from people who will never post in the ADHD subreddit vs. people who will post in the ADHD subreddit. In the Appendix, we expand on comorbid ADHD and anxiety, and using learned classifiers on mental health-related text.

## Data Collection

Text data was collected from the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits on Reddit. Although Reddit posts are not formal clinical diagnoses, Reddit data offers advantages such as being immediately and publicly available, including a timeframe to track historical data, and anonymous posts documenting vulnerable first-person experiences [14].

All posts were scraped from the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits from the dates February 16, 2020 to Nov 28, 2022.

### Data Preprocessing

The data was cleaned by removing empty or removed posts. The data was filtered to only contain posts from users that only ever posted in the Anxiety subreddit or who first posted on the Anxiety subreddit only then in the ADHD subreddit.

For users who started posting in the ADHD subreddit eventually, we only kept posts from the Anxiety subreddit that were posted 6 months or more before the first post in the ADHD subreddit. No posts from the ADHD subreddit were used.

In total, 47482 posts were downloaded from the ADHD and Anxiety subreddits. 33% were retained for the test set.

## Models

### Baseline Model

Our baseline models were regularized logistic regression and binomial Naive Bayes.

#### Transformer Model

We fine-tuned the pre-trained RoBERTa model from HuggingFace [12] with the RoBERTa tokenizer, the cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of \(1e-5\), and a dropout layer with \(p=0.3\).

## Results

### Baseline Results

With a baserate of 50%, the best logistic regression model achieved a correct classification rate of 54% and the best Naive Bayes model achieved a correct classification rate of 59%.

As seen, Logistic Regression models performed at 54% accuracy and Naive Bayes performed at \(58.6\%\) accuracy. Attributing to its performance, as seen in Figure 6, the majority of samples fell correctly into the true positive and true negative class.

### RoBERTa Results

With a test set baserate of 50%, the RoBERTa model achieved a correct classification rate of 76%.

### Discussion

Our results demonstrate that, for posts in the Anxiety subreddit, it is possible to predict which posts come from people who will later post in the ADHD subreddit as well from posts that come from people who will not, without using any information "from the future."

Further, we have shown that keyword-based methods, Naive Bayes and logistic regression, are not sufficient for this task, while it is possible to make progress with RoBERTa. This indicates that complex cues can be used to detect which posters will later post in the ADHD subreddit.

## Experiments with explainability

One application of our trained classifier is obtaining further insight into the relationship between anxiety disorders and ADHD.

To enable qualitative analysis, we have experimented with visualizing the reason that the RoBERTa classifier outputs "will post in ADHD" or "will not post in ADHD" for a given post. We visualize the difference in output caused by masking out each individual word and each individual phrase in the post.

Aggregate analysis will be available in the future.

## Conclusions

We present a novel task: predicting whether internet text that comes from a person discussing their anxiety comes from a person who in the future will also discuss ADHD. We demonstrate that this task is not solvable using keyword-based methods, while it progress can be made using RoBERTa.

The immediate application of our method is for obtaining qualitative insight into the connection between anxiety and ADHD by visualizing the reason that the RoBERTa classifier outputs "will post in ADHD" or "will not post in ADHD" for a given post.

## Background

### Comorbid ADHD and Anxiety

Up to \(53\%\) of adults with ADHD may also have an anxiety disorder (Children and with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Report 2018) and about 3 in 10 children with ADHD had anxiety 1. ADHD and anxiety are frequently seen together; however, ADHD and anxiety are separate conditions (Ellis, 2017). ADHD is a common mental health disorder with symptoms such as inattention (not being able to keep focus), hyperactivity, and impulsivity (Elmaghraby and Garayalde, 2022). Anxiety disorders may involve symptoms of excessive fear (Muskin, 2022) which does not go away over time (NIMH, 2023). People who have anxiety disorders may struggle with intense and uncontrollable feelings of anxiety, fear, worry, or panic (American Psychiatric Association, Association et al., 2013).

Footnote 1: [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbdd/adhd/data.html](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbdd/adhd/data.html)

Although ADHD and anxiety have different symptoms, there are instances when the two conditions have overlapping symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish between the two conditions (Story, 2022). For instance, individuals with anxiety may have trouble concentrating in situations that trigger anxiety. Those with ADHD may have trouble concentrating in any type of situation (Story, 2022).

It is important to correctly diagnose patients with ADHD and anxiety, as the co-occurrence of \(\mathrm{ADHD}\) and anxiety may make the symptoms of both conditions seem more extreme (Koyuncu et al., 2022). For example, anxiety can make it even more difficult for someone with ADHD to pay attention and follow through on tasks (Story, 2022).

Misdiagnosed comorbid ADHD and anxiety may lead to treating only the symptoms for anxiety while the root of the problem, which is ADHD, remains untreated (Katzman et al., 2017) (Hallowell, 2018). Undiagnosed ADHD can cause anxiety and depression which, in turn, can mask ADHD, making it more difficult to diagnose accurately (Kistler, 2022).

Diagnosis of ADHD typically occurs in children; however, ADHD is now recognized to be persistent to adulthood in 50-66% of people (Johnson, Morris, and George, 2020). Misdiagnosis of ADHD is common as many clinicians are still not aware that ADHD is a valid diagnosis in adults (Johnson, Morris, and George, 2020).

### Classification of Mental Health-related texts with Deep Learning

Machine learning techniques have been utilized for multi-class classification of mental health condition-related text, particularly on Reddit. (Ameer et al., 2022) trained various models to detect texts related to anxiety, ADHD, bipolar disorder, depression, and PTSD. Ameer et al. observed that a pre-trained and then fine-tuned RoBERTa classifiers achieved the best performance. (Murarka, Radhakrishnan, and Ravichandran, 2020) used RoBERTa to detect and classify texts related to mental health conditions and observed better accuracy and F-1 scores than BERT or LSTM models.

However, their model performed poorly in classifying anxiety, partially due to the term "anxiety" occurring in 12% of ADHD posts.

The dataset that was used for both papers was data scraped from 13 subreddits using the Reddit API: 17,159 posts and title texts. Of the 13 subreddits, 5 were directly associated with a mental illness: "bipolar", "adhd", "anxiety", "depression", and "ptsd" while the remaining were chosen from a wide range of subreddit topics and assigned the class label of "none".

Previously, work such as [22] applied machine learning to classifying text by associated mental health condition.

Note that, in our work, we aim to distinguish finer-grained categories than in previous work: we are specifically interested in disintguishing posts in the Anxiety subreddit into two classes: posts from people who will and will not later post in the ADHD subreddit. That is a more difficult task than distinguishing posts in the Anxiety subreddit from posts in the ADHD subreddit, as in previous work.

## 3 Limitations

Our primary goal is to gain insight into the connection between anxiety and ADHD, as well as ADHD co-morbid with anxiety. We use a particular social media platform (Reddit), which is primarily English-speaking and whose audience is known to skew male 2. Conclusions about symptoms drawn from Reddit therefore are likely biased by language, gender, and culture. We do not have specific demographic information about the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits, so that conclusion is itself tentative.

Footnote 2: [https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255182/distribution-of-users-on-reddit-worldwide-gender/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1255182/distribution-of-users-on-reddit-worldwide-gender/)

The classifier we train is not intended as a diagnostic tool and should not be used as such.

Classification results on text from outside of Reddit and outside of the Anxiety subreddit would likely not match what we report.

## 4 Ethical considerations

We use public data, and as such the research is not human-subjects research, as confirmed by our IRB.

Owing to the sensitivity of the topic, we have decided not to include samples from our data in the paper.

Creating classifiers whose output is mental health conditions is fraught with the danger that such a classifier would be used without consent on users' text. Care should be taken that this does not happen. Our classifier is not diagnostically useful.
