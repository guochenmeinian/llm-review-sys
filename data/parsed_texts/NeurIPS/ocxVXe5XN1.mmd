###### Abstract

In this work, we introduce novel information-theoretic generalization bounds using the conditional \(f\)-information framework, an extension of the traditional conditional mutual information (MI) framework. We provide a generic approach to derive generalization bounds via \(f\)-information in the supersample setting, applicable to both bounded and unbounded loss functions. Unlike previous MI-based bounds, our proof strategy does not rely on upper bounding the cumulant-generating function (CGF) in the variational formula of MI. Instead, we set the CGF or its upper bound to zero by carefully selecting the measurable function invoked in the variational formula. Although some of our techniques are partially inspired by recent advances in the coin-betting framework (e.g., Jang et al. (2023)), our results are independent of any previous findings from regret guarantees of online gambling algorithms. Additionally, our newly derived MI-based bound recovers many previous results and improves our understanding of their potential limitations. Finally, we empirically compare various \(f\)-information measures for generalization, demonstrating the improvement of our new bounds over the previous bounds.

## 1 Introduction

Understanding generalization is a longstanding topic of machine learning research. Recently, information-theoretic generalization measures, e.g., mutual information (MI) between the input (i.e. data) and output (i.e. hypothesis) of a learning algorithm, have been proposed by [2, 3, 4]. While original MI-based information-theoretic generalization bounds have made significant progress in analyzing the generalization of stochastic gradient-based algorithms in nonconvex learning problems (e.g., deep learning) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13], they are found to have several limitations. One of the most severe limitations is their unboundedness, where the MI measure can be infinite while the true generalization error is small [14]. To mitigate this issue, various bound-tightening techniques have been proposed [15, 6, 7]. Among them, [16] introduces a conditional mutual information (CMI) framework, which allows for the derivation of a CMI-based bound that is strictly upper-bounded by a constant. In the CMI framework, an additional "ghost sample" is introduced alongside the original sample drawn from the unknown data distribution. A Bernoulli random variable sequence is then used to determine the membership of training data from these two samples. Ultimately, the CMI between these Bernoulli random variables and the output hypothesis of the learning algorithm, conditioned on these two samples, characterizes generalization. This setup, known as the "supersample" setting, ensures theboundedness of the CMI bound due to the constant entropy of a Bernoulli random variable. Intuitively, this CMI quantity leaks less information between data and the hypothesis, resulting in tighter bounds compared to the original MI quantity, as theoretically justified in [17]. Furthermore, several studies have aimed to further tighten CMI-based bounds. For example, previous tightening techniques in [15, 6, 7] are also applicable to CMI bounds [17, 18, 19, 20, 21]. Notably, another way to tighten the CMI bound is by utilizing variants of the original CMI quantity, such as functional CMI (\(f\)-CMI) [22], evaluated CMI (e-CMI) [16, 23], and loss-difference CMI (ld-CMI) [24]. As the output hypothesis is replaced by the predictions, loss pairs, and loss differences of the two samples, these CMI quantities are tighter than the original hypothesis-based CMI due to the data-processing inequality. While most information-theoretic bounds in the supersample setting focus on (conditional) mutual information measures, it is natural to ask whether there is a general way to extend this CMI framework to other statistical distance/divergence measures, such as other \(f\)-divergences.

Using alternative dependence measures to replace MI in information-theoretic generalization bounds has been studied in several existing works [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30], with some of them considering the supersample setting. In particular, [26] provides some Wasserstein distance-based and total variation-based bounds in the supersample setting. Furthermore, [29] proposes a general convex analysis-based framework that replaces the input-output MI quantity in [2, 3, 4] with any strongly convex function. While [29] itself does not discuss the supersample setting, the further extension in [30] indeed considers invoking the supersample setting to strengthen the bounds.

In this work, we present a generic approach to derive generalization bounds based on conditional \(f\)-information, a natural extension from mutual information to other \(f\)-divergence-based dependence measures. Our proof strategy is significantly different from the original CMI framework [16] and the convex analysis (or regret analysis) based framework [29, 30]. Specifically, our development starts from the variational representation of \(f\)-divergence, which involves the convex conjugate of a convex function used to define the \(f\)-divergence. While the previous CMI framework focuses on upper-bounding the cumulant generating function (CGF) of a selected measurable function (which relates to the generalization error), we make a particular choice of such a measurable function, namely the inverse of that convex conjugate function. This choice makes CGF equal to (or upper bounded by) zero, hence eliminated from the variational representation. The remaining task is to lower bound this inverse of the convex conjugate function under a joint distribution. In the case of MI (or KL), the expectation of this inverse function is close to the _log wealth_ quantity used in the coin-betting framework for obtaining concentration inequalities [31, 1, 32]. Indeed, the lower bounding techniques here are inspired by some inequalities used in the coin-betting framework [31, 1, 32], and we extend them to the cases of other \(f\)-divergence in the supersample setting. Notably, unlike [30, 1], our conditional \(f\)-information generalization bounds do not rely on any existing regret guarantees of online learning algorithms. We discuss the connection with the coin-betting framework in Appendix E.

Given that \(f\)-divergences all obey the data-processing inequality [33], we focus on using loss difference (ld)-based \(f\)-information, an extension of ld-CMI in [24], in this work. Specifically, our main contributions are summarized as follows: 1) In the case where the loss difference between a data pair is bounded, we first provide a novel variational formula (cf. Lemma 3.1) for \(f\)-information, enabling us to derive conditional \(f\)-information-based generalization bounds; 2) For the KL case, we first provide an "oracle" CMI bound (cf. Theorem 3.1). This bound recovers many previous CMI bounds, including the square-root bound and fast-rate bounds in low empirical risk settings. It also helps us understand the potential looseness of previous square-root CMI bounds, where some quantities that can vanish as the sample size \(n\) increases are simply ignored. Additionally, some novel fast-rate bounds are implied (cf. Corollary 3.1-3.2). Particularly, Corollary 3.2 contains a term in the form of the product of total variation and KL divergence, a similar quantity also appearing in a recent PAC-Bayesian bound [34]; 3) We present several other \(f\)-information-based bounds, including the looser measure, \(\chi^{2}\)-information (cf. Theorem B.2) and tighter measures, squared Hellinger (SH)-information (cf. Theorem 3.2) and Jensen-Shannon (JS)-information (cf. Theorem 3.3). Due to the similarity in expressions, most arguments for our CMI bounds are also applicable to these bounds based on \(f\)-information measures; 4) We extend our framework to the unbounded loss difference case, where we provide a refined variational formula for \(f\)-information (cf. Lemma 4.1), enabling us to provide a novel \(f\)-information-based bound (cf. Theorem 4.1 for the case of KL). The obtained bound is no worse than a previous information-theoretic generalization bound in [25] (adapted to the same supersample setting); 5) Empirical results show that the new bounds in our framework, particularly the squared Hellinger-information bound, outperform previous results.

Preliminaries

NotationThroughout this paper, we adopt a convention where capitalized letters denote random variables, and their corresponding lowercase letters represent specific realizations. Let \(P_{X}\) denote the distribution of a random variable \(X\), and \(P_{X|Y}\) represent the conditional distribution of \(X\) given \(Y\). When conditioning on a specific realization, we use \(P_{X|Y=y}\) or simply \(P_{X|y}\). Additionally, we use \(\mathbb{E}_{X}\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{P}\) interchangeably to denote the expectation over \(X\sim P\), whenever it is clear from context. Moreover, \(\mathbb{E}_{X|Y=y}\) (or \(\mathbb{E}_{X|y}\)) denotes the expectation over \(X\sim P_{X|Y=y}\).

Generalization ErrorLet \(\mathcal{Z}\) be the domain of the instances, and let \(\mathcal{W}\) be the domain of the hypotheses. We denote the unknown distribution of the instances by \(\mu\), and let \(S=\{Z_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim}\mu\) be the training sample. A learning algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\), characterized by a conditional distribution \(P_{W|S}\), takes the training sample \(S\) as the input and outputs a hypothesis \(W\in\mathcal{W}\), i.e. \(\mathcal{A}:\mathcal{Z}^{n}\to\mathcal{W}\). To evaluate the quality of the output hypothesis \(W\), we use a loss function \(\ell:\mathcal{W}\times\mathcal{Z}\to\mathbb{R}_{0}^{+}\). For any hypothesis \(w\), the population risk is defined as \(L_{\mu}(w)\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{Z^{\prime}}\left[\ell(w,Z^{\prime})\right]\), where \(Z^{\prime}\sim\mu\) is an independent testing instance. In practice, since \(\mu\) is unknown, we use the empirical risk, which is defined as \(L_{S}(w)\triangleq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\ell(w,Z_{i})\), as a proxy for the population risk of \(w\). The expected generalization error is then defined as \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{W}\left[L_{\mu}(W)\right] -\mathbb{E}_{W,S}\left[L_{S}(W)\right]\).

Supersample SettingWe follow the traditional supersample setting introduced by [16]. Let an \(n\times 2\) matrix \(\widetilde{Z}\in\mathcal{Z}^{n\times 2}\) be the supersample, where each entry is drawn i.i.d. from the data distribution \(\mu\). We index the columns of \(\widetilde{Z}\) by \(\{0,1\}\), and denote the \(i\)th row of \(\widetilde{Z}\) as \(\widetilde{Z}_{i}\) with entries \((\widetilde{Z}_{i,0},\widetilde{Z}_{i,1})\). We use \(U=\{U_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\sim\mathrm{Unif}(\{0,1\}^{n}),\) independent of \(\widetilde{Z}\), to determine the training sample membership from \(\widetilde{Z}\). Specifically, when \(U_{i}=0\), \(\widetilde{Z}_{i,0}\) in \(\widetilde{Z}\) is included in the training set \(S\), and \(\widetilde{Z}_{i,1}\) is used for testing; \(U_{i}=1\) dictates the opposite case. Let \(\overline{U}_{i}=1-U_{i}\), the training sample \(S\) is then equivalent to \(\widetilde{Z}_{U}=\{\widetilde{Z}_{i,U_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{n}\), and the testing sample is \(\widetilde{Z}_{\overline{U}}=\{\widetilde{Z}_{i,\overline{U}_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{n}\). Additionally, we let \(L_{i,0}\triangleq\ell(W,\widetilde{Z}_{i,0})\) and define \(L_{i,1}\) similarly. Let \(\Delta L_{i}=L_{i,1}-L_{i,0}\) be the loss difference in the \(i\)th row of \(\widetilde{Z}\). To avoid complicated subscripts, we also use superscripts \(+\) and \(-\) to replace the subscripts \(0\) and \(1\), respectively, namely, \(\widetilde{Z}_{i}^{+}=\widetilde{Z}_{i,0}\), \(\widetilde{Z}_{i}^{-}=\widetilde{Z}_{i,1}\), \(L_{i}^{+}=L_{i,0}\) and \(L_{i}^{-}=L_{i,1}\). Furthermore, we define \(G_{i}\triangleq(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\), i.e. the testing loss minus the training loss at position \(i\). Clearly, \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}G_{i}\) is an unbiased estimator of \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\). In other words, \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L _{i},U_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\).

\(f\)-Divergence and \(f\)-InformationThe family of \(f\)-divergence is defined as follows.

**Definition 2.1** (\(f\)-divergence [33]).: _Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be two distributions on \(\Theta\), and let \(\phi:\mathbb{R}_{+}\to\mathbb{R}\) be a convex function with \(\phi(1)=0\). If \(P\ll Q\), then the \(f\)-divergence between \(P\) and \(Q\) is defined as_

\[\mathrm{D}_{\phi}(P||Q)\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[\phi\left(\frac{dP}{dQ} \right)\right]\!,\]

_where \(\frac{dP}{dQ}\) is a Radon-Nikodym derivative._

A variational representation for \(f\)-divergence, as provided below, has been independently investigated in previous works [35, 25, 36, 37, 33]. Recently, this variational representation has also been applied to PAC-Bayesian generalization theory [38] and domain adaptation theory [39, 40].

**Lemma 2.1** ([37, Corollary 3.5]).: _Let \(\phi^{*}\) be the convex conjugate1 of \(\phi\), and \(\mathcal{G}=\{g:\Theta\to\mathrm{dom}(\phi^{*})\}\). The following, known as variational formula of \(f\)-divergence, holds:_

Footnote 1: For a function \(f:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty,+\infty\}\), its convex conjugate is \(f^{*}(y)\triangleq\sup_{x\in\mathrm{dom}(f)}\langle x,y\rangle-f(x)\).

\[\mathrm{D}_{\phi}(P||Q)=\sup_{g\in\mathcal{G}}\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim P}\left[g (\theta)\right]-\inf_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}}\left\{\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim Q} \left[\phi^{*}(g(\theta)+\lambda)\right]-\lambda\right\}.\]

Following [33, Section 7.8], let \(I_{\phi}(X;Y)\triangleq\mathrm{D}_{\phi}(P_{X,Y}||P_{X}P_{Y})\) be the \(f\)-information, which extends the standard mutual information (MI) defined in terms of KL divergence.

We now set \(\theta=(\Delta L_{i},U_{i})\) and \(g(\Delta L_{i},U_{i})=tG_{i}\) in Lemma 2.1, where \(t\in\mathbb{R}\), \(P=P_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\) is the joint distribution of \((\Delta L_{i},U_{i})\) and \(Q=P_{\Delta L_{i}}P_{U_{i}}\) is the product of the marginal distributions. Consequently, Lemma 2.1 directly implies that \[\mathbb{E}_{P}\left[G_{i}\right] \leq\inf_{t\in\mathbb{R}}\frac{1}{t}\left(I_{\phi}(\Delta L_{i};U_{ i})+\inf_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}}\left\{\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[\phi^{*}(t(-1)^{U_{i}^{ \prime}}\Delta L_{i}+\lambda)\right]-\lambda\right\}\right)\] (1) \[\leq\inf_{t\in\mathbb{R}}\frac{1}{t}\left(I_{\phi}(\Delta L_{i};U_ {i})+\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[\phi^{*}(t(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i})\right] \right),\] (2)

where we let \(\lambda=0\) in Eq. (2). Notice that if \(\phi(x)=x\log x+c(x-1)\) for any constant \(c\), then \(I_{\phi}(X;Y)\) becomes MI. In this case, the optimal \(\lambda^{*}=-\log\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[e^{g(\theta)}\right]\) in Lemma 2.1, and Lemma 2.1 recovers the Donsker and Varadhan's variational formula (cf. Lemma A.1). Here, the second term in Eq. (1) represents the cumulant generating function of \((\Delta L_{i},U_{i}^{\prime})\). By analyzing the tail behavior of \((\Delta L_{i},U_{i}^{\prime})\) and applying Eq. (1), one can derive the final MI-based generalization bound. For example, if the loss is bounded, Eq. (1) recovers [24, Theorem 3.2] by using Hoeffding's Lemma.

On one hand, while Eq. (1) is tighter than Eq. (2), the parameter \(\lambda\) may not have an analytic form for divergences beyond KL and \(\chi^{2}\). In this sense, Eq. (2) has its own merits. On the other hand, previous MI-based generalization bounds use concentration results to further upper bound the second term in Eq. (1). While this strategy has been successful for the MI case, for instance by using Hoeffding's Lemma, it may be challenging to obtain similar concentration results for other \(f\)-information. In this work, we introduce a novel approach to prove generalization bounds for \(f\)-information.

## 3 Conditional \(f\)-Information Bounds: Bounded Loss Difference Case

We begin by presenting a general lemma that will serve as a main recipe for obtaining generalization bounds in this section. This lemma introduces a new variational formula for \(f\)-divergence, which may be of independent interest beyond the context of generalization.

**Lemma 3.1**.: _Given random variables \(X\), \(Y\), and a measurable function \(f\) for \((X,Y)\). For every \(t\in[b_{1},b_{2}]\subseteq\mathbb{R}\), assume that \(\phi^{*}\) is invertible within the range of \(t\cdot f\), which we denote by \(\Gamma_{t}\). Let \(\phi^{*-1}\) be the inverse of \(\phi^{*}\) on \(\cup_{t\in[b_{1},b_{2}]}\Gamma_{t}\), and let \(Y^{\prime}\) be an independent copy of \(Y\). If \(\mathbb{E}_{X,Y^{\prime}}\left[f(X,Y^{\prime})\right]=0\), then_

\[\sup_{t\in[b_{1},b_{2}]}\mathbb{E}_{X,Y}\left[\phi^{*-1}(tf(X,Y))\right]\leq I _{\phi}(X;Y).\]

Although Lemma 3.1 is a simple and straightforward result derived from Lemma 2.1 by setting \(g=\phi^{*-1}\circ(tf)\), it is quite powerful for deriving \(f\)-information-based generalization bounds. Specifically, in the supersample setting, due to the symmetric properties of two columns of \(\widetilde{Z}\), we set \(X=\Delta L_{i}\), \(Y=U_{i}\) and \(f(\Delta L_{i},U_{i}^{\prime})=(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i}\) (where \(U_{i}^{\prime}\) is an independent copy of \(U_{i}\)), the condition in Lemma 3.1, namely \(\mathbb{E}_{X,Y^{\prime}}\left[f(X,Y^{\prime})\right]=0\), is clearly met. Then we have

\[\sup_{t}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\left[\phi^{*-1}\left(tG_{i}\right) \right]\leq I_{\phi}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}).\]

After carefully choosing \(b_{1},b_{2}\) such that \(\phi^{*-1}\) is well defined, the main focus is to find a lower bound for the function \(\phi^{*-1}\) over a certain interval. We will start with the standard MI case.

### Mutual Information (KL-based) Generalization Bound

Consider \(\phi(x)=x\log x+x-1\). Its convex conjugate function is \(\phi^{*}(y)=e^{y}-1\) with the inverse \(\phi^{*-1}(z)=\log(1+z)\). Building upon Lemma 3.1, we obtain the following bound:

**Theorem 3.1**.: _Assume the loss difference \(\ell(w,z_{1})-\ell(w,z_{2})\) is bounded in \([-1,1]\) for any \(w\in\mathcal{W}\) and \(z_{1},z_{2}\in\mathcal{Z}\), we have_

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{2\left( \mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]+|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]|\right)I (\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\]

We remark that a bounded loss difference is a less restrictive assumption than a strictly bounded loss. For example, if \(\ell\) is \(L\)-Lipschitz in the second argument, then \(\ell(w,z_{1})-\ell(w,z_{2})\leq L||z_{1}-z_{2}||\)Thus, as long as \(||z_{1}-z_{2}||\) is bounded, the loss difference is bounded even when \(\ell\) itself is unbounded. Additionally, we refer to Theorem 3.1 as the "_oracle_" CMI bound because the upper bound itself includes the expected generalization error at position \(i\), \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\), which is precisely the quantity we aim to bound.

From Theorem 3.1, first, if we simply upper bound the loss difference \(\Delta L_{i}\) (and \(G_{i}\)) by one, Theorem 3.1 recovers [24, Theorem 3.2] up to a constant. More importantly, Theorem 3.1 indicates that in the case of bounded loss difference or bounded loss, solely using \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\) as the generalization measure for algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) is insufficient to accurately characterize its generalization error. Specifically, when \(2\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]+\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i} \right]\right|\right)\) vanishes as \(n\) increases, relying on the MI-based measure alone, i.e., \(\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\), will always result in a slow convergence rate for \(\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\). While similar observations have been made in recent studies [41, 42, 43], where it is found that the sub-Gaussian variance proxy in previous MI bounds may also vanish in some examples, our Theorem 3.1 provides a more straightforward understanding of the potential looseness of \(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})})\). Additionally, further discussion comparing our oracle CMI bound with the MI-based results in [29, 30] is provided in Appendix B.4. To highlight the differences in our proof techniques compared to previous information-theoretic generalization bounds, we provide a proof sketch below.

Proof Sketch of Theorem 3.1.: Lemma 3.1 gives us \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t}\mathbb{E}\left[\log\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}} \Delta L_{i}\right)\right]\). Let \(f(x)=\log(1+x)-x+ax^{2}\) and set \(a=\frac{\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|}{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2 }\right]}+\frac{1}{2}\). By demonstrating that \(f(x)\geq 0\) holds when \(a\geq\frac{1}{2}\) and \(|x|\leq 1-\frac{1}{2a}\), we have \(\sup_{t>-1}\mathbb{E}\left[\log\left(1+tG_{i}\right)\right]\geq\sup_{t\in[ \frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]}\mathbb{E}\left[tG_{i}-at^{2}G_{i}^{2}\right]\). The supremum is attained when \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]}{2a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right] }=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]}{|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]|+\mathbb{ E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}\), which is achievable. Therefore, \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t\in(-1,+\infty)}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i }}\left[\log\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\right]\geq\frac{\mathbb{ E}^{2}\left[G_{i}\right]}{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}\), which simplifies to

\[\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}]\leq 2\left(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|+ \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]\right)I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}).\] (3)

The remaining steps are straightforward. See Appendix B.1 for the complete proof. 

It is also worth noting that by letting \(g=\phi^{*-1}\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[g\right]=0\) in the case of KL divergence, we obtain \(\lambda^{*}=0\) in Lemma 2.1. As a result, Eq. (2) becomes equivalent to Eq. (1). In this sense, starting from Eq. (2) does not compromise the tightness of Eq. (1). Moreover, the proof provides deeper insights into the tightness of Theorem 3.1, which we will now discuss.

Small Empirical Risk Case or Realizable SettingPreviously, fast-rate information-theoretic generalization bounds in the realizable setting--where the square-root function is removed--have been derived by demonstrating that the CGF can be negative [16, 44, 23, 24], or by invoking the channel capacity result of the binary channel [44, 24].

Based on Theorem 3.1, the square-root function can be directly removed in the realizable setting. Specifically, if the learning algorithm \(\mathcal{A}\) is an interpolating algorithm, i.e., the training loss is always minimized to zero, then \(G_{i}\in[0,1]\) always holds. In this case, \(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|=\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\) and \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]\leq\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\), allowing us to obtain \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\leq 4I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\) from Eq. (3). Consequently, Theorem 3.1 simplifies to \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\frac{4}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\). Note that for this bound to hold, the condition of zero training loss can be relaxed to the training loss being always no larger than the testing loss.

Furthermore, to achieve a better constant in the bound, observe that the proof of our Theorem 3.1 utilizes the inequality \(\log(1+x)\geq x-ax^{2}\) for \(|x|\leq 1-\frac{1}{2a}\). If \(x\in[0,1]\) always holds, one can use the inequality \(\log(1+x)\geq x\log 2\) instead, where equality holds when the loss is zero-one loss (See Figure 1(Right) for a visualized illustration).

Figure 1: Comparison of different \(\phi^{*-1}\) (Left) and examples of \(x-ax^{2}\) for lower-bounding \(\log(1+x)\) (Right).

As a result, we obtain \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}{n\log 2}\), which is tighter than the previous bound and will never be vacuous (i.e. the bound is always smaller than \(1\)) since \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\leq H(U_{i})=\log 2\). In fact, this bound can exactly characterize the generalization error (i.e., equality holds) if the loss is the zero-one loss, as demonstrated in [24, Theorem 3.3].

New Fast-Rate BoundsTheorem 3.1 not only recovers the previous fast-rate ld-CMI bound in the realizable setting but also introduces new fast-rate bounds.

By solving Eq. (3) for \(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\), we obtain the following bound.

**Corollary 3.1**.: _Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \left(2I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})+\sqrt{2\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]I( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right).\]

This fast-rate bound has not been proved in [24], yet it resembles [24, Eq. (2)] in structure. Specifically, the single-loss MI term, \(2I(L_{i}^{+};U_{i})\) in [24, Eq. (2)], is now substituted with \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\), and the empirical risk term, \(\mathbb{E}\left[L_{S}(W)\right]\), is replaced by \(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]\). Here, \(\Delta L_{i}=L_{i}^{-}-L_{i}^{+}\), and notice that both \(L_{i}^{+}\) and \(L_{i}^{-}\) follow the same marginal distribution due to the symmetric construction of the supersample, so we can obtain that \(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(L_{i}^{-}-L_{i}^{+}) ^{2}\right]\leq 4\mathbb{E}\left[(L_{i}^{+}-\mathbb{E}\left[L_{i}^{+}\right])^{2 }\right]=4\mathrm{Var}(L_{i}^{+})\). Consequently, Corollary 3.1 further implies the following bound:

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( 2I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})+2\sqrt{2\mathrm{Var}\left(L_{i}^{+}\right)I(\Delta L_{ i};U_{i})}\right).\] (4)

Notably, Eq. (4) hints that if the variance of the single loss in the supersample is sufficiently small, the bound will decay at the same rate as in the realizable setting, namely \(\mathcal{O}(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}))\), as the second term vanishes.

Instead of solving Eq. (3), if we directly upper-bound \(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\) in Theorem 3.1, we can also obtain the following bound from Theorem 3.1.

**Corollary 3.2**.: _Under the conditions of Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( \sqrt{2\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}+\sqrt{2 \mathbb{E}_{U_{i}}\left[\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\left(P_{\Delta L_{i}|U_{i}}, P_{\Delta L_{i}}\right)\right]I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right).\]

Note that Corollary 3.2 is tighter than Corollary 3.1 by Jensen's inequality and Pinsker's inequality. While we focus on the MI-based or KL-based generalization bound in this section, the inclusion of total variation (TV) in the second term of Corollary 3.2 expands the scope of the bound. Notably, in a recent study by [34], a component of the form \(\sqrt{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}}\) is also present in their generalization bounds. Specifically, they derive PAC-Bayesian generalization bounds using the Zhang-Cutkosky-Paschalidis (ZCP) divergence, initially explored in [45]. Interestingly, the ZCP divergence can be further upper bounded by \(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}}+\mathrm{D }_{\mathrm{TV}})\). Although it remains uncertain whether the first term in Corollary 3.2 is tighter than \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\) or not, we demonstrate that the component \(\sqrt{\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}}\) can emerge directly in the derivation of KL-based bounds, without using the ZCP divergence. Additionally, note that the term \(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]\) in Corollary 3.2 can likewise be replaced by \(4\mathrm{Var}(L_{i}^{+})\) term.

### Other \(f\)-Information-based Generalization Bound

Based on Lemma 3.1, it is straightforward to apply similar techniques to many well-known \(f\)-divergences or \(f\)-information measures to obtain generalization bounds. In this section, we discuss several other \(f\)-information-based bounds. Before we study the specific \(f\)-divergence, we remark that, in Section 3.1, our focus was on the unconditional mutual information \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\). As illustrated in [24], using the data-processing inequality (DPI) and the chain rule, we have \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\leq I(L_{i}^{+},L_{i}^{-};U_{i})\leq I(W;U_{i}|\widetilde {Z}_{i})\). This makes it easy to derive other CMI variant-based bounds. While other \(f\)-divergences also satisfy DPI, they may not adhere to the chain rule. Accordingly, for these cases, we use the disintegrated conditional \(f\)-information, defined as \(I_{\phi}^{z}(X;Y)\triangleq\mathrm{D}_{\phi}(P_{XY|z}||P_{X|z}P_{Y|z})\) (noting that \(I(X;Y|Z)=\mathbb{E}_{Z}\left[I_{\phi}^{Z}(X;Y)\right)\right]\)), instead of the unconditional quantity. In this context, at least \(I_{\phi}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}|\widetilde{Z}_{i})\leq I_{\phi}(W;U_{i}|\widetilde {Z}_{i})\) still holds, ensuring that the hypothesis-based conditional \(f\)-information bound can be directly derived.

\(\mathcal{X}^{2}\)-based Generalization BoundConsider \(\phi(x)=(x-1)^{2}\). Its convex conjugate is \(\phi^{*}(y)=\frac{y^{2}}{4}+y\). For \(y\geq-2\), the inverse of conjugate function \(\phi^{*-1}(z)=2(\sqrt{z+1}-1)\) exists. Since \(2(\sqrt{z+1}-1)\geq\log(1+z)\), any lower bound that holds for \(\log(1+z)\) will also hold for \(2(\sqrt{z+1}-1)\). See Figure 1(Left) for a visualization. In other words, all the bounds in Section 3.1 will also hold when using \(\chi^{2}\)-divergence. This can also be immediately noticed by the inequality \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P||Q\right)\leq\chi^{2}(P||Q)\)[33]. We defer the formal disintegrated \(\chi^{2}\)-information bound in Appendix B.7.

Squared Hellinger (SH) Distance Generalization BoundConsider \(\phi(x)=(\sqrt{x}-1)^{2}\), and its convex conjugate is \(\phi^{*}(y)=\frac{y}{1-y}\). For \(y\in(-\infty,1)\), the inverse function \(\phi^{*-1}(z)=\frac{z}{1+z}\) exists for \(z\in(-1,+\infty)\). We then have the following oracle conditional squared Hellinger (SH)-information bound.

**Theorem 3.2**.: _Under the same conditions in Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{ \widetilde{Z}_{i}}\sqrt{\left(4\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}|\widetilde{Z} _{i}\right]+2\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\widetilde{Z}_{i}\right]\right| \right)I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\widetilde{Z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})},\]

_where \(I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\widetilde{z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})=\mathrm{D}_{ \mathrm{H}^{2}}\left(P_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\widetilde{z}_{i}}\|P_{\Delta L_{i }|\widetilde{z}_{i}}P_{U_{i}}\right)\) is the (disintegrated) SH-information._

Given that \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}\left(P||Q\right)\leq\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\left( P,Q\right)\), the TV-based bound can be derived as a corollary from above.

Jensen-Shannon (JS) Divergence Generalization BoundConsider \(\phi(x)=x\log\frac{2x}{1+x}+\log\frac{2}{1+x}\), with the convex conjugate \(\phi^{*}(y)=-\log(2-e^{y})\). For \(y<\log 2\), the inverse function \(\phi^{*-1}(z)=\log(2-e^{-z})\) exists for \(z>-\log 2\). This leads to the following oracle JS-information bound.

**Theorem 3.3**.: _Under the same conditions in Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{2}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{ \widetilde{Z}_{i}}\sqrt{\left(4\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}|\widetilde{Z} _{i}\right]+\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\widetilde{Z}_{i}\right]\right| \right)I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\widetilde{Z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})},\]

_where \(I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\widetilde{z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})=\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{ JSD}}\left(P_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\widetilde{z}_{i}}||P_{\Delta L_{i}| \widetilde{z}_{i}}P_{U_{i}}\right)\) is the (disintegrated) JS-information._

Jeffrey's divergence [46], which is defined as \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{Jeffrey}}(P||Q)\triangleq\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P|| Q\right)+\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(Q||P\right)\), is an \(f\)-divergence with the convex function \(\phi(x)=(x-1)\log x\). Since \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{JSD}}\left(P||Q\right)\leq\frac{1}{4}\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{ Jeffrey}}(P||Q)\)[47], a Jeffrey's divergence-based bound can be derived as a corollary from Theorem 3.3 (and clearly, also from Theorem 3.1 due to the non-negativity of KL divergence).

Notably, Theorems 3.2-3.3 share similar expressions with Theorem 3.1, and deriving analogous corollaries to Corollaries 3.1-3.2 is feasible (see Appendix B.7).

In the proofs of Theorems 3.2 and Theorem 3.3, we continue to use \(x-ax^{2}\) to lower bound the inverse of conjugate functions \(\frac{x}{1+x}\) and \(\log(2-e^{-x})\) for SH-information and JS-information, respectively. However, due to the complexity of handling \(\log(2-e^{-x})\) in the context of JS-information, we opted for a much rougher selection of the parameter \(a\) than in the proof of Theorem 3.1 for simplicity. Consequently, the constants in Theorem 3.3 are not optimal and can be refined with a more fine-grained analysis.

## 4 Extension to Unbounded Loss Difference

Previous bounds are typically applicable when dealing with bounded loss differences (albeit not necessarily within the range of \([-1,1]\)). This limitation arises from the fact that the function \(\phi^{*-1}\) may fail to exist in Lemma 3.1 when \(f\) is unbounded, regardless of any non-trivial adjustments made to the range of \(t\). To overcome this limitation, we now extend our analysis to the case of unbounded loss differences by refining Lemma 3.1. One crucial modification to Lemma 3.1 involves defining the measurable function \(g=t\phi^{*-1}\cdot\mathds{1}_{|f|\leq C}\) for some \(C\geq 0\), where \(\mathds{1}\) is the indicator function.

We present the following lemma tailored for unbounded functions.

**Lemma 4.1**.: _Let \(X\) be an arbitrary random variable, \(\varepsilon\) be a Rademacher variable, and \(t\in(-b,b)\). Assume that there exists a constant \(C\geq 0\) such that \(\phi^{*}\) is invertible in \((-bC,bC)\). If \(\phi^{*}(0)=0\), then_

\[\sup_{t\in(-b,b)}\mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon}\left[\phi^{*-1}(t\varepsilon X) \cdot\mathds{1}_{|X|\leq C}\right]\leq I_{\phi}(X;\varepsilon).\]Note that \(\phi^{*}(0)=0\) is satisfied by all divergences discussed in Section 3. Armed with Lemma 4.1, our proof strategy hinges on separately bounding the truncated terms \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{|X|\leq C}\right]\) and \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\cdot\mathbb{1}_{|X|>C}\right]\). To achieve this, we utilize Lemma 4.1 along with similar lower-bounding techniques as detailed in Section 3 to bound the first term. For the second term, we invoke Holder's inequality, drawing inspiration from prior works such as [25, 27].

Before presenting the refined bound for unbounded loss difference, we introduce some additional notations. Define the \(L_{p}\) norm of a random variable \(X\sim P\) as \(||X||_{p}\triangleq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}(\mathbb{E}_{P}|X|^{p})^{\frac{1 }{p}}&\text{for }p\in[1,\infty),\\ \operatorname*{ess\,sup}|X|\quad\text{for }p=\infty,\end{array}\right.\) where \(\operatorname*{ess\,sup}|X|\triangleq\inf\{M:P(|X|>M)=0\}\) is the essential supremum. Furthermore, let the \(f\)-divergence generated by the convex function \(\phi_{\alpha}(x)=|x-1|^{\alpha}\) be \(\operatorname*{D}_{\phi_{\alpha}}(P||Q)\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[\left( \frac{dP}{dQ}-1\right)^{\alpha}\right]\). This divergence, which takes \(\chi^{2}\)-divergence and total variation as special cases (with \(\alpha=2\) and \(\alpha=1\), respectively), and it has been utilized in previous information-theoretic generalization bounds [25, 29, 30]. We denote the corresponding \(f\)-information of \(\operatorname*{D}_{\phi_{\alpha}}(P||Q)\) as \(I_{\phi_{\alpha}}\).

Now, we are ready to present a MI-based bound, with straightforward extensions to other \(f\)-information measures.

**Theorem 4.1**.: _For constants \(C\geq 0\), \(q\geq 1\), and \(\alpha,\beta\in[1,+\infty]\) such that \(\frac{1}{\alpha}+\frac{1}{\beta}=1\), denote \(\zeta_{1}=\sqrt{2\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\mathbb{1}_{|\Delta L _{i}|\leq C}\right]+C\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbb{1}_{|\Delta L_{i}|\leq C }\right]\right|\right)}\) and \(\zeta_{2}=\left(P\left(|\Delta L_{i}|>C\right)\right)^{\frac{q-1}{q\beta}}|| \Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}\), we have_

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\inf_{C,q,\alpha,\beta}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i =1}^{n}\left(\zeta_{1}\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}+\zeta_{2}\sqrt[\sqrt[ \alpha]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})})\right).\]

Since \(U_{i}\) is a Bernoulli random variable, according to [25, Lemma 1], we know that \(I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})<1+2^{\alpha-1}\) for \(\alpha\in[1,2]\) and remains bounded for other values of \(\alpha\) as well. Thus, Theorem 4.1 generally preserves the boundedness property of the original CMI bound unless \(\Delta L_{i}\) has an infinite \(L_{q\beta}\)-norm. Additionally, due to truncation, \(\zeta_{1}\leq\sqrt{2}C\) for any given \(C\), while \(\zeta_{2}\) heavily depends on the tail behavior of \(\Delta L_{i}\sim P_{\Delta L_{i}}\) (or \(G_{i}\sim P_{U_{i}^{\prime}}P_{\Delta L_{i}}\) equivalently). We now discuss several common cases.

Bounded LossNotably, Theorem 4.1 also covers the bounded loss cases. For instance, if \(\ell\) is bounded in \([0,1]\) a.s., setting \(C=1\) in Theorem 4.1 leads to \(\zeta_{2}=0\), directly recovering Theorem 3.1 for bounded loss. In fact, the choice of \(C=1\) might not necessarily be the optimal for \(\ell\in[0,1]\). Particularly, for certain \(C\in(0,1)\), we let \(\alpha=1\) and \(\beta=\infty\), then \(\zeta_{2}=||\Delta L_{i}||_{\infty}\) and \((I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}))^{1/\alpha}=I_{\mathrm{TV}}(\Delta L_{i };U_{i})\). Since \(\operatorname*{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\lesssim\sqrt{\operatorname*{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}}\) by Pinsker's inequality, this alternative choice holds potential for even tighter bounds than Theorem 3.1.

"Almost Bounded" LossWhen the loss function exhibits sub-Gaussian or sub-Gamma tail behaviors, the probability \(P(|G_{i}|>C)\) decays rapidly. By carefully selecting the threshold \(C\), the dominance of the first term in the bound can be expected. Assume the loss difference \(\Delta L_{i}\) is sub-Gaussian with certain variance proxy, say, \(\sigma\). Setting \(C=\sigma\) and \(q=2\), we have \(P(|\Delta L_{i}|>C)\leq 2e^{-1}\) and \(||\Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}\lesssim\sqrt{q\beta}\sigma\)[48]. Consequently, each term in the summation of Theorem 4.1 simplifies to \(\mathcal{O}\left(\sigma\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}+\sigma(2e)^{\frac{1-\alpha }{2\alpha}}\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1}}\sqrt[\alpha]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right)\). However, the relationship between \(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\) and \(I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\) is not clear beyond the cases of \(\alpha=1\) and \(\alpha=2\) (corresponding to total variation and \(\chi^{2}\)-information, respectively). Studying the overall behavior of the bound represents an intriguing direction for future research. Furthermore, consider the alternative case with \(C=0\) and \(q=1\), where the first term in Theorem 4.1 becomes zero. The second term, using \(||\Delta L_{i}||_{\beta}\lesssim\sqrt{\beta}\sigma\) for sub-gaussian random variables, becomes \(\mathcal{O}(\sigma\sqrt{\frac{\alpha}{\alpha-1}}\sqrt[\alpha]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})})\). Compared to existing MI bounds, e.g., \(\mathcal{O}(\sigma\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})})\), we know from \(\operatorname*{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\left(P,Q\right)\lesssim\sqrt{\operatorname*{ D}_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P||Q\right)}\) and \(\operatorname*{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}\left(P||Q\right)\leq\chi^{2}(P||Q)\) that \(I_{\phi_{1}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\lesssim\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\lesssim \sqrt{I_{\phi_{2}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\), suggesting that some \(\alpha\in(1,2)\) may yield a tighter bound than MI.

Heavy-tailed LossHeavy-tailed losses, although lacking universally agreed definitions, typically refer to the cases where the moment-generating function (MGF) does not exists (away from \(0\)) [49].

Remarkably, our Theorem 4.1 remains meaningful for such losses since it does not rely on the existence of the MGF of the loss function. Specifically, without any additional knowledge about the tail behavior of \(\Delta L_{i}\), we have the following result from Theorem 4.1.

**Corollary 4.1**.: _Under the conditions in Theorem 4.1, let \(\gamma=\frac{q-1}{q\beta}\), we have_

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\gamma^{ \frac{1}{\gamma+1}}+\gamma^{\frac{-\gamma}{\gamma+1}}\right)\left(\sqrt{2I( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma+1}}\left(||\Delta L_{i}||_{ 1}^{\gamma}||\Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}\sqrt[\alpha]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_ {i};U_{i})}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}.\]

It's worth noting that as \(\gamma\to 0\) (i.e. \(q\to 1\)), we can see that \(\left(\gamma^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}+\gamma^{\frac{-\gamma}{\gamma+1}}\right)\to 1\). Consequently, in Corollary 4.1, the bound simplifies to \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(||\Delta L_{i}||_{\beta}\sqrt[\alpha]{I_{\phi_ {\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right)\). This is an extension of [25, Theorem 3], incorporating individual techniques [6] and loss-difference methods [24] in the supersample setting. Notably, our Corollary 4.1 improves upon [25, Theorem 3], as \(\gamma\to 0\) may not necessarily be the optimal choice. Furthermore, it is also intriguing to investigate whether our Corollary 4.1 can recover [29, Corollary 5].

## 5 Numerical Results

In this section, we conduct an empirical comparison between our novel conditional \(f\)-information generalization bounds and several existing information-theoretic generalization bounds. Our experimental setup closely aligns with the settings in [24]. In particular, we undertake two distinct prediction tasks as follows: 1) _Linear Classifier on Synthetic Gaussian Dataset_, where we train a simple linear classifier using a synthetic Gaussian dataset; 2) _CNN and ResNet-50 on Real-World Datasets_. The second task follows the same deep learning training protocol as in [22], involves training a \(4\)-layer CNN on a binary MNIST dataset ("\(4\) vs \(9\)") [50] and fine-tuning a ResNet-50 model [51], pretrained on ImageNet [52], on CIFAR10 [53]. In both tasks, we assess prediction error as our performance metric. That is, we utilize the zero-one loss function to compute generalization error. Note that during training, we use the cross-entropy loss as a surrogate to enable optimization with gradient-based methods.

The comparison of generalization bounds mainly focuses on those presented in Section 3. Specifically, we consider the oracle bounds, given in Theorem 3.1, Theorem 3.2, and Theorem 3.3, which we denote as _CMI(Oracle)_, _CSHI(Oracle)_, and _CJSI(Oracle)_, respectively. Given that the

squared Hellinger-information is a tighter measure than MI, and the constants in Theorem 3.2 exhibit less pessimism compared to those in the JS-information bound, we introduce two additional squared Hellinger-information bounds for comparison. The first one, akin to Corollary 3.2, is \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\sqrt{\left( 4\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+2\mathbb{E}\left[\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\left(P_ {\Delta L_{i}|U_{i},\vec{Z}_{i}},P_{\Delta L_{i}|\vec{Z}_{i}}\right)\right] \right)I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\mathbb{Z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\) (cf. Corollary B.1 in Appendix B.7), denoted as _CSHI(Var)_. The second one adopts a more pessimistic choice by replacing \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]\) with the constant \(1\), labeled as _CSHI(Worst)_. Additionally, we include three previous information-theoretic generalization bounds as baselines: the original ld-CMI bound in (24, Theorem3.1) (_ld-CMI_), the sharpness-based single-loss MI bound in (24, Theorem 4.5) (_Sharpness_), and the binary KL-based CMI bound in (23, Theorem 5) (_Binary kl_). Further details on experimental settings are available in the Appendix D.

The final results are shown in Figure 2. First, we observe that for the linear classifier on the two-class data (Figure 1(a)), most bounds are close to the exact generalization error, with _Sharpness_ being the tightest. Note that the sharpness-based MI bound in (24, Theorem 4.5) is applicable solely for zero-one loss. As the prediction task becomes more complex (Figures 1(b)-1(f)), our squared Hellinger-information-based bounds are the tightest. Specifically, the squared Hellinger-information-based bound is always tighter than the CMI bound in the oracle type. Notably, _CSHI(Var)_ also outperforms all other \(f\)-information-based bounds in these cases, and even the pessimistic _CSHI(Worst)_ bound outperforms them, except for _Sharpness_, in Figures 1(c)-1(d). Additionally, by comparing _CMI(Oracle)_ and _ld-CMI_, we see significant potential for improving the original ld-CMI bound. Finally, although the JS-information bound contains relatively pessimistic constants, it still outperforms some MI-based bounds in many cases (e.g., Figures 1(c)-1(e)). These observations suggest that considering alternative \(f\)-information rather than MI is indeed necessary for studying generalization.

## 6 Other Related Works and Limitations

In addition to the studies mentioned previously, there have been recent developments in information-theoretic generalization bounds in the supersample setting. For example, (54, 44) propose a "leave-one-out" (LOO) construction of supersamples, reducing the size of the supersample from \(2n\) to \(n+1\). Additionally, (55) constructs a "neighboring-hypothesis" matrix, enabling the derivation of a hypothesis-conditioned CMI bound. The key component in this bound is the product of the new CMI term and an algorithmic stability parameter. Furthermore, significant progress has been made in understanding MI or CMI as generalization measures in stochastic convex optimization (SCO) problems. Specifically, (56, 57, 58) all point out that MI or CMI bounds can be non-vanishing in some SCO examples, while the exact generalization error is vanishing. Notably, (58) discovers a "CMI-accuracy tradeoff" phenomenon in certain scenarios: For the generalization error to be upper bounded by a vanishing parameter, the original hypothesis-based CMI must be lower bounded by the reciprocal of this parameter (or even the reciprocal of its square), indicating that the CMI bound cannot characterize the learnability of such problems. Although this limitation is currently only observed for hypothesis-based CMI, it is anticipated to hold in other variants of CMI, such as ld-CMI.

Our work also contributes to understanding the potential looseness of previous CMI generalization bounds. However, the current state of our bounds cannot explain or resolve the limitation presented in (58) in a non-trivial way. Nonetheless, our framework provides some intuition that, as long as a gap exists between \(\phi^{*-1}\) and \(x-ax^{2}\) (see Figure 1(Right)), there will always be room for constructing counterexamples that challenge information-theoretic measures, although such examples may be rare. Another limitation of this work is the lack of a high-probability generalization guarantee. There are two potential directions to address this: either by applying similar techniques to the framework in (59), which is the PAC-Bayesian counterpart of the CMI bound, or by combining it with recent information-bottleneck generalization bounds (60, 61).

## Appendix A Technical Lemmas

**Lemma A.1** (Donsker and Varadhan's variational formula).: _Let \(Q\), \(P\) be probability measures on \(\Theta\), for any bounded measurable function \(f:\Theta\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\), we have \(\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{KL}}(Q||P)=\sup_{f}\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim Q}\left[f(\theta )\right]-\log\mathbb{E}_{\theta\sim P}\left[\exp f(\theta)\right]\)._

**Lemma A.2**.: _Let \(P\) and \(Q\) be two probability measures on the same metric space \(\mathcal{X}\). Let \(f\) be some measurable function associated with \(\mathcal{X}\). The total variation distance between \(P\) and \(Q\) can be written as_

\[\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}}\left(P,Q\right)=\frac{1}{M}\sup_{||f||_{\infty}\leq M }\left|\mathbb{E}_{P}\left[f(X)\right]-\mathbb{E}_{Q}\left[f(X)\right]\right|.\]

**Lemma A.3**.: _The following inequalities hold:_

\[\log(1+x)\geq x-ax^{2} \text{for }a\geq\frac{1}{2}\text{ and }x\in\left[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}\right],\] (5) \[\frac{x}{1+x}\geq x-ax^{2} \text{for }a\geq 1\text{ and }x\in\left[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}\right],\] (6) \[\log(2-e^{-x})\geq x-ax^{2} \text{for }a\geq 4\text{ and }x\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}].\] (7)

Proof.: We prove these inequalities separately.

We first prove Eq. (5)We analyze the function \(f(x)=\log(1+x)-x+ax^{2}\). By computing the first derivative \(f^{\prime}(x)\):

\[f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{1+x}-1+2ax=\frac{x(2a-1+2ax)}{1+x}.\]

Let \(f^{\prime}(x)=0\), we have \(x(2a-1+2ax)=0\), which gives two critical points:

\[x=0\quad\text{and}\quad x=\frac{1-2a}{2a}.\]

Note that \(x=\frac{1-2a}{2a}\) is within the interval \(\left[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}\right]\). Then computing the second derivative \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\):

\[f^{\prime\prime}(x)=\frac{-1}{(1+x)^{2}}+2a.\]

Since \(a\geq\frac{1}{2}\) and \(-1<x<1\), we have \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\geq 0\), indicating that \(f(x)\) is either concave upwards or linear at these critical points. It is easy to check that the minimum value \(f(0)=0\), so \(f(x)\geq 0\) in this interval. Hence, \(\log(1+x)\geq x-ax^{2}\) holds for \(a\geq\frac{1}{2}\) and \(x\in\left[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}\right]\).

We then prove Eq. (6)We analyze the function \(f(x)=\frac{x}{1+x}-x+ax^{2}\). By simplifying this function, we have:

\[f(x)=\frac{x^{2}(a-1+ax)}{1+x}.\]

Notice that \(a-1\geq 0\) and \(1-a\leq ax\leq a-1\), then it is easy to see that the numerator \(x^{2}(a-1+ax)\) is always non-negative for \(x\in\left[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}\right]\) and \(a\geq 1\). In addition, the denominator \(1+x\) is always positive for \(x\in\left[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}\right]\). Therefore, \(f(x)=\frac{x^{2}((a-1)+ax)}{1+x}\geq 0\).

Consequently, we have shown that \(\frac{x}{1+x}\geq x-ax^{2}\) for \(a\geq 1\) and \(x\in\left[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}\right]\).

We then prove Eq. (7)We analyze the function \(f(x)=\log(2-e^{-x})-x+ax^{2}\). By taking its derivative, we have

\[f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{2e^{x}-1}-1+2ax.\]

We now demonstrate that the function \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) for \(x\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)\leq 0\) for \(x\in\left[-\frac{1}{2},0\right]\).

The second derivative of \(f(x)\) is

\[f^{\prime\prime}(x)=\frac{-2e^{x}}{(2e^{x}-1)^{2}}+2a.\]

Let \(t=2e^{x}\), since \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\), we know that \(t\in[2e^{-\frac{1}{2}},2e^{\frac{1}{2}}]\). Hence, we reformulate \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) as

\[f^{\prime\prime}(t)=\frac{-t}{(t-1)^{2}}+2a=\frac{-1}{t+\frac{1}{t}-2}+2a.\]

Notice that \(t+\frac{1}{t}\) is monotonically increasing when \(t>1\), so \(f^{\prime\prime}(t)\) is monotonically increasing in \(t\in[2e^{-\frac{1}{2}},2e^{\frac{1}{2}}]\). Consequently,

\[f^{\prime\prime}(t)\geq f^{\prime\prime}(t=2e^{-\frac{1}{2}})\approx-26.7+2a.\]

Additionally, it is clear that \(f^{\prime\prime}(x=0)=f^{\prime\prime}(t=2e^{0})=-2+2a>0\) for \(a\geq 4\). WWe now consider two cases:

1. If \(a>13.35\), then \(f^{\prime\prime}(t)\geq f^{\prime\prime}(t=2e^{-\frac{1}{2}})\geq 0\). Hence, \(f^{\prime}(x)\) is monotonically increasing in \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\). Since \(f^{\prime}(x=0)=0\), we demonstrate that \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) for \(x\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)\leq 0\) for \(x\in\left[-\frac{1}{2},0\right]\).
2. If \(a\leq 13.35\), then there exists an \(x_{0}\) such that \(f^{\prime\prime}(x_{0})\leq 0\). Recall that \(f^{\prime\prime}(x=0)=f^{\prime\prime}(t=2e^{0})=-2+2a>0\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)\) is monotonically increasing in \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\), we know that such \(x_{0}\in[-\frac{1}{2},0]\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)\geq 0\) for all \(x\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]\). Thus, \(f^{\prime}(x)\) first decreases in \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},x_{0}]\) then increases in \(x\in[x_{0},\frac{1}{2}]\). Since \(f^{\prime}(x=-\frac{1}{2})=\frac{1}{2e^{-\frac{1}{2}}}-1-a\approx 3.69-a<0\) for \(a\geq 4\), we conclude that \(f^{\prime}(x)>0\) for \(x\in\left[0,\frac{1}{2}\right]\) and \(f^{\prime}(x)\leq 0\) for \(x\in\left[-\frac{1}{2},0\right]\).

Consequently, we know that \(f(x)\) decreases in \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},0]\) and increases in \([0,\frac{1}{2}]\). By checking \(f(x)\geq f(0)=0\), the inequality \(\log(2-e^{-x})\geq x-ax^{2}\) holds for \(a\geq 4\) and \(x\in\left[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\right]\).

This completes the proof. 

## Appendix B Omitted Proofs in Section 3 and Additional Results

### Proof of Theorem 3.1

Proof.: Lemma 3.1 indicates that

\[I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t\in(-1,+\infty)}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i }}\left[\log\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\right].\]

Recall that \(G_{i}=(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\), and let \(a=\frac{[\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]]}{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}+\frac{1}{2}\). Since \(a\geq\frac{1}{2}\) and \(1-\frac{1}{2a}\geq 0\), we can apply Eq. (5) in Lemma A.3 to have \(f(x)=\log(1+x)-x+ax^{2}\geq 0\) for \(x\in[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]\).

Hence, by \(G_{i}\in[-1,1]\), we restrict \(t\in[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]\) and let \(x=tG_{i}\) to have the following inequality,

\[\sup_{t>-1}\mathbb{E}\left[\log\left(1+tG_{i}\right)\right]\geq\sup_{t\in[ \frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]}\mathbb{E}\left[tG_{i}-at^{2}G_{i}^{2}\right]= \frac{\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}]}{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]},\] (8)where the last equality holds when \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]}{2a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}\).

We now show that \(t^{*}\) can indeed be reached within \(t\in[\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]\).

Substituting \(a=\frac{\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|}{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2} \right]}+\frac{1}{2}\), we can see that \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]}{\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right] \right|+\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}\). In addition, notice that

\[1-\frac{1}{2a}=\frac{\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|}{\left|\mathbb{ E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|+\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}\quad\text{ and }\frac{1}{2a}-1=\frac{-\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|}{\left| \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|+\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]}.\]

Clearly, either \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]=-\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\) or \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]=\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\) holds. Consequently, \(t^{*}\) can be achieved at one of the endpoints of \([\frac{1}{2a}-1,1-\frac{1}{2a}]\).

Therefore,

\[I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t\in(-1,+\infty)}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i }}\left[\log\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\right]\geq\frac{\mathbb{ E}^{2}[G_{i}]}{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]},\]

which is equivalent to

\[\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}]\leq 4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]I( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})= 2\left(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|+\mathbb{E}\left[ \Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]\right)I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}).\] (9)

Then, by Jensen's inequality,

\[\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}} \left[G_{i}\right]\right|\] \[\leq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{2\left(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i} \right]\right|+\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]\right)I(\Delta L_{i};U_ {i})},\]

where the last inequality is by Eq. (9).

This completes the proof. 

### Proof of Corollary 3.1

Proof.: Recall Eq. (3) (or Eq. (9) equivalently),

\[\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}]\leq 2\left(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|+ \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]\right)I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}).\]

Notice that \(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\geq 0\), we now solve the inequality above for \(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\). Let \(A_{1}=\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]\) and \(A_{2}=I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\), then by the quadratic-root formula, the solution to \(\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}]-2A_{2}\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|-2A_{1}A _{2}\leq 0\) is

\[0\leq\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\leq\frac{2A_{2}+\sqrt{4A_{2}^{ 2}+8A_{1}A_{2}}}{2}=A_{2}+\sqrt{A_{2}^{2}+2A_{1}A_{2}}.\]

Therefore, we have

\[\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\leq I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})+\sqrt{\left(I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\right)^{2}+2 \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\] \[\leq 2I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})+\sqrt{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]I( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})},\]

where the second inequality is by \(\sqrt{x+y}\leq\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}\).

The remaining steps are routine, which will complete the proof. 

### Proof of Corollary 3.2

Proof.: Based on Theorem 3.1, by \(\sqrt{x+y}\leq\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}\), we have

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left( \sqrt{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\right]I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}+\sqrt{2\left| \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right).\] (10)Let \(G^{\prime}_{i}=(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L^{\prime}_{i}\), where \(\Delta L^{\prime}_{i}\) is an independent copy of \(\Delta L_{i}\). Notice that \(\mathbb{E}\left[G^{\prime}_{i}\right]=0\). Then,

\[\left|\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|=\left|\mathbb{E }_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]-\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L^{\prime}_{i},U_{ i}}\left[G^{\prime}_{i}\right]\right|\leq\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}}\left[\left| \mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i}|U_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]-\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L^{\prime }_{i}}\left[G^{\prime}_{i}\right]\right|\right],\]

where the last inequality is by Jensen's inequality.

Notice that \(G_{i}\leq 1\), by the dual form of total variation (cf. Lemma A.2), we have

\[\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}}\left[\left|\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i}|U_{i}}\left[G_{i} \right]-\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L^{\prime}_{i}}\left[G^{\prime}_{i}\right]\right| \right]\leq\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}}\left[\operatorname{D_{TV}}\left(P_{\Delta L_{i }|U_{i}},P_{\Delta L_{i}}\right)\right].\]

Plugging the above into Eq. (10) will complete the proof. 

### Comparison with "Online-to-PAC" Generalization Framework

We now discuss the comparison with [29; 30], consider the case of the KL or mutual information. The only explicit _expected_ generalization bound provided in [30] is their Corollary 21, which recovers the square-root bound of \(\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{I(W;S)/n})\). This bound is clearly weaker than our fast-rate bound in our Corollary 3.1-3.2, due to the omission of vanishing terms in our oracle bound in Theorem 3.1. In fact, a more refined MI bound is presented in the earlier version of [30], namely [29; Corollary 4]. This bound takes the form

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\sqrt{\frac{4\mathbb{E}_{Z}\|\ell(\cdot, Z)-\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\ell(\cdot,Z)]\|_{\infty}^{2}I(W;S)}{n}},\]

which can indeed be derived from [30] due to the generality of their framework. Recall that our Theorem 3.1 gives the bound

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{(2\mathbb{ E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+2|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]|)I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\]

Notably, because we apply individual and loss-difference techniques, our averaged MI term is always tighter than that of [29; 30], as \(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\leq\sqrt{\frac{I(W;S)}{n}}\) generally holds. To fairly compare our framework with theirs, we ignore the difference between MI terms and only focus on the novel components of each bound, specifically \(\mathbb{E}_{Z}\|\ell(\cdot,Z)-\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\ell(\cdot,Z)]\|_{\infty}^{2}\) in their work and \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]|\) in ours, let's consider the following simple example:

**Example 1**.: _Let \(\mathcal{W}\in[-1,1]\), and let the input space be \(\mathcal{Z}=\{1,-1\}\). Assume \(\mu=\text{Unif}(\mathcal{Z})\), i.e. \(Z\) is a Rademacher variable. Consider a convex and \(1\)-Lipschitz loss function \(\ell(w,z)=-w\cdot z\)._

Under the ERM algorithm, \(W=\mathcal{A}(S)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_{i}\). Notice that for any \(w\in\mathcal{W}\), \(\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\ell(w,Z)]=\frac{1}{2}(-w\cdot(1-1))=0\), hence \(\mathbb{E}_{Z}\|\ell(\cdot,Z)-\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\ell(\cdot,Z)]\|_{\infty}^{2}= \mathbb{E}_{Z}\|\ell(\cdot,Z)\|_{\infty}^{2}=1\). In contrast, since \(\Delta L_{i}\in[-1,1]\) in this case, \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]\leq\mathbb{E}[|\Delta L_{i}|]\) and \(|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]|\leq\mathbb{E}[|\Delta L_{i}|]\), we have \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]|\leq 2\mathbb{E}[|\Delta L_{i}|]\). Moreover, \(\mathbb{E}[|\Delta L_{i}|]=\mathbb{E}[|W\cdot(Z_{i}^{+}-Z_{i}^{-})|]\leq \frac{2}{n}\mathbb{E}[|\sum_{i=1}^{n}Z_{i}|]\leq\frac{2}{\sqrt{n}}\), where the last step is by the Khintchine-Kahane inequality (62, Theorem D.9).

Thus, in this example, \(\mathbb{E}_{Z}\|\ell(\cdot,Z)-\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\ell(\cdot,Z)]\|_{\infty}^{2}=1\), while our bound \(\mathbb{E}[\Delta L_{i}^{2}]+|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}]|\leq 2\mathbb{E}[|\Delta L_{i}|]\leq \mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}})\) shows a tighter convergence rate. Consequently, even without using the individual trick and loss-difference technique, our bound (Theorem 3.1) can still be tighter than [29; 30] in terms of convergence rate in this example. This suggests that, MI-based bounds in [29; 30] can still encounter limitations (e.g., slow convergence rate), as with previous MI-based bounds.

Finally, to clarify the comparison, we only demonstrate that our _oracle_ CMI bound could be tighter. It is worth noting that the unpublished version of [30] represents an initial exploration of their "online-to-PAC" generalization framework. As such, the results in their current version may primarily aim to recover previous findings, and their framework likely has room for further advancements.

### Proof of Theorem 3.2

Proof.: Lemma 3.1 indicates that

\[I_{\text{H}^{2}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t\in(-\infty,1)} \mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}\left[\frac{t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{ i}}{1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}}\Big{|}\tilde{z}_{i}\right].\]Let \(a=\frac{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|}{2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i }\right]}+1\). Consider the function \(f(x)=\frac{x}{1+x}-x+ax^{2}\). Notice that \(a\geq 1\) and \(-1\leq\frac{1}{a}-1\leq 1-\frac{1}{a}\leq 1\). By Eq. (6) in Lemma A.3, we know that when \(x\in[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}]\), \(f(x)\geq 0\). Hence, recall that \(G_{i}\in[-1,1]\), we restrict \(t\in[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}]\) to have the following inequality,

\[\sup_{t<1}\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{tG_{i}}{1+tG_{i}}\Big{|}\tilde{z}_{i}\right] \geq\sup_{t\in[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}]}\mathbb{E}\left[tG_{i}-at^{2}G_{i }^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]=\frac{\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{4a \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]},\] (11)

where the last equality holds when \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{2a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}| \tilde{z}_{i}\right]}\).

We now show that \(t^{*}\) can indeed be reached within \(t\in[\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}]\).

Substituting \(a\), we can see that

\[t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}{|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i} |\tilde{z}_{i}\right]|+2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}.\]

In addition, \(1-\frac{1}{a}=\frac{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|}{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}| \tilde{z}_{i}]|+2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}\) and \(\frac{1}{a}-1=\frac{-|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|}{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}| \tilde{z}_{i}]|+2\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}\). Clearly, either \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]=-\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde {z}_{i}\right]\right|\) or \(\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]=|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{ i}\right]|\) holds. Consequently, \(t^{*}\) can be achieved in \([\frac{1}{a}-1,1-\frac{1}{a}]\).

Therefore,

\[I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t\in(-\infty,1)} \mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}\left[\frac{t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L _{i}}{1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}}\Big{|}\tilde{z}_{i}\right]\geq\frac{ \mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i }\right]},\]

which is equivalent to

\[|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|\leq\sqrt{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{ z}_{i}\right]I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}= \sqrt{(2\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]|+4\mathbb{E} \left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]\right|)I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\tilde{z}}( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\] (12)

Then, by Jensen's inequality,

\[\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big{|}\mathbb{E}_ {\Delta L_{i},U_{i},\widetilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\Big{|}\leq\frac{1}{n }\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{\widetilde{Z}_{i}}\Big{|}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_ {i}|\widetilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\Big{|}.\]

Plugging Eq. (12) into the above will complete the proof. 

### Proof of Theorem 3.3

Proof.: Lemma 3.1 indicates that

\[I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t>-\log 2}\mathbb{E}_{ \Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}\left[\log(2-e^{-t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}})| \tilde{z}_{i}\right].\]

Let \(a=\frac{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|}{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z} _{i}\right]}+4\). Consider the function \(f(x)=\log(2-e^{-x})-x+ax^{2}\). Notice that \(a\geq 4\), and by Eq. (7) in Lemma A.3, we know that when \(x\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\), \(f(x)\geq 0\). Hence, recall that \(G_{i}\in[-1,1]\), we restrict \(t\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\) to have the following inequality,

\[\sup_{t>-\log 2}\mathbb{E}\left[\log(2-e^{-tG_{i}})|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]\geq\sup_{t \in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]}\mathbb{E}\left[tG_{i}-at^{2}G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z} _{i}\right]=\frac{\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^ {2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]},\] (13)

as the same with the previous proofs, the last equality holds when \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{2a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z} _{i}\right]}\).

We then check the conditions that \(t^{*}\in[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\):

\[-\frac{1}{2}\leq\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}{2a\mathbb{E} \left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}\leq\frac{1}{2}\qquad\Longleftrightarrow \qquad a\geq\frac{|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]|}{\mathbb{E}\left[G _{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]},\]

which is clearly satisfied by \(a=\frac{|\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]|}{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z} _{i}\right]}+4\). Consequently, \(t^{*}\) can be achieved in \([-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\).

Therefore,

\[I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\geq\sup_{t>-\log 2}\mathbb{E}_{ \Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}\left[\log(2-e^{-t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}})| \tilde{z}_{i}\right]\geq\frac{\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]}{4a\mathbb{E }\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]}.\]

With additional arrangements, we have

\[\mathbb{E}[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}]\leq\sqrt{4a\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z} _{i}\right]I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\tilde{z}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}= \sqrt{\left(4\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]\right|+16 \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}|\tilde{z}_{i}\right]\right)I_{\mathrm{JS}}^{\tilde{z }}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\] (14)

Then, by Jensen's inequality,

\[\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Big{|}\mathbb{E} _{\Delta L_{i},U_{i},\tilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\Big{|}\leq\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Z}_{i}}\Big{|}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i} |\tilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\Big{|}.\]

Plugging Eq. (14) into the above will complete the proof. 

### Additional \(f\)-Information Disintegrated Bounds

The following bounds can be derived by first employing a similar approach as in the proof of Theorem 3.1 to upper bound \(\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\). Then, we incorporate this individual bound into \(\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|\mathbb{E}_ {\Delta L_{i},U_{i},\tilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum _{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Z}_{i}}\Big{|}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}| \tilde{Z}_{i}}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|\).

**Theorem B.1**.: _Under the same conditions in Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Z}_{i}}\sqrt{2\left(\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}| \widetilde{Z}_{i}\right]+\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}|\widetilde{Z}_{i}\right] \right|\right)I_{\chi^{2}}^{\tilde{Z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})},\]

_where \(I_{\chi^{2}}^{\tilde{z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})=\mathrm{D}_{\chi^{2}}\left(P _{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}||P_{\Delta L_{i}|\tilde{z}_{i}}P_{U_{i}}\right)\) is the (disintegrated) \(\chi^{2}\)-information._

The following bound is a corollary from Theorem 3.2, which is used in our experiments in Section 5.

**Corollary B.1**.: _Under the same conditions in Theorem 3.1, we have_

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}_{\widetilde{Z}_{i}}\sqrt{\left(4\mathbb{E}\left[\Delta L_{i}^{2}| \widetilde{Z}_{i}\right]+2\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}}\left[\mathrm{D}_{\mathrm{TV}} \left(P_{\Delta L_{i}|U_{i},\widetilde{Z}_{i}},P_{\Delta L_{i}|\widetilde{Z}_{ i}}\right)\right]\right)I_{\mathrm{H}^{2}}^{\tilde{Z}_{i}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\]

The proof is nearly the same to Corollary 3.2 except that we do not apply \(\sqrt{x+y}\leq\sqrt{x}+\sqrt{y}\) to unpack the terms.

## Appendix C Omitted Proof in Section 4

### Proof of Lemma 4.1

Proof.: By the variational representation of \(f\)-divergence, we have

\[I_{\phi}(X;\varepsilon)\geq \sup_{g}\mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon}\left[g(X,\varepsilon)\right]- \mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon^{\prime}}\left[\phi^{*}(g(X,\varepsilon^{\prime}))\right]\] \[\geq \sup_{t}\mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon}\left[\phi^{*-1}(t\varepsilon X )\cdot\mathds{1}_{|X|\leq C}\right]-\mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon^{\prime}}\left[ \phi^{*}\left(\phi^{*-1}(t\varepsilon^{\prime}X)\cdot\mathds{1}_{|X|\leq C} \right)\right].\]

For the second term above, we have

\[\mathbb{E}_{X,\varepsilon^{\prime}}\left[\phi^{*}\left(\phi^{*-1}(t \varepsilon^{\prime}X)\cdot\mathds{1}_{|X|\leq C}\right)\right]=\int_{\Xi}t \varepsilon^{\prime}XdP_{X,\varepsilon^{\prime}}+\phi^{*}(0)=\int_{|x|\leq C} \frac{tX-tX}{2}dP_{X}=0,\]

where \(\Xi=\{x\in\mathcal{X},\varepsilon\in\{-1,1\}|\,|x|\leq C\}\). Putting everything together will conclude the proof.

### Proof of Theorem 4.1

Proof.: Since \((-1)^{U_{i}}\) is a Rademacher variable and \(\phi^{*}(0)=e^{0}-1=0\) for KL divergence, we can apply Lemma 4.1 first then follow the similar developments in Theorem 3.1 by controlling \(tG_{i}\in[-1,1]\). In particular, for any \(C\geq 0\),

\[I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}) \geq\sup_{t\in[-1/C,1/C]}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\left[ \log(1+tG_{i})\cdot\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\] \[\geq\sup_{t\in[\frac{1}{2aC},\frac{2a-1}{2aC}]}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L _{i},U_{i}}\left[(tG_{i}-at^{2}G_{i}^{2})\cdot\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\] \[=\frac{\mathbb{E}^{2}[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}]}{4a \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]},\]

where \(a=\frac{C\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]}{2 \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]}+\frac{1}{2}\). Notice that \(t^{*}=\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]}{2a \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]}=\frac{\mathbb{E} \left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]}{C\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i} \mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]+\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{ i}|\leq C}\right]}\) and it is easy to verify \(t^{*}\in[\frac{1-2a}{2aC},\frac{2a-1}{2aC}]\), so the last equality can be achieved.

Consequently,

\[\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\right|\leq\sqrt{ 2(C\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\right|+ \mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right])I(\Delta L_{i};U_{ i})}.\] (15)

Furthermore, let \(P=P_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}}\) and \(Q=P_{\Delta L_{i}}P_{U_{i}^{\prime}}\)

\[\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\right]\right|= \left|\int G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\frac{dP}{dQ}dQ\right|\] \[= \left|\int G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}-1\right) dQ\right|,\]

where we use the fact that \(\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}^{\prime}}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|\Delta L_{i}|>C} \right]=\frac{\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i}}\left[\Delta L_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|\Delta L _{i}|>C}-\Delta L_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|\Delta L_{i}|>C}\right]}{2}=0\).

Then, by using Holder's inequality twice,

\[\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\right]\right|\leq \left(\int\left|G_{i}\right|^{\beta}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}dQ \right)^{\frac{1}{\beta}}\left(\int\left(\frac{dP}{dQ}-1\right)^{\alpha}dQ \right)^{\frac{1}{\alpha}}\] \[\leq \left(\int\mathbbm{1}_{|\Delta L_{i}|>C}dQ\right)^{\frac{q-1}{q \beta}}\left(\int\left|\Delta L_{i}\right|^{q\beta}dQ\right)^{\frac{1}{q\beta }}\left(I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})\right)^{1/\alpha}\] \[= \left(P\left(|\Delta L_{i}|>C\right)\right)^{\frac{q-1}{q\beta}} \left|\left|\Delta L_{i}\right|\right|_{q\beta}\left(I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L _{i};U_{i})\right)^{1/\alpha}.\] (16)

Moreover, notice that

\[\left|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})\right|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i= 1}^{n}\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\right]\right|= \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G _{i}|>C}+G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\right|\] \[\leq \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i} \mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\right]\right|+\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{ |G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\right|\right).\]

Plugging Eq. (15) and Eq. (16) into the above will complete the proof. 

### Proof of Corollary 4.1

Proof.: First, by Markov's inequality, we have

\[\zeta_{2}\leq\left(\frac{\mathbb{E}|\Delta L_{i}|}{C}\right)^{\gamma}||\Delta L _{i}||_{q\beta}=\frac{||\Delta L_{i}||_{1}^{\gamma}||\Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}}{C ^{\gamma}}.\]

In addition, recall that \(\zeta_{1}\leq\sqrt{2}C\), we let

\[A_{1}=\sqrt{2I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\quad\text{ and }A_{2}=||\Delta L_{i}||_{1}^{ \gamma}||\Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}\sqrt[a]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\]Then, define \(f(C)=A_{1}C+\frac{A_{2}}{C^{\gamma}}\). Solving \(\min_{C>0}f(C)\), we have

\[C^{*}=\left(\frac{A_{2}\gamma}{A_{1}}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}.\]

Plugging \(C^{*}\) into \(f(C)\), we have

\[f(C^{*})=\left(\gamma^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}+\gamma^{\frac{-\gamma}{\gamma+1}} \right)A_{1}^{\frac{2}{\gamma+1}}A_{2}^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}.\]

From the proof of Theorem 4.1, we notice that

\[\left|\mathbb{E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|>C}\right]\right|+\left|\mathbb{ E}\left[G_{i}\mathbbm{1}_{|G_{i}|\leq C}\right]\right|\leq f(C^{*}).\]

Substituting \(A_{1}\) and \(A_{2}\) into the expression of \(f(C^{*})\), we will finally obtain

\[|\mathcal{E}_{\mu}(\mathcal{A})|\leq\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\gamma^{ \frac{1}{\gamma+1}}+\gamma^{\frac{-\gamma}{\gamma+1}}\right)\left(\sqrt{2I( \Delta L_{i};U_{i})}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma+1}}\left(||\Delta L_{i}||_ {1}^{\gamma}||\Delta L_{i}||_{q\beta}\sqrt[\alpha]{I_{\phi_{\alpha}}(\Delta L _{i};U_{i})}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma+1}}.\]

This completes the proof. 

## Appendix D Experimental Details

Our experimental setup largely follows [24], and the code of our experiments can be found at https://github.com/ZiqiaoWangGeothe/Conditional-f-Information-Bound.

Linear Classifier on Synthetic Gaussian DatasetIn this experiment, similar to [24], we use the popular Python package _scikit-learn_[63] to generate synthetic Gaussian data. Each feature of data is drawn independently from a Gaussian distribution, ensuring that all features are informative for the class labels. Specifically, we set the dimension of feature vector to \(5\) and create different classes of points, which are normally distributed. We train the linear classifier using full-batch gradient descent with a fixed learning rate of \(0.01\) for a total of \(300\) epochs, employing early stopping when the training error falls below a threshold (e.g., \(<0.5\%\)). To ensure robustness and statistical significance, we generate \(50\) different supersamples for each experiment. Within each supersample, we create \(100\) different mask random variables, resulting in a total of \(5,000\) runs for each experimental setting. This thorough setup allows us to compare and the disintegrated \(f\)-information-based bounds.

CNN and ResNet-50 on Real-World DatasetsIn these experiments, the same setup is initially given in [22], and is also used in [23, 61, 24]. Specifically, we draw \(k_{1}\) samples of \(\widetilde{Z}\) and \(k_{2}\) samples of \(U\) for each given \(\tilde{z}\). For the CNN on the binary MNIST dataset, we set \(k_{1}=5\) and \(k_{2}=30\). The 4-layer CNN model is trained using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of \(0.001\) and a momentum coefficient of \(\beta_{1}=0.9\). The training process spans \(200\) epochs with a batch size of \(128\). For ResNet-50 on CIFAR10, we set \(k_{1}=2\) and \(k_{2}=40\). The ResNet model is trained using stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with a learning rate of \(0.01\) and a momentum coefficient of \(0.9\) for a total of \(40\) epochs. The batch size for this experiment is set to \(64\). In the SGLD experiment, we train a 4-layer CNN on the binary MNIST dataset with a batch size of \(100\) for \(40\) epochs. The initial learning rate is \(0.01\) and decays by a factor of \(0.9\) after every \(100\) iterations. Let \(t\) be the iteration index; the inverse temperature of SGLD is given by \(\min\{4000,\max\{100,10e^{t/100}\}\}\). We set the training sample size to \(n=4000\), and \(k_{1}=5\) and \(k_{2}=30\). Checkpoints are saved every \(4\) epochs.

All these experiments are conducted using NVIDIA A100 GPUs with 40 GB of memory. For more comprehensive details, including model architectures, we recommend referring to [22, 23, 24].

## Appendix E CMI Framework from the Perspective of Coin-Betting Sequences

Deriving generalization bounds from a coin-betting perspective is inspired by [64, 1, 34]. We now adapt this strategy to derive CMI bounds, invoking inequalities similar to those in Lemma A.3.

Assume \(\ell\in[0,1]\). Let \(\Delta\ell_{i}\in[-1,1]\) be a sequence of "continuous coin" outcomes chosen arbitrarily, and at each round \(i\), a player bets \(c_{i}\geq 0\) money on the sign of the outcome \(\varepsilon_{i}\in\{-1,1\}\). Then, \(\Delta\ell_{i}\) is revealed, and the better wins or loses \(c_{i}\varepsilon_{i}\Delta\ell_{i}\) money.

Let the initial wealth \(\mathrm{Wealth}_{0}=1\). The wealth at the end of round \(n\) is:

\[\mathrm{Wealth}_{n}=\mathrm{Wealth}_{n-1}+c_{n}\varepsilon_{n}\Delta\ell_{n}=1+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}\varepsilon_{i}\Delta\ell_{i}.\]

Notice that \(c_{i}\in[0,\mathrm{Wealth}_{i-1}]\). Now consider a strategy where the player always bets a fixed fraction \(t\in[0,1]\) of the current money, i.e., \(c_{i}=t\mathrm{Wealth}_{i-1}\). Then:

\[\mathrm{Wealth}_{n}(t)=\mathrm{Wealth}_{n-1}+t\varepsilon_{n}\Delta\ell_{n} \mathrm{Wealth}_{n-1}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(1+t\varepsilon_{i}\Delta\ell_{i} \right).\]

It follows that

\[\log\mathrm{Wealth}_{n}(t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\log(1+t\varepsilon_{i}\Delta\ell_{i }).\]

Unlike the traditional online gambling game, we incorporate the individual technique from [6] by analyzing the expected log-wealth of the \(i\)th bet2, given by

Footnote 2: This can also be interpreted as having \(n\) players each place a single bet with \(t\), so \(\log\mathrm{Wealth}_{n}(t)\) represents their collective log-wealth.

\[W_{i}(t)=\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\log\left(1+t\varepsilon_{ i}\Delta L_{i}\right).\]

There are two kinds of players: those guessing the coin outcome randomly and those with side information. Let \(\varepsilon=(-1)^{U_{i}}\) where \(U_{i}\sim\mathrm{Bern}(1/2)\). The average log-wealth of the random guesser is \(\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}^{\prime},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log(1+t(-1)^{U^{i}}\Delta L_{i})\), and the average log-wealth of the informed player is \(W_{i}(t)=\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log(1+t(-1)_{i}^{U}\Delta L_{i})\).

Clearly, the value of side information impacts the second player's income. To quantify this impact, by the DV-representation of KL divergence (cf. Lemma A.1), we have

\[I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}) \geq\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log \left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)-\log\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}^{\prime}, \Delta L_{i}}\left[e^{\log\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i}\right)}\right]\] \[=\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log \left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)-\log\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}^{\prime}, \Delta L_{i}}\!\left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\] \[=\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log \left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right),\] (17)

where the last equality holds because \(\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}^{\prime},\Delta L_{i}}t(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i}= \mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i}}\left[\mathbb{E}_{U_{i}^{\prime}}t(-1)^{U_{i}^{ \prime}}\Delta L_{i}\right]=\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i}}\left[\frac{t\Delta L_{i} -t\Delta L_{i}}{2}\right]=0\). Notice that the log-wealth of the comparator, i.e. the random-guesser, appears in Eq. (17) in the form of \(\inf_{\lambda}\mathbb{E}_{\Delta L_{i},U_{i}^{\prime}}\left[\phi^{*}\left( \log(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}^{\prime}}\Delta L_{i})+\lambda\right)\right]-\lambda\).

Similar to [1], by the inequality \(\log(1+x)\geq x-x^{2}\) for \(x\geq-0.68\) (see Figure 1(Right) for a visualization of this inequality), we have

\[I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i}) \geq\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,1)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log \left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\] \[\geq\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,68)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\!\log \left(1+t(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right)\] \[\geq\!\!\!\sup_{t\in(0,68)}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\left[t (-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}-t^{2}\Delta L_{i}^{2}\right]\] \[= \frac{1}{4}\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}^{2}\big{[}(-1)^{U_{i}} \Delta L_{i}\big{]},\]

We then have

\[\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\left[(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\right]\leq 2 \sqrt{I(\Delta L_{i};U_{i})}.\] (18)Moreover, we now assume that the side information is "perfect" such that \((-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\geq 0\) (i.e. an interpolating or overfitting algorithm) always holds for each \(i\), namely the income is always positive. Under this condition, the players can safely set \(t=1\), that is, the players "all-in" their money. Then, by \(\log{(1+x)}\geq\frac{x}{(1+x)}\) for \(x>-1\), we have

\[I(\Delta_{i};U_{i})\geq \mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\log\left(1+(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{ i}\right)\] \[\geq \mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\frac{(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}}{1 +(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}}\] \[\geq \mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}\frac{(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}}{2},\]

which gives us

\[\mathbb{E}_{U_{i},\Delta L_{i}}(-1)^{U_{i}}\Delta L_{i}\leq 2I(\Delta_{i};U_{ i}).\] (19)

Consequently, recovering several existing ld-CMI bounds (up to a constant) from Eq. (19) and Eq. (18) is straightforward.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We highlight the motivations and contributions of this work in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 6 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: All assumptions are given in the theorem statements or in the preliminary section, and all the technical details are provided in Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our implementation also follows the previous works, as pointed out in the experiments section, and we explained all the additional details that needed for reproducing our results in the main text and Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We only use synthetic dataset and some well-known public image datasets, which can be easily found, and we provide our source code in Appendix D and in the supplementary materials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the standard deviations in some figures in Figure 2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our work conforms the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not see any societal impacts with our paper, as it is purely theoretical in nature. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: There is no such risk. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the datasets and models properly. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new asset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
