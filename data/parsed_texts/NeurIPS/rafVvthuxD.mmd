###### Abstract

While diffusion models can learn complex distributions, sampling requires a computationally expensive iterative process. Existing distillation methods enable efficient sampling, but have notable limitations, such as performance degradation with very few sampling steps, reliance on training data access, or mode-seeking optimization that may fail to capture the full distribution. We propose EM Distillation (EMD), a maximum likelihood-based approach that distills a diffusion model to a one-step generator model with minimal loss of perceptual quality. Our approach is derived through the lens of Expectation-Maximization (EM), where the generator parameters are updated using samples from the joint distribution of the diffusion teacher prior and inferred generator latents. We develop a reparametrized sampling scheme and a noise cancellation technique that together stabilize the distillation process. We further reveal an interesting connection of our method with existing methods that minimize mode-seeking KL. EMD outperforms existing one-step generative methods in terms of FID scores on ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128, and compares favorably with prior work on distilling text-to-image diffusion models.

## 1 Introduction

Diffusion models [1; 2; 3] have enabled high-quality generation of images [4; 5; 6], videos [7; 8], and other modalities [9; 10; 11]. Diffusion models use a forward process to create a sequence of distributions that transform the complex data distribution into a Gaussian distribution, and learn the score function for each of these intermediate distributions. Sampling from a diffusion model reverses this forward process to create data from random noise by solving an SDE, or an equivalent probability flow ODE [12]. Typically, solving this differential equation requires a significant number of evaluations of the score function, resulting in a high computational cost. Reducing this cost to single function evaluation would enable applications in real-time generation.

To enable efficient sampling from diffusion models, two distinct approaches have emerged: (1) trajectory distillation methods [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18] that accelerate solving the differential equation, and (2) distribution matching approaches [19; 20; 21; 22; 23] that learn implicit generators to match the marginals learned by the diffusion model. Trajectory distillation-based approaches have greatly reduced the number of steps required to produce samples, but continue to face challenges in the 1-step generation regime. Distribution matching approaches can enable the use of arbitrary generators and produce more compelling results in the 1-step regime, but often fail to capture the full distribution due to the _mode-seeking_ nature of the divergences they minimize.

In this paper, we propose EM Distillation (EMD), a diffusion distillation method that minimizes an approximation of the _mode-covering_ divergence between a pre-trained diffusion teacher model and a latent-variable student model. The student enables efficient generation by mapping from noise to data in just one step. To achieve Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) of the marginal teacher distribution for the student, we propose a method similar to the Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework [24], which alternates between an Expectation-step (E-step) that estimates the learning gradients with Monte Carlo samples, and a Maximization-step (M-step) that updates the studentthrough gradient ascent. As the target distribution is represented by the pre-trained score function, the E-step in the original EM that first samples a datapoint and then infers its implied latent variable would be expensive. We introduce an alternative MCMC sampling scheme that jointly updates the data and latent pairs initialized from student samples, and develop a reparameterized approach that simplifies hyperparameter tuning and improves performance for short-run MCMC [25]. For the optimization in the M-step given these joint samples, we discover a tractable linear noise term in the learning gradient, whose removal significantly reduces variances. Additionally, we identify a connection to Variational Score Distillation [9; 26] and Diff-Instruct [22], and show how the strength of the MCMC sampling scheme can interpolate between mode-seeking and mode-covering divergences. Empirically, we first demonstrate that a special case of EMD, which is equivalent to the Diff-Instruct [22] baseline, can be readily scaled and improved to achieve strong performance. We further show that the general formulation of EMD that leverages multi-step MCMC can achieve even more competitive results. For ImageNet-64 and ImageNet-128 conditional generation, EMD outperforms existing one-step generation approaches with FID scores of 2.20 and 6.0. EMD also performs favorably on one-step text-to-image generation by distilling from Stable Diffusion models.

## 2 Preliminary

### Diffusion models and score matching

Diffusion models [1; 2], also known as score-based generative models [27; 3], consist of a forward process that gradually injects noise to the data distribution and a reverse process that progressively denoises the observations to recover the original data distribution. This results in a sequence of noise levels with conditional distributions, whose marginals are. We use a variance-preserving forward process [3; 28; 29] such that. Song et al. [3] showed that the reverse process can be simulated with a reverse-time Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) that depends only on the time-dependent score function  of the marginal distribution of the noisy observations. This score function can be estimated by a neural network through (weighted) denoising score matching [30; 31]:

(1)

where is the weighting function and is the noise schedule.

### MCMC with Langevin dynamics

While solving the reverse-time SDE results in a sampling process that traverses noise levels, simulating Langevin dynamics [32] results in a sampler that converges to and remains at the data manifold of a target distribution. As a particularly useful Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling method for continuous random variables, Langevin dynamics generate samples from a target distribution by iterating through

(2)

where is the stepsize,, and indexes the sampling timestep. Langevin dynamics has been widely adopted for sampling from diffusion models [27; 3] and energy-based models [33; 34; 35]. Convergence of Langevin dynamics requires a large number of sampling steps, especially for high-dimensional data. In practice, short-run variants with early termination have been succesfully used for learning of EBMs [25; 37; 38].

### Maximum Likelihood and Expectation-Maximization

Expectation-Maximization (EM) [24] is a maximum likelihood estimation framework to learn latent variable models:, such that the marginal distribution approximates the target distribution. It originates from the generic training objective of _maximizing_ the log-likelihood function over parameters:, which is equivalent to _minimizing_ the _forward_ KL divergence [39]. Since the marginal distribution is usually analytically intractable, EM involves an E-step that expresses the gradients over the model parameters with an expectation formula

(3)where \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})=\frac{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})p (\mathbf{z})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})}\) is the posterior distribution of \(\mathbf{z}\) given \(\mathbf{x}\). See Appendix A for a detailed derivation. The expectation can be approximated by Monte Carlo samples drawn from the posterior using e.g. MCMC sampling techniques. The estimated gradients are then used in an M-step to optimize the parameters. Han et al. [40] learned generator networks with an instantiation of this EM framework where E-steps leverage Langevin dynamics for drawing samples.

### Variational Score Distillation and Diff-Instruct

Our method is also closely related to Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [9], Variational Score Distillation (VSD) [26] and Diff-Instruct [22], which have been used for distilling diffusion models into a single-step generator [23; 41]. The generator produces clean images \(\mathbf{x}_{0}=g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\) with \(p(\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\bm{I})\), and can be diffused to noise level \(t\) to form a latent variable model \(p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})=p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t }|\mathbf{z})p(\mathbf{z})\), \(p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t}|\mathbf{z})=\mathcal{N}(\alpha_{t}g_{\bm{ \theta}}(\mathbf{z}),\sigma_{t}^{2}\bm{I})\). This model is trained to match the marginal distributions \(p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\) and \(q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\) by minimizing their _reverse_ KL divergence. Integrating over all noise levels, the objective is to _minimize_\(\mathcal{J}(\bm{\theta})\) where

\[\mathcal{J}(\bm{\theta})=\mathbb{E}_{p(t)}[\tilde{w}(t)D_{\mathrm{KL}}(p_{\bm {\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})||q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t}))]=\mathbb{E}_{p(t)}\left[ \tilde{w}(t)\int p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\log\frac{p_{\bm{\theta},t}( \mathbf{x}_{t})}{q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})}d\mathbf{x}_{t}\right].\] (4)

When parametrizing \(\mathbf{x}_{t}=\alpha_{t}g_{\theta}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma_{t}\bm{\epsilon}\), the gradient for this objective in Eq. (4) can be written as

\[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\mathcal{J}(\bm{\theta})=\mathbb{E}_{p(t),p(\bm{\epsilon} ),p(\mathbf{z})}[-\tilde{w}(t)(\underbrace{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}}\log q_{t} (\mathbf{x}_{t})}_{\text{teacher score}}-\underbrace{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}} \log p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})}_{\text{learned $s_{0}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t)$}})\alpha_{t}\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}g_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z})],\] (5)

where \(p(\bm{\epsilon})=\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\bm{I})\), the teacher score is provided by the pre-trained diffusion model. In SDS, \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}}\log p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\) is the known analytic score function of the Gaussian generator. In VSD and Diff-Instruct, an auxiliary score network \(s_{\phi}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t)\) is learned to estimate it. The training alternates between learning the generator network \(g_{\bm{\theta}}\) with the gradient update in Eq. (5) and learning the score network \(s_{\bm{\phi}}\) with the denoising score matching loss in Eq. (1).

## 3 Method

### EM Distillation

We consider formulating the problem of distilling a pre-trained diffusion model to a deep latent-variable model \(p_{\bm{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})\) defined in Section 2.4 using the EM framework introduced in Section 2.3. For simplicity, we begin with discussing the framework at a single noise level and drop the subscript \(t\). We will revisit the integration over all noise levels in Section 3.3. Assume the target distribution \(q(\mathbf{x})\) is represented by the diffusion model where we can access the score function \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})\). Theoretically speaking, the generator network \(g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\) can employ any architecture including ones where the dimensionality of the latents differs from the data dimensionality. In this work, we reuse the diffusion denoiser parameterization as in other work on one-step distillation: \(g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})=\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z},t^{*})\), where \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{\bm{\theta}}\) is the \(\mathbf{x}\)-prediction function inherited from the teacher diffusion model, and \(t^{*}\) remains a hyper-parameter.

Figure 1: **Before and after MCMC correction.** In (a)(b), the left columns are \(\mathbf{x}=g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\), the right columns are updated \(\mathbf{x}\) after 300 steps of MCMC sampling jointly on \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{z}\). (a) illustrates the effect of correction in ImageNet. Note that the off-manifold images are corrected. (b) illustrates the correction in the embedding space of Stable Diffusion v1.5, which are decoded to image space in (c). Note the disentanglement of the cats and sharpness of the sofa. Zoom in for better viewing.

A naive implementation of the E-step involves two steps: (1) draw samples from the target diffusion model \(q(\mathbf{x})\) and (2) sample the latent variable \(\mathbf{z}\) from \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\) with _e.g._ MCMC techniques. Both steps can be highly non-trivial and computationally expensive, so here we present an alternative approach to sampling the same target distribution that avoids directly sampling from the pretrained diffusion model, by instead running MCMC from the joint distribution of \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\). We initialize this sampling process using a joint sample from the student: drawing \(\mathbf{z}\sim p(\mathbf{z})\) and \(\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})\). This sampled \(\mathbf{x}\) is no longer drawn from \(q(\mathbf{x})\), but \(\mathbf{z}\) is guaranteed to be a valid sample from the posterior \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\). We then run MCMC to correct the sampled pair towards the desired distribution: \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}):=q(\mathbf{x})p_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})=p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\frac{q( \mathbf{x})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})}\) (see Fig. 1 for a visualization of this process). If \(q(\mathbf{x})\) and \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})\) are close to each other, \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) is close to \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\). In that case, initializing the _joint_ sampling of \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) with pairs of \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) from \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) could significantly accelerate both sampling of \(\mathbf{x}\) and inference of \(\mathbf{z}\). Assuming MCMC converges, we can use the resulting samples to estimate the learning gradients for EM:

\[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta})=\mathbb{E}_{\rho_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})}\left[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\right]=\mathbb{E}_{\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})}\left[-\frac{\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\|\mathbf{x}-\alpha g_{\bm{ \theta}}(\mathbf{z})\|_{2}^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right].\] (6)

We abbreviate our method as EMD hereafter. To successfully learn the student network with EMD, we need to identify efficient approaches to sample from \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\).

### Reparametrized sampling and noise cancellation

As an initial strategy, we consider Langevin dynamics which only requires the score functions:

\[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) =\underbrace{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})}_{\text{ teacher score}}-\underbrace{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})}_{ \text{learned}\ s_{\phi}(\mathbf{x})}+\underbrace{\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p_{ \bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})}_{-\frac{\mathbf{x}-\alpha g_{\bm{\theta} }(\mathbf{z})}{\sigma^{2}}}\] (7) \[\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\log\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z}) =\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z})+ \nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})=-\frac{\mathbf{x}-\alpha g _{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})}{\sigma^{2}}\alpha\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}g_{\bm{ \theta}}(\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{z}.\]

While we do not have access to the score of the student, \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})\), we can approximate it with a learned score network \(s_{\bm{\phi}}\) estimated with denoising score matching as in VSD [26] and Diff-Instruct [22]. As will be covered in Section 3.3, this score network is estimated at all noise levels. The Langevin dynamics defined in Eq. (7) can therefore be simulated at any noise level.

Running Langevin MCMC is expensive and requires careful tuning, and we found this challenging in the context of diffusion model distillation where different noise levels have different optimal step sizes. We leverage a reparametrization of \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{z}\) to accelerate the joint MCMC sampling and simplify step size tuning, similar to Nijkamp et al. [36], Xiao et al. [42]. Specifically, the parametrization \(\mathbf{x}=\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon}\) defines a deterministic transformation from the pair of \((\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) to the pair of \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\), which enables us to push back the joint distribution \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) to the \((\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-space. The reparameterized distribution is

\[\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})=\frac{q(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})}p(\bm{\epsilon})p(\mathbf{z}).\] (8)

The score functions become

\[\begin{split}\nabla_{\bm{\epsilon}}\log\rho(\bm{\epsilon}, \mathbf{z})&=\sigma(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})-\nabla_{ \mathbf{x}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}))-\bm{\epsilon},\\ \nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\log\rho(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})& =\alpha(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p_{\bm{ \theta}}(\mathbf{x}))\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})-\mathbf{z}. \end{split}\] (9)

``` Input: Teacher score functions \(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}}\log q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\), generator network \(g_{\bm{\theta}}\), prior \(p(\mathbf{z})\), score network \(s_{\bm{\phi}}\), noise scheduler \(p(t)\), weighting functions \(w(t)\) and \(\tilde{w}(t)\), # of MCMC steps \(K\), MCMC step size \(\gamma\). Output: Generator network \(g_{\bm{\theta}}\), score network \(s_{\bm{\phi}}\). while not converged do  Sampling a batch of \(t\), \(\mathbf{z}\), \(\bm{\epsilon}\) from \(p(t)\), \(p(\mathbf{z})\), \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\bm{I})\) to obtain \(\mathbf{x}_{t}\)  Updating \(s_{\bm{\phi}}\) via Stochastic Gradient Descent with the batch estimate of Eq. (12)  Sampling \(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{K}\) and \(\mathbf{z}^{K}\) with \((\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector\((\mathbf{x}_{0},\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z},t,\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}}\log q_{t}( \mathbf{x}_{t}),g_{\bm{\theta}},s_{\bm{\phi}},K,\gamma)\)  Updating \(g_{\bm{\theta}}\) via Stochastic Gradient Ascent with the batch estimate of Eq. (11) endwhile ```

**Algorithm 1**EM DistillationSee Appendix B for a detailed derivation. We found that this parameterization admits the same step sizes across noise levels and results in better performance empirically (Table 1).

Still, learning the student with these samples continued to present challenges. When visualizing samples \(\mathbf{x}\) produced by MCMC (see Fig. 1(a)), we found that samples contained substantial noise. While this makes sense given the level of noise in the marginal distributions, we found that this inhibited learning of the student. We identify that, due to the structure of Langevin dynamics, there is noise added to \(\mathbf{x}\) at each step that can be linearly accumulated across iterations. By removing this accumulated noise along with the temporally decayed initial \(\epsilon\), we recover cleaner \(\mathbf{x}\) samples (Fig. 1(b)). Since \(\mathbf{x}\) is effectively a regression target in Eq. (6), and the expected value of the noises is \(\mathbf{0}\), canceling these noises reduces variance of the gradient without introducing bias. Empirically, we find bookkeeping the sampled noises in the MCMC chain and canceling these noises after the loop significantly stabilize the training of the generator network. This noise cancellation was critical to the success of EMD, and is detailed in Appendix B and ablated in experiments (Fig. 2(b)).

### Maximum Likelihood across all noise levels

The derivation above assumes smoothing the data distribution with a single noise level. In practice, the diffusion teachers always employ multiple noise levels \(t\), coordinated by a noise schedule \(p(t)\). Therefore, we optimize a weighted loss over all noise levels of the diffusion model, to encourage that the marginals of the student network match the marginals of the diffusion process at all noise levels:

\[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\nabla_{ \boldsymbol{\theta}}\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{p(t),q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})} \left[\tilde{w}(t)\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\right]= \operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{p(t),\rho_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})}\left[ \tilde{w}(t)\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta},t}( \mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})\right],\] (10)

where \(p_{\boldsymbol{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})\) are a series of latent-variable models as defined in Section 2.4, with a shared generator \(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\) across all noise levels. Empirically, we find \(\tilde{w}(t)=\sigma_{t}^{2}/\alpha_{t}\) or \(\tilde{w}(t)=\sigma_{t}^{2}/\alpha_{t}^{2}\) perform well.

Denote the resulted distribution after \(K\) steps of MCMC sampling with noise cancellation as \(\rho_{t}^{K}(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{K},\mathbf{z}^{K})\), the final gradient for the generator network \(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\) is

\[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta})=\operatorname{ \mathbb{E}}_{p(t),\rho_{t}^{K}(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{K},\mathbf{z}^{K})}\left[- \tilde{w}(t)\frac{\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\|\mathbf{x}_{t}^{K}-\alpha_{t} g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}^{K})\|_{2}^{2}}{2\sigma_{t}^{2}}\right].\] (11)

The final gradient for the score network \(s_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t)\) is

\[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\mathcal{J}(\boldsymbol{\phi})=\operatorname{ \mathbb{E}}_{p(t),p_{\boldsymbol{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t},\mathbf{z})}\left[ w(t)\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}\|s_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t)-\nabla_{ \mathbf{x}_{t}}\log p_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t}|g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}) )\|_{2}^{2}\right].\] (12)

Similar to VSD [26; 22], we employ alternating update for the generator network \(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\) and the score network \(s_{\boldsymbol{\phi}}(\mathbf{x}_{t},t)\). See summarization in Algorithm 1.

### Connection with VSD and Diff-Instruct

In this subsection, we reveal an interesting connection between EMD and Variational Score Distillation (VSD) [26; 22], _i.e._, although motivated by optimizing different types of divergences, VSD [26; 22] is equivalent to EMD with a special sampling scheme.

To see this, consider the 1-step EMD with noise cancellation, stepsize \(\gamma=1\) in \(\mathbf{x}\), and no update on \(\mathbf{z}\)

\[\mathbf{x}_{t}^{0}=\alpha_{t}g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma_{t} \epsilon,\quad\mathbf{x}_{t}^{1}=\alpha_{t}g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z} )+\sigma_{t}^{2}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{0})}{p_{ \boldsymbol{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t}^{0})}\lrcorner\sqrt[t]{2\sigma\mathbf{ n}^{\mathsf{T}}}.\] (13)

Substitute it into Eq. (11), we have

\[\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) =\mathbb{E}_{p(t),p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}),p(\mathbf{z})}\left[- \tilde{w}(t)\frac{\nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\|\mathbf{x}_{t}^{1}-\alpha_{t}g _{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\|_{2}^{2}}{2\sigma_{t}^{2}}\right]\] (14) \[=\mathbb{E}_{p(t),p(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}),p(\mathbf{z})}\left[ \tilde{w}(t)(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}_{t}}\log q_{t}(\mathbf{x}_{t})-\nabla_{ \mathbf{x}_{t}}\log p_{\boldsymbol{\theta},t}(\mathbf{x}_{t}))\alpha_{t} \nabla_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\right],\]

which is exactly the gradient for VSD (Eq. (5)), up to a sign difference. This insight demonstrates that, EMD framework can flexibly interpolate between mode-seeking and mode-covering divergences, by leveraging different sampling schemes from 1-step sampling in only \(\mathbf{x}\) (a likely biased sampler) to many-step joint sampling in \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) (closer to a mixing sampler). Notably, for image generation, some believe that _forward_ KL divergence may fail to achieve better fidelity compared to _reverse_ KL divergence. The interpolation enabled by EMD can thus be very useful in practice.

If we further assume the marginal \(p_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})\) is a Gaussian, then EMD update in Eq. 14 would resemble Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) [9].

## 4 Related Work

**Diffusion acceleration.** Diffusion models have the notable issue of slowness in inference, which motivates many research efforts to accelerate the sampling process. One line of work focuses on developing numerical solvers [43; 44; 12; 45; 46; 47] for the PF-ODE. Another line of work leverages the concept of knowledge distillation [48] to condense the sampling trajectory of PF-ODE into fewer steps [13; 49; 15; 50; 51; 18; 52; 53; 54; 55]. However, both approaches have significant limitations and have difficulty in substantially reducing the sampling steps to the single-step regime without significant loss in perceptual quality.

**Single-step diffusion models.** Recently, several methods for one-step diffusion sampling have been proposed, sharing the same goal as our approach. Some methods fine-tune the pre-trained diffusion model into a single-step generator via adversarial training [20; 21; 56], where the adversarial loss enhances the sharpness of the diffusion model's single-step output. Adversarial training can also be combined with trajectory distillation techniques to improve performance in few or single-step regimes [52; 57; 58]. Score distillation techniques [9; 26] have been adopted to match the distribution of the one-step generator's output with that of the teacher diffusion model, enabling single-step generation [41; 22]. Additionally, Yin et al. [23] introduces a regression loss to further enhance performance. These methods achieve more impressive 1-step generation, some of which enjoy additional merits of being data-free or flexible in the selection of generator architecture. However, they often minimizes over mode-seeking divergences that can fail to capture the full distribution and therefore causes mode collapse issues. We discuss the connection between our method and this line of work in Section 3.4. Concurrent with our work, Zhou et al. [59] adopt Fisher divergence as the distillation objective and propose a novel decomposition that alleviates the dependency on the approximation accuracy of the auxiliary score network. Although the adopted Fisher divergence is similar to _reverse_ KL in terms of the reparametrization and hence the risk of mode collapse, Zhou et al. [59] demonstrate impressive performance gain.

## 5 Experiments

We employ EMD to learn one-step image generators on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64, ImageNet 128\(\times\)128 [60] and text-to-image generation. The student generators are initialized with the teacher model weights. Results are compared according to Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [61], Inception Score (IS) [62],Recall (Rec.) [63] and CLIP Score [64]. Throughout this section, we will refer to the proposed EMD with \(K\) steps of Langevin updates on \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) as EMD-\(K\), and we use EMD-1 to describe the DiffInstruct/VSD-equivalent formulation with only one update in \(\mathbf{x}\) as presented in Section 3.4.

### ImageNet

We start from showcasing the effect of the key components of EMD, namely noise cancellation, multi-step joint sampling, and reparametrized sampling. We then summarize results on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64 with Karras et al. [47] as teacher, and ImageNet 128\(\times\)128 with Kingma and Gao [29] as teacher.

Noise cancellationDuring our development, we observed the vital importance of canceling the noise after the Langevin update. Even though theoretically speaking our noise cancellation technique does not guarantee reducing the variance of the gradients for learning, we find removing the accumulated noise term from the samples (including the initial diffusion noise \(\epsilon\)) does give us seemingly clean images empirically. See Fig. 2 for a comparison. These updated \(\mathbf{x}^{K}\) can be seen as regression targets in Eq. (11). Intuitively speaking, regressing a generator towards clean images should result in more stable training than towards noisy images. Reflected in the training process, canceling the noise significantly decreases the variance in the gradient (Fig. 2(a)) and boosts the speed of convergence (Fig. 2(b)). We also compare with another setting where only the noise in the last step gets canceled, which is only marginally helpful.

Multi-step joint samplingWe scrutinize the effect of multi-step joint update on \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\). Empirically, we find a constant step size of Langevin dynamics across all noise levels in the \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-space works well: \(\boldsymbol{\gamma}=(\gamma_{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}},\gamma_{\mathbf{z}})=(0.4 ^{2},0.004^{2})\), which simplifies the process of step size tuning. Fig. 1 shows results of running this \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector for 300 steps. We can see that the \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector removes visual artifacts and improves structure. Fig. 2(c)d illustrates the relation between the distilled generator's performance and the number of Langevin steps per distillation iteration, measured by FID and Recall respectively. Both metrics show clear improvement monotonically as the number of Langevin steps increases. Recall is designed for measuring mode coverage [63], and has been widely adopted in the GAN literature. A larger number of Langevin steps encourages better mode coverage, likely because it approximates the mode-covering _forward_ KL better. Sampling \(\mathbf{z}\) is more expensive than sampling \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\), requiring back-propagation through the generator \(g_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}\). An alternative is to only sample \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\) while keeping \(\mathbf{z}\) fixed, with the hope that if \(\mathbf{x}\) does not change dramatically with a finite number of MCMC updates, the initial \(\mathbf{z}\) remains a good approximation of samples from \(\rho_{\boldsymbol{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\). As shown in Fig. 2(d)d, sampling \(\boldsymbol{\epsilon}\) performs similarly to the joint sampling of \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) when the number of sampling steps is small, but starts to fall behind with more sampling steps.

Reparametrized samplingAs shown in Appendix B, the noise cancellation technique does not depend on the reparametrization. One can start from either the score functions of \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) in Eq. (7) or the score functions of \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) in Eq. (9) to derive something similar. We conduct a comparison between the two parameterizations for joint sampling, \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector and \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector.

For the \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector, we set the step size of \(\mathbf{x}\) as \(\sigma_{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}^{2}\gamma_{\boldsymbol{\epsilon}}\) to align the magnitude of update with the one of the \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector, and keep

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline  & FID (\(\downarrow\)) & IS (\(\uparrow\)) \\ \hline \((\mathbf{x},)/(\boldsymbol{\epsilon},)\) & 2.829 & 62.31 \\ \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) & 3.11 & 61.08 \\ \((\boldsymbol{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) & **2.77** & **62.98** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Text-to-image generation

We further test the potential of EMD on text-to-image models at scale by distilling the Stable Diffusion v1.5 [6] model. Note that the training is image-free and we only use text prompts from the LAION-Aesthetics-6.25+ dataset [75]. On this task, DMD [23] is a strong baseline, which introduced an additional regression loss to VSD or Diff-Instruct to avoid mode collapse. However, we find the baseline without regression loss, or equivalently EMD-1, can be improved by simply tuning the hyperparameter \(t^{*}\). Empirically, we find it is better to set \(t^{*}\) to intermediate noise levels, consistent with the observation from Luo et al. [22]. In Appendix C.4 we discuss the selection of \(t^{*}\). The intuition is that by choosing the value of \(t^{*}\), we choose a specific denoiser at that noise level for initialization. Other hyperparameters can be found in Appendix C.3.

We evaluate the distilled one-step generator for text-to-image generation with zero-shot generalization on MSCOCO [76] and report the FID-30k in Table 4 and CLIP Score in Table 5. Yin et al. [23] uses the guidance scale of 3.0 to compose the classifier-free guided teacher score (we refer to this guidance scale of teacher as tCFG) in the learning gradient of DMD, for it achieves the best FID for DDIM sampler. However, we find EMD achieves a lower FID at the tCFG of 2.0. Our method, EMD-8, trained on 256 TPU-v5e for 5 hours (5000 steps), achieves the FID=9.66 for one-step text-to-image generation. Using a higher tCFG, similar to DMD, produces a model with competitive CLIP Score. In Fig. 5, we include some samples for qualitative evaluation. Additional qualitative results (Tables 14 and 15), as well as side-by-side comparisons (Tables 10 to 13) with trajectory-based distillation baselines [74, 55] and adversarial distillation baselines [21] can be found in Appendix D.2.

Figure 4: ImageNet samples from the distilled 1-step generator. Models are trained class-conditionally with all classes. We provide single-class samples in (c) to demonstrate good mode coverage.

### Computation overhead in training

Despite EMD being more expensive per training iteration compared to the baseline approach Diff-Instruct, we find the performance gain of EMD cannot be realized by simply running Diff-Instruct for the same amount of time or even longer than EMD. In fact, the additional computational cost that EMD introduced is moderate even with the most expensive EMD-16 setting. In Table 6 we report some quantitative measurement of the computation overhead. Since it is challenging to time each python method's wall-clock time in our infrastructure, we instead logged the sec/step for experiments with various algorithmic ablations on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64. EMD-16 only doubles the wall-clock time of Diff-Instruct when taking all other overheads into account.

## 6 Discussion and limitation

We present EMD, a maximum likelihood-based method that leverages EM framework with novel sampling and optimization techniques to learn a one-step student model whose marginal distributions match the marginals of a pretrained diffusion model. EMD demonstrates strong performance in class-conditional generation on ImageNet and text-to-image generation. Despite exhibiting compelling results, EMD has a few limitations that call for future work. Empirically, we find that EMD still requires the student model to be initialized from the teacher model to perform competitively, and is sensitive to the choice of \(t^{*}\) (fixed timestep conditioning that repurposes the diffusion denoiser to become a one-step generator) at initialization. While training a student model entirely from scratch is supported theoretically by our framework, empirically we were unable to achieve competitive results. Improving methods to enable generation from randomly initialized generator networks with distinct architectures and lower-dimensional latent variables is an exciting direction of future work. Although being efficient in inference, EMD introduces additional computational cost in training by running multiple sampling steps per iteration, and the step size of MCMC sampling can require careful tuning. There remains a fundamental trade-off between training cost and model performance. Analysis and further improving on the Pareto frontier of this trade-off would be interesting for future work.

## Appendix A Expectation-Maximization

To learn a latent variable model \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})=p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}) p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})\), \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})=\int p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})d \mathbf{z}\) from a target distribution \(q(\mathbf{x})\), the EM-like transformation on the gradient of the log-likelihood function is:

\[\begin{split}\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta})& =\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{q(\mathbf{x})}[ \log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})]\\ &=\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{ x})}[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})]]\\ &=\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{q(\mathbf{x})p_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})+ \nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]\\ &=\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{q(\mathbf{x})p_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{z})].\end{split}\] (15)

Line 3 is due to the simple equality that \(\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\nabla_{ \bm{\theta}}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]=0\).

## Appendix B Reparametrized sampling and noise cancellation

Reparametrization.The EM-like algorithm we propose requires joint sampling of \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) from \(\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\). Similar to [36, 42], we utilize a reparameterization of \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{z}\) to overcome challenges in joint MCMC sampling, such as slow convergence and complex step size tuning. Notice that \(\mathbf{x}=\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon}\) defines a deterministc mapping from \((\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) to \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\). Then by _change of variable_ we have:

\[\begin{split}\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})d\bm{ \epsilon}d\mathbf{z}&=\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})d \mathbf{x}d\mathbf{z}\\ &=\frac{q(\mathbf{x})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x})}p_{\bm{\theta} }(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})d\mathbf{x}d\mathbf{z}\\ &=\frac{q(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})} {p_{\bm{\theta}}(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})}p_{ \bm{\theta}}(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})d\bm{\epsilon}d\mathbf{z}\\ \Rightarrow\rho_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})& =\frac{q(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})}{p_{\bm{ \theta}}(\alpha g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z})+\sigma\bm{\epsilon})}p(\bm{ \epsilon})p(\bm{\epsilon}),\end{split}\] (16)

where \(p(\bm{\epsilon})\) and \(p(\mathbf{z})\) are standard Normal distributions.

The score functions become

\[\begin{split}\nabla_{\bm{\epsilon}}\log\rho(\bm{\epsilon},\bm{z})& =\sigma(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}))-\bm{\epsilon},\\ \nabla_{\mathbf{z}}\log\rho(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})& =\alpha(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x})-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} \log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}))\nabla_{\mathbf{z}}g_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{z })-\mathbf{z}.\end{split}\] (17)

Noise cancellation.The single-step Langevin update on \(\bm{\epsilon}\) is then:

\[\bm{\epsilon}^{i+1}=(1-\gamma)\bm{\epsilon}^{i}+\gamma\sigma\nabla_{\mathbf{x }}\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}^{i})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{i})}+\sqrt{2\gamma }\mathbf{n}^{i}.\] (18)

Interestingly, we find the particular form of \(\nabla_{\bm{\epsilon}}\log\rho(\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\) results in a closed-form accumulation of multi-step updates

\[\bm{\epsilon}^{i+1}=(1-\gamma)^{i+1}\bm{\epsilon}^{0}+\gamma\sum\nolimits_{k= 0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sigma\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}^{i})}{p _{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{i})}+\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sqrt {2\gamma}\mathbf{n}^{k},\] (19)

which, after the push-forward, gives us

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{x}^{i+1}=&\alpha g(\mathbf{z}^ {i+1})+\underbrace{\gamma\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sigma^{2} \nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}^{i})}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{i} )}}_{drift}\\ &+\underbrace{(1-\gamma)^{i+1}\sigma\bm{\epsilon}^{0}+\sum \nolimits_{k=0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sqrt{2\gamma}\sigma\mathbf{n}^{k}}_{noise },\end{split}\] (20)

As \(\mathbf{x}^{i+1}\) is effectively a regression target in Eq. (6), and the expected value of the \(noise\) is \(\mathbf{0}\), we can remove it without biasing the gradient. Empirically, we find book-keeping the sampled noises in the MCMC chain and canceling these noises after the loop significantly stabilize the training of the generator network.

The same applies to the \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\) sampling (with step size \(\gamma\sigma^{2}\)):

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{x}^{i+1}=&\mathbf{x}^{i}+ \gamma\sigma^{2}(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x}^{i})-\nabla_{\mathbf{x }}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{i}))-\gamma(\mathbf{x}^{i}-\alpha g( \mathbf{z}^{i}))+\sqrt{2\gamma}n^{i}\\ =&\gamma\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k} \alpha g(\mathbf{z}^{k})+\gamma\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sigma ^{2}(\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log q(\mathbf{x}^{i})-\nabla_{\mathbf{x}}\log p_{ \bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}^{i}))\\ &+(1-\gamma)^{i}\alpha g(\mathbf{z}^{0})+\underbrace{(1-\gamma)^{ i+1}\sigma\bm{\epsilon}^{0}+\sum\nolimits_{k=0}^{i}(1-\gamma)^{i-k}\sqrt{2 \gamma}\sigma n^{k}}_{noises}.\end{split}\] (21)

## Appendix C Implementation details

### ImageNet 64\(\times\)64

We train the teacher model using the best setting of EDM [47] with the ADM UNet architecture [77]. We inherit the noise schedule and the score matching weighting function from the teacher. We run the distillation training for 300k steps (roughly 8 days) on 64 TPU-v4. We use \((\bm{\epsilon},\mathbf{z})\)-corrector, in which both the teacher and the student score networks have a dropout probability of 0.1. We list other hyperparameters in Table 7. Instead of listing \(t^{*}\), we list the corresponding log signal-to-noise ratio \(\lambda^{*}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(lr_{g}\) & \(lr_{s}\) & batch size & Adam \(b_{1}\) & Adam \(b_{2}\) & \(\gamma_{\bm{\epsilon}}\) & \(\gamma_{\mathbf{z}}\) & \(K\) & \(\lambda^{*}\) & \(\tilde{w}(t)\) \\ \hline \(2\times 10^{-6}\) & \(1\times 10^{-5}\) & 128 & 0.0 & 0.99 & \(0.4^{2}\) & \(0.004^{2}\) & \(16\) & \(-3.2189\) & \(\frac{\sigma_{k}^{2}}{\alpha_{t}^{2}}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Hyperparameters for EMD on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64.

### ImageNet 128\(\times\)128

We train the teacher model following the best setting of VDM++ [29] with the 'U-ViT, L' architecture [78]. We use the 'cosine-adjusted' noise schedule [78] and 'EDM monotonic' weighting for student score matching. We run the distillation training for 200k steps (roughly 10 days) on 128 TPU-v5p. We use \((\bm{\epsilon},\bm{\mathrm{z}})\)-corrector, in which both the teacher and the student score networks have a dropout probability of 0.1. We list other hyperparameters in Table 8.

### Text-to-image generation

We adopt the public checkpoint of Stable Diffusion v1.5 [6] as the teacher. We inherit the noise schedule from the teacher model. The student score matching uses the same weighting function as the teacher. We list other hyperparameters in Table 9.

### Choosing \(t^{*}\) and \(\lambda^{*}\)

The intuition is that by choosing the value of \(t^{*}\), we choose a specific denoiser at that noise level. When parametrizing \(t\), the log-signal-to-noise ratio \(\lambda\) is more useful when designing noise schedules, a strictly monotonically decreasing function [28]. Due to the monotonicity, \(\lambda^{*}\) is an alternative representation for \(t^{*}\) that actually reflects the noise levels more directly.

Fig. 6 shows the denoiser generation at the 0th training iteration for different \(\lambda^{*}\) in ImageNet 128\(\times\)128. When \(\lambda^{*}=0\), the generated images are no different from Gaussian noises. When \(\lambda^{*}=-6\), the generated images have more details than \(\lambda^{*}=-10\). In the context of EMD, these samples help us understand the initialization of MCMC. According to our experiments, setting \(\lambda^{*}\in[-6,-3]\) results in similar performance. For the numbers reported in the manuscript, we used the same \(\lambda^{*}\) as the baseline Diff-Instruct on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64 and only did a very rough grid search on ImageNet 128\(\times\)128 and Text-to-image.

## Appendix D Additional qualitative results

### Additional ImageNet results

In this section, we present additional qualitative samples for our one-step generator on ImageNet 64\(\times\)64 and ImageNet 128\(\times\)128 in Fig. 7 to help further evaluate the generation quality and diversity.

### Additional text-to-image results

In this section, we present additional qualitative samples from our one-step generator distilled from Stable Diffusion 1.5. In Table 10, 11, 12, and 13, we visually compare the sample quality of our method with open-source competing methods for few- or single-step generation. We also include the teacher model in our comparison. We use the public checkpoints of LCM1 and InstaFlow2, where

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(lr_{g}\) & \(lr_{s}\) & batch size & Adam \(b_{1}\) & Adam \(b_{2}\) & \(\gamma_{\bm{\epsilon}}\) & \(\gamma_{\bm{\mathrm{z}}}\) & \(K\) & \(\lambda^{*}\) & \(\widehat{w}(t)\) \\ \hline \(2\times 10^{-6}\) & \(1\times 10^{-5}\) & 1024 & 0.0 & 0.99 & \(0.4^{2}\) & \(0.004^{2}\) & \(16\) & \(-6\) & \(\frac{\sigma_{t}^{2}}{\alpha_{t}}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Hyperparameters for EMD on ImageNet 128\(\times\)128.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(lr_{g}\) & \(lr_{s}\) & batch size & Adam \(b_{1}\) & Adam \(b_{2}\) & \(\gamma_{\bm{\epsilon}}\) & \(\gamma_{\bm{\mathrm{z}}}\) & \(K\) & \(t^{*}\) & \(\widehat{w}(t)\) \\ \hline \(2\times 10^{-6}\) & \(1\times 10^{-5}\) & 1024 & 0.0 & 0.99 & \(0.3^{2}\) & \(0.005^{2}\) & \(8\) & \(500\) & \(\frac{\sigma_{t}^{2}}{\alpha_{t}}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Hyperparameters for EMD on Text-to-image generation.

both checkpoints share the same Stable Diffusion 1.5 as teachers. Note that the SD-turbo results are obtaind from the public checkpoint 3 fine-tuned from Stable Diffusion 2.1, which is different from our teacher model.

Footnote 3: https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sd-turbo

From the comparison, we observe that our model significantly outperforms distillation-based methods including LCM and InstaFlow, and it demonstrates better diversity and quality than GAN-based SD-turbo. The visual quality is on-par with 50-step generation from the teacher model.

We show additional samples from our model on a more diverse set of prompts in Table 14 and 15.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the claims in the abstract and the introduction are supported by the experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the last section, we discuss the limitation, including the assumptions and their related constraints of the proposed method, the efficiency of the method, and the most sensitive hyperparameters. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: All derivations are included in the main text and the appendix. All assumptions are explicitly communicated. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the algorithm and full implementation details in the main text and the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We have not open sourced the model or code, but our approach is data-free so no training data is required. We also provide implementation details in the appendix that we hope are sufficient for reproducing our results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All implementation details are enclosed in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the standard deviation for the Inception Score, following the convention in the literature. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The computed resources used in this project are listed in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: I confirm the paper conform in every respect with the NeurIPS code of ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: We currently discuss mostly the positive impacts of this work, but can add more acknowledgement of the potential for harm caused by text-to-image generative models if the reviewers believe it is useful. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [No] Justification: The model will not be released. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All models that are open-sourced through HuggingFace are provided with corresponding hyperlinks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new assets introduced. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
