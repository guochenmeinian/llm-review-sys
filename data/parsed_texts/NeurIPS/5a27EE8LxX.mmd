###### Abstract

Current LLMs are generally aligned to follow safety requirements and tend to refuse toxic prompts. However, LLMs can fail to refuse toxic prompts or be overcautious and refuse benign examples. In addition, state-of-the-art toxicity detectors have low TPRs at low FPR, incurring high costs in real-world applications where toxic examples are rare. In this paper, we introduce Moderation Using LLM Introspection (MULI), which detects toxic prompts using the information extracted directly from LLMs themselves. We found we can distinguish between benign and toxic prompts from the distribution of the first response token's logits. Using this idea, we build a robust detector of toxic prompts using a sparse logistic regression model on the first response token logits. Our scheme outperforms SOTA detectors under multiple metrics.

## 1 Introduction

Significant progress has been made in recent large language models. LLMs acquire substantial knowledge from wide text corpora, demonstrating a remarkable ability to provide high-quality responses to various prompts. They are widely used in downstream tasks such as chatbots [18, 4] and general tool use [23, 6]. However, LLMs raise serious safety concerns. For instance, malicious users could ask LLMs to write phishing emails or provide instructions on how to commit a crime [29, 10].

Current LLMs have incorporated safety alignment [27, 24] in their training phase to alleviate safety concerns. Consequently, they are generally tuned to decline to answer toxic prompts. However, alignment is not perfect, and many models can be either overcautious (which is frustrating for benign users) or too-easily deceived (e.g., by jailbreak attacks) [28, 15, 21, 16]. One approach is to supplement alignment tuning with a toxicity detector [12, 2, 1, 3], a classifier that is designed to detect toxic, harmful, or inappropriate prompts to the LLM. By querying the detector for every prompt, LLM vendors can immediately stop generating responses whenever they detect toxic content. These detectors are usually based on an additional LLM that is finetuned on toxic and benign data.

Current detectors are imperfect and make mistakes. In real-world applications, toxic examples are rare and most prompts are benign, so test data exhibits high class imbalance: even small False Positive Rates (FPR) can cause many false alarms in this scenario [5]. Unfortunately, state-of-the-art content moderation classifiers and toxicity detectors are not able to achieve high True Positive Rates (TPR) and very low FPRs, and they struggle with some inputs.

Existing detectors also impose extra costs. At training time, one must collect a comprehensive dataset of toxic and benign examples for fine-tuning such a model. At test time, LLM providers must also query a separate toxicity detection model, which increases the cost of LLM serving and can incur additional latency. Some detectors require seeing both the entire input to the LLM and the entire output, which is incompatible with providing streaming responses; in practice, providers deal with this by applying the detector only to the input (which in current schemes leads to missing some toxic responses) or applying the detector once the entire output has been generated and attempting toerase the output if it is toxic (but by then, the output may already have been displayed to the user or returned to the API client, so it is arguably too late).

In this work, we propose a new approach to toxicity detection, Moderation Using LLM Introspection (MULI), that addresses these shortcomings. We simultaneously achieve better detection performance than existing detectors and eliminate extra costs. Our scheme, MULI, is based on examining the output of the model being queried (Figure 1). This avoids the need to apply a separate detection model; and achieves good performance without needing the output, so we can proactively block prompts that are toxic or would lead to a toxic response.

Our primary insight is that there is information hidden in the LLMs' outputs that can be extracted to distinguish between toxic and benign prompts. Ideally, with perfect alignment, LLMs would refuse to respond to any toxic prompt (e.g., "Sorry, I can't answer that..."). In practice, current LLMs sometimes respond substantively to toxic prompts instead of refusing, but even when they do respond, there is evidence in their outputs that the prompt was toxic: it is as though some part of the LLM wants to refuse to answer, but the motivation to be helpful overcomes that. If we calculate the probability that the LLM responds with a refusal conditioned on the input prompt, this refusal probability is higher when the prompt is toxic than when the prompt is benign, even if it isn't high enough to exceed the probability of a non-refusal response (see Figure 2). As a result, we empirically found there is a significant gap in the probability of refusals (PoR) between toxic and benign prompts.

Calculating PoR would offer good accuracy at toxicity detection, but it is too computationally expensive to be used for real-time detection. Therefore, we propose an approximation that can be computed efficiently: we estimate the PoR based on the logits for the first token of the response. Certain tokens that usually lead to refusals, such as _Sorry_ and _Cannot_, receive a much higher logit for toxic prompts than for benign prompts. With this insight, we propose a toxicity detector based on the logits of the first token of the response. We find that our detector performs better than state-of-the-art (SOTA) detectors, and has almost zero cost.

At a technical level, we use sparse logistic regression (SLR) with lasso regularization on the logits for the first token of the response. Our detector significantly outperforms SOTA toxicity detection models by multiple metrics: accuracy, Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC), as well as TPR at low FPR. For instance, our detector achieves a \(42.54\%\) TPR at \(0.1\%\) FPR on ToxicChat [14], compared to a \(5.25\%\) TPR at the same FPR by LlamaGuard. Our contributions include:

* We develop MULI, a low-cost toxicity detector that surpasses SOTA detectors under multiple metrics.
* We highlight the importance of evaluating the TPR at low FPR, show current detectors fall short under this metric, and provide a practical solution.

Figure 1: Pipeline of MULI. Left: Existing methods use a separate LLM as a toxicity detector, thus having up to a 2x overhead. Right: We leverage the original LLM’s first token logits to detect toxicity using sparse logistic regression, incurring negligible overhead.

* We reveal that there is abundant information hidden in the LLMs' outputs, encouraging researchers to look deeper into the outputs of the LLM more than just the generated responses.

## 2 Related work

Safety alignment can partially alleviate safety concerns: aligned LLMs usually generate responses that are closer to human moral values and tend to refuse toxic prompts. For example, Ouyang et al. [20] incorporate Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs, improving alignment. Yet, further improving alignment is challenging [24; 27].

Toxicity detection can be a supplement to safety alignment to further improve the safety of LLMs. Online APIs such as the OpenAI Moderation API [2], Perspective API [3], and Azure AI Content Safety API [1] can be used to detect toxic prompts. Also, Llama Guard is an open model that can be used to detect toxic/unsafe prompts [12].

## 3 Preliminaries

### Problem Setting

Toxicity detection aims to detect prompts that may lead a LLM to produce harmful responses. One can attempt to detect such situations solely by inspecting the prompt, or by inspecting both the prompt and the response. According to [14], both approaches yield comparable performance. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on detecting toxicity based solely on the prompt. This has a key benefit: it means that we can block toxic prompts before the LLM produces any response, even for streaming APIs and streaming web interfaces. We focus on toxicity detection "for free", i.e., without running another classifier on the prompt. Instead, we inspect the output of the existing LLM, and specifically, the logits/softmax outputs that indicate the distribution over tokens.

### Evaluation metrics

We measure the effectiveness of a toxicity detector using three metrics:

**Balanced optimal accuracy:** The accuracy indicates the proportion of the examples in which the predictions agree with the ground truth labels. Balanced optimal prediction accuracy is evaluated on a balanced dataset where the proportion of negatives and positives is roughly equal.

**Area Under Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC):** In real-world applications, there is significant class imbalance: benign prompts are much more common than toxic prompts. The Precision-Recall Curve plots precision against the recall across various TPR to FPR tradeoffs, without assuming balanced classes. AUPRC is a primary metric in past work, so we measure it in our evaluation as well.

**True Positive Rate (TPR) at low False Positive Rate (FPR):** Because most prompts are benign, even a modest FPR (e.g., 5%) is unacceptable, as it would cause loss of functionality for many benign users. In practice, we suspect model providers have an extremely low tolerance for FPR when applying the detection method. Therefore, we measure the TPR when FPR is constrained below some threshold of acceptability (e.g., 0.1%). We suspect this metric might be the most relevant to practice.

Figure 2: Illustration of the candidate responses and the starting tokens.

## 4 Toy models

To help build intuition for our approach, we propose two toy models that help motivate our final approach. The first toy model has an intuitive design rationale, but is too inefficient to deploy, and the second is a simple approximation to the first that is much more efficient. We evaluate their performance on a small dataset containing the first \(100\) benign prompts and \(100\) toxic prompts from the test split of the ToxicChat [14] dataset. Llama2 [26] is employed as the base model.

### Probability of refusals

Current LLMs are usually robustly finetuned to reject toxic prompts (see Figure 3). Therefore, a straightforward idea to detect toxicity is to simply check whether the LLM will respond with a rejection sentence (a refusal). Specifically, we evaluate the probability that a randomly sampled response to this prompt is a refusal.

To estimate this probability, we randomly generate 100 responses \(r_{i}\) to each prompt \(x\) and estimate the probability of refusal (PoR) using a simple point estimate:

\[\mathrm{PoR}(x)=\frac{1}{100}\sum_{i=1}^{100}\mathbbm{1}[r_{i}\text{ is a refusal}],\] (1)

Following [33], we treat a response \(r\) as a refusal if it starts with one of several refusal keywords. As shown in Figure 3(a), there is a huge gap between the PoR distribution for benign vs toxic prompts, indicating that we can accurately detect toxic prompts by comparing the PoR to a threshold. We hypothesize this works because alignment fine-tuning significantly increases the PoR for toxic prompts, so even if alignment is not able to completely prevent responding to a toxic prompt, there are still signs that the prompt is toxic in the elevated PoR.

Figure 4: (a) LLMs have a high probability of refusing to respond for most toxic prompts (_Positives_) and a low probability for benign prompts (_Negatives_). (b) The logit for “Sorry” appearing as the first token of the response tends to be higher for positives than negatives. (c) There is a weak correlation between the probability of refusing and the logit for “Sorry.”

Figure 3: Typical prompts and responses.

However, it is completely infeasible to generate 100 responses at runtime, so while accurate, this is not a practical detection strategy. Nonetheless, it provides motivation for our final approach.

### Logits of refusal tokens

Since calculating the PoR is time-consuming, we now turn to more efficient detection strategies. We noticed that many refusal sentences start with a token that implies refusal, such as _Sorry_, _Cannot_, or \(I\) (_I_ usually leads to a refusal when it is the first token of the response); and sentences that start with one of these tokens are usually a refusal. Though the probability of starting with such a token could be quite low, there can still be a huge gap between negative and positive examples. Therefore, instead of computing the PoR, we compute the probability of the response starting with a refusal token (PoRT). This is easy to compute:

\[\mathrm{PoRT}(x)=\sum_{t}\mathrm{Prob}(t),\] (2)

where \(t\) ranges over all refusal tokens, and \(\mathrm{Prob}(t)\) denotes the estimated probability of \(t\) at the start position of the response for prompt \(x\). This allows us to detect toxic prompts based on the softmax/logit values at the output of the model, without any additional computation or classifier.

We build two toy toxicity detectors, by comparing PoR or PoRT to a threshold, and then compare them by constructing a confusion matrix for their predictions (Table S1 in the Appendix). In this experiment, we used _Sorry_ as the only refusal token for PoRT, and we computed the classification threshold as the median value of each feature over the \(200\) examples from the small evaluation dataset. We found a high degree of agreement between these two approaches, indicating that toxicity detection based on PoRT is built on a principled foundation.

### Evaluation of the toy models

We evaluated the performance of the toy models on the small evaluation dataset. We estimated PoR with \(1\), \(10\), or \(100\) outputs, and calculated PoRT with three refusal tokens (_Sorry_, _Cannot_ and \(I\); tokens 8221, 15808, and 306). In practice, we used the logits for PoRT since it is empirically better than using softmax outputs. We evaluate the performance with balanced prediction accuracy Acc, AUPRC, and TPR at low FPR (TPR@FPR\({}_{\mathrm{FPR}}\)). For TPR@FPR\({}_{\mathrm{FPR}}\), we set the FPR to be \(10\%,1\%,0.1\%\), respectively.

Results are in Table 1. All toy models achieve accuracy around \(80\%\), indicating they are all decent detectors on a balanced dataset. Increasing the number of samples improves the PoR detector, which is reasonable since the estimated probability will be more accurate with more samples. PoR struggles at low FPR. We believe this is because of sampling error in our estimate of PoR: if the ground truth PoR of some benign prompts is close to \(1.0\), then after sampling only 100 responses, the estimate \(\mathrm{PoR}_{100}\) might be exactly equal to \(1.0\) (which does appear to happen; see Figure 3(a)), forcing the threshold to be \(1.0\) if we wish to achieve low FPR, thereby failing to detect any toxic prompts. Since the FPR tolerance of real-world applications could be very low, one may need to generate more than a hundred responses if the detector is based on PoR.

In contrast, PoRT-based detectors avoid this problem, because we obtain the probability of a refusal token directly without any estimate or sampling error. These results motivate the design of our final detector, which is based on the logit/softmax outputs for the start of the response.

\end{table}
Table 1: Effectiveness of the toy modelsMULI: Moderation Using LLM Introspection

Concluding from the results of the toy models, even the logit of a single specific starting token contains sufficient information to determine whether the prompt is toxic. In fact, hundreds of thousands of tokens can be used to extract such information. For example, Llama2 outputs logits for \(36,000\) tokens at each position of the response. Therefore, we employ a Sparse Logistic Regression (SLR) model to extract additional information from the token logits in order to detect toxic prompts.

Suppose the LLM receives a prompt \(x\); we extract the logits of all \(n\) tokens at the starting position of the response, denoted by a vector \(l(x)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\). We then apply an additional function \(f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}\) on the logits before sending to the SLR model. We denote the weight and the bias of the SLR model by \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and \(b\in\mathbb{R}\) respectively, and formulate the output of SLR to be

\[\mathrm{SLR}(x)=\mathbf{w}^{T}f(l(x))+b.\] (3)

In practice, we use the following function as \(f\):

\[f^{*}(l)=\mathrm{Norm}(\ln(\mathrm{Softmax}(l))-\ln(1-\mathrm{Softmax}(l))),\] (4)

is the estimated re-scaled probability by applying the Softmax function across all token logits. \(\mathrm{Norm}(\cdot)\) is a normalization function, where the mean and standard deviation values are estimated on a training dataset and then fixed. \(f^{*}\) can be understood as computing log-odds for each possible token and then normalizing these values to a fixed mean and standard deviation. The parameters \(\mathbf{w},b\) in Equation (3) are optimized for the following SLR problem with lasso regularization:

\[\min_{\mathbf{w},b}\sum_{\{x,y\}\in\mathcal{X}}\mathrm{BCE}(\mathrm{Sigmoid }(\mathrm{SLR}(x)),y)+\lambda\|w\|_{1}\,.\] (5)

In the above equation, \(\mathcal{X}\) indicates the training set, each example of which consists of a prompt \(x\) and the corresponding toxicity label \(y\in\{0,1\}\), \(\mathrm{BCE}(\cdot)\) denotes the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) Loss, \(\left\|\cdot\right\|_{1}\) denotes the \(\ell_{1}\) norm, and \(\lambda\) is a scalar coefficient.

## 6 Experiments

### Experimental setup

**Baseline models.** We compared our models to LlamaGuard [12] and the OpenAI Moderation API [2] (denoted by OMod), two current SOTA toxicity detectors. We also queried GPT-4o and GPT-4o-mini [18] (the prompt can be found in Appendix A.7) for additional comparison. For LlamaGuard, we use the default instructions for toxicity detection. Since it always output either _safe_ or _unsafe_, we extracted the logits of _safe_ and _unsafe_ and use the feature \(\mathrm{logits}_{\mathrm{LlamaGuard}}=\mathrm{logits}_{\mathrm{unsafe}}- \mathrm{logits}_{\mathrm{safe}}\) for multi-threshold detection. For OpenAI Moderation API, we found that directly using the toxicity flag as the indicator of the positive leads to too many false negatives. Therefore, for each prompt we use the maximum score \(c\in(0,1)\) among all \(18\) sub-categories of toxicity and calculate the feature \(\mathrm{logits}_{\mathrm{OMod}}=\ln(c)-\ln(1-c)\) for multi-threshold evaluation.

**Dataset.** We used the prompts in the ToxicChat [14] and LMSYS-Chat-1M [31] datasets for evaluation, and included the OpenAI Moderation API Evaluation dataset for cross-dataset validation [17]. The training split of ToxicChat consists of \(4698\) benign prompts and \(384\) toxic prompts, the latter including \(113\) jailbreaking prompts. The test split contains \(4721\) benign prompts and \(362\) toxic prompts (the latter includes \(91\) jailbreaking prompts). For LMSYS-Chat-1M, we extracted a subset of prompts from the original dataset. We checked through the extracted prompts, grouped all the similar prompts, and manually labeled the remaining ones as toxic or non-toxic. We then randomly split them into training and test sets without splitting the groups. The training split consists of \(4868\) benign and \(1667\) toxic examples, while the test split consists of \(5221\) benign and \(1798\) toxic examples.

**Evaluation metrics and implementation details.** We measured the optimal prediction accuracy Acc\({}_{\text{opt}}\), AUPRC and TPR at low FPRPR\(\epsilon\)FPR\({}_{\text{FPR}}\). For TPR@FPR\({}_{\text{FPR}}\), we set the FPR \(\in\{10\%,1\%,0.1\%,0.01\%\}\). The analysis is based on llama-2-7b except otherwise specified. For llama-2-7b, we set \(\lambda=1\times 10^{-3}\) in Equation (5) and optimized the parameters \(\mathbf{w}\) and \(b\) for \(500\) epochs by Stochastic Gradient Descent with a learning rate of \(5\times 10^{-4}\) and batch size \(128\). We released our code on GitHub1.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

We further display the logarithm scale plot of TPR versus FPR for different models in Figure 5. We also include one of the toy models \(\mathrm{Logits}_{\mathrm{Cannot}}\). On ToxicChat, MULI outperforms all other schemes, achieving significantly better TPR at all FPR scales. On LMSYS-Chat-1M, MULI is comparable to the OpenAI Content Moderation API and outperforms all others. Even the performance of toy model \(\mathrm{Logits}_{\mathrm{Cannot}}\) is comparable to that of LlamaGuard and the OpenAI Content ModerationAPI on ToxicChat, even though the toy model is zero-shot and almost zero-cost.

### MULI based on different LLM models

We built and evaluated MULI detectors based on different models [26; 19; 30; 32; 13; 9; 22; 7]. See Table S2 in the Appendix for the results. Among all the models, the detectors based on llama-2-7b and llama-2-13b exhibit the best performance under multiple metrics. For instance, the detector based on llama-2-13b obtained \(46.13\%\) TPR at \(0.1\%\) FPR. It may benefit from the strong alignment techniques, such as shadow attention, that were incorporated during training of Llama2. Performance drops heavily when Llama models are quantized. The second tier includes Llama3, Vicuna, and Mistral. They all obtained around \(30\%\) TPR at \(0.1\%\) FPR.

We further investigated the correlation between the security of base LLMs and the performance of the MULI detectors. We collected the Attack Success Rate (ASR) of the human-generated jailbreaks evaluated by HarmBench and computed the security score of the model by \(\mathrm{Score}_{\mathrm{security}}=100\%-\mathrm{ASR}\). See Figure 6 for the scatter plot for different LLMs. The correlation is clear: the more secure the base LLM is against jailbreaks and toxic prompts (the stronger the safety alignment), the higher the performance that our detector can achieve. Such findings corroborated our motivation at the very beginning, which was that well-aligned LLMs already provide sufficient information for toxicity detection in their output.

### Dataset sensitivity

Figure 7 shows the effect of the training set size on the performance of MULI (see Table S3 in the Appendix for additional results). Even training on just ten prompts (nine benign prompts and only one toxic prompt) is sufficient for MULI to achieve \(76.92\%\) AUPRC and \(13.81\%\) TPR at \(0.1\%\) FPR, which is still better than LlamaGuard and the OpenAI Content Moderation API.

Table 4 shows the robustness of MULI when used on a different data distribution than it was trained on. In cross-dataset scenarios, the model's performance tends to be slightly inferior compared to its performance on the original dataset. Yet, it still surpasses the baseline models on ToxicChat, where the TPRs at \(0.1\%\) FPR of LlamaGuard and OMod are \(5.25\%\) and \(6.08\%\), respectively. In addition,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline TrainingTest & \begin{tabular}{c} AUPRC \\ \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{c} TPR@\(\mathrm{FPR}_{0.1\%}\) \\ \end{tabular} \\ \hline ToxicChat & 91.29 & 95.86 & 42.54 & 31.31 \\ LMSYS-Chat-1M & 79.62 & 98.23 & 33.43 & 66.85 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Cross-dataset performance

Figure 6: Security score of different models versus (a) AUPRC; (b) TPR@\(\mathrm{FPR}_{0.1\%}\).

we also evaluated both detectors and baseline models on the OpenAI Moderation API Evaluation dataset. The results are in Table 5. The TPR at \(0.1\%\) FPR of MULTI trained on ToxicChat / MULTI trained on lmsys1m / LlamaGuard / OpenAI Moderation API are \(24.90\%/25.86\%/14.56\%/15.13\%\), respectively. Even when MULIs is trained on other datasets, its performance significantly exceeds SOTA methods.

### Interpretation of the failure cases

We inspected some failure cases of MULTI. As shown in Figure S1, the MULTI logits of most negative examples in Toxic Chat are below \(3\), while that of most positive examples are above \(0\). We found that the failure cases all seem to be ambiguous borderline examples. Some high-logit negative examples contain sensitive words. Some low-logit positive examples are extremely long prompts with a little bit of harmful content or are related to inconspicuous jailbreaking attempts. See the examples in Appendix A.8.

### Interpretation of the SLR weights

In order to find how MULTI detects toxic prompts, we looked into the weights of SLR trained on different training sets. We collected five typical refusal starting tokens, including _Not_, _Sorry_, _Cannot_, \(I\), _Unable_, and collected five typical affirmative starting tokens, including _OK_, _Sure_, _Here_, _Yes_, _Good_. We extracted their corresponding weights in SLR and calculated their ranks (see Table S4 in the Appendix). The rank \(r\) of a weight \(w\) is calculated by \(r(w)=\big{|}\{v\in W|v>w\}\big{|}\big{/}|W|\), where \(W\) is the set of all weight values. A rank value near \(0\) (resp. \(1\)) suggests the corresponding token is associated with benign (resp. toxic) prompts, and more useful tokens for detection have ranks closer to \(0\) or \(1\). Note that since the SLR is sparsely regularized, weights with ranks between \(0.15-0.85\) are usually very close to zero. Refusal tokens generally seem more useful for toxicity detection than affirmative tokens, as suggested by the frequent observations of ranks as low as \(0.01\) for the refusal tokens in Table S4. Our intuition is the information extracted by SLR could be partially based on LLMs' intention to refuse.

### Ablation study

We trained MULTI with different function \(f\) in Equation (3) and different sparse regularizations. See Table 6 for the comparison. The candidate functions include \(f^{*}\) defined in Equation (4), \(\logit

outputting the logits of the tokens, \(\mathrm{prob}\) outputting the probability of the tokens, and \(\log(\mathrm{prob})\) outputting the logarithm probability of the tokens. The candidate sparse regularization inlude \(\ell_{1}\), \(\ell_{2}\), and \(\mathrm{None}\) for no regularization. We can see that \(f^{*}\) and \(\log(\mathrm{prob})\) exhibit comparable performance. The model with function \(f^{*}\) has the highest AUPRC score, as well as TPR at \(10\%\) and \(1\%\) FPR. The model trained on the logits achieved the highest TPR at extremely low (\(0.1\%\) and \(0.01\%\)) FPR.

## 7 Conclusion

We proposed MULI, a low-cost toxicity detection method with performance that surpasses current SOTA LLM-based detectors under multiple metrics. In addition, MULI exhibits high TPR at low FPR, which can significantly lower the cost caused by false alarms in real-world applications.

MULI only scratches the surface of information hidden in the output of LLMs. We encourage researchers to look deeper into the information hidden in LLMs in the future.

LimitationsMULI relies on well-aligned models, since it relies on the output of the LLM to contain information about harmfulness. MULI's ability to detect toxic prompts was shown to be correlated with the strength of alignment of base LLMs, so we expect it will work poorly with weakly-aligned or unaligned LLMs. MULI has also not been tested under scenarios where a malicious user fine-tunes an LLM to remove the safety alignment or launches adversarial attacks. In such scenarios, running MULI based on a separate LLM may be required, which could incur an additional inference cost. Moreover, we didn't evaluate whether MULI remains equally effective across demographic subgroups [11; 8], which could be a topic for future work. Training MULI requires a one-time training cost, to run the base LLM on the prompts in the training set, so while MULI is free at inference time, it does require some upfront cost to train. If training cost is an issue, even training MULI on just ten examples suffices to achieve performance superior to SOTA detectors, as shown in Section 6.4.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We explained the motivation of our method, showed some brief results, and listed our contributions at the end of Section 1 Introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed the limitations in section 7 Conclusion. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: We clarified all the symbols and formulas but did not include theorems to prove. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We introduced the experimental details, including settings, dataset, and hyperparameters, in section 6.1 Experimental setup. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide code in supplementary materials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We introduced the experimental details, including settings, dataset, and hyperparameters, in section 6.1 Experimental setup. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We did not report error bars following previous work in the field. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We specified the type of GPU that we conducted the experiment on. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have reviewed and followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed it in Section 1, Introduction, and Section 7, Conclusion. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not have such concerns. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cited all the original owners of the datasets and models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not release new assets Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
