###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown state-of-the-art performance in a variety of tasks, including arithmetic and reasoning; however, to gauge the intellectual capabilities of LLMs, causal reasoning has become a reliable proxy for validating a general understanding of the mechanics and intricacies of the world similar to humans. Previous works in natural language processing (NLP) have either focused on open-ended causal reasoning via causal commonsense reasoning (CCR) or framed a symbolic representation-based question answering for theoretically backed-up analysis via a causal inference engine. The former adds an advantage of real-world grounding but lacks theoretically backed-up analysis/validation, whereas the latter is far from real-world grounding. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing the **COLD** (**Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities**) framework, which is built upon human understanding of daily real-world activities to reason about the causal nature of events. We show that the proposed framework facilitates the creation of enormous causal queries (\(\sim 9\) million) and comes close to the mini-turing test, simulating causal reasoning to evaluate the understanding of a daily real-world task. We evaluate multiple LLMs on the created causal queries and find that causal reasoning is challenging even for activities trivial to humans. We further explore (the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs) using the backdoor criterion to determine the causal strength between events.

## 1 Introduction

In recent times, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable generalization capabilities (Devlin et al., 2019; Radford et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). Consequently, the ability to perform causal reasoning (often considered a core feature of intelligence (Penn and Povinelli, 2007; Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018)) has sparked research interest in the context of LLMs, aiming to answer if causal reasoning is possible with LLMs (Weber et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2023, 2024; Cohrs et al., 2023; Romanou et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Mitchell et al., 2023; Vashishtha et al., 2023; Stolfo et al., 2023). On a broader level, there are two lines of work; first, that treats the causal reasoning via learning relationships between the events that are grounded in the real world (Gordon et al., 2012; Ho et al., 2022; Zecevic et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023). Second line of work relies on a causal inference engine and establishes relationships between variables via symbolic representation (Jin et al., 2023, 2024). The former relies on understanding real-world events but lacks formal definitions that adhere to the causal inference theory. The latter solves the issue using a causal inference engine but uses symbolic representations not grounded in the world, making the causal queries more like a test for the understanding of causal theory. Though the first line of work includes real-world events, the causal queries are often limited and could be answered by memorizing the causal relationships between the events. Recent findings that include rigorous analysis using a causalinference engine claim LLMs to be _"Causal Parrots"_(Zeeevic et al., 2023), i.e., the LLMs tend to pick up (memorize) patterns in the training data to perform well on the causal reasoning benchmarks. Moreover, some initial findings by Tang et al. (2023) suggest that LLMs perform significantly better when semantics are consistent with commonsense but struggle to solve symbolic tasks, pointing towards semantic representation to be better for proper validation of LLMs, leading to a conclusion that an in-depth analysis using real-world events is necessary.

In this work, we bridge the gap between the two approaches by proposing the **COLD** (**Causal reasOning in closed Daily activities**) framework, based on the human understanding of real-world daily activities capturing commonsense (for example, "making coffee," "boarding an airplane," etc.), that adheres to causal theory literature. It is more natural to frame real-life reasoning-based queries via language; consequently, we follow the literature on Causal Commonsense Reasoning (CCR), which studies the relationships between real-world events (described via natural language).

CCR is a non-trivial task of estimating the cause-and-effect relationship between events that are studied under the umbrella of commonsense reasoning (Kuipers, 1984; Gordon et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023; Chun et al., 2023; Du et al., 2022). The events in CCR generally refer to actions taking place in an activity in the real world. For example, consider the activity of "traveling by an airplane" given in Fig. 1, where the occurrence of all the events is confounded by a universal variable \(\mathbf{U}\) ("intention to perform a task"). Moreover, there are a few events that cause one another. For example, the event "checking in luggage" (\(E_{1}\)) caused the occurrence of events like "waiting at the luggage belt" (\(E_{2}\)) after the flight, i.e., in an alternate universe where one does not checks in luggage and goes with the cabin bags, will never wait for their luggage after the flight has landed. Moreover, some of the events have no causal impact, like "find the boarding gate" (\(E_{3}\)) has no causal relationship with "checking in luggage" (\(E_{1}\)). More formally,

\[\Delta_{(E_{1}\to E_{2})} =\mathbb{P}(E_{2}|do(E_{1}))-\mathbb{P}(E_{2}|do(\neg E_{1}))\] (1) \[\Delta_{(E_{1}\to E_{3})} =\mathbb{P}(E_{3}|do(E_{1}))-\mathbb{P}(E_{3}|do(\neg E_{1}))\]

where \(do(.)\) denotes the **do** operator (Pearl, 2012) showing the intervention on \(E_{1}\), and \(\Delta\) is the _causal estimand_ capturing the causal strength between two events, i.e., \(\Delta(E_{1}\to E_{2})\) is expected to be higher when compared to \(\Delta(E_{1}\to E_{3})\). Note, CCR excludes the causal events that are beyond the reach of commonsense knowledge, for example, does "planting trees" have a direct impact on the "rainy season"? or does "providing free education" improve the "economic condition of the country/state"; does "carpooling" directly impact "air pollution", etc. A noteworthy point concerning causality is that though the logical temporal (or prototypical) order of these events provides a weak signal about causal relationships, temporal precedence does not always imply causation (SS2). For example, one could erroneously argue that "boarding a plane" is also the cause of "waiting at the luggage belt" since without "boarding a plane," one cannot wait for the luggage belt.

For building a causal reasoning framework (based on CCR) around real-life daily activities, one would require a few primary features readily available: 1) Clear distinction between the events, i.e., the events should encapsulate describing a particular step in an activity, 2) Causal Dependency between the variables/events, i.e., there should be some events causing other events to occur. 3) Causal independence of events with the rest of the world, i.e., the occurrence of events should be independent of events that are not part of the activity (i.e., the covariates are balanced out). We found that "_Scripts_"(Schank, 1975; Schank and Abelson, 1975) provide a concrete medium that satisfies all these requirements. Scripts are defined as a sequence of events describing a prototypical activity, such as going to a restaurant, and hence capture commonsense knowledge about the world. (Schank and Abelson, 1975; Modi et al., 2016; Wanzare et al., 2016; Ostermann et al., 2018; Modi, 2016, 2017; Modi et al., 2017; Modi and Titov, 2014). Moreover, different people have similar understandings of

Figure 1: \(\mathbf{U}\) denotes the unobserved variables, confounding all events present in a real-world activity. In an activity, some events cause other events to happen. For example, in _“traveling by an airplane”_, the event of _“check-in luggage”_ causes events like “taking back luggage.”

the activity in the form of scripts that inherently balance out the covariates present in the real world, i.e., all the activities have the same starting and ending point and account for common exogenous and endogenous variables, providing a suitable platform to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between the events. In other words, for an activity like "flying in an airplane," or "going grocery shopping" (also see Fig. 2, left) the events that happened before starting the activity and after completing the activity are marginalized out using a common understanding of these activities by different humans and hence will have no causal relations with any of the exogenous events during the activity. Creating a causal graph for script knowledge, i.e., establishing relationships between events taking place during the activity, provides a perfect platform for creating causal queries, thus providing a medium to establish CCR between events. In a nutshell, we make the following contributions:

* We propose **COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities)**, a CCR framework based on Script knowledge (daily activities involving commonsense) that provides a closed system to test the understanding of causal inference grounded in the real-world. The proposed framework adheres to SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) (Cox, 1958; Rubin, 1980) by design (SS3). **COLD** consists of activity-specific observational graphs (created via crowd-sourcing) and causal graphs. Further, **COLD** facilitates creating an enormous number of causal queries (e.g., \(2,887,950\) per activity) via causal query triplets from the causal graph. This comes close to the mini-Turing test (Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018), where the story becomes the understanding of the daily activity, and the sampled enormous causal queries help in the exhaustive and rigorous evaluation of LMs.
* We devise various design mechanisms for estimating causal strength analytically and show how the representations learned by language models can be validated.
* Via detailed experimentation on the widely used open-weight language models, including encoder-only models (RoBERTa-MNLI) and autoregressive models (gpt-neo-125M, gpt-neo-1.3B, gpt-neo-2.7B, phi-2, gpt-j-6B, Llama-2-7b-chat-hf, Mistral-7B-v0.1, gamma-7b, and Meta-Llama-3-8B) we estimate the causal reasoning capability of the learned representations. We release the framework, model code, and results via https://github.com/Exploration-Lab/COLD.

Figure 2: **Left:** the figure represents the closed nature of daily real-world activities (capturing commonsense, commonly understood by humans), start and end given the context of the task, i.e., the pre-activity world and post-activity world activities marginalize out the dependence of event occurring during the activity with the rest of the world. **Right:** Causal Graph for “going grocery shopping.” Notice the collider (red nodes) makes the independent set of nodes (highlighted in different colors) unconditionally independent in the causal graph. In contrast, when given a condition on a collider (“put bags in cart”, the two clusters (yellow and blue) become dependent (if collider is observed, both yellow and blue clusters may have been observed as well).

## 2 Background

**The Mini Turing Test** proposed by Pearl and Mackenzie (2018) is designed in a question-answering format to validate the understanding of causal knowledge about a simple story. The primary feature of a mini-Turing test is the enormous number of causal queries that can be framed using the underlying causal graph, which governs the occurrence of events in the story. Due to the enormous number of causal queries, passing the mini-Turing via memorization becomes combinatorially heavy, and hence, the authors argue that it can only be beaten if one has access to the underlying causal graph governing the occurrence of events (i.e., one has the ability to reason causally about the events). In this work, though, we only consider a more straightforward case of choice-based causal triplets; we realize the number of causal queries that can be created is enormous and helps validate the causal reasoning abilities coming close to the mini-Turing test.

_d-separation:_ Establishing the independence of variables becomes non-trivial when dealing with complex interactions among multiple variables. _d_-separation (Pearl, 1988) facilitates the determination of conditional independence between two sets of nodes \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\) in a graphical model \(\mathcal{G}\) given another set of nodes \(\mathbf{Z}\). _d_-separation asserts that \(\mathbf{X}\) and \(\mathbf{Y}\), given the set \(\mathbf{Z}\), are \(d\)-separated if all paths for every node in \(\mathbf{X}\) and every node in \(\mathbf{Y}\) are blocked by conditioning on \(\mathbf{Z}\), denoted as \(\mathbf{X}\rotatebox[origin={c}]{$\models$}_{\mathcal{G}}\mathbf{Y}\mid \mathbf{Z}\). A path \(p\) is blocked by a set of nodes \(\mathbf{Z}\)(Pearl et al., 2016), if and only if: 1) \(p\) contains a chain of nodes \(\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}\rightarrow\mathbf{C}\) or a fork \(\mathbf{A}\leftarrow\mathbf{B}\rightarrow\mathbf{C}\) such that the middle node \(\mathbf{B}\) is in \(\mathbf{Z}\) OR 2) \(p\) contains a collider \(\mathbf{A}\rightarrow\mathbf{B}\leftarrow\mathbf{C}\) such that the collision node \(\mathbf{B}\) or its descendant is not in \(\mathbf{Z}\).

**Backdoor Criterion:** A set of variables \(W\) satisfies the backdoor criterion relative to \(T\) and \(Y\) if the following are true:

1. [label=()]
2. \(W\) blocks all backdoor paths from \(T\) to \(Y\) i.e. blocking confounding or non-causation association paths
3. \(W\) doesn't contain any descendants of \(T\)

Then, \(W\) satisfies the backdoor criterion (Pearl et al., 2016; Neal, 2020). We make use of the backdoor criterion to estimate the causal estimand, capturing the relationship between the causal events. (Refer App. C for more detail)

## 3 COLD (Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities)

We propose **COLD** (**Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities**) framework for testing causal reasoning abilities of natural language understanding systems such as LLMs. Fig. 3 gives an overview of the creation process. We use crowd-sourced data of script knowledge to create observational

Figure 3: The proposed **COLD** framework for evaluating LLMs for causal reasoning. The human-written Event Sequence Descriptions (ESDs) are obtained from crowdsource workers and include a telegrammic-style sequence of events when performing an activity. The Observational Graph and the Causal Graph for an activity are used to create causal query triplets (details in Algorithm 1), shown towards the right. Using counterfactual reasoning, “going to the kitchen” is possible without going to the market (if the ingredients are already available), making “come home with the ingredients.” a more plausible effect among the given choices. Similarly, in the second example, the event “going to market” has no direct relation with the event “heating the oven”.

graphs which is further used along with manual intervention to create causal graphs. Subsequently, an algorithm is used to create an enormous number of causal queries (causal triplets), which are further used to test LLMs for causal reasoning. Next, we explain each of the steps in more detail.

**Task Formulation: COLD** is motivated by Causal Commonsense Reasoning (CCR), which we define as the task of finding the strength of the cause-and-effect relationship between two events (\(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\)) given in an activity \(a\in\mathcal{A}\), where \(\mathcal{A}\) is the set of all activities. For example, for an activity like "going in an airplane", the central question is to determine the causal relationship between two events that occur during the activity (events like "checking in luggage" and "waiting for luggage"). Since reasoning about a sequence of events is tedious (and sometimes confusing (Do et al., 2011)), researchers often rely on a more plausible cause rather than defining a definite causal event. For instance, COPA dataset (Gordon et al., 2012) provides a premise event and a corresponding causal query question along with two choices (see Table 1 for an example); a system is required to predict which of the two choices is most plausible cause/effect as required by the question.

**Creating a Closed Causal System**

Given the nature of Script knowledge (satisfying the criterion of balanced covariates, SS1), we use a script corpus called DeScript (Wanzare et al., 2016) for creating the observational graphs. DeScript is a corpus with a telegram-style sequential description of an activity in English (e.g., baking a cake, taking a bath, etc.). DeScript is created via crowd-sourcing. For a given activity, crowd-workers write a point-wise and sequential short description of various events involved in executing the activity (this one complete description is called an ESD (Event Sequence Description)). DeScript collects data for a set of 40 daily activities (100 ESDs each) varying in complexity and background knowledge. Additionally, for a given activity, semantically similar events from different ESDs are manually aligned by human annotators (for more details, refer to Wanzare et al. (2016)). These alignments were later used by Joshi et al. (2023, 2023) to create a DAG representing the overall activity. In our work, we use these DAGs as the observational distribution of an activity (\(\mathcal{G}_{o}^{(a)}\), where \(a\in\mathcal{A}\), where \(\mathcal{A}\) is the set of all activities). These DAGs provide a medium for generating enormous trajectories (scales from \(1.6e+16\) to \(1.3e+27\), also see Table 2), that are coming directly from human annotations (alignment as well as the ESDs), providing us a proxy to represent the understanding of daily activities.

**Observational Distribution** (\(\mathcal{G}_{o}\)): Note that the graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\), approximately represent (almost) all possible ways in which an ESD can be written for an activity, providing the true observational distribution, i.e., how the combinations of events will look like while performing the activity in the real world (see App. A.3 for examples).

**Causal Graphs (\(\mathcal{G}_{c}\)): To reason about the causal relationships between the events (nodes of \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\)), we would need the underlying causal graph that shows the cause of occurrence of various activities (directly or indirectly). We construct the causal graphs manually by reasoning about the independence of various events in the activity. Fig. 2 shows the pictorial representation of one of the created causal graphs for the activity "going grocery shopping." Notice that various sets of events in the graph create clusters, denoting independence between various events. For example, nodes related to make list cause the events that involve the presence of a list and do not cause events like going via car (as some of the population will not create a list for shopping). Similarly, the mode of transportation (car/bus/walk) is independent of the events performed inside the store.**

**Causal Query Triplets: The obtained Causal Graph (\(\mathcal{G}_{c}\)), for an activity provides a medium to reason about causal links between the events. Notice in Fig. 2, how the red nodes (colliders) help separate out the independent event clusters. For example, the nodes 'get list from car' and 'check list (if anything is left)' being colliders, separate out the making list-related events with the rest of the graph. Similarly, the node 'put bags in cart' separates out the 'take shop cart' and 'take bags'. Another interesting property represented in the obtained causal graph is the conditional dependence between various clusters. For example, the cluster related to 'get in car' is unconditionally independent of'make list'. However, if we condition on the collider ('get list from car'), they become dependent, i.e., if 'get list from car' is observed, it means that the person will have created the list as well as went by car for the grocery shopping (similarly for node 'put bags in cart'). \(d\)-separation (SS2) provides an easier way to establish conditional/unconditional independence between the set of nodes. For creating the dataset of causal queries (similar to other datasets like COPA (Gordon et al., 2012)), we need a triplet of three events (premise \(p\), Choice-1 \(c_{1}\), Choice-2 \(c_{2}\)) associated with a question about 'cause' or 'effect' relationship, i.e., given the premise which of the two choices is the cause/effect? (Table 1). We call these triplets _Causal Query_

two versions occurring and not occurring. SUTVA plays a vital role in causal inference by ensuring that each unit's treatment assignment has a consistent impact, facilitating the accurate estimation of treatment effects. Our framework closely adheres to SUTVA assumptions (details in A.1).

**Comparison with Other Causal Datasets:** We briefly compare the created dataset with the existing set of causal reasoning datasets in App. Table 5. The created dataset serves as a middle ground, having both real-world groundings as well as an underlying causal graph to create an exhaustive set of causal queries.

## 4 Experiments and Results

**COLD** provides a causal query dataset for evaluating LMs for causal understanding. In particular, we consider the "Causal Query Triplets" (Table 2) coming from compact trajectories as a base and sample the instance version coming from the same skeleton. Since it is not possible to evaluate all the possible causal queries that could be created using our framework, we use \(10K\) samples for each activity to report our findings. For a fair comparison between various models and better reproducibility, we freeze the sampled causal query triplets and compare the success rate over the frozen samples. We evaluate via two methods. First, as done in previous work Jin et al. (2024, 2023); Chen et al. (2024), we first experiment with various LLMs using a prompt-based evaluation scheme; second, we propose other mechanisms (based on causal theory, e.g., Average Treatment Effect) that could be used to perform an in-depth analysis of evaluating causal relationships between events.

**Causal Reasoning Evaluation of LLMs via Prompts:** We start with the prompt-based evaluation of recent open-weight LLMs (gpt-neo-125M, gpt-neo-1.3B, gpt-neo-2.7B (Black et al., 2021), gemma-2b (Team et al., 2024), phi-2 (Javaheripi et al., 2023), gpt-j-6B (Wang and Komatsuzaki, 2021), gamma-7b (Team et al., 2024), Llama-2-7b-chat-hf (Touvron et al., 2023), Mistral-7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023), and Meta-Llama-3-8B (Dubey et al., 2024)) We frame the prompt as a multi-choice question-answering (MCQA) objective (Robinson and Wingate, 2023). The prompt is intentionally structured so that the LLM is intended to predict a single choice token (Such as "A", "B", etc.). Robinson and Wingate (2023) highlight the advantages of MCQA-based evaluation over cloze evaluation (Brown et al., 2020)(where the LLMs are expected to generate the entire answer in a cloze test), leading to a significant boost in various tasks, including commonsense-based tasks. App. E, Fig. 5 presents various prompt templates for autoregressive experiments, and App. E Fig. 6 shows a few qualitative examples for the framed causal query templates. Table 3 shows the success rate obtained for various LLMs. The success rate corresponds to the percentage of queries where the LLM predicts the desired choice. We observe that reasoning causally about simple daily activities is challenging when a rigorous test is framed, validating the dependencies between the events. Overall, for the more common activities like baking a cake and going grocery shopping, the LLMs perform better when compared to activities like boarding a bus or planting a tree. We also experimented with another version of the dataset, where incorrect choice may correspond to temporally plausible but causally implausible events. The results drop significantly in this case; details and results are provided in the App. F.1.

**Evaluation using Average Treatment Effect (ATE) (\(\Delta\)):** Computing the Average Treatment Effect (\(\Delta\)) helps establish the strength of causal links given a context (Eq. 1). In our setup, to estimate

\(P(y|do(x))\) (i.e., the causal estimand) from statistical estimands (obtained from observational distribution), we make certain reasonable assumptions about the underlying process that governs the relation among variables/events and then utilize the implications of these assumptions. For any activity taking place, the causal relationships between two events \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) may have a causal link along with a non-causal link through a set of confounders \(z\). We define the confounder \(z=\{t_{i}|t_{i}\in\mathcal{T}\}\), where \(\mathcal{T}\) denotes all the trajectories (sequence of events) from the start of the activity till the event \(E_{1}\). The temporal nature of events makes this assumption suitable since the occurrence of \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) can be confounded by all the events preceding \(E_{1}\). Note the possibility of unobserved confounders (events that are not explicitly mentioned but may be affecting the mentioned events) in our case is removed due to two reasons: 1) Keeping a closed system representation with a large number of diverse scripts (written by humans) helps cover the set of most generic and diverse events either implicitly or explicitly as a part of the activity, and 2) The causal reasoning goal is restricted to figuring out the causal effect between the events that are present explicitly. Assuming the unmentioned events have insignificant effects, we can establish that there will not be any unobserved confounders. This assumption makes the observed confounders satisfy the backdoor criterion (Pearl, 1993) that make sufficient adjustment sets. By using the backdoor criterion (App. C), the interventional distributions are estimated as follows:

\[P(E_{2}|do(E_{1}))=\sum_{t_{i}\in\mathcal{T}}p_{*}(E_{2}|E_{1},z=t_{i})p_{*}(z =t_{i})\] (2)

Note that the true observational distribution, i.e. \(p_{*}(E_{2}|E_{1},z)\) and \(p_{*}(z)\) both are unknown and have to be approximated (\(\hat{p}(E_{2}|E_{1},z)\) and \(\hat{p}(z)\)). Further, we describe ways \(\hat{p}\) can be estimated via multiple design mechanisms. Due to space limitation, we only describe the \(\hat{p}\) estimation via language models below and move the statistical analysis using the original trajectories and observational graphs to the App. D.2.

**ATE using Language Models** Since pre-trained LMs capture world knowledge (Devlin et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Li et al., 2023; Nanda et al., 2023; Karvonen, 2024), these provide a suitable proxy for establishing relationships between these events. For our experiments, we consider a simple reasoning capability of language models, i.e., to reason about the temporal order of various events, i.e., given an event, what is the likelihood of the occurrence of another event? We further ask if this can be used to estimate the causal relationship between the events (a similar strategy is used by Zhang et al. (2022) for zero-shot causal estimation). It is worth noting that for these activities about daily activities, one way to find causes is to establish the temporal likelihood of the events. For each of the multiple language models, we frame the temporal prediction differently.

**Encoder-only Models:** For BERT-based models trained for mask token prediction, we model the temporal prediction using the probability assigned to the mask tokens "_before_" and "_after_" (Zhang et al., 2022). Given two events \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), the temporal link is predicted using a prompt like \(E_{1}\) <mask> \(E_{2}\), and the scores corresponding to the before and after tokens are collected. App. D, Fig. 7, the top row highlights the prompt template used for BERT-based models. For encoder-only experiments, we consider RoBERTa MNLI (Liu et al., 2019).

**Decoder-only Models:** For other language models that are autoregressive in nature, we modify the prompt to predict the temporal order as the last token. We again use the MCQA-based prompting style to frame the temporal order query by providing "_before_" and "_after_" as the options in the prompt. App. D, Fig. 7, the bottom row highlights the prompt template used for Decoder-only Models.

**Interventions:** We utilize the SUTVA assumption in the proposed framework to devise an intervention over a trajectory in natural language form. App. D, Fig. 8 shows the style of intervention made by an event (\(E_{1}\)) taking place (\(do(E_{1})\)) or not taking place \(do(\neg E_{1})\).

Given the above strategies, LMs can be used to evaluate \(\hat{p}(E_{2}|\neg E_{1},z=t)\), by feeding the prompt that contains \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) and the \(z=t)\) and predict the temporal nature between \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\), given a trajectory \(z=t\). Further, applying the backdoor criterion for multiple trajectories \(\mathcal{T}\), we obtain

\[\begin{split} p_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{2}|do(E_{1}))&= \frac{1}{|\mathcal{T}|}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}}\hat{p}(E_{2}|E_{1},z=t)\\ p_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{2}|do(\neg E_{1}))&=\frac{1}{| \mathcal{T}|}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T}}\hat{p}(E_{2}|\neg E_{1},z=t)\end{split}\] (3)which can further be used to estimate the causal strength between the events \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\).

\[\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}=p_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{2}|do(E_{1}))-p_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{2}|do( \neg E_{1}))\]

Using the multiple \(\Delta\) estimates defined above, we estimate the causal strength between the events available for an activity. We follow the scheme presented in the App. B, Algorithm 2 to compute the performance in terms of success rates.

**Temporal Scheme:** In this scheme, we validate if temporal ordering knowledge of LLMs could be directly used to estimate the causal estimand. We make use of templates shown in the App. Fig. 7. The causal estimand is estimated via the difference in logit values when intervening over an event, i.e., does the predicted probability take into account the context of events not happening? Surprisingly, we found that temporal ordering does provide a suitable proxy for estimating causal strength between the events. We further extend this approximation to incorporate the backdoor adjustments in the \(\Delta\).

**Backdoor Adjustments:** For the experiments with Language models, we apply the backdoor adjustment to estimate the causal estimand \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\). App. Fig. 8 shows the prompt template used to determine the relationship between the events. The prompt template takes a trajectory, \(t_{i}\), that contains all the events till the event \(E_{1}\) in sequential order of occurrence, further, an added prompt determines the intervention (\(do(E_{1})\) or \(do(\neg E_{1})\)) and the causal estimand is estimated using the logit values associated with the predicted token. App. B, Algorithm 3 provides the designed scheme to compute unbiased causal estimands. We essentially flip the options and generate the scores associated with options 'A' and 'B' for increase and decrease, respectively (more details in the App. C.)

Table 4 shows a comparison between various design choices. We observe that when using LLMs for \(\hat{p}\) estimation, the backdoor adjustment increases the performance over the temporal estimation scheme by a significant margin. The understanding of these activities is generic, and LLMs do provide a suitable set of sequences when prompted to generate a list of steps to complete the activity. For example, when prompted with 'Generate the sequential steps in a telegrammic style to perform the activity "going grocery shopping"', almost all the models we tested provide

a valid set of steps for the given activity. However, when prompted with causal queries, the lower performance signifies the lack of understanding of the underlying causal mechanism. The constructed dataset helps to rigorously validate the understanding of the activity through an enormous number of causal query triplets. The results show that although the LLMs can explain the activity in detail, including generating correct steps for performing tasks, causally reasoning about the set of events remains challenging.

**Human Study:** We conducted a small-scale human validation study over the created causal query dataset and asked 5 graduate students to answer 100 randomly sampled causal query triplets (20 per activity). We record an average performance of 92.20%. (More details about the human study are provided in the App. B)

## 5 Related Work

Causal reasoning has been an active research area in the ML community (Spirtes et al., 2000a; Peters et al., 2017; Scholkopf et al., 2021). Some of the initial works highlight the causal nature of events present in text (Schank, 1975) as _'causal chains'_. Multiple works have considered creating benchmarks/datasets that capture causal relationships between the events described in the text (see App. Table 5). More recently, with the rapid growth of LLMs on reasoning/understanding tasks, attention has shifted to validating these general-purpose models capturing causal reasoning (Jin et al., 2023; Zecevic et al., 2023; Willig et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Willig et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2022; Jin et al., 2024). App. A.2 Table 5 shows a broad overview of the existing causal Dataset/Benchmarks presented in the NLP community. In this work, the primary focus is to bridge the gap between various lines of work that consider natural language to learn/validate/reason about causal relationships between events.

## 6 Limitations and Future Directions

One of the primary limitations of our work is the limited set of activities. Though the frameworks support generating exhaustive/enormous causal queries, finding general commonsense reasoning activities/tasks that are well understood by humans remains challenging. Moreover, creating a causal graph for an activity increases as we move toward more long-term tasks. However, as a general test of causal intelligence, our framework provides a suitable platform to validate the reasoning capabilities more rigorously. In the future, it would be interesting to sample trajectories from the observational distribution \(\mathcal{G}^{a}_{o}\) to create a training dataset and check if causal reasoning ability can be acquired by language modeling objectives (including other variants like presented in Lampinen et al. (2023)). We leave this detailed analysis for future endeavors. The proposed algorithm for causal triplet generation generates the simplest variant of causal queries in the form of causal triplets (also referred to as Pairwise Causal Discovery (PCD) task by (Chen et al., 2024)). More complicated causal queries can be generated, such as considering cases with common confounders, long/short causal chain dependency, etc. Moreover, taking formal definitions. (i.e., using the formal causal inference language) causal queries inspired from Jin et al. (2023, 2024) can be framed for a more rigorous analysis. Being at the initial state, we stick to the simple causal queries that provide two choices, and the task is to choose the more plausible cause. The creation of underlying causal graphs provides endless possibilities for creating varied versions of causal queries. In this work, we only consider an unconditional version of _d_-separation. In the future, the same causal graphs could be used to define more datasets for covering other rungs of the _'causal ladder'_(Pearl and Mackenzie, 2018).

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed the **COLD** (**Causal reasOning in cLosed Daily activities**) framework for generating causal queries that can be used to rigorously evaluate LLMs. We performed extensive experimentation with LLMs for the task of Causal Commonsense Reasoning. Results indicate that LLMs are still far from a complete understanding of daily commonsensical activities and fail to answer causal queries when analyzed in an exhaustive manner. We believe this framework will provide a good platform for future research in understanding the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs.

COLD Framework Details

The **COLD** framework consists of Observational Distributions represented in the form of DAGs (\(\mathcal{G}_{o}\)) along with the corresponding causal graphs (\(\mathcal{G}_{c}\)) governing the dependency of occurrence between the events. Table 2 highlights the total number of causal queries that can be created using the framework. Table 1 shows a qualitative comparison with the COPA dataset Gordon et al. (2012) and the triplet samples coming from the **COLD** framework.

### Adherence to SUTVA

In causal literature, a fundamentally acknowledged _Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption_ (SUTVA) (Cox, 1958; Rubin, 1980) requires that for each unit (e.g., sequence of events), there is only one version of the non-treatment, i.e., for an event in the sequence, there lie only two versions occurring and not occurring. SUTVA plays a vital role in causal inference by ensuring that each unit's treatment assignment has a consistent impact, facilitating the accurate estimation of treatment effects. Although, in the past, researchers have created various datasets that capture the causal relationship between real-world events (Gordon et al., 2012; Du et al., 2022), the problem of achieving the SUTVA assumption has remained challenging. For example, given events (taken from the COPA dataset (Gordon et al., 2012)) \(E_{1}\): "The teacher assigned homework to students" and \(E_{2}\): "The students groaned," it becomes challenging to define \(\neg E_{1}\) since there are enormous possibilities that may have occurred at the same time (in place of \(E_{1}\)) that negates \(E_{1}\), making it difficult to define an event of not having done something. Recent work by Zhang et al. (2022), proposes to use multiple alterations of events for capturing \(\neg E_{1}\), violating the SUTVA assumption. In this work, we highlight that if we define a closed system, capturing a commonsense activity, it facilitates adherence to SUTVA assumptions as closely as possible. For example, in the activity of "going via an airplane," one would have either "checked-in the luggage" (\(E_{1}\)) or "skipped checking-in luggage" due to smaller bags (\(\neg E_{1}\)). Moreover, developing a causal setup with observations has always been a challenging problem in the wild and often requires few assumptions, as the strong causal link can only be established in an ideal world where randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are feasible. In our framework, adhering to SUTVA comes naturally where, in a trajectory, an occurrence of an event can be intervened to obtain an alternate trajectory, reaching an ideal setup facilitating causal reasoning in daily commonsensical activities.

### Comparison with previous Causal Reasoning Datasets/Benchmarks

Table 5 shows a broad overview of the existing causal Dataset/Benchmarks presented in the NLP community. We find that most of the existing set of work relies on real-world events to reason about causality in NLP, where human annotators are asked to reason causally between the nature of events. However, most of these datasets/benchmarks try to establish a connection using a simple question prompt, which may not be enough to construct the underlying causal graph. Moreover, most of the real-world grounding-based methods remain open-ended due to the events taking place in the wild, making it difficult to consider constructing a causal graph where multiple variables play a role. More recently, with increased research attention on the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs, researchers have tried framing causal queries based on a causal inference engine, requiring the underlying causal graphs. However, when constructing causal queries from prompting LLMs, natural language is used to verbalize the causal concepts in the form of symbolic variables that may not have a real-world grounding.2 Moreover, the created causal queries are difficult for a human with little or no knowledge of causal inference concepts.3 Table 5 shows a comparison of all these features in detail, where **COLD** satisfies all the features.

Footnote 3: https://huggingface.co/datasets/causalnlp/CLadder

We realize this is a first-of-its-kind framework built over real-world events and contains the underlying causal graph. Having both the Observational Distribution (representing the enormous event sequences present in daily activity) and the manually created underlying causal graph helps facilitate an in-depth analysis of the causal reasoning abilities of LLMs. Moreover, the same framework can further be extended in various ways: 1) Extending the number of activities: In the current version of the framework, we only consider 5 daily activities to provide an in-depth analysis. In the future, those can be extended to incorporate more such activities. 2) Extending the scope of activities: The tasksused in the activities are generic and capture commonsense; for validating domain-specific causal reasoning abilities, the framework could be extended to domain activities, for example, cooking a specific recipe where adding different ingredients causes a variation in taste. 3) Extending the type of causal queries: while constructing the causal queries, we considered the simplest task of finding the more plausible cause/effect given two options as events, keeping only unconditional \(d-\)separation as the primary condition. The framework can directly be extended, keeping causal queries inspired from Jin et al. (2023, 2024).

On the analysis front, we realize that the possibilities of an in-depth analysis increase by a significant margin. In this work, we shed light on a few mechanisms for validating causal reasoning abilities via zero-shot CCR (compared to previous works that rely on training and further testing on similar datasets). We specifically focused on open-weight models for better applicability in the future and proposed a few mechanisms for estimating the causal relationships between the events. This opens up several possible avenues for an in-depth analysis of LLMs.

### Observational Graphs

Fig. 9, Fig. 10, Fig. 11, Fig. 12, and Fig. 13 shows the _"observational graphs"_ for the activity \(\mathsf{Baking}\) a \(\mathsf{Cake}\), \(\mathsf{Going}\)\(\mathsf{Grocery}\)\(\mathsf{Shopping}\), \(\mathsf{Going}\)\(\mathsf{on}\)\(\mathsf{a}\)\(\mathsf{Train}\), \(\mathsf{Planting}\)\(\mathsf{a}\)\(\mathsf{Tree}\), and \(\mathsf{Riding}\)\(\mathsf{on}\)\(\mathsf{a}\)\(\mathsf{Bus}\) respectively.

## Appendix B Algorithms in the COLD Framework

In this section, we provide insights into the Algorithms used in the **COLD** framework. We start with Algorithm 1, which creates causal query triplets given the observational graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\) and along with the Causal Graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\).

**Remark:** Temporal precedence is generally assumed essential for defining causation, and it is one of the most important clues that is used to distinguish causal from other types of associations (Mill, 1898; Hill, 1965; Pearl and Verma, 1995). For our framework, we also consider the topologically sorted order obtained from the observational graphs and use the temporal order to define the causal query triplets, i.e., the cause events will always precede the effect events.

**Creating Causal Query Triplets:** The Algorithm 1 is designed to sample all the possible causal query triplets to construct a dataset for validating causal reasoning ability over an activity. Provided the observational graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\) and the Causal Graphs \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) for an activity, we first sample all the possible node triplets in the graph. Later, we iterate over the set of triplets and check if one of the nodes in

Table 5: **Comparison of causal experimental settings used in prior LLM evaluation benchmarks. The real-world grounding plays a crucial role in evaluating LLMs, which is not present in the symbolic benchmarks.**the triplet \((n_{i},n_{j},n_{k})\) is _d_-separated. Further, the _d_-separated node becomes the wrong choice. The remaining two events become premise and correct choices, depending on their temporal order. For example, if \(n_{i}\) is the node that is _d_-separated from \(n_{j}\) and \(n_{k}\), we check if \(n_{j}\) and \(n_{k}\) have a causal link between them in \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\). If \(n_{j}\) and \(n_{k}\) are found to have a causal link, we create two triplets using the temporal ordering between \(n_{j}\) and \(n_{k}\). The temporal link \(n_{j}\to n_{k}\) leads to an 'effect' query where \(n_{j}\) becomes 'premise' and \(n_{k}\) becomes 'correct choice,' and a 'cause' query where \(n_{j}\) becomes 'correct choice' and \(n_{k}\) becomes the 'premise.' Note in Algorithm 1 [Store tuple], we only show one such instance for brevity; the implementation will consist of another mirror instance (i.e., for every [Store tuple] both 'cause' and 'effect' question triplets are stored to the dataset).

The understanding of these activities is generic, and LLMs do provide a suitable set of sequences when prompted to generate a list of steps to complete the activity. The constructed dataset helps to rigorously validate the understanding of the activity through an enormous number of causal query triplets. The results show that although the LLMs can explain the activity in detail, including generating correct steps for performing tasks, causally reasoning about the set of events remains challenging.

Human validation:To get a rough estimate of the human performance on the created causal reasoning queries, we also perform a small-scale human study, where the annotators are given a set of randomly chosen 100 causal queries. The human subjects were graduate students of computer science who were given a brief tutorial about counterfactual reasoning. Table 6 shows the obtained results. We would like to mention that validating human performance is challenging due to the nature of the causal reasoning task. The nature of counterfactual reasoning requires the human/algorithm to assume a similar alternate world/universe with only a particular happening or not happening to approximate the causal strength between the events. These imaginations can be expressed in statements as highlighted by Pearl and Mackenzie (2018); Pearl et al. (2016), containing an "if" statement in which the "if" portion is untrue or unrealized (aka counterfactual). The "if" portion of a counterfactual is called the hypothetical condition, or more often, the antecedent, making it challenging (cognitively heavy) to conduct a human evaluation. Please note that the study is performed using only a small sample of 100 causal query triplets out of thousands of queries, and the presented results only provide a rough estimate that may not generalize for a larger number of queries. Hence, a comparison of human study results and LLMs is not fair, and the presented human performance estimates may not be true representative of the entire population. Interactions with human subjects also revealed that they tend to confuse temporality and causality (similar findings were reported by Do et al. (2011)).

Evaluating over Causal Query Triplets:Algorithm 2 makes use of the causal estimands \(\Delta\) to compare the causal strength between the premise event and the choice events. We consider the causal estimand computed between the premise and the available set of choices and predict the label corresponding to the high \(\Delta\) values. For a given causal query from the created causal query triplet dataset \(\mathcal{D}\), where each data entry \(\mathcal{D}_{i}\) corresponds to \((p,c_{1},c_{2},q,l)\), i.e., premise event, choice 1, choice 2, question and the label respectively. As the task is to predict the more plausible cause/effect of the given premise event, we create two event pairs, \((p,c_{1})\) and \((p,c_{2})\), and compute the causal estimand \(\Delta\) for both the pairs using the temporal or the backdoor scheme (described below in Algorithm 3). Note that the order of events given to \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\) is in \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) format, i.e. \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2})\). Using the temporal precedence (highlighted as remark above), the cause event will always precede the effect event temporally. Hence, for a causal query with the question as 'cause', the causal estimand is estimated as \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(c_{1}^{i},p^{i})\), \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(c_{2}^{i},p^{i})\) and \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(p^{i},c_{1}^{i})\), \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}(p^{i},c_{2}^{i})\) when the question is 'effect.' Further, based on the estimated \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\) scores, the more plausible cause/effect is predicted.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Human Annotators & **cake** & **shopping** & **train** & **tree** & **bus** & Average \\ \hline Subject 1 & 95 & 95 & 90 & 100 & 90 & 94 \\ Subject 2 & 100 & 100 & 90 & 95 & 90 & 95 \\ Subject 3 & 100 & 100 & 85 & 85 & 70 & 88 \\ Subject 4 & 100 & 100 & 95 & 90 & 85 & 94 \\ Subject 5 & 100 & 85 & 95 & 90 & 80 & 90 \\ \hline Average & 99.00 & 96.00 & 91.00 & 92.00 & 83.00 & **92.20** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: **Human validation done for a small sample of 100 causal query triplets. Overall we find that humans do perform well in causal reasoning about these daily activities.**

**Computing \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\):** Algorithm 3 depicts the process of computing an unbiased estimate for the causal estimand. The causal strength is computed between two events \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) where \(E_{1}\) is assumed to be preceding \(E_{2}\) temporally. To make an unbiased estimate based on the provided options, we consider normalizing the obtained probability scores by flipping the options and providing the same query prompt to the Language Model.

\[f_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2},\phi)\leftarrow\frac{s_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2}, \phi)+s_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2},\phi_{f})}{s_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2},\phi )+s_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2},\phi_{f})+\tilde{s}_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2}, \phi)+\tilde{s}_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{1},E_{2},\phi_{f})},\]

where \(\phi\) denotes the prompt template as shown in Figure 8 (top) and \(\phi_{f}\) denotes the same prompt with flipped options, Figure 8 (bottom). The overall equation helps normalize the prediction probabilities of the 'Increase' option by using the probabilities of the 'Decrease' option. Finally, these normalized scores are computed for multiple trajectories \(t_{i}\) in the backdoor adjustment scheme to compute the causal estimands \(p_{\mathcal{M}}(E2\mid do(E_{1}))\) and \(p_{\mathcal{M}}(E2\mid do(\neg E_{1}))\) that help estimate the causal strength \(\Delta_{\mathcal{M}}\) between the events \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\).

## Appendix C Backdoor Adjustments

A set of variables \(W\) satisfies the backdoor criterion relative to \(T\) and \(Y\) if the following are true

1. \(W\) blocks all backdoor paths from \(T\) to \(Y\) i.e. blocking confounding or non-causation association paths
2. \(W\) doesn't contain any descendants of \(T\)

Figure 4: Causal Graphical Model of Events. \(E_{1}\) temporally precedes \(E_{2}\), and \(z\) is trajectory variable, which assumes a values \(t\) where \(t\in\) All trajectories from start to \(E_{1}\)Then, \(W\) satisfies the backdoor criterion (Pearl et al., 2016; Neal, 2020).

Adhering to the above conditions of the backdoor criterion, it is reasonable to assume that the trajectory \(t\) (temporally ordered sequence of events) till \(E_{1}\) will contain the events that confound the event \(E_{1}\) and event \(E_{2}\) (condition A). Every event trajectory till \(E_{1}\) will temporally precede \(E_{1}\)(condition B). Hence, the trajectory variable will satisfy backdoor criteria in the proposed closed system. The domain of the trajectory variable is a set of all trajectories till \(E_{1}\). Therefore, conditioning on \(t\) closes all paths that induce non-causal associations. The generic representation of an approximate causal graphical model involving \(E_{1},E_{2}\), and \(t\) is shown in Figure 4, and can be formulated as:

\[p_{\mathcal{M}}(E_{2}|do(E_{1}))=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{T}|}\sum_{t\in\mathcal{T} }\dot{p}(E_{2}|E_{1},z=t)\]

Where \(\mathcal{T}\) is a set of all trajectories from the start of the activity till the event \(E_{1}\)(excluding \(E_{1}\)).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

For estimating the probability \(\hat{p}(E_{2}|\neg E_{1},z=t_{i})\), we make use of the observational graph by considering all the parent nodes of \(E_{1}\) and compute the probability of reaching \(E_{2}\) from the parent (i.e., last event of trajectory \(t_{i}\)) avoiding the occurrence of \(E_{1}\).

\[\hat{p}(E_{2}|\neg E_{1},z=t_{i})=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}t\in\mathcal{T}_{ij} \\ E_{1}\notin t\end{subarray}}\prod_{l,m\in t}T(e_{l}\to e_{m})\] (6)

also, \(p(z=t_{i})\) can be computed as product of each transition in \(t_{i}\), i.e

\[p(z=t_{i})=\prod_{ij}T(e_{i}\to e_{j})\] (7)

Computations from Equations 5, 6, and 7 are used in the backdoor adjustment defined in Equation 2 for estimating the interventional likelihood of occurrence of \(E_{2}\) under each treatment (\(E_{1}\) and \(\neg E_{1}\)) and causal risk difference (\(\Delta\)). Note depending on the choice of transition function (\(T_{n}\) or \(T_{t}\)), we obtain two deltas \(\Delta_{n}\) and \(\Delta_{t}\), respectively.

## Appendix E Prompt Templates for Language Model based Experiments

We present the various prompt templates used to estimate the temporal link between the events in Figure 7. For BERT-based models, we use the MLM-trained models for predicting the masked token given a sentence (Previously, a similar approach was adopted by Zhang et al. (2022)). In contrast, for autoregressive models, we frame the prompt as a question-answer objective, taking inspiration from Robinson and Wingate (2023), where a multiple-choice-based question is framed to predict the answer in the form of the option IDs. The prompt is intentionally structured so that the LLM is intended to predict a single token (Such as "A", "B", etc.). Robinson and Wingate (2023) highlights the advantages of MCQA-based evaluation over cloze evaluation (where the LLMs are expected to generate the entire answer in a cloze test), leading to a significant boost in various tasks, including commonsense-based tasks.

For our prompt-based evaluation experiments over the generated causal triplets, we follow the same MCQA-based strategy and frame the prompts accordingly for a fair evaluation. Figure 5 presents various prompt templates for autoregressive experiments, and Figure 6 shows a few qualitative examples for the framed causal query templates.

Figure 5: Input prompt formats for the MCQA-based evaluation of autoregressive open-weight models (e.g., llama(-2), GPT-J, etc.). The black text is the templated input. The orange text is the input from the created causal query triplets, where the activity name denotes the description of the activity like baking a cake. The next-token prediction probabilities of the option IDs at the red text is used as the observed prediction distribution.

Figure 7: Input prompt formats for the \(\Delta\) estimation via Language models. The first row shows the prompt template used for BERT-based language models, where the mask token is predicted. The second row shows the template for autoregressive open-weight models (e.g., llama(-2), GPT-J, etc.). The black text is the templated input. The orange text is the input from the created causal query triplets, where the first event text and second event text comes from the premise and available set of choices. The mask-token prediction probabilities of ‘before’ and ‘after’ and next-token prediction probabilities of the option IDs at the red text are used as the observed prediction distribution for BERT-based and GPT-based open-weight models.

Figure 8: Input prompt formats for computing the causal estimand using the autoregressive open-weight models (using backdoor criterion) (e.g., llama(-2), GPT-J, etc.). The black text is the templated input. The orange text is the input from the created causal query triplets, where the activity name denotes the description of the activity like baking a cake. The trajectory \(\mathcal{T}_{i}\) is obtained using the observational graph \(\mathcal{G}_{o}\) and contains the sequence of events before the event \(E_{1}\). The next-token prediction probabilities of the option IDs at the red text is used as the observed prediction distribution. The flipped options variants of the prompts contain the same query with flipped options (i.e., the option ‘Increase’ becomes ‘Decrease’ and vice versa). This is done to make the causal estimand unbiased towards the predicted option token as highlighted in Algorithm 3.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details about the main claims in the Abstract and Introduction (Section 1). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide a separate section on Limitations (Sections 6) Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not have any theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details in Section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details in the Introduction. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: As discussed in Section 4, we only perform evaluation on pre-trained models and do not train/fine-tune any new model. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: As discussed in Section 4, we only perform evaluation on pre-trained models and do not train/fine-tune any new model. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix Section D.1 provides details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we read the code of ethics and follow these. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: To the best of our knowledge the research proposed in the paper does not have any negative social impact. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable for our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have used only open-source resources and cited relevant owners of the various resources, tools and models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not create any new asset. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not perform any human experiments. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable in our case. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
