###### Abstract

Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that allows multiple FL participants (FL-PTs) to collaborate on training models without sharing private data. Due to data heterogeneity, negative transfer may occur in the FL training process. This necessitates FL-PT selection based on their data complementarity. In cross-silo FL, organizations that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest, and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. This requires the desirable FL-PT selection strategy to simultaneously mitigate the problems of free riders and conflicts of interest among competitors. To this end, we propose an optimal FL collaboration formation strategy -FedEgoists- which ensures that: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from FL if and only if it benefits the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors or their supporters. It provides an efficient clustering solution to group FL-PTs into coalitions, ensuring that within each coalition, FL-PTs share the same interest. We theoretically prove that the FL-PT coalitions formed are optimal since no coalitions can collaborate together to improve the utility of any of their members. Extensive experiments on widely adopted benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FedEgoists compared to nine state-of-the-art baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.

## 1 Introduction

Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm of distributed machine learning (ML) as it does not require sharing raw data between FL participants (FL-PTs), thereby upholding the privacy considerations [10, 12, 54, 55, 56]. In the popular Federated Averaging (FedAvg) framework, multiple FL-PTs train a shared model locally with their own datasets, and upload their local model updates to a central server (CS), which then aggregates these model updates and distributes the resulting global model to each FL-PT [32]. There are two types of FL [20]. In _cross-device FL_, FL-PTs are end-user devices such as smartphones or IoT devices, and CS is the final owner of the trained model. In _cross-silo FL_, FL-PTs are companies or organizations in private or public sectors and are the final owners/users of the trained model, while the CS has the authority to coordinate the FL training process.

We consider in this paper the scenario of cross-silo FL where organizations in the business sector that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs [16]. The business sector is part of the private sector made up by companies and includes business that operate for profit; it is a key driver of technological innovation. The application of FL in the business sector has been studied in diverse domains, including digital banking, ridesharing, recommender systems, and Electric Vehicle charging services [28; 29; 39; 47; 53]. Regional banks have different user groups from their respective regions and are independent [54], while the banks in the same region can compete for users [31]. Recently, a FL platform, MELLODDY, has been developed for drug discovery, including multiple companies from business sectors [35]. Generally, competition exists when there are multiple organizations that are in the same market area and hope to unlock the power of FL [16; 45].

From a FL-PT's perspective, the scenario under study has two features: (i) self-interest and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. In business sectors, individuals are self-interested. This magnifies the free-riding problem where some FL-PTs benefit from the contributions of others without making any contribution to the FL ecosystem [20; 22]. Competition signifies that there is a potential conflict of interest between some two FL-PTs. Thus, two principles can simultaneously be used to meet the individual's needs: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from the FL ecosystem if and only if it can benefit the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors as well as the allies of its competitors [42]. The first principle is proposed and formulated in this paper for the first time, while the second principle has previously been considered for other scenarios [42]. From a FL manager's perspective, its priority is to regulate the FL ecosystem to meet the requirements of its customers (i.e., FL-PTs).

This paper studies cross-silo FL in business sectors where there are typically a limited number of FL-PTs (e.g., 2 to 100) [16; 27]. We consider both self-interest and competition for the first time in literature, although it has been well recognized that the free riding problem can be especially serious when self-interested FL-PTs engage in business competition [17; 41]. Since competition and self-interest are considered, all FL-PTs are partitioned into disjoint groups/coalitions, each with the common interest. The competition and benefit relationships among FL-PTs can be described as graphs. We use theoretical tools from graph theory and propose an efficient solution FedEgoists that can well satisfy the two principles above. Meanwhile, FedEgoists can help FL-PTs achieve the best possible ML model performances, i.e., subject to the two principles, the coalitions that FedEgoists finds are optimal in the sense that one coalition cannot increase the utility of any of its members by collaborating with any other coalitions. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to nine baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silo FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities. The main motivation and results of this paper are illustrated in Figure 1.

## 2 Related Work

The existing FL works consider the following three lines of works separately and don't address the self-interest and competition features simultaneously.

Figure 1: An overview of the main motivation and results of this paper.

**Competition.** Collaboration between competing companies is an important research area in business studies [3; 11]. Recently, there has been a growing interest in the study of competition in cross-silo FL where a key application area is the business sector. There are two cases. _In the first case_, all FL-PTs are assumed to offer the same service in the same market area and compete against each other. Several works attempt to reduce the potential side effect after FL-PTs join a fully competitive FL ecosystem. Wu and Yu [50] aim to maintain a negligible change in market share [51; 52] and analyze the achievability of this objective. Tsoy and Konstantinov [45] and Huang et al. [16] study the profitability of FL-PTs, but are taken under different assumptions on the source of extra profit brought by FL. Specifically, Tsoy and Konstantinov [45] assume that: (i) each consumer allocates a fixed budget to multiple services from different markets, and (ii) if a FL-PT owns a better model, the consumer will thus allocate more of its budget to consume its service due to the improved service quality. Huang et al. [16] consider duopoly business competition and assume that, if the model-related service can be improved by FL, customers will have a willingness to pay more and FL-PTs thus have opportunities to increase their profits. _In the second case_, not all FL-PTs compete against each other, like one assumption in this paper, where some FL-PTs come from different market areas. Tan et al. [42] study how to avoid the conflicts of interest among FL-PTs for the first time and give a heuristic to realize Principle 2. However, Tan et al. [42] don't consider the self-interest feature of cross-silo FL in the business sector and cannot guarantee the optimal collaboration among independent coalitions without competition. The collaboration relationships among FL-PTs result in a collaboration graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\). In their heuristic, FL-PTs are considered one by one and \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\) is thus constructed gradually to guarantee that for each FL-PT, there is no path that can be reachable to or from its competitors. In this paper, we apply the concepts of cliques and strongly connected components in graph theory to satisfy the self-interest and competition features and further optimize the proposed algorithm.

**Free-riding.** Karimireddy et al. [22] show that a naive scheme can lead to catastrophic levels of free-riding where the benefits of data sharing are completely eroded. By contract theory, they introduce accuracy shaping based mechanisms to prevent free-riding.

**Coalitions.** A coalition is a cooperative relationship formed among different individuals due to certain interests. Each agent is only concerned with the contributions of other agents within the same coalition [1]. Prior studies mainly focus on alleviating the side effect of data heterogeneity by allocating proper collaborators with data complementarity to each FL-PT. Donahue and Kleinberg [9] provide an analytical understanding of what partition of FL-PTs leads to a core-stable coalition structure for mean estimation and linear regression. Cui et al. [5] propose a heuristic algorithm to compute the core-stable coalition structure for general learning tasks. To some extent, the CS can dictate the collaboration relationships among FL-PTs only if doing so can better address the concerns of FL-PTs such as fairness and performance [6; 13; 59; 60]. Chaudhury et al. [4] treat all FL-PTs as a grand coalition and optimize a common model such that there is no other coalition \(\mathcal{S}\) of FL-PTs that could significantly benefit more by training a model only using the data of \(\mathcal{S}\). Sattler et al. [37] propose a novel federated multi-task learning framework where the geometric properties of the FL loss surface is leveraged to group FL-PTs into clusters with jointly trainable data distributions. Ding and Wang [7] partition a total of \(n\) FL-PTs into \(K\) groups, where \(K\ll n\) and the FL-PTs with similar contributors are assigned to the same group. Then, a common model is returned to each group of FL-PTs such that the performance of using \(K\) models for \(n\) FL-PTs is a good approximation to the the performance of learning \(n\) personalized models for \(n\) FL-PTs respectively. However, the above works don't consider the adversarial relationships among FL-PTs.

## 3 Model and Assumptions

### Relationship Graphs

There is a set of FL-PTs denoted by \(\mathcal{V}=\{v_{1},v_{2},\cdots,v_{n}\}\). Each FL-PT \(v_{i}\) is uniquely equipped with its own local dataset \(\mathcal{D}_{i}\). A benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\) is deployed to describe the potential collaboration advantages between any two FL-PTs. Together with the competing relationships represented by \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) among different FL-PTs, we pave the way for the formation of the contribution graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\). The benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\) is a weighted directed graph with an edge set \(E_{b}\) (i.e., \(\mathcal{G}_{b}=(\mathcal{V},E_{b})\)) and is used to evaluate the data complementarity between FL-PTs. It is defined as follows. For any two FL-PTs \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{i}\), if \(v_{i}\) can benefit from \(v_{j}\)'s data, then there is a directed edge from \(v_{j}\) to \(v_{i}\) (i.e., \((v_{j},v_{i})\in E_{b}\)) and the weight of this edge is \(w_{j,i}>0\) where a larger value of \(w_{j,i}\) signifies a larger benefit to \(v_{i}\) brought by\(v_{j}\). In contrast, if \(v_{i}\) cannot benefit from the data of \(v_{j}\), then \((v_{j},v_{i})\notin E_{b}\) and \(w_{j,i}=0\). The benefit graph can be computed by the hypernetwork technique like [5; 33; 42]. The competing graph \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) is an undirected graph with an edge set \(E_{c}\), i.e., \(\mathcal{G}_{c}=(\mathcal{V},E_{c})\). For any two FL-PTs \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\), if they compete against each other, then there is an undirected edge between \(v_{i}\) to \(v_{j}\) (i.e., \((v_{i},v_{j})\in E_{c}\)). If they are independent of each other, then \((v_{i},v_{j})\notin E_{c}\). The CS is assumed to be trustable. In the real world, the CS may represent an impartial and authoritative third-party (e.g., the industry association) [5]. Then, FL-PTs can report their competitive relationships to the third-party in person and confidentiality agreements can be signed between the third-party and FL-PTs. Each FL-PT \(v_{i}\) will report its competitors to CS, as it hopes that CS will correctly utilize this information to prevent its competitors from benefiting from its data. Thus, CS has the knowledge of \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\). Although \(v_{i}\) may benefit from \(v_{j}\)'s data(\(w_{j,i}>0\)), CS has the authority to determine whether \(v_{i}\) can actually utilize \(v_{j}\)'s local model update information (i.e., indirectly use \(v_{j}\)'s data) in the FL training process or not. Let \(\mathcal{X}=(x_{j,i})\) be a \(n\times n\) matrix where \(x_{j,i}\in\{0,1\}\): for two different FL-PTs \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\), \(x_{j,i}\) is set to one if \(v_{j}\) will contribute to \(v_{i}\) (i.e., \(v_{i}\) will utilize \(v_{j}\)'s local model update information) in the FL training process and \(x_{j,i}\) is set to zero otherwise. \(\mathcal{X}\) defines a directed graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}=(\mathcal{V},E_{u})\), called the data usage graph: \((v_{j},v_{i})\in E_{u}\) if and only if \(j\neq i,x_{j,i}=1\); then, \(v_{j}\) is said to be a collaborator or contributor of \(v_{i}\).

Finally, we introduce some concepts in graph theory. Let \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},E)\) denote an arbitrary graph whose node set is \(\mathcal{V}\) and whose edge set is \(E\). For any subset \(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{V}\), _an (induced) subgraph_\(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) of the graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is such that (i) the node set of \(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) is \(\tilde{\mathcal{V}}\) and (ii) the edge set of \(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) consists of all of the edges in \(E\) that have both endpoints in \(\mathcal{S}\). A subgraph \(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) is said to be a _strongly connected component_ of \(\mathcal{G}\) if we have (i) \(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) is strongly connected, i.e., there is a path in each direction between any two nodes and (ii) \(\mathcal{G}\left(\mathcal{S}\right)\) is maximal in the sense that no additional edges or nodes from \(\mathcal{G}\) can be included in the subgraph without breaking the property of being strongly connected. The collection of strongly connected components forms a partition of the nodes of \(\mathcal{G}\). A simple path is a path in a graph which does not have repeating nodes.

### Collaboration Principles

The FL-PTs in the scenario under study have two features: (i) self-interest and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. Accordingly, there are two collaboration principles introduced below.

#### 3.2.1 Absence of free riders

While establishing collaboration relationships among FL-PTs, the following principle is used to guarantee the non-existence of free rider.

**Principle 1**.: _For any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}\), there exists a FL-PT \(v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}\) that benefits \(v_{i}\) if and only if there exists at least one FL-PT \(v_{k}\) that can benefit from \(v_{i}\)._

In this paper, all Fl-PTs are assumed to be self-interested and there exists competition among some FL-PTs. Let \(\pi\) denote a partition of FL-PTs \(\mathcal{V}\) into \(K\) mutually disjoint groups where \(\pi=\{\mathcal{S}_{1},\mathcal{S}_{2},\cdots,\mathcal{S}_{K}\}\) satisfies: (i) \(\mathcal{S}_{i}\subseteq\mathcal{V}\), (ii) \(\cup_{k=1}^{K}\mathcal{S}_{k}=\mathcal{V}\) and (iii) \(\mathcal{S}_{i}\cap\mathcal{S}_{j}=\emptyset\), \(\forall i,j\in\{1,2,...,K\}\). For any \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi\), the collaboration relationships among the FL-PTs of \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\) are established according to the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\), i.e., for any \(v_{i},v_{j}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\), \(v_{j}\) is a contributor of \(v_{i}\) if and only if there exists an edge \((v_{j},v_{i})\) in the graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\). Each FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\) is only concerned with the contributions of other FL-PTs within the same \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\).

**Definition 1** (Coalitions).: _A partition \(\pi=\{\mathcal{S}_{1},\mathcal{S}_{2},\cdots,\mathcal{S}_{K}\}\) is said to be a set of coalitions if we have for any \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi\) with \(|\mathcal{S}_{k}|\geqslant 2\) and \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\) that_

\[\sum\nolimits_{v_{j}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}-\{v_{i}\}}w_{i,j}>0\text{ and }\sum \nolimits_{v_{j}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}-\{v_{i}\}}w_{j,i}>0\] (1)

In a coalition \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\) with \(|\mathcal{S}_{k}|\geqslant 2\), each FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\) can both benefit and benefit from other members in \(\mathcal{S}_{k}-\{v_{i}\}\). Thus, in a set \(\pi\) of coalitions, Principle 1 will be realized since Eq. (1) is satisfied. If \(|\mathcal{S}_{k}|=1\), the single FL-PT of \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\) neither benefit nor benefit from any other FL-PT.

#### 3.2.2 Avoiding conflict of interest

To avoid conflict of interest, a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors (i.e., its enemies) and any FL-PTs that help its competitors (i.e., the friends of its enemies). Also, it doesn't hope to see others help the supporters/friends of its competitors (in)directly. For any FL-PT \(v_{i}\), let \(\mathcal{A}_{s}\) denote the supporter alliance of \(v_{i}\) defined as: \(\mathcal{A}_{i}=\{v_{k}\in\mathcal{V}\,|\,v_{k}\text{ is reachable to }v_{i}\text{ in the data usage graph }\mathcal{G}_{u}\}\). Let us consider any two competing FL-PTs \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{i}\) where \((v_{j},v_{i})\in E_{c}\). To avoid conflict of interest, \(v_{j}\) will not contribute to any member of \(\mathcal{A}_{i}\). Like [42], this is defined as the following principle by which it is strictly guaranteed that no FL-PTs will contribute to its competitors (in)directly.

**Principle 2**.: _For any two competing FL-PTs \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\), \(v_{j}\) is unreachable to \(v_{i}\) in the data usage graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\)._

### Problem Description

Now, we propose a proper problem formulation such that the resulting solution can well satisfy the FL-PTs' needs and help them achieve the best possible ML model performances. All FL-PTs are divided into a set \(\pi\) of coalitions. For the FL-PTs of of a coalition \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi\), their collaboration relationships are established according to the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\). The utility \(u(\mathcal{S}_{k})\) of a coalition \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\) is defined as the sum of the edge weights of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\). Formally, let \(E_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\) denotes the edge set of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\); then, \(u(\mathcal{S}_{k})=\sum_{(v_{j},v_{i})\in E_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})}w_{j,i}\); given a FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\), its utility is defined as \(u_{i}(\mathcal{S}_{k})=\sum_{(v_{j},v_{i})\in E_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})}w_{j,i}\) where \(v_{i}\) is fixed; here, the utility of a coalition is the sum of the utilities of all its members, i.e., \(u(\mathcal{S}_{k})=\sum_{v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}}u_{i}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\). For two coalitions \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\) and \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{k}\) with \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\subseteq\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{k}\), \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\) is a subgraph of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{k})\); then the utility of \(v_{i}\) in a larger coalition \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{k}\) is no smaller than its utility in a smaller coalition \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\), i.e., \(u_{i}(\mathcal{S}_{k})\leqslant u_{i}\)\((\mathcal{S}^{\prime}_{k})\).

In this paper, our final problem is to find a partition \(\pi\) of FL-PTs such that

* Principles 1 and 2 are satisfied.
* Subject to Principles 1 and 2, no coalitions of \(\pi\) (i.e., no subset \(\pi^{\prime}\) of \(\pi\)) can collaborate together and be merged into a larger coalition with a higher utility; in other words, after merging these coalitions into a larger one, no FL-PTs in these coalitions \(\pi^{\prime}\) increase their utilities under the larger coalition. Formally, let \[\Pi=\left\{\pi^{\prime}\subseteq\pi\,|\,\sum_{\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi^{\prime} }u(\mathcal{S}_{k})<u\left(\bigcup_{\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi^{\prime}}\mathcal{S }_{k}\right),\text{ Principles 1 and 2 are satisfied by }\bigcup_{\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi^{\prime}}\mathcal{S}_{k}\right\}.\] Then, \(\Pi\) satisfies: \[\Pi=\emptyset.\] (2)

## 4 Solution

Now, we give an algorithm that satisfies Principles 1 and 2 and Eq. (2). It is presented as Algorithm 1 and its main idea is as follows. Firstly, we find a partition \(\hat{\pi}=\{\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{1},\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{2},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{ S}}_{H}\}\) of all FL-PTs \(\mathcal{V}\) such that the FL-PTs of each subset \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\in\hat{\pi}\) are independent of each other. Secondly, \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\in\hat{\pi}\) is further partitioned into several subsets/coalitions, denoted as \(SCC_{h}=\{\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,1},\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,2},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{ S}}_{h,y_{h}}\}\) such that for all \(l\in[1,y_{h}]\), \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,l})\) is a strongly connected component of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h})\). Thirdly, for any coalitions of \(\bigcup_{h=1}^{H}SCC_{h}\), we merge these coalitions into a larger one if doing so achieves a higher coalition utility without violating Principles 1 and 2.

Below, we detail Algorithm 1. Firstly, we define \(\mathcal{G}^{-}_{c}=(\mathcal{V},E^{-}_{c})\) as the inverse of the competing graph \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\), i.e., any two nodes of \(\mathcal{G}^{-}_{c}\) are adjacent if and only if they are not adjacent in \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\); if there is an edge between two nodes in \(\mathcal{G}^{-}_{c}\), then these two nodes are said to be independent of each other (line 2). In graph theory, a clique of an arbitrary undirected graph \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},E)\) is a subset of nodes \(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\mathcal{V}\) in which any two nodes of \(\mathcal{S}\) are connected by an edge in the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}(\mathcal{S})\); a maximal clique is a clique such that if it is extended by adding any other node, the resulting larger subgraph is not complete. We search for all maximal cliques within \(\mathcal{G}^{-}_{c}\), which form a partition \(\hat{\pi}\) of all FL-PTs \(\mathcal{V}\). Any two FL-PTs in a subset \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{k}\in\hat{\pi}\) are independent of each other. In line 3, the cliques of \(\mathcal{G}^{-}_{c}\) can be found by the classic Bron-Kerbosch algorithm [44].

Secondly, for each \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\in\hat{\pi}\), we process the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h})\) of the benefit graph. All strongly connected components of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h})\) are founded by the classic Tarjan algorithm [43]. The node sets of all these components constitute a partition of \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\), denoted as \(SCC_{h}\) (lines 4-5). Thirdly, we also use \(\hat{v}_{y}\) to denote a set \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,y_{h}}\subseteq\mathcal{V}\) and let \(\pi=\bigcup_{h=1}^{H}SCC_{h}=\{\hat{v}_{1},\hat{v}_{2},\cdots,\hat{v}_{Y}\}\) where \(Y=\sum_{h=1}^{H}y_{h}\leq n\) and \(\cup_{y=1}^{Y}\hat{v}_{y}=\mathcal{V}\) (line 6); then we construct by Definition 2 two new graphs \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) whose node sets are \(\pi\) (line 7).

**Definition 2**.: _In the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\), there is a directed edge from \(\hat{v}_{l}\) to \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) if and only if there exist two nodes \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(v_{j}\in\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) such that \((v_{i},v_{j})\) is a directed edge in the benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\). In the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\), there is an undirected edge between \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) if and only if there exist two nodes \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(v_{j}\in\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) such that \((v_{i},v_{j})\) is an undirected edge in the competing graph \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\). For any two coalitions \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) of \(\pi\), \(\hat{v}_{l}\) is said to benefit (resp. benefit from) \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) if there is a directed edge \((\hat{v}_{l},\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}})\) (resp. \((\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}},\hat{v}_{l})\)) in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\); \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) are said to be competitive if there is an undirected edge \((\hat{v}_{l},\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}})\) in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) and independent of each other otherwise._

In line 9, Algorithm 2 is called where there is a while-loop. In Algorithm 2, we check whether the loop condition in line 1 is satisfied or not; this loop condition will be called _the cycle condition_ subsequently. As illustrated by \(\hat{v}_{2}\) and \(\hat{v}_{5}\) in Figure 2(a), if "yes", let \(\mathcal{X}=\{\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\}_{i=1}^{\theta}\) denote the nodes of this cycle. The following operations are taken to update the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\): (i) the nodes of \(\mathcal{X}\) are merged into a new node \(\hat{v}_{y}\) where all the edges in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) that point to (resp. point from) the nodes of \(\mathcal{X}\) change to point to (resp. point from) \(\hat{v}_{y}\), and (ii) the nodes of \(\mathcal{X}\) in \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) also exist in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\); such nodes in \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) are still merged into a new node \(\hat{v}_{y}\), and all the edges in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) whose endpoints are the nodes of \(\mathcal{X}\) change to become the edges whose endpoints are \(\hat{v}_{y}\). The above operations will be used as a routine and are given in Algorithm 3.

The time complexity of algorithm 1 depends on the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm in line 3 and is \(\mathcal{O}(3^{n/3})\)[44]; please see Appendix A.1 for a detailed analysis. In line 1 of Algorithm 2 or 4, any two coalitions \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{j}}\) are independent (of each other); in line 1 of Algorithm 5, the two coalitions \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) are independent. Any two members from such two coalitions respectively will be independent by Definition 2. In each coalition, all its members are independent. Thus, all members of the merged \(\hat{v}_{y}\) are independent of each other. For any coalition \(\hat{v}_{y}\), the collaboration relationships among its members are established according to the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{y})\); thus, we have two conclusions. Firstly, Principle 2 is realized since for the data usage graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\), paths may exist only between two nodesin a coalition. Secondly, after the merge operation in line 2 of Algorithm 2 or 4, for any \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{l}}|=1\), it can benefit from its direct predecessor and benefit its direct successor in the cycle or the simple path, satisfying Eq. (1). As a result, we have the following proposition whose detailed proof can be found in Appendix A.2.

**Proposition 1**.: _Upon completion of Algorithm 1, Principles 1 and 2 are realized._

Upon completion of Algorithm 1, the cycle condition, the path condition, and the node condition are not satisfied. Then, we have the following two conclusions: (i) when the cycle condition isn't satisfied, we have for any coalition \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{i}}|=1\) that it can be merged with other coalitions without violating Principles 1 and 2 if and only if the path condition is satisfied in the graphs \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\); and (ii) When both the cycle condition and the path condition aren't satisfied, we have for any coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\) that it can be merged with other coalitions without violating Principles 1 and 2 if and only if the node condition is satisfied in the graphs \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\). The proofs of the above two conclusions are given in Appendix A.3. With these two conclusions, we further have the following proposition.

**Proposition 2**.: _Upon completion of Algorithm 1, Eq. (2) holds._

## 5 Evaluation

### Experimental Setup

**Datasets & data heterogeneity.** We conduct experiments on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets with different data heterogeneity settings [23]. Also, we use a real-world dataset eICU [36] to illustrate the practicality of FedEgoists. Both the **CIFAR-10** and **CIFAR-100** datasets contain 60,000 color images for image classification tasks but have different levels of complexity. CIFAR-10 images have 10 classes with 6,000 images per class, while CIFAR-100 is more complex and has 100 classes with only 600 images per class. We simulate the data heterogeneity by two typical approaches: (i) pathological distribution [5; 32; 42; 61], where each FL-PT is randomly allocated 2 classes of images for CIFAR-10 and 20 classes of images for CIFAR-100, and (ii) Dirichlet distribution [41; 57; 62], where a distribution vector \(q_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is drawn from the distribution \(Dir_{n}(\beta)\) for each class \(c\) and FL-PT \(v_{i}\) is allocated a \(q_{c,i}\) proportion of data samples of class \(c\); smaller \(\beta\) value results in higher data heterogeneity, and we set \(\beta=0.5\). Above, we use standard datasets and randomly divide each dataset into different parts that are used as the local data of different FL-PTs. We also use a real-world dataset that contains data directly from multiple different FL-PTs. Specifically, **eICU** is a dataset collecting EHRs from many hospitals across the United States admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). The task is to predict mortality during hospitalization. More details on the way of processing these datasets are given in Appendix B.1.

**Comparison baselines. FedAvg**[32] is widely recognized as a vanilla FL algorithm. Multiple representative personalized FL (PFL) methods are used as baselines for comparison [41]. **FedProx**[25] and **SCAFFOLD**[21] represent two typical approaches that make the aggregated model at the CS close to the global optima and are two benchmarks in [24]. In other baseline methods, different personalized models are trained for individual FL-PTs. **pFedHN**[38] and **pFedMe**[40] represent two approaches based on hypernetworks and meta-learning respectively. **FedDisco**[58] and **pFedGraph**[57] are two approaches based on data complementarity, which are proposed recently. **FedOra[48] is a method that assesses whether a FL-PT's generalization performance can benefit from knowledge transferred from others and maximizes it. The last baseline is **Local** where each FL-PT simply takes local ML training without collaboration. These traditional FL approaches cannot address the issues of both self-interest and competition. Thus, we use the operations in lines 1-4 of Algorithm 1 to generate a set of coalitions, denoted as \(\cup_{h=1}^{H}SCC_{h}\) where \(SCC_{h}=\{\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,1},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,y_{h}}\}\). If \(|\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,1}|\geqslant 2\), \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,1}\) represents a group of independent FL-PTs that can collaborate together following Principles 1 and 2. the above nine FL approaches are applied to each group of such FL-PTs to generate the baseline results.

Finally, like [5; 26; 42], the hypernetwork technique in [33] is used to compute the benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\) and a hypernetwork is constructed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The specific way of generating \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\) is introduced in Appendix B.2. The used network structures are introduced in Appendix B.3. There are \(n=10\) FL-PTs in the CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and eICU experiments.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

are systematically presented in Table 3, which shows that in the worst case, the proposed FedEgoists has a performance very close to the best performance of all the baseline approaches.

Finally, we also conduct experiments to show the effect of data heterogeneity and the related results can be found in Appendix B.4.2.

### Real-world Collaboration Example: eICU

Following the setting in [5; 42], there are ten hospitals in total, with \(\left\{v_{i}\right\}_{i=0}^{4}\) as large hospitals and \(\left\{v_{i}\right\}_{i=5}^{9}\) as small hospitals. Due to the extreme imbalance of data labels, where over 90% are negative labels, we use the AUC scores to evaluate the performance of the trained model. Suppose there are more than one large hospital located in the same city while small hospitals are dispersed in different rural areas with lower population densities; competition mainly occurs among large hospitals. We posit that competitive relationships exist between the following pairs of FL-PTs: \((v_{1},v_{4})\), \((v_{2},v_{3})\), and \((v_{2},v_{4})\). Table 4 presents our experimental results. In Appendix B.5, we also illustrate the collaboration relationships among the 10 FL-PTs. In the naive baseline methods, the formed coalitions are \(\left\{v_{0},v_{3},v_{4}\right\}\), \(\left\{v_{1},v_{2}\right\}\) and \(\left\{v_{5},v_{6},\cdots,v_{9}\right\}\). In the proposed method, larger coalitions are formed so that their members can benefit from more FL-PTs in the same coalition; the formed coalitions are \(\left\{v_{0},v_{3},v_{4},\cdots,v_{9}\right\}\) and \(\left\{v_{1},v_{2}\right\}\). Thus, FedEgoists can facilitate the collaboration among FL-PTs. In Table 4, it is observed that FedEgoists achieves a better performance on the whole.

In addition to CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and eICU, we also conduct experiments on the synthetic data like [42] and the related settings and results are presented in Appendix B.6.

## 6 Conclusions

In this paper, we consider cross-silos FL where organizations in the business sector that engage in business activities are key sources of FL-PTs. The resulting FL ecosystem has two features: (i) self-interest and (ii) competition among FL-PTs. Correspondingly, two principles are proposed to build a sustainable FL ecosystem: (1) a FL-PT can benefit from the FL ecosystem if and only if it can benefit the FL ecosystem, and (2) a FL-PT will not contribute to its competitors as well as the supporters of its competitors. The FL ecosystem needs to be tailored to realize these principles. In this paper, we propose an efficient solution that can well realize the two principles above. In the meantime, for any two coalitions without competition that can collaborate together, one coalition cannot increase its utility by collaborating with the other coalition. Extensive experiments over real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed solution compared to nine baseline methods, and its ability to establish efficient collaborative networks in cross-silos FL with FL-PTs that engage in business activities.

## Appendix A Theoretical Analysis

### The Time Complexity of Algorithm 1

Now, we analyze the time complexity of Algorithm 1. Firstly, the construction of \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) in line 2 involves two nested for loops, resulting in a complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\). In line 3, the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm is used, which has a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(3^{n/3})\)[44]. In lines 4-5, there is a for-loop; each iteration, the Tarjan's algorithm is executed on \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h})\) with a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(m_{h}+e_{h})\)[43], where \(m_{h}\) is the number of nodes in \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h})\) and \(e_{h}\) denotes the number of its edges; thus, the aggregate time complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(n+|E_{b}|)\). The time complexity of forming a union of sets \(\pi\) in line 6 is \(\mathcal{O}(Y)\). The construction of \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) in line 7 involves two nested loops to check the existence of edges between different node sets; at each iteration, the time complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(|\hat{v}_{y}||\hat{v}_{y^{\prime}}|)\) where \(y,y^{\prime}\in[1,Y]\); the total time complexity in line 7 is \(\mathcal{O}(Y^{2}n^{2})\) where \(|\hat{v}_{y}|\leqslant n\).

Initially, there are \(Y\) elements in the set \(\pi=\{\hat{v}_{1},\hat{v}_{2},\,\cdots,\hat{v}_{Y}\}\) where \(Y\leqslant n\). \(\pi\) is the node sets of \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\). In lines 9, 10 and 11 of Algorithm 1, Algorithms 2, 4 and 5 are sequentially called. In each of Algorithms 2, 4 and 5, there is at least one while loop and the loop conditions are about the features of a cycle, a simple path or two neighboring nodes in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\). At each iteration of these while loops, at least two nodes will be merged into a new node \(\hat{v}_{y}\) with multiple nodes of \(\pi\) removed. So, there are a total of at most \(Y-1\) iterations in all these while loops and we always have \(|\pi|\leqslant n\); afterwards, Algorithm 1 ends.

In Algorithms 2, 4 and 5, Algorithm 3 is called. The time complexity of line 1 in Algorithm 3 is \(\mathcal{O}(|\mathcal{X}|)\). In lines 2-4, \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) are reconstructed and the complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(d|\mathcal{X}|)\), where \(d\) is the maximum of the in-degrees and out-degrees of all nodes of \(\mathcal{X}\) in the graphs \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) and is upperly bounded by \(|\pi|\), which is no larger than \(n\). To sum up, the total complexity of Algorithm 3 is \(\mathcal{O}(n|\mathcal{X}|)\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\).

In Algorithm 2, there is a while loop. In line 1, all cycles can be found by the Johnson's algorithm [19], which is implemented in a Python library and has a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}\left((|\pi|+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1)\right)\leqslant\mathcal{O} \left((n+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1)\right)\) where \(E(\mathcal{Z}_{b})\) denotes the number of edges in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(c\) denotes an upper bound of the total number of cycles discovered. For each cycle, we check whether any two of its nodes are competitive, which has a time complexity \(\mathcal{O}(|\pi|^{2})\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\); in the meantime, we check whether there is a node \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) in this cycle with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{i}}|=1\), which has a time complexity \(\mathcal{O}(|\pi|)\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n)\). So, the time complexity of checking the cycle condition in line 1 is \(\mathcal{O}\left((n+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1)\right)+\mathcal{O}(cn^{2})= \mathcal{O}\left((n^{2}+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1)\right)\). At each iteration of the while loop (line 2), Algorithm 3 is called and the time complexity of Algorithm 3 is \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\). The number of iterations is upperly bounded by \(n\). Thus, the complexity of Algorithm 2 is no larger than \(\mathcal{O}\left(n(n^{2}+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1)\right)=\mathcal{O}(f_{1}(n,E( \mathcal{Z}_{b}),c))\) where

\[f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)=n(n^{2}+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))(c+1).\] (3)

In Algorithm 4, there is an outer while loop. In line 1, for any two nodes \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{g}}\), we check whether they are such that \(|\hat{v}_{y_{1}}|\geqslant 2\) and \(|\hat{v}_{y_{g}}|\geqslant 2\), which has time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(|\pi|^{2})\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\). For each pair of \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{g}}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{1}}|\geqslant 2\) and \(|\hat{v}_{y_{g}}|\geqslant 2\), we can use the modified DFS algorithm to find all the simple paths from \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) to \(\hat{v}_{y_{g}}\)[8]. This algorithm is implemented in a Python library and has a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}((|\pi|+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))\tau)\leqslant\mathcal{O}((n+E(\mathcal{ Z}_{b}))\tau)\) where \(\tau\) denotes an upper bound of the total number of simple paths between two nodes. For each path, we check whether any two of its nodes are competitive, which has a time complexity \(\mathcal{O}(|\pi|^{2})\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\); in the meantime, we check whether there is a node \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) in this path with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{i}}|=1\), which has a time complexity \(\mathcal{O}(|\pi|)\leqslant\mathcal{O}(n)\). So, the time complexity of checking the path condition in line 1 is \[\mathcal{O}((n+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))\tau)+\mathcal{O}(\tau n^{2})=\mathcal{O}\left((n^ {2}+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))\tau\right)=\mathcal{O}(f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),\tau))\]

\[f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),\tau)=(n^{2}+E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))\tau.\] (4)

At each iteration of the while loop, the operations in lines 2-3 are executed. In line 2, Algorithm 3 is called and the time complexity of Algorithm 3 is \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\). In line 3, Algorithm 2 is called with a time complexity \(\mathcal{O}\left(f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)\right)\). The number of iterations is upperly bounded by \(n\). Thus, the complexity of Algorithm 4 is \(\mathcal{O}\left(n(f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)+f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}), \tau))\right)\).

In Algorithm 5, the time complexity of checking the node condition in line 1 has a time complexity of \(\mathcal{O}(E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}))\). At each iteration, the operations in lines 2-4 are executed. In lines 2-4, Algorithms 3, 2 and 4 are called sequentially. As analyzed above, these operations have a time complexity no larger than \(\mathcal{O}\left(n(f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)+f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}), \tau))\right)\). The number of iterations is upperly bounded by \(n\). Thus, the complexity of Algorithm 5 is no larger than \(\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}(f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)+f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b} ),\tau))\right)\).

To sum up, since a complete graph of \(n\) nodes has a total of \(n(n-1)\) that is an upper bound of \(E(\mathcal{Z}_{b})\), where \(\pi\) is the node set of \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and \(|\pi|\leqslant n\). Further, we have

\[f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c) \leqslant n^{3}(c+1)\] (5) \[f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),\tau) =n^{3}\tau.\] (6)

The worst-case time complexity of the operations in lines 9-11 depends on Algorithm 5 and is no larger than

\[\mathcal{O}\left(n^{2}(f_{1}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b}),c)+f_{2}(n,E(\mathcal{Z}_{b }),\tau))\right)\leq\mathcal{O}\left(n^{5}(\tau+c+1)\right).\] (7)

Finally, if \(c\) and \(\tau\) can be upperly bounded by constants, then the time complexity of Algorithm 1 depends on the Bron-Kerbosch algorithm in line 3 and is \(\mathcal{O}(3^{n/3})\). We note that this paper studies cross-silo FL in business sectors where there are typically a limited number of FL-PTs (e.g., 2 to 100) [16; 27; 49].

### Proof of Proposition 1

A graph \(\mathcal{G}\) is said to be strongly connected if it contains a directed path from \(v_{i}\) to \(v_{j}\) and a directed path from \(v_{j}\) to \(v_{i}\) for every pair of nodes \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\) of \(\mathcal{G}\). Specially, a graph that contains only a single node is said to be strongly connected trivially.

**Lemma 1**.: _Principle 1 is realized when Eq. (1) is satisfied._

Proof.: Only the FL-PTs in the same coalition may collaborate. For any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{V}\), there exists a coalition \(\mathcal{S}_{k}\in\pi\) such that \(v_{i}\in\mathcal{S}_{k}\). When \(|\mathcal{S}_{k}|=1\), the only FL-PT \(v_{i}\) neither receives nor provides benefits to any other FL-PT, thereby satisfying Principle 1 trivially. When \(|\mathcal{S}_{k}|\geqslant 2\), \(v_{i}\) engages in a reciprocal exchange of benefits with the other members of \(\mathcal{S}_{k}-\{v_{i}\}\), which is guaranteed by Eq. (1). Thus, \(v_{i}\) both contributes to and benefits from other members and Principle 1 is satisfied. 

**Lemma 2**.: _Upon completion of lines 1-6 of Algorithm 1, we have for any \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\) that (i) all FL-PTs of the coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) are independent of each other and (ii) Eq. (1) holds for any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\)._

Proof.: At line 3, we obtain all maximal cliques of the inverse of \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\), denoted as \(\hat{\pi}=\left\{\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{1},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{H}\right\}\). The nodes of \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\) are independent of each other. At line 5, all the strongly connected components of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\left(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\right)\) are computed, and the node sets of the components of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\left(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}\right)\) are denoted as \(SCC_{h}=\left\{\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,1},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,y_{h}}\right\}\) where \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h}=\bigcup_{l=1}^{y_{h}}\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,l}\). Thus, the FL-PTs of each \(\hat{\mathcal{S}}_{h,l}\) are still independent of each other. In line 6, \(\pi=\left\{\hat{v}_{1},\hat{v}_{2},\cdots,\hat{v}_{Y}\right\}=\bigcup\limits_{h =1}^{H}SCC_{h}\) where \(Y=\sum_{h=1}^{H}y_{h}\). Thus, the first point of Lemma 2 holds. The subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l})\) is strongly connected. If \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\), we have for any node \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\) that there are nodes of \(\hat{v}_{l}\) that can be reachable to and from \(v_{i}\). Thus, the second point of Lemma 2 holds. 

In lines 7-11, some coalitions of \(\left\{\hat{v}_{1},\hat{v}_{2},\cdots,\hat{v}_{Y}\right\}\) may be merged as a larger coalition by Algorithm 3, which occurs in lines 9, 10 and 11 of Algorithm 1 where Algorithms 2, 4 and 5 are called,respectively; Algorithm 2 is also called in Algorithm 4; Algorithms 2 and 4 are called sequentially in Algorithm 5. The merge operation occurs (i.e., Algorithm 3 is executed) if the cycle condition, the path condition and the node condition are satisfied in Algorithms 2, 4 and 5 respectively. Upon each completion of Algorithm 3, \(\pi\) is updated: some coalitions will be merged into a new coalition \(\hat{v}_{y}\) that is further added to \(\pi\), and then be removed from \(\pi\). Like Lemma 2, we still have the following conclusion.

**Lemma 3**.: _At the beginning of each execution of Algorithm 3, suppose we have for any \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\) that (i) all FL-PTs of the coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) are independent of each other and (ii) Eq. (1) holds for any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\). Then, upon each completion of Algorithm 3, we still have for any \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\) that (i) all FL-PTs of the coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) are independent of each other and (ii) Eq. (1) holds for any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\)._

Proof.: Algorithm 3 is called if the cycle condition, the path condition and the node condition are satisfied in Algorithms 2, 4 and 5 respectively.

In line 1 of Algorithms 2 or 4, any two coalitions \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\), are independent of each other; by Definition 2, any two members from \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\), respectively are independent of each other. In the meantime, for any \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\in\pi\), any two members of \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) are independent of each other. Thus, upon completion of the merge operation in line 2 of Algorithms 2 or 4, \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\hat{v}_{y_{2}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) are merged into a new coalition \(\hat{v}_{y}\), and all FL-PTs of \(\hat{v}_{y}\) are independent of each other. This completes the proof of the first point of Lemma 3 when it comes to Algorithms 2 and 4.

Similarly, in line 1 of Algorithm 5, any two members from \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) respectively are independent of each other. In the meantime, for any \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\in\pi\), any two members of \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) are independent of each other. Thus, upon completion of the merge operation in line 2 of Algorithm 5, \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) are merged into a new coalition \(\hat{v}_{y}\), and all FL-PTs of \(\hat{v}_{y}\) are independent of each other. This completes the proof of the first point of Lemma 3 when it comes to Algorithm 5.

The collaboration relationships among the members of \(\hat{v}_{y}\) are established exactly according to the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{y})\). In line 1 of Algorithms 2 or 4, for any \(l\in[1,\theta]\), if \(|\hat{v}_{y_{l}}|\geqslant 2\), the members of \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) already satisfy Eq. (1). Let us consider any two nodes \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\). By Definition 2, if there is an edge from \(\hat{v}_{l}\) to \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\), then there is a node of \(\hat{v}_{l}\) that benefits from a node of \(\hat{v}_{l}\) in the benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\). If \(|\hat{v}_{y_{l}}|=1\), the single node in \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) will benefit its direct successor in the cycle (resp. the simple path) and benefit from its direct predecessor in this cycle (resp. the simple path); thus the node of \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) also satisfies Eq. (1). This completes the proof of the second point of Lemma 3 when it comes to Algorithms 2 and 4. In line 1 of Algorithm 5, since \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\) and \(|\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}|\geqslant 2\), the members of \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) already satisfy Eq. (1). This completes the proof of the second point of Lemma 3 when it comes to Algorithm 5. 

Finally, by Lemma 2, we have the following conclusion holds upon completion of lines 1-6 of Algorithm 1: for any \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\), (i) all FL-PTs of the coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) are independent of each other and (ii) Eq. (1) holds for any FL-PT \(v_{i}\in\hat{v}_{l}\). Afterwards, Algorithm 3 may be executed multiple times by the call by Algorithms 2, 4 and 5; upon each completion of Algorithm 3, \(\pi\) is updated such that some of its coalitions are removed from \(\pi\) and merged into a larger one that is added to \(\pi\). By Lemma 3, upon completion of Algorithm 1, the conclusion above still holds. Since Eq. (1) holds, Principle 1 is realized by Lemma 1. For any \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\), the collaboration relationships among the members of a coalition \(\hat{v}_{l}\) are established exactly according to the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l})\). Each FL-PT \(v_{i}\) of a coalition only collaborate with other FL-PTs within the same coalition, The data usage graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\) in fact consists of multiple separated subgraphs \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l})\), i.e., \(\mathcal{G}_{u}=\{\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l})\,|\,\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi\}\). In the graph \(\mathcal{G}_{u}\), paths may exist only between two FL-PTs of the same coalition, and any two FL-PTs in the same coalition are independent of each other. Thus, Principle 2 is realized.

### Proof of Proposition 2

After finishing the operations in line 9 of Algorithm 1, the loop condition in line 1 of Algorithm 2 (i.e., the cycle condition) is not satisfied. The execution in line 10 of Algorithm 1 starts. Before executing the first iteration of the while loop of Algorithm 4, if the loop condition (i.e., the path condition) is not satisfied, then Algorithm 4 ends with both the cycle condition and the path condition violated. If Algorithm 4 ends after executing several iterations, then the cycle condition (line 3) and the path condition (line 1) are both violated.

Subject to Principles 1 and 2, no coalitions of \(\pi\) (i.e., no subset \(\pi^{\prime}\) of \(\pi\)) can collaborate together and be merged into a larger coalition with a higher utility; in other words, after merging these coalitions into a larger one, no FL-PTs in these coalitions \(\pi^{\prime}\) increase their utilities under the larger coalition. Formally, like what we define in Section 3.3, let

\[\Pi=\left\{\pi^{\prime}\subseteq\pi\,|\,\sum_{\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}}u (\hat{v}_{y_{i}})<u\left(\bigcup_{\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}}\hat{v}_{y_{i }}\right),\text{ Principles 1 and 2 are satisfied by }\bigcup_{\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}}\hat{v}_{y_{i}} \right\}.\]

Given a graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) where the cycle and path conditions are not satisfied, we have the following conclusion.

**Lemma 4**.: _Suppose the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) is a graph without any such cycle that (i) the nodes of this cycle are all independent of each other and (ii) there exists a node \(\hat{v}_{k}\) in this cycle with \(|\hat{v}_{k}|=1\). Let us consider an arbitrary node \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) of \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{i}}|=1\); each node \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) also represents a coalition; then, we have_

* _The coalition_ \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) _can benefit or benefit from other coalitions by being merged with them without violating Principles_ 1 _and_ 2 _(i.e., there exists a non-empty_ \(\pi^{\prime}\in\Pi\) _such that_ \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}\)_) if and only if there exists a path_ \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\) _in the graph_ \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) _with_ \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\geqslant 2\) _and_ \(\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\geqslant 2\) _and the nodes of this path are independent of each other._

Proof.: Firstly, we prove the "only if" direction by contradiction. For a coalition \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) that contains only one FL-PT/node, it can collaborate with other coalitions without violating Principle 1 only if there are two other coalitions \(\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}\) that can both benefit and benefit from it; by Definition 2, in the case that \(\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}\) denote the same coalition, there is a cycle in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) between \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}}\) where \(\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}}=\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}\). Suppose there are some coalitions that can collaborate with \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) without violating Principles 1 and 2 (i.e., there exists a non-empty \(\pi^{\prime}\in\Pi\) such that \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}\)); correspondingly, in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\), there will be a path of the form \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}},\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}, \cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\) in which a coalition will benefit its successor; the nodes of this path are also independent of each other according to the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) in order to be able to collaborate together without violating Principle 2. Then, this path is simple and not a cycle (i.e., \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\neq\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\)); otherwise, it is a cycle that has two nodes that compete against each other. In this path, all intermediate nodes can both benefit and benefit from other nodes. Each of \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\) also represents a coalition and should contain at least two nodes of \(\mathcal{V}\); then, each node in \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\) already satisfies Eq. (1), thus maintaining Principle 1. Otherwise, if \(|\hat{v}_{y_{1}}|=1\), then the single node of \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) cannot benefit from others; if \(|\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}|=1\), then the single node of \(\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\) cannot benefit others. These two cases violate Principle 1. This completes the proof of the "only if" direction.

Secondly, we prove the "if" direction. If there exists a path \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\) in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{1}}|\geqslant 2\) and \(|\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}|\geqslant 2\) and the nodes of this path are independent of each other, then the coalitions that these nodes in the paths represent can be merged into a new subset \(\hat{v}_{y}\) of nodes of \(\mathcal{V}\); doing so doesn't violate Principle 2, i.e., the edge set of \(\mathcal{G}_{c}(\hat{v}_{y})\) is empty. As shown above, each node in \(\hat{v}_{y_{1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\) already satisfies Eq. (1) since any two nodes of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{1})\) or \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{\theta})\) are connected. Also, in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\), any intermediate node can both benefit and benefit from other nodes in this path without violating Principle 1. Finally, let \(\pi^{\prime}=\{\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}\}\). For any \(l\in[2,\theta]\), there exists at least one FL-PT \(v_{i}\) of \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) that can benefit from some FL-PT in \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\), which is denoted as \(v_{j}\) by Definition 2. Before merging the coalitions of \(\pi^{\prime}\), the FL-PT \(v_{i}\) of a coalition \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\in\pi^{\prime}\) only collaborates with the other FL-PTs with the same coalition \(\hat{v}_{y_{l}}\) and the collaboration relationship is established according to \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{y_{l}})\). Let \(\hat{v}_{y}=\bigcup_{\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\in\pi^{\prime}}\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\). After merging the coalitions of \(\pi^{\prime}\) into a larger coalition \(\hat{v}_{y}\), FL-PT \(v_{i}\) can additionally benefit from FL-PT \(v_{j}\), i.e., \(u_{i}(\hat{v}_{y_{l}})<u_{i}(\hat{v}_{y})\); in the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{y})\), \(v_{i}\) can benefit from all FL-PTs of \(\hat{v}_{y}\) such that they point to \(v_{i}\) by directed edges. This completes the proof of the "if" direction. 

After finishing the operations in line 10 of Algorithm 1, the cycle condition and the path condition cannot be satisfied. Then, the execution in line 11 of Algorithm 1 starts. Before executing the first iteration of the while loop of Algorithm 5, if the loop condition (i.e., the node condition) is not satisfied, then Algorithm 5 ends with the cycle, path and node conditions violated. If Algorithm 5 ends after executing several iterations, then the cycle and path conditions (lines 3-4) and the node condition (line 1) are violated.

Subject to Principles 1 and 2, no coalitions of \(\pi\) (i.e., no subset \(\pi^{\prime}\) of \(\pi\)) can collaborate together and be merged into a larger coalition with a higher utility; in other words, after merging these coalitions into a larger one, no FL-PTs in these coalitions \(\pi^{\prime}\) increase their utilities under the larger coalition. Formally, like what we define in Section 3.3, let

\[\Pi=\left\{\pi^{\prime}\subseteq\pi\,|\,\sum_{\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi^{\prime}}u( \hat{v}_{l})<u\left(\bigcup_{\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi^{\prime}}\hat{v}_{l}\right),\text { Principles 1 and 2 are satisfied by }\bigcup_{\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi^{\prime}}\hat{v}_{l}\right\}.\]

Given a graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) where the cycle, path and node conditions are not satisfied, we have the following conclusion.

**Lemma 5**.: _Suppose the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) is a graph without any such path that (i) the nodes of this path are all independent of each other and (ii) this path is either a cycle in which there exists a node \(\hat{v}_{y}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y}|=1\), or a simple path of the form \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{l}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\) with \(|\hat{v}_{y_{i}}|=1\), \(|\hat{v}_{y_{1}}|\geqslant 2\) and \(|\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}}|\geqslant 2\). Let us consider an arbitrary node \(\hat{v}_{l}\) of \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l}|\geqslant 2\); each node \(\hat{v}_{l}\) also represents a coalition; then, we have_

* _The coalition_ \(\hat{v}_{l}\) _can benefit or benefit from other coalitions by being merged with them without violating Principles 1 and 2 (i.e., there exists a non-empty_ \(\pi^{\prime}\in\Pi\) _such that_ \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi^{\prime}\)_) if and only if there exists another node_ \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) _with_ \(|\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}|\geqslant 2\) _that connects_ \(\hat{v}_{l}\) _by an edge in the graph_ \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) _and the two nodes_ \(\hat{v}_{l}\) _and_ \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) _are independent of each other._

Proof.: Firstly, we prove the "if" direction. If there exists another node \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) with \(|\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}|\geqslant 2\) that connects \(\hat{v}_{l}\) by an edge in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) and the two nodes \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) are independent of each other, then the coalitions that these two nodes in \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\) represent can be merged into a new subset \(\hat{v}_{y}\) of nodes of \(\mathcal{V}\); doing so doesn't violate Principle 2 by Definition 2. Each FL-PT in \(\hat{v}_{l}\) and \(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\) already satisfies Eq. (1) since any two FL-PTs of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l})\) or \(\mathcal{G}_{b}(\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}})\) are connected. Thus, any node in the merged set \(\hat{v}_{y}\) still satisfies Principle 1. Finally we have \(\pi^{\prime}=\{\hat{v}_{l},\hat{v}_{l^{\prime}}\}\). This completes the proof of the "if" direction.

Secondly, we prove the "only if" direction. For a coalition \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) that contains only one FL-PT/node, it can collaborate with other coalitions without violating Principle 1 only if there are two other coalitions \(\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}}\) and \(\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}\) that can both benefit and benefit from it. Suppose there are some coalitions that collaborate with \(\hat{v}_{y_{i}}\) without violating Principles 1 and 2 (i.e., there exists a non-empty \(\pi^{\prime}\in\Pi\) such that \(\hat{v}_{l}\in\pi^{\prime}\)); correspondingly, in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\), there will be a path of the form \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\hat{v}_{y_{2}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{j}})\), \((\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\), or \((\hat{v}_{y_{1}},\cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{i-1}},\hat{v}_{y_{i}},\hat{v}_{y_{i+1}}, \cdots,\hat{v}_{y_{\theta}})\) in which a coalition will benefit its successor; the nodes of this path are also independent of each other according to the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{c}\) in order to be able to collaborate together without violating Principle 2. Then, by the assumptions in Lemma 5, this path is a simple path in which there doesn't a node such that (i) the coalition that it represents contains only one node of \(\mathcal{V}\) and (ii) there don't exist one of its upstream nodes and one of its downstream nodes whose corresponding coalitions both contain at least two nodes \(\mathcal{V}\). This means that the coalitions that the nodes of this path represent all contain at least nodes. This completes the proof of the "only if" direction. 

As shown above, upon completion of Algorithm 1, the cycle, path and node conditions are not satisfied in the graph \(\mathcal{Z}_{b}\). Firstly, by Lemma 4, for arbitrary multiple coalitions in which there is at least one coalition that contains only one FL-PT, they cannot be merged into a larger coalition without violating Principles 1 and 2. Secondly, by Lemma 5, for arbitrary multiple coalitions each of which has at least two FL-PTs, they cannot be merged into a larger coalition without violating Principles 1 and 2. Thus, Proposition 2 holds.

## Appendix B More Experimental Details

### Data Processing

CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100.In both CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, there are a total of 50,000 images for training and 10,000 images for testing. In CIFAR-10, each class has 5000 training images and 1000 testing images. In CIFAR-100, each class has 500 training images and 100 testing images. In both the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 experiments, we split the data into 10 FL-PTs, and the training data for each FL-PT is divided into a training set (90%) and a validation set (10%). The label distribution of CIFAR-10 is illustrated in Figure 3. In Figure 3, the label distribution across different FL-PTs/FL-PTs indicates that there is a significant variance in the total number of samples per FL-PT, and the data is imbalanced. Similarly, the label distribution of CIFAR-100 is illustrated in Figure 4.

eICU.We process the eICU dataset following the data pre-processing steps in [18; 30], finally generating JSON files that include hospital identifiers. We divided the training, validation, and testing sets in a ratio of 7:1.5:1.5, with each hospital being treated as an independent FL-PT. We chose a binary classification task using the eICU database, aiming to predict patient mortality within 48 hours of ICU admission(\(mort\_48h\)) based on the initial data provided.

### The Hypernetwork Technique for Generating the Benefit Graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\)

The local model information is mainly leveraged in the calculation of \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\). Specifically, there are \(n\) FL-PTs. Each FL-PT \(v_{i}\) has a risk/loss function \(\ell_{i}\): \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}_{+}\). Given a learned hypothesis \(h\in\mathcal{H}\), let the loss vector \(\ell(h)=[\ell_{1},\ldots,\ell_{n}]\) represent the utility loss of the \(n\) FL-PTs under the hypothesis \(h\). The hypothesis \(h\) is considered a Pareto solution if there is no other hypothesis \(h^{\prime}\) that dominates \(h\), i.e.,

\[\nexists h^{\prime}\in\mathcal{H},s.\,t.\,\forall i:\ell_{i}(h^{\prime}) \leqslant\ell_{i}(h)\text{ and }\exists j:\ell_{j}(h^{\prime})<\ell_{j}(h).\] (8)

Let \(r=(r_{1},\ldots,r_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) denote a preference vector which denotes the weight of the objective local model loss that is normalized with \(\sum_{k=1}^{n}r_{k}=1\) and \(r_{k}\geq 0,\forall k\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\). The hypernetwork \(HN\) takes \(r\) as input and outputs a Pareto solution \(h\), i.e.,

\[h\gets HN(\phi,r),\] (9)

where \(\phi\) denotes the parameters of the hypernetwork [23]. For each FL-PT \(v_{i}\), linear scalarization can be used. Like [5; 30], an optimal preference vector \(r_{i}^{*}=\left(r_{i,1}^{*},r_{i,2}^{*},\ldots,r_{i,n}^{*}\right)\) is determined to generate the hypothesis \(h_{i}^{*}\) that minimizes the loss with the data \(\mathcal{\hat{D}}_{i}\). This is expressed as

\[h_{i}^{*}=HN(\phi,r_{i}^{*})\text{ where }r_{i}^{*}=argmin_{r}\mathcal{\hat{L} }_{i}(HN(\phi,r)).\] (10)

Figure 4: Label distribution of CIFAR-100. Colors indicate the labels for each FL-PT/FL-PT.

Figure 3: Label distribution of CIFAR-10. Colors indicate the labels for each FL-PT/FL-PT.

For each FL-PT \(i\), the value of \(r^{*}_{i,j}\) is used as an estimate to the weight of \(v_{j}\) to \(v_{i}\)[5, 26]. \(\{r^{*}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) defines a directed weighted graph, i.e., the benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\).

### Architecture Details

The network architectures used in different datasets are introduced below [5, 14, 15, 30, 34, 42].

#### b.3.1 Cifar-10 & Cifar-100

When it comes to a specific dataset, all approaches have the same network structure for each FL-PT to execute the learning tasks.

Hypernetwork.We construct a hypernetwork that employs a 2-layer hidden MLP to generate the parameters of the target network.

Cifar-10.The target network passes through two convolutional layers, each followed by a \(2\times 2\) max pooling layer. Afterward, the data is flattened and further processed through two fully connected layers, each followed by a LeakyReLU activation function, finally yielding the prediction results.

Cifar-100.Initially, the input data passes through two convolutional layers, activated by ReLU and each followed by a 2x2 max pooling layer to reduce spatial dimensions and highlight important features. After these convolutional and pooling layers, the data is flattened to prepare for dense processing. Subsequently, it is fed into two fully connected layers, each incorporating a ReLU activation function to add non-linearity and improve learning capabilities. The output is finally produced by a linear layer.

#### b.3.2 eICU

We employ a single-layer MLP hypernetwork, while the target network utilizes a Transformer classifier [46] with Layer Normalization [2].

### More Experiments on CIFAR-10 & CIFAR-100

#### b.4.1 Illustrating the Collaboration Relationships in the Benchmark Experiments

Now, we give a representative example to illustrate the collaboration relationships among the 10 FL-PTs and present more details on the experimental results. The experiments are taken with CIFAR-100 under the Dirichlet distribution setting. The competing relationships exist in the following pairs of two nodes: \((v_{0},v_{3})\),\((v_{1},v_{9})\), \((v_{2},v_{7})\), \((v_{3},v_{4})\),\((v_{3},v_{7})\), \((v_{4},v_{6})\), \((v_{4},v_{8})\), \((v_{5},v_{7})\), and \((v_{5},v_{8})\). This is illustrated in Figure 5(a). The final collaboration relationships among FL-PTs are illustrated in Figure 5: Figure 5(b) illustrates the results for FedEgoists while Figure 5(c) illustrates the results for the baseline methods. As shown, FedEgoists can facilitate the collaboration among FL-PTs and thus achieves a better performance.

#### b.4.2 The Effect of Data Heterogeneity

Data heterogeneity is typically simulated by a pathological or Dirichlet distribution. For example, the pathological distribution is used in [5; 42]. In this paper, we conducted experiments on pathological and Dirichlet distributions respectively. In addition, We also verify the effect of the data heterogeneity level on the effectiveness of the proposed solution. Specifically, let \(m\) denote the number of classes. In Dirichlet distribution, there is a distribution vector \(q_{c}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}\) is drawn from the Dirichlet distribution \(Dir_{m}(\beta)\) for each class \(c\) and FL-PT \(v_{i}\) is allocated a \(q_{c,i}\) proportion of data samples of class \(c\); smaller \(\beta\) value results in higher data heterogeneity. We vary the value of \(\beta\) that takes different values in \(\{0.01,0.1,0.5\}\) and conducted the corresponding experiments. The related experimental results are presented in Table 5. It is observed that, in some cases of high data heterogeneity, FedEgoists achieves a performance close to the Local approach; overall, FedEgoists performs the best when it is compared to the baseline approaches.

### Real-world Collaboration Example

Figure 6(a) illustrates the generated benefit graph \(\mathcal{G}_{b}\). Figure 6(b) illustrates the final set \(\pi\) of coalitions returned by Algorithm 1 while Figure 6(c) illustrates the final set \(\pi\) of coalitions of the baseline methods. Still, it is observed that, FedEgoists can facilitate the collaboration among FL-PTs and thus achieves a better performance.

### Synthetic Data

We present our experimental results with synthetic data across different scenarios with fixed competing graphs like [42]. There are \(n=8\) FL-PTs. The synthetic data are generated by \(x\sim\mathcal{U}[-1.0,1.0]\). The noise \(\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}[0.0,0.5^{2}]\) is added to each label. Given the FL-PT \(v_{i}\), the grand truth weights \(u_{i,l}=v+r_{i,l}\) are sampled as \(v\sim\mathcal{U}[0.0,1.0]\) and \(r_{i,l}\sim\mathcal{N}[0.0,\rho^{2}]\) where \(l=1,2,3\); \(\rho^{2}\) measures the data distribution discrepancy among FL-PTs. We set \(\rho=0.01\), which means that the generated data are weakly non-iid in terms of sample features and labels. We construct the hypernetwork using a 1-layer MLP for training the Pareto Front of all objectives. The target network consists of a two-layer linear network. After the first linear layer, a Leaky ReLU activation function is applied.

\end{table}
Table 5: Accuracy comparisons under different \(\beta\) of Dirichlet distribution

**Weakly Non-IID setting.** The same regression task is learned by all FL-PTs and the synthetic labels are defined as:

\[y=\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^{3}u_{i,k}^{T}x^{k}+\epsilon.\] (11)

FL-PTs \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\), \(v_{5}\) and \(v_{6}\) have 2000 samples whose amount is large, while the other FL-PTs have 100 samples whose amount is small. Thus, there exists quantity skew, i.e., a significant difference in the sample quantities of FL-PTs. Two large FL-PTs \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) are independent and competes with the other two large FL-PTs \(v_{5}\) and \(v_{6}\) that are independent. Each small FL-PT competes one large FL-PT: \((v_{1},v_{7})\), \((v_{2},v_{8})\), \((v_{3},v_{5})\), and \((v_{4},v_{6})\) are edges in the competing graph \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\). Such \(\mathcal{G}_{c}\) leads to a unique clique cover. Under this setting, small FL-PTs benefit large FL-PTs little. The experiments results (measured by mean squared error (MSE)) are given in Table 6.

**Strongly Non-IID setting.** We generate conflicting learning tasks by flipping over the labels of some FL-PTs:

\[y=\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^{3}u_{i,k}^{T}x^{k}+\epsilon,i\in\{1,2,3,4\}\] (12) \[y=-\sum\nolimits_{k=1}^{3}u_{i,k}^{T}x^{k}+\epsilon,i\in\{5,6,7,8\}\] (13)

Different from the Weakly Non-IID setting, each FL-PT has 2000 samples, implying that there is no quantity skew. The setting of flipped labels between Eq. (12) and (13) leads to strongly Non-IID among the eight FL-PTs. We test on a different competing graph where there are two independent groups of FL-PTs \(\{v_{i}\}_{i=1}^{4}\) and \(\{v_{i}\}_{i=5}^{8}\): for \(i\in\{1,5\}\), the FL-PTs \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{i+1}\) are independent and compete with \(v_{i+2}\) and \(v_{i+3}\) that are independent. Under this setting, all FL-PTs can benefit each other. The experiments results are given in Table 7.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: As stated in the last part of the abstract and introduction, we clearly summarized the contribution and scope of this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the section 1 Introduction, we discuss in detail for improvement and limitations of the methods presented in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: It can be seen from Section 3 Model and Assumptions. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification:We provide detailed experimental settings, datasets to achieve reproducibility. See Section 5 Evaluation. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification:The code used in the experiments is openly accessible.. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification:We have provided detailed experimental settings. See Section 5.1 Experimental Setup and Appendix B.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided the standard deviation of the results in the experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the B.7, We have provided detailed experimental environment. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research fully adheres to the NeurIPS Code in all aspects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our work focuses on building a FL ecosystem that can be applied to real-life business scenarios. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: When comparing with the baseline algorithm, its code was used and this article was cited. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new data collection was done. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No crowdsourcing or conducted research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: No research with Human Subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
