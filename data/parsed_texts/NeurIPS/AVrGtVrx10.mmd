###### Abstract

Multimodal models trained on modality-complete data are plagued with severe performance degradation when encountering modality-missing data. Prevalent cross-modal knowledge distillation-based methods precisely align the representation of modality-missing data and that of its modality-complete counterpart to enhance robustness. However, due to the irreparable information asymmetry, this determinate alignment is too stringent, easily inducing modality-missing features to capture spurious factors erroneously. In this paper, a novel multimodal Probabilistic Conformal Distillation (PCD) method is proposed, which considers the inherent indeterminacy in this alignment. Given a modality-missing input, our goal is to learn the unknown Probability Density Function (PDF) of the mapped variables in the modality-complete space, rather than relying on the brute-force point alignment. Specifically, PCD models the modality-missing feature as a probabilistic distribution, enabling it to satisfy two characteristics of the PDF. One is the extremes of probabilities of modality-complete feature points on the PDF, and the other is the geometric consistency between the modeled distributions and the peak points of different PDFs. Extensive experiments on a range of benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of PCD over state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at: https://github.com/mxchen-mc/PCD.

## 1 Introduction

Classical multimodal learning [29; 20; 36; 3] typically pre-supposes that the modalities of all data are complete throughout both the training and testing. However, due to collection constraints such as device limitations, budget constraints, and restrained working conditions, it is challenging to guarantee such a perfect condition [47]. When modalities are partially available, the performance of models trained on modality-complete data will deteriorate remarkably. This thereby attracts a range of explorations contributed recently, given that multimodal learning is playing an increasing role.

The existing approaches to address this problem generally fall into two paradigms, i.e., independent modeling [11; 39; 7] and unified modeling [9; 13; 46] for different modality-missing combinations, of which the latter is preferred due to the merits of low-storage cost and flexibility. As one prevalent line of unified modeling, cross-modal knowledge distillation (KD) has achieved persistent advancements in recent years [40; 51; 47; 46]. It attempts to guide the modality-missing representation to align with its modality-complete counterpart, facilitating the training under the guidance of privileged modality-complete information. However, these methods fail to consider that once a modality is missing, it is impossible to recover its personalized information via a brute-force alignment, whichhas been revealed theoretically by [18]. Roughly ignoring this inherent information asymmetry in the alignment can instead lead multimodal models to fit spurious factors erroneously.

We conjecture that when partial modalities are missing, the retaining information is merely correlated to that of modality-complete input in a probabilistic sense. Specifically, given a modality-missing input, the unknown Probability Density Function (PDF) of its mapped variables in the modality-complete space peaks at the corresponding modality-complete feature and diminishes when diverging away from this point, as illustrated in Figure 1 (b). Compared to previous deterministic methods, learning the PDF is a more reasonable and tolerant way to transfer privileged information. Although the closed form of the oracle PDF is unknown, we can approximate it by modeling a probabilistic distribution with two key characteristics: (1) In a modeled distribution, the positive points closer to the modality-complete representation should demonstrate high probabilities and the negative points farther away should exhibit low probabilities. (2) For different distributions from distinct samples, the relation of their peak points should be conformal with that of their modality-complete representations. Here, the former focuses on extreme probability points, while the latter ensures geometric consistency.

With the above intuition, we propose a novel multimodal Probabilistic Conformal Distillation (PCD) method, which aims to align the modality-missing feature with its modality-complete counterpart probabilistically. Specifically, PCD parameterizes each modality-missing representation as an independent probabilistic distribution and optimizes it to satisfy the two characteristics. To achieve (1), the log probabilities of the distribution are maximized at positive points and minimized at negative points. To achieve (2), PCD introduces a contrastive-learning-based approach to align the geometric structure of the peak points of distributions with that of the modality-complete features. In this way, the modeled modality-missing distributions can approximate their corresponding PDFs, thereby facilitating the privileged modality-complete information transfer more efficiently.

In a nutshell, our contributions can be summarized as follows:

* We propose a multimodal Probabilistic Conformal Distillation method to handle the missing modality problem, which transfers privileged information of modality-complete representation by considering the indeterminacy in the mapping from incompleteness to completeness.
* We parameterize different modality-missing representations as distinct distributions to fit their unknown PDFs in the modality-complete space. This is specially realized by considering the probabilities of extreme points and ensuring the geometric consistency between peak points of different PDFs and modeled distributions.
* We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of PCD across a range of modality-missing scenarios. Extensive comparison on multimodal classification and segmentation tasks consistently validate the superior performance of our method compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. Particularly, PCD achieves an average improvement of about 5% for the seven modality-missing scenarios on the classification dataset CeFA.

## 2 Related Work

We roughly categorize recent explorations to improve the missing modality robustness into two paradigms: independent modeling methods and unified modeling methods.

### Independent Modeling for Missing Modality

Many works address the modality-missing problem by training specific models for different modality-missing combinations [41; 10; 31; 26]. In a certain modality-missing case, some approaches recon

Figure 1: In a two-modality scenario, when both modalities are present, the modality-complete representation is derived through fusion. When one modality is absent, the mapped representation inferred from the remaining modality is subject to a certain probability distribution in the modality-complete space.

struct the original data of the missing modalities from the available ones [2; 22; 28; 28]. However, the complexity of the data reconstruction usually leads to instability and may introduce noise to affect the main task [30; 52]. To alleviate this problem, many works try to reconstruct missing modalities at the representation level [11; 39; 7; 5]. Nevertheless, training specific models for each missing case tend to be inflexible and storage-consuming for real-world scenarios.

### Unified Modeling for Missing Modality

Recently, there has been a growing interest in improving the robustness of unified multimodal models against a range of modality-missing combinations [56; 33; 21; 19]. To achieve this goal, some methods attempt to extract redundant information across modalities by designing different _fusion_ networks [15; 53; 9; 50]. However, these methods ignore the complementary information, resulting in suboptimal performance to the specific models. Other methods capture the comprehensive information through dynamical fusion strategies [13; 14; 12; 6]. To be specific, these methods utilize uncertainty estimation techniques to learn the dynamical strength relationships among modalities within different samples, allowing for the adaptive assignment of weights to each available modality. To harness both redundant and complementary information of available modalities more effectively, some methods [32; 51; 47; 46] introduce a _distillation_ loss to guide the unified model to imitate representations or inter-sample relations of the modality-complete model. This distillation process help the unified model acquire additional privileged information from complete modalities, so as to improve multimodal robustness [44; 43; 45; 42]. However, previous KD-based methods often emphasize precisely aligning the modality-missing representation with its complete counterpart, which probably causes the overfitting on spurious features due to the inherent information asymmetry.

## 3 Method

### Preliminary

**Notations.** Suppose that we have a modality-complete training set of \(\{(\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\), where each input \(\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star}\) comprises \(M\) modalities, denoted as \(\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star}=\{x_{i}^{m}\}_{m=1}^{M}\), and \(y_{i}\) represents the corresponding ground-truth label. \(N\) is the dataset size. Our goal is to train a unified model capable of accurately predicting the label \(y_{i}\) for any modality-missing case \(\mathrm{x}_{i}\subseteq\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star}\quad\mathrm{x}_{i}\neq\varnothing\). Here, we use an auxiliary indicator vector \(\delta_{i}\) for \(\mathrm{x}_{i}\), where \(\forall m,\ \delta_{i}^{m}\in\{0,\ 1\}\) indicates the modality in \(\mathrm{x}_{i}\) missing or not. During testing, we construct different modality-missing cases to comprehensively evaluate the robustness.

**Motivation.** Owing to the inherent information asymmetry, modality-complete and modality-missing representations cannot be perfectly aligned, even with redundant information. This claim is experientially supported by the results in Appendix D. Therefore, we try to align the representation of modality-missing input \(\mathrm{x}_{i}\) with that of modality-complete input \(\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star}\) in a probabilistic sense. As shown in the right panel of Figure 1, we conjecture that the representation \(z_{i}\) of modality-missing input \(\mathrm{x}_{i}\) has a probabilistic peak expectation towards the representation \(z_{i}^{\star}\) of the modality-complete input \(\mathrm{x}_{i}^{\star}\). In other words, the corresponding PDF \(p(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\) satisfies the following requirement

\[z_{i}^{\star}=\arg\max_{z_{i}\in Z}\ p(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i}),\] (1)

where \(Z\) denotes the representation space. Generally, approximating the unknown PDF \(p(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\) is a more relaxed condition compared with the stringent point alignment in previous KD-based methods.

### Probabilistic Conformal Distillation

#### 3.2.1 Objective

Although \(p(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\) is unknown, even about the function family of the distribution, we can define an easier distribution \(q(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\) to approximate its characteristics. Specifically, we can force \(q(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\) to follow the two-fold characteristics: 1) _extremum property._ In a modeled distribution \(q(z_{i}|\mathrm{x}_{i})\), positive points near the modality-complete representation \(z_{i}^{\star}\) should exhibit higher probabilities, and negative points distant from \(z_{i}^{\star}\) approach far smaller probabilities. (2) _conformal property._ Given different samples, the relationship of the peak points of \(q(z|\mathrm{x})\) should be conformal with that of their corresponding modality-complete points \(z^{\star}\).

RGB-D dataset designed for urban scene comprehension. There are 5,000 annotated samples, where 2,975 samples are for training, 500 for validation, and 1,525 for testing.

Experimental Details.For classification CASIA-SURF and CeFA, the SGD optimizer [34] is used and the batch size is 64. The dimension of the Gaussian distribution is 512. We report the results using the metric of Average Classification Error Rate (ACER). Each modality leverages a separate ResNet-18 [17] as the unimodal encoder. We employ an exponential decay learning rate strategy in which the learning rate is fixed at 1e-3 during the warm-up stage and then decays exponentially. Weight decay and momentum are set to 0.0005 and 0.9, respectively. For segmentation experiments on NYUv2 and Cityscapes, we use the Adam optimizer [25] and set the batch size to 16. The results are evaluated by the metric of mean IOU (mIOU). The learning rate is initialized with 1e-2 and 1e-4 respectively for two datasets and adapted by the one-cycle scheduler. Following [46], we use ESANet [36] as the backbone. On all datasets, the variances are obtained through a two-layer MLP, where the hidden size is 1024. During training, we augment each modality-complete data by simulating all potential modality-missing scenarios and randomly sample one of the augmented data as the training sample for the current epoch. For bimodal datasets, three cases are included, that is, missing RGB, missing depth, and complete. For trimodal datasets, there are seven missing cases.

### Performance Comparison

To evaluate the robustness of PCD, we choose the following methods in the comparison: 1) Baselines. Traditional [49; 36]: a benchmark method trained solely on modality-complete data. Separate Model [49; 36]: separate intermediate-fusion models for each modality combination. 2) Redundancy-based methods: Augmentation [1], MMFormer [50]. 3) Cross-modal KD-based methods: MMIN [51], MMANET [46]. 4) Dynamical fusion-based methods: MD [12], ETMC [14], RAML [6].

**Classification Task.** The results in Table 1 show the performance of PCD and other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across various testing conditions with missing modalities on two classification datasets CASIA-SURF and CeFA. We can see that the 'Traditional' method, which is exclusively trained on modality-complete samples, exhibits a high sensitivity to the missing modality problem. Specifically, the error rate surges by 21.63% on CASIA-SURF when only the RGB modality is available. Comparing the results of various missing modality methods, PCD achieves the best results in almost all the settings on the two multimodal classification datasets. In comparison to the second-best method, PCD demonstrates the error rate reductions of 1.01% and 5.31% on CASIA-SURF and CeFA. These results illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in privileged information transfer. Besides, the performance of some methods declines with an increasing number of modalities. For example, on CeFA, the error rate of MMANET with complete modalities is 0.81% higher than when IR is absent. This deterioration may potentially caused by overfitting resulting from deterministic alignment. In contrast, our method employs a probabilistic distillation, which introduces a more relaxed framework for aligning representations, mitigating this issue effectively.

**Segmentation Task.** We conducte experiments on NYUv2 and Cityscapes to verify the effectiveness of PCD on segmentation tasks. Compared to the second-best method, PCD achieves average accuracy improvements of 0.91% and 0.83% on NYUv2 and Cityscapes, respectively. Furthermore, in the Depth-missing scenarios on the NYUv2 and Cityscapes datasets, PCD demonstrates relatively small improvements. This may be because that the performance of the input RGB is already very close to that of the modality-complete input. Consequently, it is challenging to obtain additional privileged information through distillation, limiting the potential enhancement.

### Further Analysis

**Ablation on Loss Components.** In this part, we investigate the impact of each loss component in Eq. (10) on CeFA. In Table 2, we conduct the ablation study and summarize the corresponding performance with or without different loss components. According to the results in Table 2, we can observe that the classification model with the probability extremum loss \(\mathcal{L}_{u}\) performs 3.36% better than the simple model with only \(\mathcal{L}_{c}\), which suggests that constraining probabilities of extreme points indeed helps to the privileged information transfer from the modality-complete teacher to the modality-missing student. Additionally, PCD with all loss components outperforms the model with \(\mathcal{L}_{c}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{u}\) on average, which validates the effectiveness of the geometric consistency loss.

**Ablation on Probabilistic Distillation.** To study the effect of probabilistic distillation, we conduct experiments to compare the performance of PCD with its determinate distillation variant. Here, the variant is the degradation method of PCD that transfers knowledge by directly minimizing the Euclidean distance of the complete-incomplete pairs in teacher and student networks. The results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that PCD consistently

outperforms its "Determinate" variant in all missing modality combinations and decreases the error rate by 8.36% on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of transferring privileged information via probabilistic distillation, which is more tolerant.

**Analysis about KD Strategy.** To explore the effectiveness of self-KD, we compare PCD with its pretrained teacher variant. This variant refers to training a modality-complete teacher individually to guide students in optimizing from scratch. The results are shown in Table 3. As can be seen, the error rate of PCD is 5.71% lower on average than its pretrained variant. In addition to training a fixed teacher to offer modality-complete supervision, our self-KD strategy also provides a good initialization for the student. With the help of the shared predictor, the semantic coherence of modality-complete and modality-missing representations is indirectly ensured, which narrows information gap between them at the beginning of KD, thereby facilitating privileged information transfer.

**Classification Boundary of the Teacher and Student.** In order to further validate the effectiveness of probabilistic distillation for the transfer of privileged complete-modality information, we analyze the predictions of both the fixed teacher obtained from the warm-up stage and the distilled student under all multimodal conditions. The results are shown in Figure 3. It can be observed that, apart from the reduced error rate, the logits of the student exhibit a higher concentration around 0 or 1, demonstrating a more separable inter-class boundary. The probabilistic distillation process transfers privileged information to hard samples around the classification boundary in a more tolerant way, mitigating the erroneous fit to spurious factors, so as to further refine modality-missing features.

**Hyperparameter \(\lambda\).** The hyperparameter \(\lambda\) controls the balance between distillation and classification. To validate the stability of PCD against \(\lambda\), we conducted several experiments with different values of \(\lambda\) on CeFA. The results are shown in the left half of Figure 4, where values of \(\lambda\) range from 1.4 to 2.4. From the curve, we can see that setting a relatively large value for \(\lambda\) enhances the distillation of privileged information, thereby enhancing the multimodal robustness. Specifically, in [1.4, 2.2], \(\lambda\) appears to be insensitive within a certain range, In our experiments, we set \(\lambda=1.8\).

**Hyperparameter \(\tau\).** In the right panel of Figure 4, we conducted several experiments with different values of \(\tau\) to assess its impact on our results. The hyperparameters \(\tau\) is the temperature in Equation (8), which scales the similarity measures. The results reveal \(\tau\) is insensitive within a certain range. In our experiments, we set \(\tau=0.5\).

**Computational Overhead.** Compared to the multimodal models with the same backbone, PCD only introduces _a few additional head modules_ in the encoder to estimate the variance. To demonstrate the minor change PCD brings, we estimated the number of parameters and FLOPs of PCD and the other three late fusion methods in Table 4. It can be seen that PCD does not significantly increase the number of parameters or FLOPs, where the FLOPs are almost equal to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c c} \hline \hline Method & Backbone & Paramters & FLOPs \\ \hline MD [12] & ResNet-18 & 35.88 & 1.392 \\ ETMC [14] & ResNet-18 & 34.30 & 1.391 \\ RAML [6] & ResNet-18 & 35.09 & 1.393 \\ PCD & ResNet-18 & 38.50 & 1.395 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

the second-best method MMANET, while the number of parameters only increased by 4.20M. This lightweight change of MPCD makes it easily be applied to many existing multimodal fusion methods.

Modality-Missing Training Data.All the experiments above are conducted with the modality-complete training data. In this part, we extend PCD by considering the scenario where the modality-complete data of some training samples is also unavailable. PCD is only applied to the data that has modality-complete counterpart, and for the remaining data, only \(\mathcal{L}_{t}\) is optimized. Here, we introduce a case where 30% of the data is consistently missing from each modality during training. As shown in Table 5, while some modality-missing cases may underperform compared to the SOTA, PCD still outperforms the second-best method by 5.20% on average. Although PCD is not specifically designed for modality-missing training data, these results demonstrate its scalability for such scenarios.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a multimodal Probabilistic Distillation (PCD) method to mitigate the missing modality problem, which considers the indeterminacy in the alignment between the modality-complete and modality-missing representations. Specifically, PCD aims to parameterize the modality-missing representations as different Gaussian distributions and fit PDFs of their mapped variables in the modality-complete space. This is achieved by ensuring the characteristics of probabilities at extreme points and maintaining geometric consistency with that of the modality-complete features. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of PCD in increasing multimodal robustness.

## Appendix B Implement Details

### Classification

**Network Architecture.** For a fair comparison, we follow the basic implementation of the traditional multimodal model in [49] for all the comparison methods. This backbone is a late fusion network with separate ResNet18 encoders for each modality. Here, for PCD, we parameterize the unimodal features from unimodal encoders and the fused multimodal features from the fusion module as independent Gaussian distributions, and make them fit their PDFs by optimizing corresponding \(\mathcal{L}_{u}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{g}\). The variance is obtained for a two-layer MLP, where the hidden size is 1024. In addition, like [6], by analyzing the variance in unimodal distributions, a weighting mechanism is employed, which can adaptively aggregate the information of each available unimodality.

**Setup.** We augment modality-complete samples by simulating all potential missing modality scenarios equally. In other words, in one epoch, each sample has an equal probability of randomly encountering one of seven missing modality scenarios. Besides, random flipping, rotation, and cropping are also used for data augmentation. All models are optimized by an SGD for 110 epochs with a mini-batch of 64. Weight decay and momentum are set to 0.0005 and 0.9, respectively. The learning rate is initialized to 0.001. After the warm-up stage, an exponential decay learning rate strategy is employed, in which the decay coefficient is 0.9. The dimension of the Gaussian distribution is 512. The hyper-parameters \(\lambda,\tau\) are 1.8 and 0.5, respectively.

### Segmentation

**Network Architecture.** We use the ESANet [36] as the backbone, which is an early fusion network. The modality encoder is the ResNet50 with Nbt1 used in ESANet. For PCD, we parameterize the fused multimodal features from the last three resolution stages as independent Gaussian distributions. Notice that, since the dimensionality of multimodal features is very high, only one negative vector in Equation (8) is selected to conserve computational resources, and this formulation degenerates to the triplet loss. Besides, \(\mathcal{L}_{u}\) is applied to the fused features after average pooling.

**Setup.** Random flipping, rotation, cropping and missing modality simulation are used for data augmentation. All models are optimized by an Adam for 450 epochs with a mini-batch of 16. Thelearning rate is initialized to 0.01 and the warm-up epoch is set as 150. After the warm-up stage, a cosine annealing learning rate strategy is employed.

## Appendix C Stability Experiments

In Table 6, we detail the stability experiments for PCD across all datasets. Each experiment is repeated for three times to ensure reliability, allowing to calculate the average score along with the standard deviation. The results reveal that, even in its worst-case scenario, PCD outperforms the best competing methods, registering average improvements of 0.87% on NYUv2, 0.72% on Cityscapes, 0.76% on CASIA-SURF, and a significant 3.13% on CeFA. These outcomes not only underscore PCD's superior performance but also attest to its stability and consistency across a wide range of testing conditions. This consistent reliability highlights the robustness and adaptability of PCD, making it an effective solution in varied scenarios.

## Appendix D The Visualization of Feature distribution

We use t-SNE to visualize the distribution of the modality-complete, RGB, Depth, and IR representations of the unified model without PCD distillation on CASIA-SURF. The results are shown in

\begin{table}

Figure 5. It can be observed that each unimodal distribution is similar but different to the modality-complete distribution, which provides empirical evidence for PCD to consider the indeterminacy in the mapping from incompleteness to completeness.

## Appendix E Ablation Study

### Ablation Study on Loss Components

We further conduct ablation studies to evaluate the effects of different loss components on the NYUv2, Cityscapes, CASIA-SURF, and CeFA datasets, as presented in Table 7. Notably, incorporating any of the loss components yields substantial improvements, particularly with the CeFA dataset. When applied separately, \(\mathcal{L}_{u}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{g}\) each contributed to an average accuracy improvement of 3.36% and 3.51% respectively. These results underscore the significance of constraining probabilities of extreme points for enhancing the transfer of privileged information. Overall, the PCD model achieves optimal performance when it incorporates all proposed loss components.

### Analysis of Hyperparameter \(\lambda\)

To further assess the stability of the PCD model in response to various \(\lambda\) parameters, we report its average performance across the CASIA-SURF and CeFA datasets, as illustrated in the left panel of Figure 6. The performance curve demonstrates that PCD maintains considerable stability across a range of \(\lambda\) values, where the performance variance is kept within 0.8. Notably, PCD consistently outperforms SOTA models on all datasets when the \(\lambda\) value is between 1.6 and 2. Based on these observations, we have set \(\lambda\) to 1.8 throughout our classification experiments to ensure optimal performance and stability. This consistent outperformance underscores the robustness of the PCD model under varying conditions.

### Analysis of Hyperparameter \(\tau\)

In the right panel of Figure 6, we conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the impact of different values of the hyperparameter \(\tau\) on the performance of PCD on the multimodal classification datasets CASIA-SURF and CeFA. This hyperparameter, which acts as the temperature coefficient in Equation (8), is used to scale the similarity measures. The experimental findings indicate that the performance of the model is relatively insensitive to variations in \(\tau\) within a certain range. Based on our results, we chose to set \(\tau\) to 0.5 for all subsequent experiments to ensure an optimal balance between performance and parameter sensitivity.

Figure 6: The average performance of PCD under different \(\lambda\) and \(\tau\) values on CASIA-SURF and CeFA.

### Analysis of Warm-up

Warm-up stage learns to provide complete modality supervision and a good initialization for the subsequent training process. In this part, we investigate the impact of varying warm-up epochs on probabilistic distillation. The experimental results in Table 8 emphasize the importance of judiciously setting the warm-up epoch. The experimental results show that PCD is not sensitive to the number of warm-up epochs. Within the range of 30 to 80, the average result is around 23%, consistently outperforming the SOTA. We set the number of warm-up epochs to 50 for the classification tasks.

## Appendix F Results on SUN RGB-D Dataset

To further confirm the effectiveness of PCD on segmentation tasks, we conduct experiments on a larger dataset, SUN RGB-D [38]. This dataset has 37 categories of objects and contains 5,285 RGB-Depth pairs for training and 5050 pairs for testing. The results are shown in Table 9. We can see that PCD is effective even on a larger segmented dataset.

## Appendix G Exploration on Modality-Missing Training Data

In Table 10, we conduct experiments on PCD against multiple SOTAs on the scenarios of training data with missing modalities. Specifically, we evaluated the performance on both the CASIA-SURF and CeFA datasets, where each modality of the training data has either 30% or 40% of its data missing. The results clearly indicate that PCD outperforms all other methods at both rates. Notably, PCD shows a significant performance improvement on CeFA, with a gap of 5.39% under the 30% missing modality condition and 5.10% under the 40% missing modality condition. These results indicate that although PCD is not specifically designed for modality-missing training data, it is still scalable for this scenario.

## Appendix H Limitations and Future Explorations

This paper introduces a probabilistic alignment approach between modality-complete and modality-missing representations to enhance the effective transfer of privileged information. The proposed method is primarily designed for scenarios where all training samples are modality-complete, and modality-missing occurs exclusively during testing. If modality-missing data is present during training, knowledge distillation cannot be applied to the modality-missing subset of the data. Therefore, in the future, scenarios with missing data during training will be further the focus of our consideration.

## Appendix I Impact Statements

The method proposed in this paper can effectively improve the robustness of the multimodal model. This exploration is of great significance to the real-world inference scenarios that can not always obtain modality-complete data, such as healthcare and automatic driving. Compared to previous methods, PCD does not add a lot of parameters and effectively saves computational costs. So far, we have not discovered any negative impacts of this method.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction part clearly reflect the main contribution. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitation is discussed in Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: There are no included theoretical results in this work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provides a detailed description of the experimental settings in Section 4 and Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [NA]  Justification: The code will be released once the paper is published. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The details are provided in Section 4 and Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: For the overall presentation of the paper, we do not provide the numerical experiment's statistical significance, which is also consistent with concurrent works. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have read and strictly followed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such safeguard risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper appropriately cites the original paper that produced the code package and considered the dataset in Section 4 and Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
