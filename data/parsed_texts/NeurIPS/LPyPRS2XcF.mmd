###### Abstract

We study episodic linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition and adversarial rewards under full-information feedback, employing _dynamic regret_ as the performance measure. We start with in-depth analyses of the strengths and limitations of the two most popular methods: occupancy-measure-based and policy-based methods. We observe that while the occupancy-measure-based method is effective in addressing non-stationary environments, it encounters difficulties with the unknown transition. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with the unknown transition effectively but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. Building on this, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the benefits of both methods. Specifically, it employs (i) an _occupancy-measure-based global optimization_ with a two-layer structure to handle non-stationary environments; and (ii) a _policy-based variance-aware value-targeted regression_ to tackle the unknown transition. We bridge these two parts by a novel conversion. Our algorithm enjoys an \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}K}+\sqrt{HK(H+\overline{P_{K}})})\) dynamic regret, where \(d\) is the feature dimension, \(H\) is the episode length, \(K\) is the number of episodes, \(\overline{P}_{K}\) is the non-stationarity measure. We show it is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors by establishing a matching lower bound. To the best of our knowledge, this is the _first_ work that achieves _near-optimal_ dynamic regret for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure.

## 1 Introduction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) studies the problem where a learner interacts with the environments and aims to maximize the cumulative reward (Sutton and Barto, 2018), which has achieved significant success in games (Silver et al., 2016), robotics (Kober et al., 2013), large language model (Ouyang et al., 2022) and so on. The interaction is usually modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Research on MDPs can be broadly divided into two lines based on the reward generation mechanism. The first line of work (Jaksch et al., 2010; Azar et al., 2013, 2017; He et al., 2021) considers the stochastic MDPs where the reward is sampled from a fixed distribution. In many real-world scenarios, however, the assumption of fixed reward distributions may not hold, as rewards can vary over time. This motivates the study on adversarial MDPs (Even-Dar et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009; Zimin and Neu, 2013; Jin et al., 2020), where rewards might change in an adversarial manner. To address the challenges of large-scale MDPs, recent studies have extended these two frameworks to incorporate function approximation, allowing RL algorithms to handle large state and action spaces. Two popular models are linear mixture MDPs (Ayoub et al., 2020) and linear MDPs (Jin et al., 2020).

In this work, we focus on linear mixture MDPs with adversarial rewards, unknown transition and full-information feedback. Though significant advances have been achieved for this setting (Cai et al., 2020; He et al., 2022), they choose _static regret_ as the performance measure, which benchmarks thelearner's policies \(\pi_{1},\ldots,\pi_{K}\) against the _best-fixed_ policy in hindsight, namely,

\[\mathrm{Reg}_{K}=\max_{\pi\in\Pi}\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{\pi}(s_{k,1})-\sum_{k=1}^ {K}V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1}),\] (1)

where \(V_{k,1}^{\pi}(s_{k,1})\) is the expected cumulative reward of policy \(\pi\) starting from initial state \(s_{k,1}\) at episode \(k\) and \(\Pi\) is the policy set. While static regret is a natural choice for online MDPs, the best-fixed policy may perform poorly when the rewards change adversarially. To this end, an enhanced measure called _dynamic regret_ is proposed in the literature (Zhao et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023), which benchmarks the learner's policies against a sequence of _changing_ policies. This measure is defined as

\[\mathrm{D}\mathrm{-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}^{c}}( s_{k,1})-\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1}),\] (2)

where \(\pi_{1}^{c},\ldots,\pi_{K}^{c}\) is any sequence of policies in the policy set that can be chosen with complete foreknowledge of online reward functions. The dynamic regret in (2) is a stronger notation as it recovers the static regret in (1) directly by setting \(\pi_{1:K}^{c}\in\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\pi\in\Pi}\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{ \pi}(s_{k,1})\). An ideal dynamic regret bound should scale with a certain variation quantity of compared policies denoted by \(P_{K}(\pi_{1}^{c},\ldots,\pi_{K}^{c})\) or \(\bar{P}_{K}(\pi_{1}^{c},\ldots,\pi_{K}^{c})\) that can reflect the degree of environmental non-stationarity.

While the flexibility of dynamic regret makes it well-suited for adversarial settings, it also presents significant challenges. The dynamic regret of _tabular_ MDPs with full-information feedback has been thoroughly studied by Zhao et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2024), who achieved optimal dependence on \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\) for the known and unknown transition settings, respectively, _without_ requiring prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure. However, the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs is still understudied. With the prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure, Zhong et al. (2021) proposed a policy optimization algorithm with the restart strategy (Zhao et al., 2020), achieving a result with suboptimal dependence in \(H\), \(K\) and \(P_{K}\). Later, Li et al. (2023) significantly improved their results by designing an algorithm with the optimal dynamic regret in \(K\) and \(P_{K}\), though the dependence on \(H\) remains suboptimal. For the more challenging scenarios where non-stationarity is _unknown_, Li et al. (2023) made an initial solution by introducing a two-layer policy optimization algorithm, albeit with an additional term in the dynamic regret involving the switching number of the best base-learner. To address this limitation, Li et al. (2024) developed an occupancy-measure-based algorithm with two-layer structure that achieves optimal dynamic regret in \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\). However, their result incurs a _polynomial_ dependence on the state space size \(S\), which is statistically undesirable.

In this work, we propose an algorithm that achieves the _near-optimal_ dynamic regret in \(d\), \(H\), \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\) simultaneously for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition, without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure. We begin with in-depth analyses of the strengths and limitations of two most popular methods: occupancy-measure-based and policy-based methods. We find that while the occupancy-measure-based method is effective in addressing the non-stationary environments, it encounter difficulties with the unknown transition. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with the unknown transition effectively but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that combines the benefits of both

methods. Specifically, our algorithm employs (i) an _occupancy-measure-based global optimization_ with a two-layer framework to handle the non-stationary environments; and (ii) a _policy-based variance-aware value-targeted regression_ to handle the unknown transition. We bridge these two parts through a novel conversion. We show our algorithm achieves an \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{H^{3}K}+\sqrt{HK(H+P_{K})})\) dynamic regret and prove it is minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors by establishing a matching lower bound. Table 1 presents the comparison between our result and previous works. Our result surpasses all previous results, even those that require prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure.

We note a similar combination was firstly employed in Ji et al. (2024), but for distinctly different purposes. In their work, the occupancy-measure-based component is used to provide a horizon-free (independent of horizon length \(H\)) static regret whereas our objective is to address non-stationary environments. One limitation of this hybrid approach is the computational complexity, which is dominated by the occupancy-measure-based component and thus expensive compared to policy-based method. This issue is the inherent challenge for occupancy-measure-based method and also appears in several studies (Zhao et al., 2023; Ji et al., 2024; Jie et al., 2024). Nevertheless, our analyses suggest that the occupancy-measure-based method offers unique advantages in handling non-stationary environments. Investigating whether similar results can be attained by other computationally efficient methods is an important future work. We believe our work represents a significant step forward, as it is reasonable to prioritize achieving _statistical optimality_ before focusing on computational efficiency.

**Organization.** We review the related work in Section 2 and formulates the setup in Section 3. We analyze the challenges and introduce our algorithm in Section 4 and present the dynamic regret in Section 5. Section 6 concludes the paper. Due to the page limits, we defer all proofs to the appendices.

**Notations.** We denote by \([n]\) the set \(\{1,\dots,n\}\) and define \([x]_{[a,b]}=\min\{\max\{x,a\},b\}\). For vector \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) and positive semi-definite matrix \(\Sigma\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\), define \(\|x\|_{\Sigma}=\sqrt{x^{\top}\Sigma x}\). For policies \(\pi\) and \(\pi^{\prime}\), define \(\|\pi-\pi^{\prime}\|_{1,\infty}=\max_{s}\|\pi(\cdot|s)-\pi^{\prime}(\cdot|s)\|_ {1}\). The notation \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\cdot)\) hides all polylogarithmic factors.

## 2 Related Work

In this section, we review related works on the dynamic regret of MDPs in non-stationary environments. The studies can be divided into two lines: non-stationary stochastic MDPs and non-stationary adversarial MDPs. These two categories address distinct challenges and are studied separately.

**Non-stationary Stochastic MDPs.** Non-stationary stochastic MDPs address scenarios where transitions and rewards are stochastically generated from _varying distributions_. The non-stationarity measure is typically defined as the total variation of the transitions or rewards over time. For infinite-horizon MDPs, the seminal work of Jaksch et al. (2010) investigates the piecewise stationary setting where both the transitions and rewards are subject to changes at specific time and remain fixed in between. Ortner et al. (2019) further advance the field by allowing for changes at every step. Subsequently, Cheung et al. (2020) introduce the Bandit-over-RL algorithm, which addresses the limitations of earlier works by eliminating the need for prior knowledge about the non-stationarity. Additional advancements have been made in episodic non-stationary MDPs (Mao et al., 2021; Domingues et al., 2021) and episodic non-stationary linear MDPs (Touati and Vincent, 2020; Zhou et al., 2022). A breakthrough is the black-box method by Wei and Luo (2021), which can transform any algorithm with the optimal static regret under certain conditions, into another one that achieves optimal dynamic regret without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity. However, this method is _inapplicable_ in adversarial settings. The limitation arises from its dependence on an optimistic estimator, constructed via a Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)-based algorithm for environmental change detection, a technique that performs well in stochastic environments but is less effective in adversarial scenarios.

**Non-stationary Adversarial MDPs.** Non-stationary adversarial MDPs consider settings where the rewards are generated in an _adversarial_ manner. The non-stationarity measure is defined as the variation of _arbitrary_ changing compared policies, allowing the policy to adapt to non-stationary environments implicitly. An illustrative difference between non-stationary stochastic and adversarial MDPs is that, in some cases, even if the rewards and transitions change over time, the optimal policy may remain fixed. The dynamic regret of _tabular_ MDPs with full-information feedback has been thoroughly studied by Zhao et al. (2022) and Li et al. (2024), who achieved optimal dependence on \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\) for the known and unknown transition settings respectively, _without_ requiring prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure. However, the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs is still understudied. With the prior knowledge about the non-stationarity measure, Zhong et al. (2021) proposed a policy optimization algorithm with restart strategy (Zhao et al., 2020), achieving a result with suboptimal dependence in \(H\), \(K\) and \(P_{K}\). Later, Li et al. (2023) significantly improved their results by designing an algorithm with optimal dynamic regret in terms of \(K\) and \(P_{K}\), though the dependence on \(H\) remains suboptimal. For the more challenging scenarios where non-stationarity is _unknown_, Li et al. (2023) made an initial solution by introducing a two-layer policy optimization algorithm, albeit with an additional term in the dynamic regret involving the switching number of the best base-learner. To address this limitation, Li et al. (2024) developed an occupancy-measure-based algorithm with two-layer structure (Zhang et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2024) that achieves optimal dynamic regret in \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\). However, their dynamic regret incurs a _polynomial_ dependence on the state space size \(S\), which is undesirable. In this work, we propose an algorithm that achieves near-optimal dynamic regret in \(d\), \(H\), \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\) simultaneously for adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition, without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure.

## 3 Problem Setup

We focus on episodic MDPs with the unknown transition and adversarial reward functions in the full-information feedback setting. We introduce the problem formulation in the following.

**Inhomogeneous, Episodic Adversarial MDPs.** We denote an inhomogeneous, episodic adversarial MDP by a tuple \(\mathcal{M}=\{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},H,\{\mathbb{P}_{h}\}_{h\in[H]},\{r_{k,h }\}_{k\in[K],h\in[H]}\}\), where \(\mathcal{S}\) is the state space with cardinality \(|\mathcal{S}|=S\), \(\mathcal{A}\) is the action space with cardinality \(|\mathcal{A}|=A\), \(H\) is the length of each episode, \(\mathbb{P}_{h}(\cdot|\cdot,\cdot):\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{ S}\rightarrow[0,1]\) is the transition with \(\mathbb{P}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)\) denoting the probability of transiting to state \(s^{\prime}\) given the state \(s\) and action \(a\) at stage \(h\), and \(r_{k,h}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow[0,1]\) is the reward function for episode \(k\) at stage \(h\) chosen by the adversary. A policy \(\pi=\{\pi_{h}\}_{h=1}^{H}\) is a collection of \(h\) functions, where each \(\pi_{h}:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\Delta(\mathcal{A})\) maps a state \(s\) to a distribution over action space \(\mathcal{A}\). For any \((s,a)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\), the state-action value function \(Q^{\pi}_{k,h}(s,a)\) and value function \(V^{\pi}_{k,h}(s)\) are defined as:

\[Q^{\pi}_{k,h}(s,a)=\mathbb{E}_{\pi}\left[\sum_{h^{\prime}=h}^{H}r_{k,h^{\prime }}(s_{h^{\prime}},a_{h^{\prime}})\:\Big{|}\:s_{h}=s,a_{h}=a\right],\quad V^{ \pi}_{k,h}(s)=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{h}(\cdot|s)}[Q^{\pi}_{k,h}(s,a)],\]

where the expectation is taken over the randomness of \(\pi\) and \(\mathbb{P}\). For any function \(V:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\), we define \([\mathbb{P}_{h}V](s,a)=\mathbb{E}_{s^{\prime}\sim\mathbb{P}_{h}(\cdot|s,a)}[V (s^{\prime})]\) and \([\forall_{h}V](s)=[\mathbb{P}_{h}V^{2}](s,a)-([\mathbb{P}_{h}V](s,a))^{2}\).

The interaction protocol is given as follows. At the beginning of episode \(k\), the environment chooses the reward functions \(\{r_{k,h}\}_{h\in[H]}\) and decides the initial state \(s_{k,1}\), where the reward function may be chosen in an adversarial manner. Simultaneously, the learner decides a policy \(\pi_{k}=\{\pi_{k,h}\}_{h\in[H]}\). Starting from the initial state \(s_{k,1}\), the learner chooses an action \(a_{k,h}\sim\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|s_{k,h})\), obtains the reward \(r_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\), and transits to the next state \(s_{k,h+1}\sim\mathbb{P}_{h}(\cdot|s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\) for \(h\in[H]\). After the episode \(k\) ends, the learner observes the entire reward function \(\{r_{k,h}\}_{h\in[H]}\). The goal of the learner is to minimize the dynamic regret in (2). Denote by \(T=KH\) the total steps.

**Linear Mixture MDPs.** We focus on _linear mixture MDPs_, which was introduced by Ayoub et al. (2020) and has been studied by subsequent works (Cai et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021; Li et al., 2024).

**Definition 1** (Linear Mixture MDPs).: An MDP \(M=\{\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},H,\{\mathbb{P}_{h}\}_{h\in[H]},\{r_{k,h}\}_{k\in[K],h\in[H]}\}\) is called an inhomogeneous, episode \(B\)-bounded linear mixture MDP, if there exist a _known_ feature mapping \(\phi(s^{\prime}|s,a):\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{S}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{d}\) and an _unknown_ vector \(\theta^{*}_{h}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) with \(\|\theta^{*}_{h}\|_{2}\leq B\), \(\forall h\in[H]\), such that (i) \(\mathbb{P}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)=\phi(s^{\prime}|s,a)^{\top}\theta^{*}_{h}\), (ii) \(\|\phi_{V}(s,a)\|_{2}\triangleq\|\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}\phi(s^{\prime}| s,a)V(s^{\prime})\|_{2}\leq 1\) for any \((s,a)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\) and any bounded function \(V:\mathcal{S}\rightarrow[0,1]\).

**Occupancy Measure.** We introduce the concept of occupancy measure (Altman, 1998; Zimin and Neu, 2013). Given a policy \(\pi\) and a transition \(\mathbb{P}\), the occupancy measure \(q\) is defined as the probability of visiting state-action-state triple \((s,a,s^{\prime})\) under transition \(\mathbb{P}\) and policy \(\pi\), that is,

\[q^{\mathbb{P},\pi}_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime})=\Pr[s_{h}=s,a_{h}=a,s_{h+1}=s^{\prime} \:|\:\mathbb{P},\pi].\]

A valid occupancy measure \(q=\{q_{h}\}_{h=1}^{H}\) satisfies the following properties. First, each stage is visited exactly once and thus \(\forall h\in[H]\), \(\sum_{s\in\mathcal{S}}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}q_{h} (s,a,s^{\prime})=1\). Second, the probability of entering a state when coming from the previous stage equals to the probability of leaving from that state to the next stage, i.e., \(\forall s\in\mathcal{S}\), \(\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}q_{1}(s,a,s^{\prime})= \mathds{1}\{s=s_{1}\}\) and \(\forall h\in[2,H]\)\(\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\sum_{s^{\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}q_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime})=\sum_{s^{ \prime\prime}\in\mathcal{S}}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}q_{h-1}(s^{\prime\prime},a,s)\). For any occupancy measure \(q\) satisfying the above two properties, it induces a transition \(\mathbb{P}^{q}=\{\mathbb{P}^{q}_{h}\}_{h=1}^{H}\) and a policy \(\pi^{q}=\{\pi^{q}_{h}\}\) such that

\[\mathbb{P}^{q}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)=\frac{q_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}{\sum_{s^{ \prime\prime}}q_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime\prime})},\pi^{q}_{h}(a|s)=\frac{\sum_{s^{ \prime}}q_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}{\sum_{a^{\prime},s^{\prime}}q_{h}(s,a^{\prime },s^{\prime})},\forall(s,a,s^{\prime},h)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A} \times\mathcal{S}\times[H].\]

We denote by \(\Delta\) the set of all occupancy measures satisfying the above two properties. For a transition \(\mathbb{P}\), denote by \(\Delta(\mathbb{P})\in\Delta\) the set of occupancy measures whose induced transition \(\mathbb{P}^{q}\) is exactly \(\mathbb{P}\). For a collection of transitions \(\mathcal{P}\), denote by \(\Delta(\mathcal{P})\in\Delta\) the set of occupancy measures whose induced transition \(\mathbb{P}^{q}\) is in the transition set \(\mathcal{P}\). We use \(q_{k}=q^{p,\pi_{k}},q_{k}^{c}=q^{p,\pi_{k}^{c}}\) to simplify the notation.

**Non-stationarity measure.** The non-stationarity measure aims to quantify the non-stationarity of the environments. We introduce two kinds of non-stationarity measures widely used in the literature:

\[P_{K}=\sum_{k=2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\lVert\pi_{k,h}^{c}-\pi_{k-1,h}^{c}\rVert_{ 1,\infty},\quad\bar{P}_{K}=\sum_{k=2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\lVert q_{k,h}^{c}-q_{ k-1,h}^{c}\rVert_{1}.\] (3)

They quantify the difference between the compared policies and the compared occupancy measures, respectively. Zhao et al. (2022, Lemma 6) show it holds that \(\bar{P}_{K}\leq HP_{K}\). Thus, we focus on the \(\bar{P}_{K}\)-type upper bound in this work as it implies an upper bound in terms of \(HP_{K}\) directly.

## 4 The Proposed Algorithm

In this section, we first analyze the strengths and limitations of two most popular methods for adversarial MDPs. Then we propose a novel algorithm that combines the benefits of both approaches.

### Analysis of Two Popular Methods

Occupancy-measure-based and policy-based methods are the two most popular approaches for solving adversarial MDPs. Both methods have been extensively studied in the literature and shown to enjoy favorable static regret guarantees (Zimin and Neu, 2013, Cai et al., 2020). However, when it comes to dynamic regret, both methods face significant challenges. We introduce the details below.

#### 4.1.1 Framework I: Occupancy-measure-based Method

The first line of work (Zimin and Neu, 2013, Rosenberg and Mansour, 2019, Jin et al., 2020) employed the occupancy-measure-based method for adversarial MDPs. This method use the occupancy measure as a proxy for the policy, optimizing over the occupancy measure rather than the policy directly. While the value function is not convex in the policy space, it becomes convex in the occupancy measure space, making this approach theoretically more attractive compared to policy-based method. However, this shift introduces new challenges for dynamic regret analysis, as discussed below.

Using the concept of the occupancy measure, the dynamic regret in (2) can be rewritten as \(\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{\pi_{ k}^{c}}(s_{k,1})-\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1})=\sum_{k=1}^{K} \langle q_{k}^{c}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\). By this conversion, the online MDP problem is reduced to the standard online linear optimization problem over the occupancy measure set \(\Delta(\mathbb{P})\) induced by the true transition \(\mathbb{P}\). However, the true transition \(\mathbb{P}\) is unknown and thus the decision set \(\Delta(\mathbb{P})\) is inaccessible. To address this issue, a general idea is to construct a confidence set \(\mathcal{P}_{k}\) at episode \(k\) that contains the true transition with high probability then replace the decision set by \(\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k})\). Then the dynamic regret can be decomposed into:

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^ {c}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle=\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle}_{\text{D-Regret-QLO}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_ {k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle}_{\text{approximation-error}},\] (4)

where \(\hat{q}_{k}\) is an occupancy measure in the decision set \(\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k})\). The first term is the dynamic regret of online linear optimization over the decision set \(\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k})\), which has been explored in the known transition setting (Zhao et al., 2022). This term can be well controlled by a two-layer structure, as demonstrated in the online learning literature (Zhang et al., 2018, Yan et al., 2023, Zhao et al., 2024).

The second term reflects the approximation error introduced by using the confidence set \(\mathcal{P}_{k}\) as a surrogate for the true transition \(\mathbb{P}\), which constitutes the primary challenge of this approach.

**Key Difficulties.** To control the approximation error in (4), previous works (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2019; Jin et al., 2020) proposed to bound the term \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\lVert\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k}\rVert_{1}\), leveraging Holder's inequality: \(\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\leq\lVert\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k}\rVert_{1} \lVert r_{k}\rVert_{\infty}\) and \(r_{k}\in[0,1]^{S\adv}\). While this approach is effective for tabular MDPs, it fails to exploit the inherent structure of linear mixture MDPs. Although the transition kernel \(\mathbb{P}\) exhibit a linear structure, the occupancy measure is not linear and retains a complex recursive form, as highlighted in Zhao et al. (2023). Consequently, the regret bound resulting from this method depends on the state space size \(S\), which is undesirable for linear mixture MDPs.

**Remark 1**.: Occupancy-measure-based method optimizes a global object that encodes the entire policy across all states, which sacrifices some computational efficiency to better handle non-stationary environments. Thanks to their global optimization property, these methods offer favorable dynamic regret guarantees. However, they struggle to address the _unknown transition_ in linear mixture MDPs and suffer from an undesirable dependence on the state space size \(S\) in the dynamic regret bound.

#### 4.1.2 Framework II: Policy-based Method

Policy-based method directly optimizes the policy, making it easier to implement and computationally more efficient than occupancy-measure-based method. More importantly, it shows advantages in handling unknown transitions, as it only requires estimating the value function, bypassing the need to estimate the transition kernel explicitly. However, due to their inherent _local-search_ nature, this method faces challenges in adapting to non-stationary environments and providing favorable dynamic regret guarantees. We outline the key challenges below.

By the performance difference lemma (Kakade and Langford, 2002; Cai et al., 2020), the dynamic regret in (2) can be rewritten as the following formulation:

\[\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\mathbb{E}_{\pi_ {k}^{c}}\big{[}\langle Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{h},\cdot),\pi_{k,h}^{c}(\cdot|s_{h} )-\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|s_{h})\rangle\big{]},\] (5)

where the expectation is taken over the _changing_ policy sequence \(\pi_{1}^{c},\ldots,\pi_{K}^{c}\). For each state \(s_{h}\), the term \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}(Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{h},\cdot),\pi_{k,h}^{c}(\cdot |s_{h})-\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|s_{h}))\) is exactly the regret of a \(A\)-armed bandit problem, with \(Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{h},\cdot)\) being the "reward vector". Thus, it indicates the dynamic regret of online MDPs can be written as the weighted average of MAB dynamic regret over all states, where the weight for each state is its (_unknown_ and _time-varying_) probability of being visited by \(\pi_{1}^{c},\ldots,\pi_{K}^{c}\).

Since the transition is unknown, the policy-based method need to estimate the value function \(Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}\) at each state. By the definition of linear mixture MDPs in Definition 1, for any \(V_{k,h}(\cdot)\), it holds that \([\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}](s,a)=\langle\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a),\theta_{h}^{*}\rangle\). Therefore, learning the underlying transition parameters \(\theta_{h}^{*}\) can be regarded as solving a "linear bandit" problem where the context is \(\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\) and the noise is \(V_{k,h+1}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-[\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\). This observation enables the application of "linear bandits" techniques to learn the value function effectively for the policy-based method.

The key challenge for the policy-based method lies in handling the non-stationarity of environment. Even with accurate estimates of \(Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}\) at each state, optimizing the dynamic regret remains difficult. To optimize (5), Li et al. (2023) proposed running the Exp3 algorithm (Auer et al., 2002) at each state and employing the fixed-share technique (Herbster and Warmuth, 2001; Cesa-Bianchi et al., 2012), forcing uniform exploration to deal with non-stationary environments. They update policies by

\[\pi_{k,h}^{\prime}(\cdot|s)\propto\pi_{k-1,h}(\cdot|s)\exp\big{(}\eta\cdot Q_{ k-1,h}^{\pi_{k-1}}(s,\cdot)\big{)},\quad\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|s)=(1-\gamma)\pi_{k,h}^{ \prime}(\cdot|s)+\gamma\pi^{u}(\cdot|s),\]

where \(\eta\) is the step size, \(\pi^{u}(\cdot|s)\) is uniform distribution, and \(\gamma\) is the fixed-share parameter. They show it ensures \(\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\leq\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\eta KH^{3}+H(1+P_{K})/\eta)\). To achieve a favorable dynamic regret, the step size \(\eta\) needs to be set as \(\eta\approx\sqrt{(1+P_{K})/(KH^{2})}\), which is impractical as the non-stationarity measure \(P_{K}\) is _unknown_. The standard approach to address this issue in the online learning literature is to adopt the online ensemble framework (Zhao et al., 2024). However, this approach encounters challenges in online MDPs as the dynamic regret in (5) involves the expectation of changing policies, which does not appear in the standard online learning setting. We elaborate on this issue below.

Specifically, the standard procedure of the two-layer framework is as follows. First, we construct a step size pool \(\mathcal{H}=\{\eta_{1},\ldots,\eta_{N}\}\) (\(N=\mathcal{O}(\log K)\)) to discretize the range of the optimal step size.

Subsequently, multiple base-learners \(\mathcal{B}_{1},\ldots,\mathcal{B}_{N}\) are maintained, with each associated with a step size \(\eta_{i}\in\mathcal{H}\). Finally, a meta-algorithm is employed to track the unknown best base-learner. Then, the dynamic regret can be decomposed into two parts: (i) the dynamic regret of the best base-learner; and (ii) the regret of the meta-algorithm to track the best-learner. Formally,

\[\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\mathbb{E}_{\pi_{k}^{\pi}}\left[\sum_{h=1}^{H}\langle Q _{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{h},\cdot),\pi_{k,h}^{c}(\cdot|s_{h})-\pi_{k,h}^{i}(\cdot|s_ {h})\rangle\right]}_{\text{base-regret}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\mathbb{E }_{\pi_{k}^{\pi}}\left[\sum_{h=1}^{H}\langle Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{h},\cdot), \pi_{k,h}^{i}(\cdot|s_{h})-\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|s_{h})\rangle\right]}_{\text{meta- regret}}.\]

**Key Difficulties.** Though the base-regret above involves the expectation of changing policies, it can be effectively controlled as the decomposition holds for any base-learner \(\mathcal{B}_{i}\), allowing us to select the one with the optimal step size for analysis. However, controlling the meta-regret remains challenging as it still involves the expectation of changing policies and the optimal tuning is hindered.

**Remark 2**.: By solely optimizing the policy at the visited states, the computational complexity of the policy-based method is independent of the state number \(S\), offering a notable advantage. However, due to the non-stationary environments, more specifically, _changing weights_ of different states, only caring about the visited states without considering their importance is not enough to achieve favorable dynamic regret. Thus, the local-search property enhances computational efficiency but poses difficulties in handling non-stationary environments. This reveals a significant trade-off between _computational efficiency_ and the ability to manage _non-stationary environments_.

### Our Method: A Novel Combination

By the analysis in Section 4.1, we observe that the occupancy-measure-based method is proficient in addressing non-stationary environments but shows limited compatibility with unknown transitions. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with unknown transitions efficiently but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. To this end, we propose a new algorithm named **O**cupancy-measure-based **O**ptimization with **P**olicy-based **E**stimation (**O**O**PE), which combines the benefits of both methods. At a high level, **O**O**PE algorithm consists of two components: (i) an _occupancy-measure-based global optimization_ with a two-layer framework to deal with the non-stationarity of environments; and (ii) a _policy-based value-targeted regression_ to handle the unknown transition. We bridge the two components through a novel analysis that converts the occupancy-measure-based approximation error into the policy-based estimation error. We elaborate on the details below.

#### 4.2.1 Occupancy-measure-based Global Optimization

The occupancy-measure-based optimization follows Li et al. (2024), using online mirror descent for updating the occupancy measure and a two-layer structure to manage non-stationary environments.

We first construct a step size pool \(\mathcal{H}=\{\eta_{1},\ldots,\eta_{N}\}\) to discretize the range of the optimal step size, then maintain multiple base-learners \(\mathcal{B}_{1},\ldots,\mathcal{B}_{N}\), each of which is associated with a step size \(\eta_{i}\in\mathcal{H}\). Finally, we use a meta-algorithm to track the best base-learner. At each episode \(k\), we construct a confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k}\) such that \(\theta_{h}^{*}\in\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\) with high probability. The details of the construction of confidence set will be introduced later. Then, the base-learner \(\mathcal{B}_{i}\) updates the occupancy measure by

\[\hat{q}_{k}^{i}=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{q\in\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k},\alpha)} \eta_{i}(q,r_{k})-D_{\psi}(q\|\hat{q}_{k-1}^{i}),\] (6)

where \(D_{\psi}(q\|q^{\prime})=\sum_{s,a,s^{\prime}}q(s,a,s^{\prime})\ln\frac{q(s,a,s ^{\prime})}{q^{\prime}(s,a,s^{\prime})}\) is the KL-divergence and the decision set is set as \(\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k},\alpha)=\{q_{h}\in[\alpha,1]^{S^{2}A},\forall h\in[H]\mid q\) satisfies constraints \((\mathbf{C1})\) and \((\mathbf{C2})\}\) where

\[(\mathbf{C1}):\sum_{a,s^{\prime}}q_{1}(s,a,s^{\prime})=\mathds{1}\{s=s_{k,1} \},\forall s\in\mathcal{S};\ \ \sum_{a,s^{\prime}}q_{h}\left(s,a,s^{\prime}\right)=\sum_{a,s^{\prime}}q_{h-1} \left(s^{\prime},a,s\right)\forall(s,h)\in\mathcal{S}\times[2,H];\]

\[(\mathbf{C2}):\forall(s,a,h)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times[H],\exists \theta\in\mathcal{C}_{k,h},\ \ \frac{q_{h}(s,a,\cdot)}{\sum_{s^{\prime}}q_{h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}=\langle\phi( \cdot\mid s,a),\theta\rangle.\]

The meta-algorithm updates weights by

\[p_{k}^{i}\propto p_{k-1}^{i}\exp(\varepsilon\langle\hat{q}_{k-1}^{i},r_{k-1} \rangle),\] (7)

where \(\varepsilon>0\) is the learning rate, \(\langle\hat{q}_{k-1}^{i},r_{k-1}\rangle\) evaluates the performance of the base-learner \(\mathcal{B}_{i}\) at episode \(k-1\). The final occupancy measure is given by \(\hat{q}_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{k}^{i}\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\) and the learner plays the policy \(\pi^{\hat{q}_{k}}\). Algorithm 1 summarizes the details. We show it enjoys the following guarantee.

**Lemma 1**.: _Suppose \(\theta^{s}_{k}\in\mathcal{C}_{k,h},\forall k\in[K],h\in[H]\). Set the clipping parameter \(\alpha=1/T^{2}\), the step size pool as \(\mathcal{H}=\{\eta_{i}=2^{i-1}\sqrt{K^{-1}\log(S^{2}A/H)}\mid i\in[N]\}\), where \(N=\lceil\frac{1}{2}\log(1+\frac{4K\log T}{\log(S^{2}A/H)})\rceil+1\), and the learning rate \(\varepsilon=\sqrt{(\log N)/(HT)}\). Algorithm 1 ensures the following guarantee:_

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\leq\mathcal{O}\Big{(} \sqrt{T(H\log\left(S^{2}A\right)+\bar{P}_{K}\log T)}\Big{)}.\]

**Remark 3**.: By the occupancy-measure-based optimization with a two-layer structure, we can handle the first term in (4) well. It remains to bound the approximation-error term \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\), which arises from employing the confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k}\) as a surrogate for true transition parameter \(\theta^{\star}\).

**Implementation Details of Algorithm 1.** The main computation complexity arises from the online mirror descent step of (6) in Line 4. This step can be divided into into an unconstrained optimization problem and a projection problem. The unconstrained optimization problem can be solved by the closed-form solution and the main computational cost lies in the projection step. Ji et al. (2024) show that though such a projection can not be formulated as a linear program, they can be efficiently solved by the Dysktra's algorithm as the decision set is an intersection of convex sets of explicit linear or quadratic forms. We refer the readers to Appendix D of Ji et al. (2024) for more details.

#### 4.2.2 Occupancy Measure to Policy Conversion

As discussed in Section 4.1.1, previous works (Rosenberg and Mansour, 2019; Jin et al., 2020; Li et al., 2024) propose to control the approximation error by bounding the term \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\|\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k}\|_{1}\). However, though the transition \(\mathbb{P}\) admits a linear structure, the occupancy measure does not and retains a complex recursive form, which introduces an undesired dependence on the state number \(S\) in the final regret. To take advantage of strength of policy-based method in integrating with linear function approximation, we propose to learn value functions as a whole instead of directly controlling the occupancy measure discrepancies. This strategy diverges from traditional methods that bound \(\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\) by the transition discrepancies \(\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a}\lVert\mathbb{P}_{h}(\cdot|s,a)-\bar{\mathbb{P}}_{k,h }(\cdot|s,a)\rVert_{1}\), where \(\bar{\mathbb{P}}_{k}\) is the estimated transition in episode \(k\). Instead, we opt to constrain \(\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\) through the value difference, which effectively integrates reward information. We introduce the details below.

Denote by \(\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})=\sum_{h,s,a,s^{\prime}}\hat{q}_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime} )r_{k,h}(s,a)\) the expected reward given the occupancy measure \(\hat{q}_{k,h}\). Then, the approximation error can be rewritten as

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle=\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K }\Big{(}\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})-V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})\Big{)}}_{\texttt{occupancy- policy-gap}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\Big{(}V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})-V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1})\Big{)}}_{\texttt{estimation-error}},\] (8)

where \(V_{k,1}\) is an intermediate value we define later. Our key idea is building an optimistic estimator \(V_{k,1}\) to ensure the first term is non-positive while controlling the second term. This bypasses the need to bound occupancy measure discrepancies, allowing us to focus solely on the value estimation error.

#### 4.2.3 Policy-based Value-targeted Regression

It remains to build the value function to ensure \(\widehat{V}_{k,h}\leq V_{k,h}\). A key observation is that the occupancy measure \(\hat{q}_{k}\) induces a new MDP whose transition lies in the confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k}\) with high probability. Thus, it suffices to ensure that \(V_{k,h}\) is an overestimate of the true value function in the confidence set.

By the definition of linear mixture MDPs, for any \(V_{k,h}(\cdot)\), it holds that \([\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}](s,a)=\langle\phi_{V_{h,h+1}}(s,a),\theta_{h}^{*}\rangle\). Thus, we compute the optimistic estimation as follows:

\[Q_{k,h}(\cdot,\cdot)=\Big{[}r_{k,h}(\cdot,\cdot)+\max_{\theta\in\mathcal{C}_{ k,h}}\langle\theta,\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(\cdot,\cdot)\rangle\Big{]}_{[0,H]},\quad V_{k,h}( \cdot)=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k,h}(\cdot|\cdot)}[Q_{k,h}(\cdot,a)].\] (9)

where \(\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\) is the confidence set. We introduce the details of constructing the confidence set below.

Following recent advances in linear mixture MDPs (Zhou et al., 2021; He et al., 2022), we estimate the parameter \(\theta_{h}^{*}\) by the _weighted ridge regression_ to utilize the variance information. Denote by \(\phi_{k,h,0}=\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\) and \(\phi_{k,h,1}=\phi_{V_{k,h+1}^{2}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\). We construct the estimator \(\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}\) as

\[\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{d}}\sum _{j=1}^{k-1}\frac{\left[\langle\phi_{j,h,0},\theta\rangle-V_{j,h+1}\left(s_{j,h+1}\right)\right]^{2}}{\bar{\sigma}_{j,h}^{2}}+\lambda\|\theta\|_{2}^{2},\]

where \(\bar{\sigma}_{j,h}^{2}\) is the upper confidence bound of the variance \([\mathbb{V}_{h}V_{j,h+1}](s_{j,h},a_{j,h})\) and is set as \(\bar{\sigma}_{k,h}^{2}=\max\{H^{2}/d,[\bar{\mathbb{V}}_{k,h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})+E_{k,h}\}\), where \([\bar{\mathbb{V}}_{k,h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\) is an estimate for the variance of value function \(V_{k,h+1}\) under the transition \(\mathbb{P}_{h}(\cdot|s_{k},a_{k})\), and \(E_{k,h}\) is the bonus term to guarantee the true variance \([\mathbb{V}_{k,h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\) is upper bounded by \([\bar{\mathbb{V}}_{k,h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})+E_{k,h}\) with high probability. By definition, we have \([\mathbb{V}_{h}V_{k,h+1}](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})=\langle\phi_{k,h,1},\theta_{h}^{*} \rangle-[\langle\phi_{k,h,0},\theta_{h}^{*}\rangle]^{2}\). Thus, we set \([\bar{\mathbb{V}}_{k,h}V_{k,h+1}]\left(s_{k,h},a_{k,h}\right)=[\langle\phi_{k,h,1},\widetilde{\theta}_{k,h}\rangle]_{[0,H^{2}]}-[\langle\phi_{k,h,0}, \widehat{\theta}_{k,h}\rangle]_{[0,H]}^{2}\), where \(\widetilde{\theta}_{k,h}\) is used to estimate the second-order moment and is constructed as:

\[\widetilde{\theta}_{k,h}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\theta\in\mathbb{S}^{d}} \sum_{j=1}^{k-1}[\langle\phi_{j,h,1},\theta\rangle-V_{j,h+1}^{2}(s_{j,h+1})]^ {2}+\lambda\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}.\]

The confidence set for the parameter \(\theta_{h}^{*}\) is constructed as

\[\mathcal{C}_{k,h}=\big{\{}\theta\ |\ \|\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{1/2}(\theta- \widehat{\theta}_{k,h})\|_{2}\leq\widehat{\beta}_{k}\big{\}}.\] (10)

where \(\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}\) is a covariance matrix, and \(\widehat{\beta}_{k}\) is a radius of the confidence set.

The algorithm is summarized in Algorithm 2. We show the approximation error is bounded as below.

**Lemma 2**.: _Set the parameters as follows:_

\[\widehat{\beta}_{k}=8\sqrt{d\log(1+k/\lambda)\log{(4k^{2}H/\delta )}}+4\sqrt{d}\log\big{(}4k^{2}H/\delta\big{)}+\sqrt{\lambda}B.\] \[\widetilde{\beta}_{k}=8d\sqrt{\log(1+k/\lambda)\log{(4k^{2}H/ \delta)}}+4\sqrt{d}\log{\big{(}4k^{2}H/\delta\big{)}}+\sqrt{\lambda}B,\] \[\widetilde{\beta}_{k}=8H^{2}\sqrt{d\log{(1+kH^{4}/(d\lambda))} \log{(4k^{2}H/\delta)}}+4H^{2}\log{\big{(}4k^{2}H/\delta\big{)}}+\sqrt{ \lambda}B.\] \[E_{k,h}=\min\left\{H^{2},2H\widetilde{\beta}_{k}\left\|\widehat{ \Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2}\phi_{k,h,0}\right\|_{2}\right\}+\min\left\{H^{2}, \widetilde{\beta}_{k}\left\|\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2}\phi_{k,h,1}\right\| _{2}\right\}.\]

_Algorithm 2 ensures with probability at least \(1-\delta\), it holds that_

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\leq\widetilde{\mathcal{O}} \Big{(}\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+\sqrt{dH^{4}K}\Big{)}.\]

**Remark 4**.: This bound can be further simplified as \(\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K})\) when \(d\geq H\), which is a mild assumption. Following previous work (Zhou et al., 2021), we only discuss the case \(d\geq H\) below.

## 5 Theoretical Guarantees

In this section, we present the dynamic regret upper bound and the lower bound for this problem.

### Dynamic Regret Upper Bound and Lower Bound

The dynamic regret upper bound of our algorithm is guaranteed by the following theorem.

**Theorem 1**.: _Set the parameters as in Lemma 1 and Lemma 2. Algorithm 1 with Algorithm 2 as the subroutine ensures with probability at least \(1-\delta\), the dynamic regret is upper bounded by_

\[\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\leq\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\Big{(}\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3 }K}+\sqrt{HK(H+\bar{P}_{K})}\Big{)}.\]

**Remark 5**.: Compared with the dynamic regret of \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big{(}\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+H^{2}\sqrt{(K+P_{K})(1+P_{K})} \big{)}\) for _known_ non-stationarity measure cases in Li et al. (2020), our bound has a better dependence on \(H\). Compared with the dynamic regret of \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\big{(}dHS\sqrt{K}+\sqrt{HK(H+\bar{P}_{K})}\big{)}\) for _unknown_ non-stationarity measure cases in Li et al. (2020), our bound removes the dependence on the state number \(S\).

Then, we establish the dynamic regret lower bound for this problem.

**Theorem 2**.: _Suppose \(B\geq 2\), \(d\geq 4\), \(H\geq 3\), \(K\geq(d-1)^{2}H/2\), for any algorithm and any constant \(\Gamma\in[0,2KH]\), there exists an adversarial inhomogeneous linear mixture MDP and a policy sequence \(\pi_{1}^{c},\dots,\pi_{K}^{c}\) such that \(\bar{P}_{K}\leq\Gamma\) and \(\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\geq\Omega(\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+\sqrt{HK(H+ \Gamma)})\)._

**Remark 6**.: Combining Theorem 1 and Theorem 2, our algorithm achieves the minimax optimal dynamic regret in terms of \(d\), \(H\), \(K\) and \(\bar{P}_{K}\) simultaneously up to logarithmic factors.

### Proof Overview

We provide the proof sketch of Theorem 1. The detailed proof can be found in the appendixes.

**Proof Sketch** (of Theorem 1).: We can decompose the dynamic regret as the following four terms:

\[\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})=\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}- \hat{q}_{k}^{i},r_{k}\rangle}_{\text{base-regret}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K} \langle\hat{q}_{k}^{i}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle}_{\text{meta-regret}}+ \underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\Big{(}\widehat{V}_{k,1}-V_{k,1}\Big{)}}_{\text{ occupancy-policy-gap}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\Big{(}V_{k,1}-V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}} \Big{)}}_{\text{estimation-error}}.\]

\(\bullet\)_base-regret._ By the analysis of OMD, it can be upper bounded by \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\eta_{i}KH+(H+\bar{P}_{K})/\eta_{i}\right)\). Choosing the base-learner with the best step size leads to an upper bound of \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KH(H+\bar{P}_{K})})\).

\(\bullet\)_meta-regret._ This term is the _static regret_ of the expert-tracking problem. As our meta-algorithm is the Hedge algorithm, by the standard analysis, this term can be upper bounded by \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(H\sqrt{K})\).

\(\bullet\)_occupancy-policy-gap._ As the value functions are optimistic estimators over the confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k}\), the value gap between the occupancy measure and the policy is guaranteed to be non-positive.

\(\bullet\)_estimation-error._ Let \(\epsilon_{k,h}^{Q}=Q_{k,h}-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}\) and \(\epsilon_{k,h}^{V}=V_{k,h}-V_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}\), then define policy noise \(M_{k,h,1}=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot|s_{k,h})}[\epsilon_{k,h}^{Q}(s_{k,h},a )]-\epsilon_{k,h}^{Q}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\), transition noise \(M_{k,h,2}=[\mathbb{P}_{h}(\epsilon_{k,h}^{V})](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-\epsilon_{k,h}^ {V}(s_{k,h+1})\) and bonus \(\iota_{k,h}=Q_{k,h}-(r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1})\). The estimation error can be decomposed into transition noises, policy noises, and bonuses, i.e., \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}(M_{k,h,1}+M_{k,h,2}+\iota_{k,h})\). The transition and policy noises can be bounded by \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{KH^{3}})\) using Azuma-Hoeffding's inequalities. The bonus term can be bounded by \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+\sqrt{dH^{4}K})\) according to Lemma 2. 

## 6 Conclusion and Future Work

In this work, we study the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition. We observe the occupancy-measure-based method is effective in addressing non-stationary environments but struggles with unknown transitions. In contrast, the policy-based method can deal with unknown transitions effectively but faces challenges in handling non-stationary environments. To this end, we propose a new algorithm that combines the benefits of both methods, achieving an \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+\sqrt{HK(H+\bar{P}_{K})})\) dynamic regret without prior knowledge of the non-stationarity measure. We show it is optimal up to logarithmic factors by establishing a matching lower bound.

Currently, we achieve this result by employing a hybrid method. Exploring whether similar results can be attained using computationally more efficient methods is an important future work. Furthermore, extending our results to other MDP classes, such as generalized linear function approximation (Wang et al., 2021) and multinomial logit function approximation (Li et al., 2024), is an interesting direction.

Proof of Lemma 1

Proof.: Without loss of generality, we assume that all states are reachable with positive probability under the uniform policy \(\pi^{u}(a|s)=1/A,\forall s\in\mathcal{S},a\in\mathcal{A}\). Otherwise, we can simply remove the unreachable states from the state space. Assume \(K\) is large enough such that the occupancy measure of \(q^{\mathbb{P},\pi^{u}}\in\Delta(\mathbb{P},1/T)\). We define \(u_{k}=(1-\frac{1}{T})q_{k}^{c}+\frac{1}{T}q^{\mathbb{P},\pi^{u}}\in\Delta( \mathbb{P},1/T^{2})\). Then, we can decompose the first term as

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}-u_{k},r_{k}\rangle+\sum_{k=1}^{K }\langle u_{k}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\] \[=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q_{k}^{c}-q^{\mathbb{P},\pi^{u} },r_{k}\rangle+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle u_{k}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\] \[\leq\frac{1}{T}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\lVert q_{k}^{c}-q^{\mathbb{P},\pi^ {u}}\rVert_{1}\lVert r_{k}\rVert_{\infty}+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle u_{k}-\hat{q }_{k},r_{k}\rangle\] \[\leq 2+\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle u_{k}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\] \[=2+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle u_{k}-\hat{q}_{k}^{i},r_{k} \rangle}_{\text{base-regret}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}^{i }-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle}_{\text{meta-regret}},\] (11)

which the first inequality follows from Holder's inequality, the second holds by \(\lVert q_{k}^{c}-q^{\mathbb{P},\pi^{u}}\rVert_{1}\leq 2H\), and the last holds for any \(i\in[N]\). Next, we bound base-regret and meta-regret separately.

Upper bound of base-regret.Since the true transition parameter \(\theta^{*}\) is contained in the confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k}\) by condition, we ensure that \(u_{k}\in\Delta(\mathbb{P},1/T^{2})\in\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k},1/T^{2})\). By the update rule of \(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\) in (6), we ensure that \(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\in\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k},1/T^{2}),\forall i\in[K]\). The update rule in (6) can be rewritten as:

\[\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i}=\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{q\in\mathbb{B}^{HSAS}}\eta_{i} \langle q,r_{k}\rangle-D_{\psi}(q\lVert\hat{q}_{k}^{i}),\qquad\hat{q}_{k+1}^{ i}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{q\in\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k},\alpha)}D_{\psi}(q \lVert\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i}),\]

or equivalently,

\[\bar{q}_{k+1,h}^{i}(s,a,s)=\hat{q}_{k,h}^{i}(s,a,s)\exp(\eta_{i}r_{k}(s,a)), \qquad\hat{q}_{k+1}^{i}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{q\in\Delta(\mathcal{C}_{k}, \alpha)}D_{\psi}(q\lVert\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i}).\]

By the three-point identity in Lemma 9, we have

\[\eta_{i}\langle u_{k}-\hat{q}_{k}^{i},r_{k}\rangle =D_{\psi}(u_{k}\lVert\hat{q}_{k}^{i})-D_{\psi}(u_{k}\lVert\bar{q} _{k+1}^{i})+D_{\psi}(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\lVert\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i})\] \[\leq D_{\psi}(u_{k}\lVert\hat{q}_{k}^{i})-D_{\psi}(u_{k}\lVert \hat{q}_{k+1}^{i})+D_{\psi}(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\lVert\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i}),\] (12)

where the inequality is due to the Pythagorean theorem.

For the last term of (12), summing over \(k\), we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}D_{\psi}(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\lVert\bar{q}_{k+1}^{i})\] \[=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a,s^{\prime}}\hat{q}_{k}^{i}( s,a,s^{\prime})\big{(}-\eta_{i}r_{k}(s,a)-1+\exp(\eta_{i}r_{k}(s,a))\big{)}\] \[\leq\eta_{i}^{2}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a,s^{\prime} }\hat{q}_{k}^{i}(s,a,s^{\prime})r_{k}(s,a)^{2}\] \[\leq\eta_{i}^{2}HK,\] (13)

where the first inequality is due to the fact \(e^{x}-x-1\leq x^{2}\) for \(x\in[0,1]\).

For the first two terms of (12), by the definition of KL-divergence, we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(D_{\psi}(u_{k}\|\hat{q}_{k}^{i})-D_{\psi}(u_{k} \|\hat{q}_{k+1}^{i})\right)\] \[=D_{\psi}(u_{1}\|\hat{q}_{1}^{i})+\sum_{k=2}^{K}\left(D_{\psi}(u_{k }\|\hat{q}_{k}^{i})-D_{\psi}(u_{k-1}\|\hat{q}_{k}^{i})\right)\] \[=D_{\psi}(u_{1}\|\hat{q}_{1}^{i})+\sum_{k=2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H} \sum_{s,a,s^{\prime}}\left(u_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})\log\frac{u_{k,h}(s,a,s^{ \prime})}{\hat{q}_{k,h}^{i}(s,a,s^{\prime})}-u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})\log \frac{u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}{\hat{q}_{k,h}^{i}(s,a,s^{\prime})}\right)\] \[=D_{\psi}(u_{1}\|\hat{q}_{1}^{i})+\psi(u_{K})-\psi(u_{1})+\sum_{k =2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a,s^{\prime}}(u_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})-u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{\prime}))\log\frac{1}{\hat{q}_{k,h}^{i}(s,a,s^{\prime})}\] \[\leq\underbrace{D_{\psi}(u_{1}\|\hat{q}_{1}^{i})+\psi(u_{K})- \psi(u_{1})}_{I_{1}}+2\log T\underbrace{\sum_{k=2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a,s^{\prime}}|u_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})-u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})|}_{I_{2}}\]

where the inequality holds by \(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\in\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k},1/T^{2})\). It remains to bound \(I_{1}\) and \(I_{2}\) separately.

For term \(I_{1}\), since \(\hat{q}_{1}^{i}\) minimize \(\psi\) over \(\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{1},1/T^{2})\), we have \(\langle\nabla\psi(\hat{q}_{1}^{i}),u_{1}-\hat{q}_{1}^{i}\rangle\geq 0\), thus,

\[I_{1}\leq\psi(u_{K})-\psi(\hat{q}_{1}^{i})\leq\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a,s^{ \prime}}\hat{q}_{1,h}^{i}(s,a,s^{\prime})\frac{1}{\hat{q}_{1,h}^{i}(s,a,s^{ \prime})}\leq H\log(S^{2}A).\] (14)

For term \(I_{2}\), for any \((s,a)\), we have

\[\sum_{s^{\prime}}\lvert u_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})-u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{ \prime})\rvert =\sum_{s^{\prime}}\lvert u_{k,h}(s,a)\mathbb{P}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s, a)-u_{k-1,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})\mathbb{P}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)\rvert\] \[=\sum_{s^{\prime}}\lvert u_{k,h}(s,a)-u_{k-1,h}(s,a)\rvert\mathbb{ P}_{h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)\] \[=\lvert u_{k,h}(s,a)-u_{k-1,h}(s,a)\rvert.\]

Thus, we have

\[I_{2}=\sum_{k=2}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\sum_{s,a}\lvert u_{k,h}(s,a)-u_ {k-1,h}(s,a)\rvert=(1-\frac{1}{T})\|q_{k}^{c}-q_{k-1}^{c}\|_{1}=(1-\frac{1}{T })\bar{P}_{K}\leq\bar{P}_{K}.\] (15)

Combining (12), (13), (14) and (15), we have

\[\texttt{base-regret} \leq\frac{1}{\eta_{i}}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(D_{\psi}(u_{k}\|\hat{q}_ {k}^{i})-D_{\psi}(u_{k}\|\hat{q}_{k+1}^{i})+D_{\psi}(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\|\bar{q}_ {k+1}^{i})\right)\] \[\leq\eta_{i}T+\frac{1}{\eta_{i}}(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T).\]

It is easy to verify that the optimal step size is \(\eta^{*}=\sqrt{(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T)/T}\). Since \(0\leq\bar{P}_{K}\leq 2T\), we ensure that

\[\sqrt{\frac{H\log(S^{2}A)}{T}}\leq\eta^{*}\leq\sqrt{\frac{H\log(S^{2}A)+4T \log T}{T}}.\]

By the construction of the step size pool \(\mathcal{H}=\{\eta_{i}=2^{i-1}\sqrt{K^{-1}\log(S^{2}A)}\mid i\in[N]\}\) with \(N=1+\lceil\frac{1}{2}\log(1+\frac{4K\log T}{\log(S^{2}A)})\rceil\), we know that the step size therein is monotonically increasing with

\[\eta_{1}=\sqrt{\frac{H\log(S^{2}A)}{T}},\eta_{N}\geq\sqrt{\frac{H\log(S^{2}A)+ 4T\log T}{T}}.\]Thus, we ensure there exists an index \(i^{*}\) such that \(\eta_{i^{*}}\leq\eta^{*}\leq 2\eta_{i^{*}}=\eta_{i^{*}+1}\). Since the decomposition in (11) holds for any \(\mathcal{B}_{i}\), we choose \(\mathcal{B}_{i^{*}}\) to analyze the regret bound. By the definition of \(\eta^{*}\), we have

\[\texttt{base-regret} \leq\eta_{i^{*}}T+\frac{1}{\eta_{i^{*}}}(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{ K}\log T)\] \[\leq\eta^{*}T+\frac{2}{\eta^{*}}(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T)\] \[=3\sqrt{T(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T)},\] (16)

where the last equality holds by substituting \(\eta^{*}=\sqrt{(H\log(S^{2}A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T)/T}\).

**Upper bound of meta-regret.** Denote by \(h^{i}_{k}=\langle\hat{q}^{i}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\in[0,H]\), we have

\[\texttt{meta-regret}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}^{i}_{k}-\sum_{i=1}^{N}p^{i} _{k}\hat{q}^{i}_{k},r_{k}\rangle=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle e_{i}-p_{k},h_{k}\rangle,\]

where \(e_{i}\) is the \(i\)-th standard basis vector in \(\mathbb{R}^{N}\). This is a standard Prediction with Expert Advice (PEA) problem and our algorithm is the well-known Hedge algorithm (Freund and Schapire, 1997; Herbster and Warmuth, 1998). By the standard analysis of Hedge (Cesa-Bianchi and Lugosi, 2006, Theorem 2.2), we have

\[\texttt{meta-regret}\leq\frac{\log N}{\varepsilon}+\varepsilon H^{2}K=\sqrt{ HT\log N},\] (17)

where the equality holds by setting \(\varepsilon=\sqrt{(\log N/HT)}\).

Combining (11), (16) and (17), we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle q^{c}_{k}-\hat{q}_{k},r_{k}\rangle\leq 3\sqrt{T(H\log(S^{2 }A)+2\bar{P}_{K}\log T)}+2.\]

This finishes the proof. 

## Appendix B Proof of Lemma 2

In this section, we first provide the main proof of Lemma 2, and then present the proofs of the auxiliary lemmas used in the main proof.

### Main Proof

Proof.: To prove Lemma 2, we first introduce the following lemma which shows the true parameter \(\theta^{*}_{h}\) is contained in the confidence set \(\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\) with high probability by such configuration.

**Lemma 3** (Zhou et al. (2021, Lemma 5)).: _Let \(\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\) be defined in (10) and set parameters as in Lemma 2. Then, we have \(\theta^{*}_{h}\in\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\) for all \(h\in[H]\) and \(k\in[K]\) with probability at least \(1-3\delta\)._

Denote by \(\mathcal{E}\) the event when Lemma 3 holds, then \(\Pr(\mathcal{E})\geq 1-3\delta\). We are ready to prove Lemma 2.

First, we can rewrite the term \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle\) as

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\langle\hat{q}_{k}-q_{k},r_{k}\rangle =\sum_{k=1}^{K}\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})-V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1})\] \[=\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\Big{(}\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})-V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})\Big{)}}_{\texttt{occupancy-policy-gap}}+\underbrace{\sum_{k=1}^ {K}\Big{(}V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})-V_{k,1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,1})\Big{)}}_{\texttt{ estimation-error}},\] (18)

Next, we bound these two terms separately.

**Upper bound of occupancy-iteration-gap.** This term is the gap between the value function computed by the occupancy measure \(\{\hat{q}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) and the optimistic value function computed by backward iteration defined in (9). Similar to Ji et al. (2024, Lemma 6.1), we show this term is non-positive.

**Lemma 4**.: _For any episode \(k\in[K]\), define \(\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})=\sum_{h,s,a,s^{\prime}}\hat{q}_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})r_ {k,h}(s,a)\) and \(V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})\) the value function computed in (9), on the event \(\mathcal{E}\), it holds that \(\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})\leq V_{k,1}(s_{k,1})\)._

**Upper bound of estimation-error.** First, we present the following lemma which shows this term can be decomposed into three major terms, transition noise, policy noise and the sum of bonuses.

**Lemma 5**.: _For all \(k\in[K],h\in[H]\), it holds that_

\[V_{k,h}(s_{k,h})-V_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h})=\sum_{h^{\prime}=h}^{H}\Big{(}M_{k,h^{\prime},1}+M_{k,h^{\prime},2}-\iota_{k,h^{\prime}}(s_{k,h^{\prime}},a_{k, h^{\prime}})\Big{)},\]

_with_

\[M_{k,h,1} =\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}[Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a)- Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a)]-(Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a _{k,h})),\] \[M_{k,h,2} =[\mathbb{P}_{h}(V_{k,h+1}-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}})](s_{k,h},a_{k,h}) -(V_{k,h+1}(s_{k,h+1})-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h+1}))\] \[\iota_{k,h}(\cdot,\cdot) =Q_{k,h}(\cdot,\cdot)-(r_{k,h}(\cdot,\cdot)+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1 }(\cdot,\cdot)).\]

Note \(M_{k,h,1}\) is the noise from the stochastic policy and \(M_{k,h,2}\) is the noise from the state transition, Let \(M_{k,h}=M_{k,h,1}+M_{k,h,2},\forall k\in[K],h\in[H]\), we define two following high probability events:

\[\mathcal{E}_{1}=\bigg{\{}\forall h\in[H],\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h^{\prime}=h}^{H} M_{k,h^{\prime}}\leq 4\sqrt{H^{3}K\log\frac{H}{\delta}}\bigg{\}},\mathcal{E}_{2}= \bigg{\{}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}M_{k,h,2}\leq\sqrt{8H^{3}K\log\frac{1}{ \delta}}\bigg{\}}.\]

According to the Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, we have \(\Pr(\mathcal{E}_{1})\geq 1-\delta\) and \(\Pr(\mathcal{E}_{2})\geq 1-\delta\). It remains to bound the model prediction error \(\iota_{k,h}\).

Next, we show the prediction error depends on the width of the confidence set and the cumulative estimate variance by the following lemma.

**Lemma 6**.: _Define prediction error \(\iota_{k,h}=Q_{k,h}-(r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1})\), on the event \(\mathcal{E}\), it holds that_

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\iota_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\leq 2\widehat{ \beta}_{K}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\tilde{\sigma}_{k,h}^{2}}\sqrt{2 Hd\log(1+K/\lambda)}.\]

Here, \(\tilde{\sigma}_{k,h}^{2}\) is the estimated variance, for the total true variance \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}[\mathbb{V}_{h}V_{h+1}^{\pi^{k}}](s_{k,h},a_{h}^{ k})\), we introduce the high probability event \(\mathcal{E}_{3}\):

\[\mathcal{E}_{3}=\bigg{\{}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}[\mathbb{V}_{h}V_{h+1}^{ \pi^{k}}](s_{k,h},a_{h}^{k})\leq 3(HK+H^{3}\log(1/\delta))\bigg{\}}.\]

Lemma C.5 in Jin et al. (2018) suggests that \(\Pr(\mathcal{E}_{3})\geq 1-\delta\). Based on the events \(\mathcal{E}\cap\mathcal{E}_{1}\cap\mathcal{E}_{2}\cap\mathcal{E}_{3}\), we have the following lemma which bounds the estimated variance of the value function.

**Lemma 7** (He et al. (2022, Lemma 6.5)).: _On the events \(\mathcal{E}\cap\mathcal{E}_{1}\cap\mathcal{E}_{2}\cap\mathcal{E}_{3}\), it holds that_

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\tilde{\sigma}_{k,h}^{2}\leq \frac{2H^{3}K}{d}+179H^{2}K+(165d^{3}H^{4}+2062d^{2}H^{5})\log^{ 2}\left(\frac{4K^{2}H}{\delta}\right)\log^{2}\left(1+\frac{KH^{4}}{\lambda} \right).\]

Combining Lemma 5, Lemma 6 and Lemma 7, we can bound the estimation-error as follows.

**Lemma 8**.: _On the events \(\mathcal{E}\cap\mathcal{E}_{1}\cap\mathcal{E}_{2}\cap\mathcal{E}_{3}\), for any \(h\in[H]\), it holds that_

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,h}(s_{k,h})-\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h})\leq \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big{(}\sqrt{dH^{4}K}+\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K} \big{)}.\]

Finally, we finish the proof of Lemma 2 by combining Lemma 4 and Lemma 8.

### Proofs of Auxiliary Lemmas

In this section, we proof the auxiliary lemmas used in the proof of Lemma 2 in Appendix B.1.

#### b.2.1 Proof of Lemma 4

Proof.: The proof is similar to that of Ji et al. (2024, Lemma 6.1). The only difference is that \(\hat{q}_{k}\) is a weighted combination rather than a single occupancy measure in the decision set. For \(k\in[K]\), the occupancy measure \(\hat{q}_{k}\) is given by \(\hat{q}_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{k}^{i}\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\). Since \(\hat{q}_{k}^{i}\in\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k},\alpha)\), we ensure that \(\hat{q}_{k}\in\Delta(\mathcal{P}_{k},\alpha)\). Thus, for occupancy measure \(\hat{q}_{k}\), there exist \(\bar{\theta}\) such that

\[\widehat{\mathbb{P}}_{k,h}(s^{\prime}|s,a)=\frac{q_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}{\sum _{s^{\prime}}q_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime})}=\langle\phi(s^{\prime}|s,a),\bar{\theta }_{k,h}(s,a)\rangle,\forall(s,a,h)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times[H].\]

It is easy to verify that the update rule \(\widehat{V}_{k,1}(s_{k,1})=\sum_{h,s,a,a^{\prime}}\hat{q}_{k,h}(s,a,s^{\prime })r_{k,h}(s,a)\) computed by the occupancy measure is the same as the following backward iteration:

\[\widehat{Q}_{k,h}(s,a) =r_{h}(s,a)+\langle\phi_{\widehat{V}_{k,h+1}}(s^{\prime}|s,a), \bar{\theta}_{k,h}(s,a)\rangle,\] \[\widehat{V}_{k,h}(s) =\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot|s)}\widehat{Q}_{k,h}(s,a),\quad \widehat{V}_{k,H+1}(s)=0.\]

Then, we can prove this lemma by induction. The conclusion trivially holds for \(n=H+1\). Suppose the statement holds for \(n=h+1\), we prove it for \(n=h\). For any \((s,a)\in\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\), since \(\widehat{Q}_{k,h}(s,a)\leq H\), so if \(Q_{k,h}(s,a)=H\), then it holds directly. Otherwise, we have

\[Q_{k,h}(s,a)-\widehat{Q}_{k,h}(s,a)\] \[=\langle\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a),\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}\rangle+ \widehat{\beta}\|\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1}}-\langle \phi_{\widehat{V}_{k,h+1}}(s^{\prime}|s,a),\bar{\theta}_{k,h}(s,a)\rangle\] \[\geq\langle\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a),\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}\rangle+ \widehat{\beta}\|\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1}}-\langle \phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s^{\prime}|s,a),\bar{\theta}_{k,h}(s,a)\rangle\] \[=\langle\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a),\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}-\bar{\theta }_{k,h}(s,a)\rangle+\widehat{\beta}\|\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{ \Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1}}\] \[\geq\widehat{\beta}\|\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{\Sigma}_{ k,h}^{-1}}-\|\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}-\bar{\theta}_{k,h}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{\Sigma}_{ k,h}}\|\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\|_{\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1}}\] \[\geq 0,\]

where the first inequality holds by the inductive hypothesis, the second holds due to Holder's inequality, and the last holds due to \(\bar{\theta}_{k,h}(s,a)\in\mathcal{C}_{k,h}\). By induction, we finish the proof. 

#### b.2.2 Proof of Lemma 5

Proof.: By the definition \(V_{k,h}(s_{k,h})=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}[Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h}, a)]\), we have

\[V_{k,h}(s_{k,h})-V_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h})\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}\big{[}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a)-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a)\big{]}\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}\big{[}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a)-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a)\big{]}-\big{(}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\big{)}\] \[\quad+\big{(}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h}, a_{k,h})\big{)}\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}\big{[}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a)-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a)\big{]}-\big{(}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\big{)}\] \[\quad+\big{[}\mathbb{P}_{h}(V_{k,h+1}-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}})](s_{k,h },a_{k,h})+\iota_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\] \[=\underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi_{k}(\cdot\mid s_{k,h})}\big{[}Q_{ k,h}(s_{k,h},a)-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a)\big{]}-\big{(}Q_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\big{)}}_{\triangleq M_{k,h,1}}\] \[\quad+\underbrace{\big{[}\mathbb{P}_{h}(V_{k,h+1}-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{ k}})](s_{k,h},a_{k,h})-\big{(}V_{k,h+1}(s_{k,h+1})-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h+1}) \big{)}}_{\triangleq M_{k,h,2}}\] \[\quad+\big{(}V_{k,h+1}(s_{k,h+1})-V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}}(s_{k,h+1}) \big{)}+\iota_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\]

where the third equality holds by the fact \(Q_{k,h}=r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}+\iota_{k,h}\) and \(Q_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}=r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}^{\pi_{k}}\). Summing up the above equation from \(h\) to \(H\) recursively finishes the proof.

#### b.2.3 Proof of Lemma 6

Proof.: By the definition of \(\iota_{k,h}=Q_{k,h}-(r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1})\), we have

\[\iota_{k,h}(s,a)\] \[=Q_{k,h}(s,a)-(r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1})(s,a)\] \[=r_{k,h}(s,a)+\big{\langle}\widehat{\theta}_{k,h},\phi_{V_{k,h+1}} (s,a)\big{\rangle}+\widehat{\beta}_{k}\big{\|}\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2} \phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\big{\|}_{2}-(r_{k,h}+\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1})(s,a)\] \[=\big{\langle}\widehat{\theta}_{k,h}-\theta_{h}^{*},\phi_{V_{k,h+1 }}(s,a)\big{\rangle}+\widehat{\beta}_{k}\big{\|}\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2} \phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\big{\|}_{2}\] \[\leq 2\widehat{\beta}_{k}\big{\|}\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2} \phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a)\big{\|}_{2},\]

where the first inequality holds by the configuration of \(Q_{k,h}\) in (9), the second inequality holds by the definition of linear mixture MDP such that \([\mathbb{P}_{h}V_{k,h+1}](s,a)=\langle\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s,a),\theta_{h}^{*}\rangle\) and the last inequality holds by the construction of the confidence set in Lemma 3.

Then, we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\iota_{k,h}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\] \[\leq\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}2\min\{\widehat{\beta}_{k}\big{\|} \widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2}\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}(s_{k,h},a_{k,h})\big{\|}_{2},H\}\] \[\leq\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}2\widehat{\beta}_{k}\bar{\sigma}_ {k,h}\min\big{\{}\big{\|}\widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2}\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}\left(s_ {k,h},a_{k,h}\right)/\bar{\sigma}_{k,h}\big{\|}_{2},1\big{\}}\] \[\leq 2\widehat{\beta}_{K}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\bar{ \sigma}_{k,h}^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\min\Big{\{}\big{\|} \widehat{\Sigma}_{k,h}^{-1/2}\phi_{V_{k,h+1}}\left(s_{k,h},a_{k,h}\right)/\bar {\sigma}_{k,h}\big{\|}_{2}\,,1\Big{\}}}\] \[\leq 2\widehat{\beta}_{K}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\bar{ \sigma}_{k,h}^{2}}\sqrt{2Hd\log(1+K/\lambda)},\]

where the first inequality holds by \(Q_{k,h}\in[0,H]\), the second holds by \(2\widehat{\beta}_{k}\bar{\sigma}_{k,h}\geq\sqrt{d}H/\sqrt{d}=H\), the third inequality is by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and the last inequality holds by the elliptical potential lemma in Lemma 10. This finishes the proof. 

#### b.2.4 Proof of Lemma 8

Proof.: The proof can be obtained by combining Lemma 5, 6 and 7. Specifically, we have

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,h}(s_{k,h})-\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{k,h}^{\pi_{k}}(s_ {k,h})\] \[\leq 2\widehat{\beta}_{K}\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{h=1}^{H}\bar{ \sigma}_{k,h}^{2}\sqrt{2Hd\log(1+K/\lambda)}}+4\sqrt{H^{3}K\log\frac{H}{\delta }}+\sqrt{8H^{3}K\log\frac{1}{\delta}}\] \[\leq \widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\big{(}\sqrt{dH^{4}K}+\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K} \big{)}.\]

where the first inequality holds by Lemma 5 and Lemma 6 and the last inequality holds by Lemma 7. This finishes the proof. 

## Appendix C Proof of Theorem 1

Proof.: Combining Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, we have

\[\mathrm{D-Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\leq\mathcal{O}\Big{(}\sqrt{T(H\log\left(S^{2 }A\right)+\bar{P}_{K}\log T)}\Big{)}+\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}\Big{(}\sqrt{dH^{4 }K}+\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}\Big{)}.\]

This finishes the proof.

Proof of Theorem 2

Proof.: Our proof is similar to that of Li et al. (2023, Theorem 4). At a high level, we prove this lower bound by noting that optimizing the dynamic regret of linear mixture MDPs is harder than (i) optimizing the static regret of linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition, (ii) optimizing the dynamic regret of linear mixture MDPs with the known transition. Thus, we can consider the lower bound of these two problems separately and combine them to obtain the lower bound of the dynamic regret of linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition.

First, we consider the lower bound of the static regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition. From lower bound in He et al. (2022, Theorem 5.3), since the dynamic regret recovers the static regret by choosing the best-fixed policy, we have the following lower bound for dynamic regret in this case:

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\geq\Omega(\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K }).\] (19)

Then, we consider the lower bound of the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the known transition. Zimin and Neu (2013) show the lower bound of the static regret for adversarial episodic loop-free MDP with known transition is \(\Omega(H\sqrt{K\log{(SA)}})\). We note that though our MDP model is different from the episodic loop-free MDP, we can treat our MDP model to the episodic loop-free MDP with an expanded state space \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}=\mathcal{S}\times[H]\). Thus, \(\Omega(H\sqrt{K\log{(SA)}})\) is also a lower bound of the static regret for the MDP in our work. We consider the following two cases:

**Case 1: \(\Gamma\leq 2H\).** In this case, we can directly utilize the lower bound of static regret as a lower bound of dynamic regret, i.e.,

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\geq\Omega(H\sqrt{K\log{(SA) }}).\] (20)

**Case 2: \(\Gamma>2H\).** Without loss of generality, we assume \(L=\lceil\Gamma/2H\rceil\) divides \(K\) and split the whole episodes into \(L\) pieces equally. Next, we construct a special policy sequence such that the policy sequence is fixed within each piece and only changes in the split point. Since the sequence changes at most \(L-1\leq\Gamma/2H\) times and the occupancy measure difference at each change point is at most \(2H\), the total path length in \(K\) episodes does not exceed \(\Gamma\). As a result, we have

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c})\geq LH\sqrt{K/L\log{(SA)}}= H\sqrt{KL\log{(SA)}}\geq\Omega(\sqrt{KH\Gamma\log{(SA)}}).\] (21)

Combining (20) and (21), we have the following lower bound for the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the known transition kernel,

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c}) \geq\Omega\big{(}\max\{H\sqrt{K\log{(SA)}},\sqrt{KH\Gamma\log{( SA)}}\}\big{)}\] \[\geq\Omega(\sqrt{KH(H+\Gamma)\log{(SA)}}),\] (22)

where the last inequality holds by \(\max\{a,b\}\geq(a+b)/2\).

Combining two lower bounds (19) and (22), we have the lower bound of the dynamic regret of adversarial linear mixture MDPs with the unknown transition kernel,

\[\mathrm{D}\text{-}\mathrm{Reg}_{K}(\pi_{1:K}^{c}) \geq\Omega\big{(}\max\{\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K},\sqrt{KH(H+\Gamma)\log {(SA)}}\}\big{)}\] \[\geq\Omega\big{(}\sqrt{d^{2}H^{3}K}+\sqrt{KH(H+\Gamma)\log{(SA)}} \big{)}.\]

This finishes the proof. 

## Appendix E Supporting Lemmas

In this section, we introduce the supporting lemmas used in the proofs.

**Lemma 9** (Three-point identity).: _Let \(\mathcal{X}\) be a closed and convex set. For any \(x\in\mathcal{X}\) and \(y,z\in\mathrm{int}\,\mathcal{X}\), it holds that_

\[D_{\psi}(x,y)+D_{\psi}(y,z)-D_{\psi}(x,z)=\langle\nabla\psi(z)-\nabla\psi(y),x- y\rangle.\]

**Lemma 10** (Abbasi-Yadkori et al. (2011, Lemma 11)).: _Let \(\{\mathbf{x}_{t}\}_{t=1}^{\infty}\) be a sequence in \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\) space, \(\mathbf{V}_{0}=\lambda\mathbf{I}\) and define \(\mathbf{V}_{t}=\mathbf{V}_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{t}\mathbf{x}_{i}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{\top}\). If \(\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}\right\|_{2}\leq L,\forall i\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}\), then for each \(t\in\mathbb{Z}_{+}\),_

\[\sum_{i=1}^{t}\min\left\{1,\left\|\mathbf{x}_{i}\right\|_{\mathbf{V}_{i-1}^{-1 }}\right\}\leq 2d\log\left(\frac{d\lambda+tL^{2}}{d\lambda}\right).\]

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction provide a concise overview of the contributions and scope. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations of this work in the introduction and conclusion section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We make no assumptions and provide proofs for all theoretical results in the appendices. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper adheres fully to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: The goal of this paper is to advance the theoretical understanding of RL, none societal impacts we feel must be specifically highlighted here. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not release any data or models that have a high risk for misuse. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not use existing assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper and does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
