###### Abstract

In recent years, there has been a significant growth in research focusing on minimum \(\ell_{2}\) norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators. However, the majority of these analyses have been limited to an unrealistic regression error structure, assuming independent and identically distributed errors with zero mean and common variance. In this paper, we explore prediction risk as well as estimation risk under more general regression error assumptions, highlighting the benefits of overparameterization in a more realistic setting that allows for clustered or serial dependence. Notably, we establish that the estimation difficulties associated with the variance components of both risks can be summarized through the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. Our findings suggest that the benefits of overparameterization can extend to time series, panel and grouped data.

## 1 Introduction

Recent years have witnessed a fast growing body of work that analyzes minimum \(\ell_{2}\) norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimators (see, e.g., 2, 17, 27, and references therein). Researchers in this field were inspired by the ability of deep neural networks to accurately predict noisy training data with perfect fits, a phenomenon known as "double descent" or "benign overfitting" (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 29, 22, among many others). They discovered that to achieve this phenomenon, overparameterization is critical.

In the setting of linear regression, we have the training data \(\{(x_{i},y_{i})\in\mathbb{R}^{p}\times\mathbb{R}:i=1,\cdots,n\}\), where the outcome variable \(y_{i}\) is generated from

\[y_{i}=x_{i}^{\top}\beta+\varepsilon_{i},\ i=1,\ldots,n,\]

\(x_{i}\) is a vector of features (or regressors), \(\beta\) is a vector of unknown parameters, and \(\varepsilon_{i}\) is a regression error. Here, \(n\) is the sample size of the training data and \(p\) is the dimension of the parameter vector \(\beta\).

In the literature, the main object for the theoretical analyses has been mainly on the out-of-sample prediction risk. That is, for the ridge or interpolation estimator \(\hat{\beta}\), the literature has focused on

\[\mathbb{E}\big{[}(x_{0}^{\top}\beta-x_{0}^{\top}\beta)^{2}\ |\ x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\big{]},\]

where \(x_{0}\) is a test observation that is identically distributed as \(x_{i}\) but independent of the training data. For example, Dobriban and Wager [13], Wu and Xu [28], Richards et al. [23], Hastie et al. [17] analyzed the predictive risk of ridge(less) regression and obtained exact asymptotic expressions under the assumption that \(p/n\) converges to some constant as both \(p\) and \(n\) go to infinity. Overall, they found the double descent behavior of the ridgeless least squares estimator in terms of the prediction risk. Bartlett et al. [2], Kobak et al. [19], Tsigler and Bartlett [27] characterized the phenomenon of benign overfitting in a different setting.

To the best of our knowledge, a vast majority of the theoretical analyses have been confined to a simple data generating process, namely, the observations are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), and the regression errors have mean zero, have the common variance, and are independent of the feature vectors. That is,

\[(y_{i},x_{i}^{\top})^{\top}\sim\text{i.i.d. with }\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i}]=0, \mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i}^{2}]=\sigma^{2}<\infty\text{ and }\varepsilon_{i}\text{ is independent of }x_{i}.\] (1)

This assumption, although convenient, is likely to be unrealistic in various real-world examples. For instance, Liao et al. [21] adopted high-dimensional linear models to examine the double descent phenomenon in economic forecasts. In their applications, the outcome variables include S&P firms' earnings, U.S. equity premium, U.S. unemployment rate, and countries' GDP growth rate. As in their applications, economic forecasts are associated with time series or panel data. As a result, it is improbable that (1) holds in these applications. As another example, Spiess et al. [26] examined the performance of high-dimensional synthetic control estimators with many control units. The outcome variable in their application is the state-level smoking rates in the Abadie et al. [1] dataset. Considering the geographical aspects of the U.S. states, it is unlikely that the regression errors underlying the synthetic control estimators adhere to (1). In short, it is desirable to go beyond the simple but unrealistic regression error assumption given in (1).

To further motivate, we start with our own real-data example from American Community Survey (ACS) 2018, extracted from IPUMS USA [24]. The ACS is an ongoing annual survey by the US Census Bureau that provides key information about the US population. To have a relatively homogeneous population, the sample extract is restricted to white males residing in California with at least a bachelor's degree. We consider a demographic group defined by their age, the type of degree, and the field of degree. Then, we compute the average of log hourly wages for each age-degree-field group, treat each group average as the outcome variable, and predict group wages by various group-level regression models where the regressors are constructed using the indicator variables of age, degree, and field as well as their interactions. We consider 7 specifications ranging from 209 to 2,182 regressors. To understand the role of non-i.i.d. regressor errors, we add the artificial noise to the training sample. See Appendix A for details regarding how to generate the artificial noise. In the experiment, the constant \(c\) varies such that \(c=0\) corresponds to no clustered dependence across observations but as a positive \(c\) gets larger, the noise has a larger share of clustered errors but the variance of the overall regression errors remains the same regardless of the value of \(c\). Figure 1 shows the in-sample (train) vs. out-of-sample (test) mean squared error (MSE) for various values of \(c\in\{0,0.25,0.5,0.75\}\). It can be seen that the experimental results are almost identical across different values of \(c\) especially when \(p>n\), suggesting that the double descent phenomenon might be universal for various degrees of clustered dependence, provided that the overall variance of the regression errors remains the same. It is our main goal to provide a firm foundation for this empirical phenomenon. To do so, we articulate the following research questions:

Figure 1: Comparison of in-sample and out-of-sample mean squared error (MSE) across various degrees of clustered noise. The vertical line indicates \(p=n\) (\(=1,415\)).

* How to analyze the out-of-sample prediction risk of the ridgeless least squares estimator under _general_ assumptions on the regression errors?
* Why does _not_ the prediction risk seem to be affected by the degrees of dependence across observations?

To delve into the prediction risk, suppose that \(\Sigma:=\mathbb{E}[x_{0}x_{0}^{\top}]\) is finite and positive definite. Then,

\[\mathbb{E}\Big{[}(x_{0}^{\top}\hat{\beta}-x_{0}^{\top}\beta)^{2}\mid x_{1}, \ldots,x_{n}\Big{]}=\mathbb{E}\Big{[}(\hat{\beta}-\beta)^{\top}\Sigma(\hat{ \beta}-\beta)\mid x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\Big{]}.\]

If \(\Sigma=I\) (i.e., the case of isotropic features), where \(I\) is the identity matrix, the mean squared error of the estimator defined by \(\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|^{2}]\), where \(\|\cdot\|\) is the usual Euclidean norm, is the same as the expectation of the prediction risk defined above. However, if \(\Sigma\neq I\), the link between the two quantities is less intimate. One may regard the prediction risk as the \(\Sigma\)-weighted mean squared error of the estimator; whereas \(\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|^{2}]\) can be viewed as an "unweighted" version, even if \(\Sigma\neq I\). In other words, regardless of the variance-covariance structure of the feature vector, \(\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|^{2}]\) treats each component of \(\beta\) "equally." The mean squared error of the estimator is arguably one of the most standard criteria to evaluate the quality of the estimator in statistics. For instance, in the celebrated work by James and Stein [18], the mean squared error criterion is used to show that the sample mean vector is not necessarily optimal even for standard normal vectors (so-called "Stein's paradox"). Many follow-up papers used the same criterion; e.g., Hansen [16] compared the mean-squared error of ordinary least squares, James-Stein, and Lasso estimators in an underparameterized regime. Both \(\Sigma\)-weighted and unweighted versions of the mean squared error are interesting objects to study. For example, Dobriban and Wager [13] called the former "predictive risk" and the latter "estimation risk" in high-dimensional linear models; Berthier et al. [6] called the former "generalization error" and the latter "reconstruction error" in the context of stochastic gradient descent for the least squares problem using the noiseless linear model. In this paper, we analyze both weighted and unweighted mean squared errors of the ridgeless estimator under general assumptions on the data-generating processes, not to mention anisotropic features. Furthermore, our focus is on the finite-sample analysis, that is, both \(p\) and \(n\) are fixed but \(p>n\).

Although most of the existing papers consider the simple setting as in (1), our work is not the first paper to consider more general regression errors in the overparameterized regime. Chinot et al. [9], Chinot and Lerasle [8] analyzed minimum norm interpolation estimators as well as regularized empirical risk minimizers in linear models without any conditions on the regression errors. Specifically, Chinot and Lerasle [8] showed that, with high probability, without assumption on the regression errors, for the minimum norm interpolation estimator, \((\hat{\beta}-\beta)^{\top}\Sigma(\hat{\beta}-\beta)\) is bounded from above by \(\big{(}\|\beta\|^{2}\sum_{i\geq c\kappa}\lambda_{i}(\Sigma)\vee\sum_{i=1}^{n} \varepsilon_{i}^{2}\big{)}/n\), where \(c\) is an absolute constant and \(\lambda_{i}(\Sigma)\) is the eigenvalues of \(\Sigma\) in descending order. Chinot and Lerasle [8] also obtained the bounds on the estimation error \((\hat{\beta}-\beta)^{\top}(\hat{\beta}-\beta)\). Our work is distinct and complements these papers in the sense that we allow for a general variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors. The main motivation of not making any assumptions on \(\varepsilon_{i}\) in Chinot et al. [9] and Chinot and Lerasle [8] is to allow for potentially adversarial errors. We aim to allow for a general variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors to accommodate time series and clustered data, which are common in applications. See, e.g., Hansen [15] for a textbook treatment (see Chapter 14 for time series and Section 4.21 for clustered data).

The main contribution of this paper is that we provide _exact finite-sample_ characterization of the variance component of the prediction and estimation risks under the assumption that \(X=[x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n}]^{\top}\) is _left-spherical_ (e.g., \(x_{i}\)'s can be i.i.d. normal with mean zero but more general); \(\varepsilon_{i}\)'s _can be correlated and have non-identical variances_; and \(\varepsilon_{i}\)'s are independent of \(x_{i}\)'s. Specifically, the variance term can be factorized into a product between two terms: one term depends only on the _trace_ of the variance-covariance matrix, say \(\Omega\), of \(\varepsilon_{i}\)'s; the other term is solely determined by the distribution of \(x_{i}\)'s. Interestingly, we find that although \(\Omega\) may contain non-zero off-diagonal elements, only the trace of \(\Omega\) matters, as hinted by Figure 1, and further demonstrate our finding via numerical experiments. In addition, we obtain exact finite-sample expression for the bias terms when the regression coefficients follow the random-effects hypothesis [13]. Our finite-sample findings offer a distinct viewpoint on the prediction and estimation risks, contrasting with the asymptotic inverse relationship (for optimally chosen ridge estimators) between the predictive and estimation risks uncovered by Dobriban and Wager [13]. Finally, we connect our findings to the existing results on the prediction risk [e.g., 17] by considering the asymptotic behavior of estimation risk.

One of the limitations of our theoretical analysis is that the design matrix \(X\) is assumed to be left-spherical, although it is more general than i.i.d. normal with mean zero. We not only view this as a convenient assumption but also expect that our findings will hold at least approximately even if \(X\) does not follow the left-spherical distribution. It is a topic for future research to formally investigate this conjecture.

## 2 The Framework under General Assumptions on Regression Errors

We first describe the minimum \(\ell_{2}\) norm (ridgeless) interpolation least squares estimator in the overparameterized case (\(p>n\)). Define

\[y :=[y_{1},y_{2},\cdots,y_{n}]^{\top}\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\] \[\varepsilon :=[\varepsilon_{1},\varepsilon_{2},\cdots,\varepsilon_{n}]^{ \top}\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\] \[X^{\top} :=[x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{n}]\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times n},\]

so that \(y=X\beta+\varepsilon\). The estimator we consider is

\[\hat{\beta}:=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{b\in\mathbb{R}^{p}}\{\|b\|:Xb=y\}=(X^{ \top}X)^{\top}X^{\top}y=X^{\dagger}y,\]

where \(A^{\dagger}\) denotes the Moore-Penrose inverse of a matrix \(A\).

The main object of interest in this paper is the prediction and estimation risks of \(\hat{\beta}\) under the data scenario such that the regression error \(\varepsilon_{i}\) may _not_ be i.i.d. Formally, we make the following assumptions.

**Assumption 2.1**.: (i) \(y=X\beta+\varepsilon\), where \(\varepsilon\) is independent of \(X\), and \(\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon]=0\). (ii) \(\Omega:=\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon e^{\top}]\) is finite and positive definite (but not necessarily spherical).

We emphasize that Assumption 2.1 is more general than the standard assumption in the literature on benign overfitting that typically assumes that \(\Omega\equiv\sigma^{2}I\). Assumption 2.1 allows for non-identical variances across the elements of \(\varepsilon\) because the diagonal elements of \(\Omega\) can be different among each other. Furthermore, it allows for non-zero off-diagonal elements in \(\Omega\). It is difficult to assume that the regression errors are independent among each other with time series or clustered data; thus, in these settings, it is important to allow for general \(\Omega\neq\sigma^{2}I\). Below we present a couple of such examples.

**Example 2.1** (Ar(1) Errors).: Suppose that the regressor error follows an autoregressive process:

\[\varepsilon_{i}=\rho\varepsilon_{i-1}+\eta_{i},\] (2)

where \(\rho\in(-1,1)\) is an autoregressive parameter, \(\eta_{i}\) is independent and identically distributed with mean zero and variance \(\sigma^{2}(0<\sigma^{2}<\infty)\) and is independent of \(X\). Then, the (\(i\), \(j\)) element of \(\Omega\) is

\[\Omega_{ij}=\frac{\sigma^{2}}{1-\rho^{2}}\rho^{|i-j|}.\]

Note that \(\Omega_{ij}\neq 0\) as long as \(\rho\neq 0\).

**Example 2.2** (Clustered Errors).: Suppose that regression errors are mutually independent across clusters but they can be arbitrarily correlated within the same cluster. For instance, students in the same school may affect each other and also have the same teachers; thus it would be difficult to assume independence across student test scores within the same school. However, it might be reasonable that student test scores are independent across different schools. For example, assume that (i) if the regression error \(\varepsilon_{i}\) belongs to cluster \(g\), where \(g=1,\ldots,G\) and \(G\) is the number of clusters, \(\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i}^{2}]=\sigma_{g}^{2}\) for some constant \(\sigma_{g}^{2}>0\) that can vary over \(g\); (ii) if the regression errors \(\varepsilon_{i}\) and \(\varepsilon_{j}\) (\(i\neq j\)) belong to the same cluster \(g\), \(\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i}\varepsilon_{j}]=\rho_{g}\) for some constant \(\rho_{g}\neq 0\) that can be different across \(g\); and (iii) if the regression errors \(\varepsilon_{i}\) and \(\varepsilon_{j}\) (\(i\neq j\)) do not belong to the same cluster, \(\mathbb{E}[\varepsilon_{i}\varepsilon_{j}]=0\). Then, \(\Omega\) is block diagonal with possibly non-identical blocks.

For vector \(a\) and square matrix \(A\), let \(\|a\|_{A}^{2}:=a^{\top}Aa\). Conditional on \(X\) and given \(A\), we define

\[\operatorname{Bias}_{A}(\hat{\beta}\mid X):=\|\mathbb{E}[\hat{\beta}\mid X]- \beta\|_{A}\quad\text{and}\quad\operatorname{Var}_{A}(\hat{\beta}\mid X):= \operatorname{Tr}(\operatorname{Cov}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)A),\]

and we write \(\operatorname{Var}=\operatorname{Var}_{I}\) and \(\operatorname{Bias}=\operatorname{Bias}_{I}\) for the sake of brevity in notation.

The mean squared prediction error for an unseen test observation \(x_{0}\) with the positive definite covariance matrix \(\Sigma:=\mathbb{E}[x_{0}x_{0}^{\top}]\) (assuming that \(x_{0}\) is independent of the training data \(X\)) and the mean squared estimation error of \(\hat{\beta}\) conditional on \(X\) can be written as:

\[R_{P}(\hat{\beta}\mid X) :=\mathbb{E}[(x_{0}^{\top}\hat{\beta}-x_{0}^{\top}\beta)^{2}\mid X ]=[\text{Bias}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]^{2}+\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta} \mid X),\] \[R_{E}(\hat{\beta}\mid X) :=\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|^{2}\mid X]=[\text{Bias}(\hat{ \beta}\mid X)]^{2}+\text{Var}(\hat{\beta}\mid X).\]

In what follows, we obtain exact finite-sample expressions for prediction and estimation risks:

\[R_{P}(\hat{\beta}):=\mathbb{E}_{X}[R_{P}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]\quad\text{and} \quad R_{E}(\hat{\beta}):=\mathbb{E}_{X}[R_{E}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)].\]

We first analyze the variance terms for both risks and then study the bias terms.

## 3 The Variance Components of Prediction and Estimation Risks

### The variance component of prediction risk

We rewrite the variance component of prediction risk as follows:

\[\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)=\text{Tr}(\text{Cov}(\hat{\beta}\mid X )\Sigma)=\text{Tr}(X^{\dagger}\Omega X^{\dagger\top}\Sigma)=\|SX^{\dagger}T\| _{F}^{2},\] (3)

where positive definite symmetric matrices \(S:=\Sigma^{1/2}\) and \(T:=\Omega^{1/2}\) are the square root matrices of the positive definite matrices \(\Sigma\) and \(\Omega\), respectively. To compute the above Frobenius norm of the matrix \(SX^{\dagger}T\), we need to compute the alignment of the right-singular vectors of \(B:=SX^{\dagger}\in\mathbb{R}^{P\times n}\) with the left-eigenvectors of \(T\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\). Here, \(B\) is a random matrix while \(T\) is fixed. Therefore, we need the distribution of the right-singular vectors of the random matrix \(B\).

Perhaps surprisingly, to compute the _expected_ variance \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]\), it turns out that we do not need the distribution of the singular vectors if we make a minimal assumption (the _left-spherical symmetry_ of \(X\)) which is weaker than the assumption that \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) is i.i.d. normal with \(\mathbb{E}[x_{1}]=0\).

**Definition 3.1** (Left-Spherical Symmetry [10, 11, 12, 14]).: A random matrix \(Z\) or its distribution is called to be _left-spherical_ if \(OZ\) and \(Z\) have the same distribution (\(OZ\stackrel{{ d}}{{=}}Z\)) for any fixed orthogonal matrix \(O\in O(n):=\{A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}:AA^{\top}=A^{\top}A=I\}\).

**Assumption 3.2**.: The design matrix \(X\) is left-spherical.

For the isotropic error case (\(\Omega=I\)), we have \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]=\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{ Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\) directly from equation 3 since \(X^{\dagger}X^{\dagger\top}=(X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\). Moreover, for the arbitrary error, the left-spherical symmetry of \(X\) plays a critical role to _factor out_ the same \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\) and the trace of the variance-covariance matrix of the regression errors, \(\text{Tr}(\Omega)\), from the variance after the expectation over \(X\).

**Lemma 3.3**.: _For a subset \(\mathcal{S}\subset\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}\) satisfying \(C^{-1}\in\mathcal{S}\) for all \(C\in\mathcal{S}\), if matrix-valued random variables \(Z\) and AZ have the same distribution measure \(\mu_{Z}\) for any \(A\in\mathcal{S}\), then we have_

\[\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(Z)]=\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(AZ)]=\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\mathbb{E}_{A^{\top }\sim r}[f(A^{\prime}Z)]]\]

_for any function \(f\in L^{1}(\mu_{Z})\) and any probability density function \(\nu\) on \(\mathcal{S}\)._

**Theorem 3.4**.: _Let Assumptions 2.1, and 3.2 hold. Then, we have_

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]=\frac{1}{n}\text{Tr}( \Omega)\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)].\]

Sketch of Proof.: With \(B=\Sigma^{1/2}X^{\dagger}\) and \(T=\Omega^{1/2}\), we can rewrite the variance as follows:

\[\text{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)=\|BT\|_{F}^{2}=\|UDV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T}V_{ T}^{\top}\|_{F}^{2}=\|DV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T}\|_{F}^{2}\]

from the singular value decompositions \(B=UDV^{\top}\) and \(T=U_{T}D_{T}V_{T}^{\top}\) with orthogonal matrices \(U,V,U_{T},V_{T}\), and diagonal matrices \(D,D_{T}\). Then, we need to compute the alignment \(V^{\top}U_{T}\) of the right-singular vectors of \(B\) with the left-eigenvectors of \(T\) because

\[\|DV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T}\|_{F}^{2}=\lambda\left((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma\right) ^{\top}\Gamma(X)\lambda(\Omega)=a(X)^{\top}\Gamma(X)b,\]where \(v^{(i)}:=V_{j}\), \(u^{(j)}:=(U_{T})_{:j}\), \(\gamma_{ij}:=\langle v^{(i)},u^{(j)}\rangle^{2}\geq 0\), \(\Gamma(X):=(\gamma_{ij})_{i,j}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\) and \(\lambda(A)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is a vector where its elements are the eigenvalues of \(A\).

Now, we want to compute the expected variance. To do so, from Lemma 3.3 with \(\mathcal{S}=O(n)\) and the left-spherical symmetry of \(X\), we can obtain

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[a(X)^{\top}\Gamma(X)b]=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\mathbb{E}_{O\sim \nu}[a(OX)^{\top}\Gamma(OX)b]\right]=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[a(X)^{\top}\mathbb{E} _{O\sim\nu}[\Gamma(OX)]b\right],\]

where \(\nu\) is the unique uniform distribution (the Haar measure) over the orthogonal matrices \(O(n)\).

Here, we can show that \(\mathbb{E}_{O\sim\nu}[\Gamma(OX)]=\frac{1}{n}J\), where \(J\) is the all-ones matrix with \(J_{ij}=1(i,j=1,2,\cdots,n)\). Therefore, we have the expected variance as follows:

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[ a(X)^{\top}\frac{1}{n}Jb\right]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}[a_{i}(X)]b _{j}=\frac{1}{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\, \mathrm{Tr}(\Omega).\]

The proofs of Lemma 3.3 and Theorem 3.4 are in the supplementary appendix.

### The variance component of estimation risk

For the expected variance \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]\) of the estimation risk, a similar argument still holds if plugging-in \(B=X^{\dagger}\) instead of \(B=\Sigma^{1/2}X^{\dagger}\).

**Theorem 3.5**.: _Let Assumptions 2.1, and 3.2 hold. Then, we have_

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]=\frac{1}{np}\,\mathrm{Tr}( \Omega)\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Tr}(\Lambda^{\dagger})],\]

_where \(XX^{\top}/p=U\Lambda U^{\top}\) for some orthogonal matrix \(U\in O(n)\)._

### Numerical experiments

In this section, we validate our theory with some numerical experiments of Examples 2.1 and 2.2, especially how the expected variance is related to the general covariance \(\Omega\) of the regressor error \(\varepsilon\). In the both examples, we sample \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) from \(\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\) with a general feature covariance \(\Sigma=U_{\Sigma}D_{\Sigma}U_{\Sigma}^{\top}\) for an orthogonal matrix \(U_{\Sigma}\in O(p)\) and a diagonal matrix \(D_{\Sigma}>0\). In this setting, we have \(\mathrm{rank}(XX^{\top})=n\) and \(\Lambda^{\dagger}=\Lambda^{-1}\) almost everywhere.

Figure 2: Our theory (dashed lines) matches the expected variances (solid lines) of the prediction (left) and estimation risks (right) in Example 2.1 (AR(1) Errors). Each point \((\sigma^{2},\rho^{2})\) represents a different noise covariance matrix \(\Omega\), but with the same \(\mathrm{Tr}(\Omega)\) along each line \(\{(\sigma^{2},\rho^{2}):\sigma^{2}/\kappa^{2}+\rho^{2}=1\}\) for some \(\kappa^{2}>0\), they have the same expected variance. We set \(n=50\), \(p=100\), and evaluate on 100 samples of \(X\) and 100 samples of \(\varepsilon\) (for each realization of \(X\)) to approximate the expectations.

AR(1) ErrorsAs shown in Example 2.1, when the regressor error follows an autoregressive process in equation 2, we have \(\Omega_{ij}=\sigma^{2}\rho^{i_{k}-j}/(1-\rho^{2})\) and \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n=\sigma^{2}/(1-\rho^{2})\). Therefore, for pairs of \((\sigma^{2},\rho^{2})\) with the same \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n\), they are expected to yield the same variances of the prediction and estimation risk from Theorem 3.4 and 3.5 even though they have different off-diagonal elements in \(\Omega\). To be specific, the pairs \((\sigma^{2},\rho^{2})\) on a line \(\{(\sigma^{2},\rho^{2}):\sigma^{2}/\kappa^{2}+\rho^{2}=1\}\) have the same \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n\) and the same expected variance which gets larger for the line with respect to a larger \(\kappa^{2}\).

Figure 2 (left) shows the contour plots of \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\operatorname{Var}_{\Sigma}(\beta\mid X)]\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)\mathbb{E}_{X}[\operatorname{Tr}(X^{ \top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\) for different pairs of \((\sigma^{2},\rho^{2})\) in Example 2.1. They have different slopes \(-\kappa^{2}\) according to the value of \(\kappa^{2}=\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n\). The right panel shows equivalent contour plots for estimation risk.

Clustered ErrorsNow consider the block diagonal covariance matrix \(\Omega=\operatorname{diag}(\Omega_{1},\Omega_{2},\cdots,\Omega_{G})\) in Example 2.2, where \(\Omega_{g}\) is an \(n_{g}\times n_{g}\) matrix with \((\Omega_{g})_{ii}=\sigma_{g}^{2}\) and \((\Omega_{g})_{ij}=\rho_{g}\) (\(i\neq j\)) for each \(i,j=1,2,\cdots,n_{g}\) and \(g=1,2,\cdots,G\). Let \(n=\sum_{g=1}^{G}n_{g}\). We then have \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n=\sum_{g=1}^{G}\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega_{g})/n= \sum_{g=1}^{G}(n_{g}/n)\sigma_{g}^{2}\). Therefore, given a partition \(\{n_{g}\}_{g=1}^{G}\) of the \(n\) observations, the covariance matrices \(\Omega\) with different \(\{\sigma_{g}^{2}\}_{g=1}^{G}\) have the same \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n\) if \((\sigma_{1}^{2},\sigma_{2}^{2},\cdots,\sigma_{G}^{2})\in\mathbb{R}^{G}\) are on the same hyperplane \(\frac{n_{1}}{n}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\frac{n_{2}}{n}\sigma_{2}^{2}+\cdots+\frac{n_{G }}{n}\sigma_{G}^{2}=\kappa^{2}\) for some \(\kappa^{2}>0\).

Figure 3 (left) shows the contour plots of \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\operatorname{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]\) and \(\frac{1}{n}\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)\mathbb{E}_{X}[\operatorname{Tr}(X^{ \top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\) for different pairs of \((\sigma_{1}^{2},\sigma_{2}^{2})\) for a simple two-clusters example (\(G=2\)) of Example 2.2 with \((n_{1},n_{2})=(5,15)\). Here, we use a fixed value of \(\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}=0.05\), but the results are the same regardless of their values, as shown in the appendix. Unlike Example 2.1, the hyperplanes are orthogonal to \(v=[n_{1},n_{2}]^{\top}\) regardless of the value of \(\kappa^{2}=\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n\). Again, the right panel shows equivalent contour plots for estimation risk.

## 4 The Bias Components of Prediction and Estimation Risks

Our main contribution is to allow for general assumptions on the regression errors, and thus the bias parts remain the same as they do not change with respect to the regression errors. For completeness, in this section, we briefly summarize the results on the bias components. First, we make the following assumption for a constant rank deficiency of \(X^{\top}X\) which holds, for example, each \(x_{i}\) has a positive definite covariance matrix and is independent of each other.

**Assumption 4.1**.: \(\operatorname{rank}(X)=n\) almost everywhere.

Figure 3: Our theory (dashed lines) matches the expected variances (solid lines) of the prediction (left) and estimation risks (right) in Example 2.2 (Clustered Errors). Each point \((\sigma^{2},\rho^{2})\) represents a different noise covariance matrix \(\Omega\), but with the same \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)\) along each line \(\{(\sigma_{1}^{2},\sigma_{2}^{2}):\frac{n_{1}}{n}\sigma_{1}^{2}+\frac{n_{2}}{ n}\sigma_{2}^{2}=\kappa^{2}\}\) for some \(\kappa^{2}>0\), they have the same expected variance. We set \(G=2,(n_{1}=5,n_{2}=15),n=20,p=40,\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}=0.05\), and evaluate on 100 samples of \(X\) and 100 samples of \(\varepsilon\) (for each realization of \(X\)) to approximate the expectations.

### The bias component of prediction risk

The bias term of prediction risk can be expressed as follows:

\[[\mathrm{Bias}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]^{2}=(S\beta)^{\top}\lim_{\lambda \searrow 0}\lambda^{2}(S^{-1}\hat{\Sigma}S+\lambda I)^{-2}S\beta,\] (4)

where \(\hat{\Sigma}:=X^{\top}X/n\). Now, in order to obtain an exact closed form solution, we make the following assumption:

**Assumption 4.2**.: \(\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[S\beta(S\beta)^{\top}]=r_{\Sigma}^{2}I/p\), where \(r_{\Sigma}^{2}:=\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[|\beta|]_{\Sigma}^{2}]<\infty\) and \(\beta\) is independent of \(X\).

A similar assumption (see Assumption 4.4) has been shown to be useful to obtain closed-form expressions in the literature (e.g., 13, 23, 20, 7).

Under this assumption, since \([\mathrm{Bias}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]^{2}=\mathrm{Tr}[S\beta(S\beta)^{ \top}\lim_{\lambda\searrow 0}\lambda^{2}(S^{-1}\hat{\Sigma}S+\lambda I)^{-2}]\) from equation 4, we have the expected bias (conditional on \(X\)) as follows:

\[\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[\mathrm{Bias}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)^{2}\mid X]=\frac {r_{\Sigma}^{2}}{p}\lim_{\lambda\searrow 0}\sum_{i=1}^{p}\frac{\lambda^{2}}{( \tilde{s}_{i}+\lambda)^{2}}=\frac{r_{\Sigma}^{2}}{p}\left|\left|i\in[p]:\tilde {s}_{i}=0\right|\right|=r_{\Sigma}^{2}\frac{p-n}{p},\]

where \(\tilde{s}_{i}\) are the eigenvalues of \(S^{-1}\hat{\Sigma}S\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}\) and \(\mathrm{rank}(S^{-1}\hat{\Sigma}S)=\mathrm{rank}(X)=n\) almost everywhere under Assumption 4.1. This bias is independent of the distribution of \(X\) or the spectral density of \(S^{-1}\hat{\Sigma}S\), but only depending on the rank deficiency of the realization of \(X\).

Finally, the prediction risk \(R_{P}(\hat{\beta})\) can be summarized as follows:

**Corollary 4.3**.: _Let Assumptions 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.2 hold. Then, we have_

\[R_{P}(\hat{\beta})=r_{\Sigma}^{2}\left(1-\frac{n}{p}\right)+\frac{\mathrm{Tr }(\Omega)}{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\mathrm{Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\top}\Sigma)\right].\]

### The bias component of estimation risk

For the bias component of estimation risk, we can obtain a similar result with 4.1 as follows:

\[[\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]^{2}=\beta^{\top}(I-\hat{\Sigma}^{\dagger} \hat{\Sigma})\beta=\lim_{\lambda\searrow 0}\beta^{\top}\lambda(\hat{\Sigma}+ \lambda I)^{-1}\beta.\]

**Assumption 4.4**.: \(\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[\beta\beta^{\top}]=r^{2}I/p\), where \(r^{2}:=\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[|\beta|]^{2}]<\infty\) and \(\beta\) is independent of \(X\).

Under Assumption 4.4, we have the expected bias (conditional on \(X\)) as follows:

\[\mathbb{E}_{\beta}[\mathrm{Bias}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)^{2}\mid X]=\frac{r^{2}}{p }\lim_{\lambda\searrow 0}\sum_{i=1}^{p}\frac{\lambda}{s_{i}+\lambda}=\frac{r^{2}}{p} \left|\left|i\in[p]:s_{i}=0\right|\right|=r^{2}\frac{p-n}{p},\] (5)

where \(s_{i}\) are the eigenvalues of \(\hat{\Sigma}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times p}\) and \(\mathrm{rank}(\hat{\Sigma})=\mathrm{rank}(X)=n\) under Assumption 4.1.

Thanks to Theorem 3.5 and equation 5, we obtain the following corollary for estimation risk.

**Corollary 4.5**.: _Let Assumptions 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.4 hold. Then, we have_

\[R_{E}(\hat{\beta})=r^{2}\left(1-\frac{n}{p}\right)+\frac{\mathrm{Tr}(\Omega)}{ n}\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\int\frac{1}{s}dF^{XX^{\top}/n}(s)\right],\]

_where \(F^{A}(s):=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}1\{\lambda_{i}(A)\leq s\}\) is the empirical spectral distribution of a matrix \(A\) and \(\lambda_{1}(A),\lambda_{2}(A),\cdots,\lambda_{n}(A)\) are the eigenvalues of \(A\)._

The proof of Corollary 4.5 is in the appendix.

#### 4.2.1 Asymptotic analysis of estimation risk

To study the asymptotic behavior of estimation risk, we follow the previous approaches [13, 17]. First, we define the Stieltjes transform as follows:

**Definition 4.6**.: The Stieltjes transform \(s_{F}(z)\) of a df \(F\) is defined as:

\[s_{F}(z):=\int\frac{1}{x-z}dF(x),\text{ for }z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\text{supp}(F).\]We are now ready to investigate the asymptotic behavior of the mean squared estimation error with the following theorem:

**Theorem 4.7**.: _[_25_, Theorem 1.1]_ _Suppose that the rows \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) in \(X\) are i.i.d. centered random vectors with \(\mathbb{E}[x_{1}x_{1}^{*}]=\Sigma\) and that the empirical spectral distribution \(F^{\Sigma}(s)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{i=1}^{p}1[\tau_{i}\leq s]\) of \(\Sigma\) converges almost surely to a probability distribution function \(H\) as \(p\to\infty\). When \(p/n\to\gamma>0\) as \(n,p\to\infty\), then a.s., \(F^{XX^{\gamma}/n}\) converges vaguely to a \(df\,F\) and the limit \(s^{*}:=\lim_{\varepsilon\searrow 0}s_{F}(z)\) of its Stieltjes transform \(s_{F}\) is the unique solution to the equation:_

\[1-\frac{1}{\gamma}=\int\frac{1}{1+\tau s^{*}}dH(\tau).\] (6)

This theorem is a direct consequence of Theorem 1.1 in Silverstein and Bai [25]. Then, from Corollary 4.5, we can write the limit of estimation risk as follows:

**Corollary 4.8**.: _Let Assumptions 2.1, 3.2, 4.1, and 4.4 hold. Then, under the same assumption as Theorem 4.7, as \(n,p\to\infty\) and \(p/n\to\gamma\), where \(1<\gamma<\infty\) is a constant, we have_

\[R_{E}(\hat{\beta})=\mathbb{E}[\|\hat{\beta}-\beta\|^{2}]\to r^{2}\left(1- \frac{1}{\gamma}\right)+s^{*}\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega) }{n}.\]

Here, the limit \(s^{*}\) of the Stieltjes transform \(s_{F}\) is highly connected with the shape of the spectral distribution of \(\Sigma\). For example, in the case of isotropic features (\(\Sigma=I\)), i.e., \(dH(\tau)=\delta(\tau-1)d\tau\), we have \(s_{\text{iso}}^{*}=(\gamma-1)^{-1}\) from \(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}=\frac{1}{1+\tau_{i}^{*}}\). In addition, if \(\Omega=\sigma^{2}I\), then the limit of the mean squared error is exactly the same as the expression for \(\gamma>1\) in equation (10) of Hastie et al. [17, Theorem 1]. This is because prediction risk is the same as estimation risk when \(\Sigma=I\).

_Remark 4.9_.: Generally, if the support of \(H\) is bounded within \([c_{H},C_{H}]\subset\mathbb{R}\) for some positive constants \(0<c_{H}\leq C_{H}<\infty\), then we can observe the double descent phenomenon in the overparameterization regime with \(\lim_{\gamma\searrow 1}s^{*}=\infty\) and \(\lim_{\gamma\to\infty}s^{*}=0\) with \(s^{*}=\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\right)\) from the following inequalities:

\[C_{H}^{-1}\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\leq s^{*}\leq c_{H}^{-1}\frac{1}{\gamma-1}.\] (7)

In fact, a tighter lower bound is available:

\[s^{*}\geq\mu_{H}^{-1}(\gamma-1)^{-1},\] (8)

where \(\mu_{H}:=\mathbb{E}_{\tau-H}[\tau]\), i.e., the mean of distribution \(H\). The proofs of equation 7 and equation 8 are given in the supplementary appendix.

We conclude this paper by plotting the "descent curve" in the overparameterization regime in Figure 4. On one hand, the expected variance (\(\times\)) perfectly matches its theoretical counterpart (\(\blacklozenge\)) and goes to zero as \(\gamma\) gets large. On the other hand, the bias term is bounded even if \(\gamma\to\infty\). The appendix contains the experimental details for all the figures.

Figure 4: The “descent curve” in the overparameterization regime for prediction risk (left) and estimation risk (right). We test \(\Omega\)’s with \(\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n=1,2,4\) in black, blue, red, respectively. For the anisotropic feature, the expected variance (\(\times\)) and its theoretical expression (\(\blacklozenge\)) are \(\Theta\left(\frac{\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)/n}{\gamma-1}\right)\) and larger than that in the high-dimensional asymptotics for the isotropic \(\Sigma=I\). For the isotropic \(\Sigma=I\), the variance terms (dotted) and the bias terms (dashed) in the high-dimensional asymptotics are \(\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\operatorname{Tr}(\Omega)}{n}\) and \(r^{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\right)\), respectively.

## Appendix A Details for drawing Figure 1

To draw Figure 1, we use a sample extract from American Community Survey (ACS) 2018. To have a relatively homogeneous population, the sample extract is restricted to white males residing in California with at least a bachelor's degree. We consider a demographic group defined by their age in years (between 25 and 70), the type of degree (bachelor's, master's, professional, and doctoral), and the field of degree (172 unique values). Then, we compute the average of log hourly wages for each age-degree-field group (all together 7,073 unique groups in the sample). We treat each group average as the outcome variable (say, \(y_{a,d,f}\)) and predict group wages by various group-level regression models where the regressors are constructed using the indicator variables of age, degree, and field as well as their interactions: that is,

\[y_{a,d,f}=x_{a,d,f}^{\top}\beta+e_{a,d,f}.\]

For the regressors \(x_{a,d,f}\), we consider 7 specifications ranging from 209 to 2,183 regressors:

* Spec. 1 (\(p=209\)): dummy variables for age (say, \(x_{a}\)) + dummy variables for the type of degree (say, \(x_{d}\)) + dummy variables for the field of degree (say, \(x_{f}\)),
* Spec. 2 (\(p=391\)): Spec. 1 + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{a}\),
* Spec. 3 (\(p=598\)): Spec. 1 + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{f}\),
* Spec. 4 (\(p=778\)): Spec. 1 + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{a}\) + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{f}\),
* Spec. 5 (\(p=1640\)): Spec. 1 + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{a}\) + all interactions between \(x_{a}\) and \(x_{f}\),
* Spec. 6 (\(p=1754\)): Spec. 1 + all interactions between \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{f}\) + all interactions between \(x_{a}\) and \(x_{f}\),
* Spec. 7 (\(p=2182\)): Spec. 1 + all three-way interactions among \(x_{a}\), \(x_{d}\) and \(x_{f}\).

Here, the dummy variable are constructed using one-hot encoding. We randomly split the sample into the train and test samples with a ratio of 1 : 4. The resulting sample sizes are 1,415 and 5,658, respectively. To understand the role of non-i.i.d. regressor errors, we add the artificial noise to the training sample: that is, we compute the ridgeless least squares estimator using the training sample of \((\tilde{y}_{a,d,f},x_{a,d,f}^{\top})^{\top}\), where \(\tilde{y}_{a,d,f}=y_{a,d,f}+u_{a,d,f}\). Here, the artificial noise \(u_{a,d,f}\) has the form

\[u_{a,d,f}\equiv\frac{(1-c)e_{a,d,f}+c\cdot e_{f}}{\sqrt{(1-c)^{2}+c^{2}}},\]

where \(e_{a,d,f}\sim N(0,\sigma^{2})\), independently across age (\(a\)), degree (\(d\)) and field (\(f\)); \(e_{f}\) is the average of another independent \(N(0,\sigma^{2})\) variable within \(f\) (hence, \(e_{f}\) is identical for each value of \(f\)) and thus the source of clustered errors; and \(c\in\{0,0.25,0.5,0.75\}\) is a constant that will be varied across the experiment. As \(c\) gets larger, the noise has a larger share of clustered errors but the variance of the overall regression errors (\(u_{a,d,f}\)) remains the same: in other words, \(\text{var}(u_{a,d,f})=\sigma^{2}\) for each value of \(c\). Figure 1 was generated with \(\sigma=0.5\) by generating the artificial noise only once.

## Appendix B Details for drawing Figures 2, 3, and 4

To draw Figure 2, 3, and 4, we sample \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) from \(\mathcal{N}(0,\Sigma)\) with \(\Sigma=U_{\Sigma}D_{\Sigma}U_{\Sigma}^{\top}\) where \(U_{\Sigma}\) is an orthogonal matrix random variable, drawn from the uniform (Haar) distribution on \(\mathcal{O}(p)\), and \(D_{\Sigma}\) is a diagonal matrix with its elements \(d_{i}=|z_{i}|/\sum_{i=1}^{p}|z_{i}|\) being sampled with \(z_{i}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,1)\) for each \(i=1,2,\cdots,p\). With this general anisotropic \(\Sigma\), the term \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Tr}(\Lambda^{-1})]/p\) is somewhat larger than \(\mu_{H}^{-1}s_{\text{so}}^{*}=(\gamma-1)^{-1}\) which is 1 in Figure 2 and 3 since \(\mu_{H}=1\) and \(\gamma=2\). For example, in Figure 2, when \(\sigma^{2}=1,\rho^{2}=0\), we have \(\text{Tr}(\Omega)/n=1\) but \(\text{Tr}(\Omega)\mathbb{E}_{X}[\text{Tr}(\Lambda^{-1})]/(np)>1\).

In Figure 4, we fix \(n=50\) and use \(p=n\gamma\) for \(\gamma\in[1,\,100]\).

To compute the expectations of \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}|X)]\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{A}^{-1})]\) over \(X\), we sample \(N_{X}\) samples of \(X\)'s, \(X_{1},X_{2},\cdots,X_{N_{X}}\). Moreover, to compute the expectation over \(\varepsilon\) in \(\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}|X_{i})\equiv\mathrm{Tr}\left(\mathbb{E}_{x}[\hat{ \beta}\hat{\beta}^{\top}]-\mathbb{E}_{x}[\hat{\beta}]\mathbb{E}_{x}[\hat{ \beta}]^{\top}\right)\), we sample \(N_{\varepsilon}\) samples of \(\varepsilon\)'s, \(\varepsilon_{1},\varepsilon_{2},\cdots,\varepsilon_{N_{x}}\) for each realization \(X_{i}\). To be specific,

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}|X)]\approx\frac{1}{N_{X}} \sum_{i=1}^{N_{x}}\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}|X_{i})\approx\frac{1}{N_{X}}\sum_{i =1}^{N_{x}}\mathrm{Tr}\left(\frac{1}{N_{\varepsilon}}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}}\hat{ \beta}_{i,j}\hat{\beta}_{i,j}^{\top}-\frac{1}{N_{\varepsilon}}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{ x}}\hat{\beta}_{i,j}\frac{1}{N_{\varepsilon}}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}}\hat{\beta}_{i,j}^{ \top}\right)\] \[\frac{1}{p}\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{A}^{-1})]\approx \frac{1}{N_{X}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{X}}\mathrm{Tr}((X_{i}X_{i}^{\top})^{-1})=\frac{ 1}{N_{X}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{X}}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{1}{\lambda_{k}(X_{i}X_{i}^{\top })},\]

where \(\hat{\beta}_{i,j}=\arg\min_{\hat{\beta}}[\|p\|:X_{i}b-y_{i,j}=0]\), \(y_{i,j}=X_{i}\beta+\varepsilon_{j}\), and \(\lambda_{k}(X_{i}X_{i}^{\top})\) is the \(k\)-th eigenvalue of \(X_{i}X_{i}^{\top}\). We can do similarly for the variance part of the prediction risk.

Figure 5 shows an additional experimental result.

## Appendix C Proofs omitted in the main text

Proof of Lemma 3.3.: For a given \(A\in\mathcal{S}\), since \(A^{-1}\in\mathcal{S}\), we have \(Z\stackrel{{ d}}{{=}}A^{-1}Z:=Z\) and

\[\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(Z)]=\mathbb{E}_{A^{-1}Z}[f(Z)]=\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(A\bar{Z})]= \mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(AZ)].\]

This naturally leads to

\[\mathbb{E}_{Z}[\mathbb{E}_{A^{-1}\nu}[f(A^{\prime}Z)]]=\mathbb{E}_{A^{\prime} \sim\nu}[\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(A^{\prime}Z)]]=\mathbb{E}_{A^{\prime}\sim\nu}[ \mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(Z)]]=\mathbb{E}_{Z}[f(Z)]\]

where the first equality comes from Fubini's theorem and the integrability of \(f\). 

Proof of Theorem 3.4.: Since \(\hat{\beta}=X^{\dagger}y\), we have \(\mathrm{Cov}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)=X^{\dagger}\mathrm{Cov}(y\mid X)X^{\dagger \top}=X^{\dagger}\Omega X^{\dagger\top}\), which leads to the following expression for the variance component of prediction risk:

\[\mathrm{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)=\mathrm{Tr}(\mathrm{Cov}(\hat{ \beta}\mid X)\Sigma)=\mathrm{Tr}(X^{\dagger}\Omega X^{\dagger\top}\Sigma)=\| SX^{\dagger}T\|_{F}^{2}=\|BT\|_{F}^{2},\]

where \(S=\Sigma^{1/2},T=\Omega^{1/2}\), and \(B=SX^{\dagger}\). Using the singular value decomposition (SVD) of \(B\) and \(T\), respectively, we can rewrite this as follows:

\[\|BT\|_{F}^{2}=\|UDV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T}V_{T}^{\top}\|_{F}^{2}=\|DV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T }\|_{F}^{2},\]

where \(B=UDV^{\top}\) and \(T=U_{T}D_{T}V_{T}^{\top}\) with orthogonal matrices \(U,V,U_{T}\), \(V_{T}\), and diagonal matrices \(D,D_{T}\). Now we need to compute the alignment \(V^{\top}U_{T}\) of the right-singular vectors of \(B\) with the

Figure 5: We use the same setting as Figure 3, except uniformly sample each \(\rho_{i}\) from \([0,0.05]\) for each experiment with the pairs \((\sigma_{1}^{Z},\sigma_{1}^{2})\). As expected, the off-diagonal elements \(\rho_{i}\) of \(\Omega\) do not affect the expected variances.

left-eigenvectors of \(T\).

\[\|DV^{\top}U_{T}D_{T}\|_{F}^{2} =\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\left(D_{ii}\sum_{k=1}^{n}V_{ik}^{\top}(U_{T})_{kj} (D_{T})_{jj}\right)^{2}\] \[=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}(B)^{2}\lambda_{j}(T)^{2}\gamma_{ij}\] \[=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\lambda_{i}\left((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma \right)\lambda_{j}(\Omega)\gamma_{ij}\] \[=\underbrace{\lambda\left((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma\right)^{ \top}}_{1\alpha\alpha}\underbrace{\Gamma(X)}_{n\alpha\alpha}\underbrace{ \lambda(\Omega)}_{n\times 1},\]

where \(\gamma_{ij}:=\langle V_{:i},(U_{T})_{:j}\rangle^{2}\geq 0\), \(\Gamma(X):=(\gamma_{ij})_{i,j}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\alpha\alpha}\) and \(\lambda(A)\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) is a vector with its element \(\lambda_{i}(A)\) as the \(i\)-th largest eigenvalue of \(A\).

Therefore, we can rewrite the variance as \(\mathrm{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)=a(X)^{\top}\Gamma(X)b\) with

\[a(X) :=\lambda\left((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma\right)\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\] \[b :=\lambda(\Omega)\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\] \[\Gamma(X)_{ij} =\gamma_{ij}=\langle v^{(i)},u^{(j)}\rangle^{2},\]

where \(v^{(i)}:=V_{:i}\) and \(u^{(j)}:=(U_{T})_{:j}\). Note that the alignment matrix \(\Gamma(X)\) is a doubly stochastic matrix since \(\sum_{j}\gamma_{ij}=\sum_{i}\gamma_{ij}=1\) and \(0\leq\gamma_{ij}\leq 1\).

Now, we want to compute the expected variance. To do so, from Lemma 3.3 with \(\mathcal{S}=O(n)\), we can obtain

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[a(X)^{\top}\Gamma(X)b]=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\mathbb{E}_{O\sim \gamma}[a(OX)^{\top}\Gamma(OX)b]\right]=\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[a(X)^{\top} \mathbb{E}_{O\sim\gamma}[\Gamma(OX)]b\right],\]

where \(\nu\) is the unique uniform distribution (the Haar measure) over the orthogonal matrices \(O(n)\). For an orthogonal matrix \(O\in O(n)\), we have

\[\Gamma(OX)_{ij}=\langle Ov^{(i)},u^{(j)}\rangle^{2}=(v^{(j)\top}O^{\top}u^{(j) })^{2},\]

since \(S(OX)^{\dagger}=SX^{\dagger}O^{\top}=BO^{\top}=UD(OV)^{\top}\). Here, \((OX)^{\dagger}=X^{\dagger}O^{\top}\) follows from the orthogonality of \(O\in O(n)\). Since the Haar measure is invariant under the matrix multiplication in \(O(n)\), if we take the expectation over the Haar measure, then we have

\[\tilde{\Gamma}(X)_{ij}:=\mathbb{E}_{O\sim\gamma}[\Gamma(OX)_{ij}]=\mathbb{E}_ {O\sim\gamma}[(v^{(j)\top}O^{\top}u^{(j)})^{2}]=\mathbb{E}_{O\sim\gamma}[(v^{ (j)\top}O^{\top}O^{\top}u^{(j)})^{2}].\]

Here, for a given \(j\), we can choose a matrix \(O^{(j)}\in O(n)\) such that its first column is \(u^{(j)}\) and \(O^{(j)\top}u^{(j)}=e_{1}\), then \(\tilde{\Gamma}(X)_{ij}\) is independent of \(j\) (say \(\tilde{\Gamma}(X)_{ij}=\alpha_{i}\)). Since \(\Gamma(X)\) is doubly stochastic, so is \(\tilde{\Gamma}(X)\) and we have \(\sum_{j=1}^{n}\tilde{\Gamma}(X)_{ij}=n\alpha_{i}=1\) which yields \(\tilde{\Gamma}(X)_{ij}=\alpha_{i}=1/n\), regardless of the distribution of \(V\); thus, \(\tilde{\Gamma}(X)=\frac{1}{n}J\), where \(J_{ij}=1(i,j=1,2,\cdots,n)\).

Therefore, we have the expected variance as follows:

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]=\mathbb{E}_{X}[a(X)^{ \top}\frac{1}{n}Jb]=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}[a_{i}(X)]b_{j}= \frac{1}{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Tr}((X^{\top}X)^{\dagger}\Sigma)]\,\mathrm{ Tr}(\Omega).\]

Proof of Corollary 4.5.: Note that

\[\mathbb{E}_{X}[\mathrm{Var}(\hat{\beta}|X)] =\frac{\mathrm{Tr}(\Omega)}{p}\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\frac{1}{n}\sum_ {i}\frac{1}{\lambda_{i}}\right]\] \[=\frac{\mathrm{Tr}(\Omega)}{p}\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\int\frac{1}{s} dF^{XX^{\top}/p}(s)\right]\] \[=\frac{\mathrm{Tr}(\Omega)}{n}\mathbb{E}_{X}\left[\int\frac{1}{s} dF^{XX^{\top}/n}(s)\right].\]

Then, the desired result follows directly from equation 5.

Proof of equation 4.: The bias term of the prediction risk can be expressed as follows:

\[[\mathrm{Bias}_{\Sigma}(\hat{\beta}\mid X)]^{2} =\|\mathbb{E}[\hat{\beta}\mid X]-\beta\|_{\Sigma}^{2}\] \[=\|(\hat{\Sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{\Sigma}-I\beta)\|_{\Sigma}^{2}\] \[=\beta^{\top}(I-\hat{\Sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{\Sigma})\Sigma(I-\hat {\Sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{\Sigma})\beta\] \[=\beta^{\top}\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}\lambda(\hat{\Sigma}+ \lambda I)^{-1}\Sigma\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}\lambda(\hat{\Sigma}+\lambda I)^{-1}\beta\] \[=(S\beta)^{\top}\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}\lambda^{2}(S^{-1} \hat{\Sigma}S+\lambda I)^{-2}S\beta,\]

where \(\hat{\Sigma}=X^{\top}X/n\). Here, the fourth equality comes from the equation

\[I-\hat{\Sigma}^{\dagger}\hat{\Sigma} =\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}I-(\hat{\Sigma}+\lambda I)^{-1} \hat{\Sigma}\] \[=\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}I-(\hat{\Sigma}+\lambda I)^{-1}( \hat{\Sigma}+\lambda I-\lambda I)\] \[=\lim_{\lambda^{*}\searrow 0}\lambda(\hat{\Sigma}+\lambda I)^{-1}.\]

Proof of equation 7.: The RHS of equation 6 is bounded above by \(\int\frac{1}{1+c_{H}s^{*}}dH(\tau)=\frac{1}{1+c_{H}s^{*}}\), and thus \(1-\frac{1}{\gamma}\leq\frac{1}{1+c_{H}s^{*}}\), which yields \(s^{*}\leq c_{H}^{-1}\frac{1}{\gamma-1}\). We can similarly prove the other inequality in equation 7 with a lower bound \(\frac{1}{1+c_{H}s^{*}}\) on the RHS of equation 6. 

Proof of equation 8.: To further explore the inequalities equation 7, we rewrite equation 6 from Theorem 4.7 as follows:

\[1-\frac{1}{\gamma}=\mathbb{E}_{\tau-H}\left[g(\tau;s^{*})\right],\quad\text{ where }g(t;s):=\frac{1}{1+ts}\text{ for }t,s>0.\]

Here, since \(g(t;s)\) is convex with respect to \(t>0\) for a given \(s>0\), by Jensen's inequality, we then have

\[\mathbb{E}_{\tau-H}[g(\tau;\mu_{H}^{-1}s_{\text{iso}}^{*})]\geq g\left(\mu_{ H};\mu_{H}^{-1}s_{\text{iso}}^{*}\right)=g(1;s_{\text{iso}}^{*})=1-\gamma^{-1}\]

where \(\mu_{H}=\mathbb{E}_{\tau-H}[\tau]\). Therefore, the limit Stieltjes transform \(s^{*}\) in the anisotropic case should be larger than \(\mu_{H}^{-1}s_{\text{iso}}^{*}\) of the isotropic case to satisfy \(\mathbb{E}_{\tau-H}[g(\tau;s^{*})]=1-\gamma^{-1}\) since \(g(t;s)\) is a decreasing function with respect to \(s\geq 0\) when \(t>0\). This leads to a tighter lower bound \(s^{*}\geq\mu_{H}^{-1}s_{\text{iso}}^{*}=\mu_{H}^{-1}(\gamma-1)^{-1}\) than equation 7 because \(\mu_{H}\leq C_{H}\).

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The claims accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See the last paragraph of Introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We explicitly mention the assumptions and provide a complete proof (see Appendix).

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the code (supplementary material) and all the information needed to reproduce the main results (Appendix). Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide the code (supplementary material) and all the information needed to reproduce the main results (Appendix).

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide all the details necessary to understand the results (Appendix). Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: To support our claim, the experiments in the paper do not need error bars. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our models are linear regression models which do not require much resources. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is a theoretical work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is a theoretical work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We used some datasets and properly credited the creators of assets (cf. ACS 2018 [24]). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the code with the details as a supplementary material. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
