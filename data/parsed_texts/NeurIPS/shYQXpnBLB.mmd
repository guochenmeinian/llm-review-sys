###### Abstract

Text-to-Image (T2I) has witnessed significant advancements, demonstrating superior performance for various generative tasks. However, the presence of stereotypes in T2I introduces harmful biases that require urgent attention as the T2I technology becomes more prominent. Previous work for stereotype mitigation mainly concentrated on mitigating stereotypes engendered with individual objects within images, which failed to address stereotypes engendered by the association of multiple objects, referred to as _Association-Engendered Stereotypes_. For example, mentioning "black people" and "houses" separately in prompts may not exhibit stereotypes. Nevertheless, when these two objects are associated in prompts, the association of "black people" with "poorer houses" becomes more pronounced. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel framework, MAS, to Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes. This framework models the stereotype problem as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. The MAS framework primarily consists of the _Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP_ (_PIS CLIP_) and _Sensitive Transformer_. The _PIS CLIP_ learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can establish the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The _Sensitive Transformer_ produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. Moreover, recognizing that existing metrics are insufficient for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel metric, _Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation_ (_SDTV_), to evaluate stereotypes in T2I. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our framework effectively mitigates association-engendered stereotypes.

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-Image (T2I) (Nichol et al. (2021); Rombach et al. (2022); Ramesh et al. (2022); Saharia et al. (2022)), based on the diffusion model, has achieved significant breakthroughs in image generation, showing potential for various downstream tasks such as image creation, editing (Brooks et al. (2023)), etc. In addition, the scale of T2I applications has expanded impressively. For example, the open-source stable diffusion project (Rombach et al. (2022)) has gained the favor of more than \(10\) million users. As of August \(2023\), the number of images created through T2I has surpassed \(15\) billion+.

As images generated by diffusion models become more prevalent, mitigating the stereotypes they engender is increasingly critical (Seshadri et al. (2023); Luccioni et al. (2024)).

The stereotype in social psychology is a mental construct of a particular type of person, object, or thing, often based on observing individuals who fit that type. Previous work explored sensitive attributes (such as gender, race, region, religion, and age) and corresponding stereotypes present in T2I diffusion models (Wang et al. (2023); Esposito et al. (2023); Bianchi et al. (2023)). For instance, when the prompt is _"a photo of a politician"_, the object ( politician) in the image generated by the T2I diffusion model always appears _male_ in the sensitive attribute of gender. Previous works (Shen et al. (2024); Kim et al. (2023); Esposito et al. (2023)) on stereotype mitigation have been limited to a single object, referred to as _Non-Association-Engendered stereotypes_ (e.g., only mitigating the stereotype problem in the occupation or gender dimension), and cannot effectively address stereotypes involving the association of multiple objects, referred to as _Association-Engendered Stereotypes_. For example, as shown in Figure 1, when the prompt is _"a photo of a white people and a house"_ versus _"a photo of a black people and a house"_, T2I diffusion models often generate images where the houses associated with white people appear better than those associated with black people, reflecting an association-engendered stereotype. Therefore, mitigating such association-engendered stereotypes is highly desired for T2I models.

In this paper, our contributions are as follows: \(\blacklozenge\) To the best of our knowledge, we take the first step towards addressing association-engendered stereotypes in T2I models. We define the stereotype problem in the T2I diffusion model as a probability distribution alignment problem, aiming to align the stereotype probability distribution of the generated image with the stereotype-free distribution. \(\blacklozenge\) We present a novel framework \(\blacklozenge\) to mitigate the association-engendered stereotypes, which primarily consists of the _Prompt-Image-Stereotype CLIP_ (_PIS CLIP_) and _Sensitive Transformer_. The _PIS CLIP_ learns the association between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which can construct the mapping of prompts to stereotypes. The _Sensitive Transformer_ produces the sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotyped image distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution. \(\blacklozenge\) Given the insufficiency of existing metrics for accurately evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, we propose a novel metric for evaluating stereotypes in T2I: _Stereotype-Distribution-Total-Variation_ (_SDTV_). \(\blacklozenge\) We conduct a comparative evaluation of our stereotype mitigation approach on five popular T2I diffusion models and six advanced stereotype mitigation approaches in T2I. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our approach in effectively mitigating both non-association-engendered and association-engendered stereotypes.

Figure 1: Original T2I models can generate stereotypes when given prompts involving multiple objects; when the prompts are “_a photo of black/white people_” or “_a photo of a house_”, they do not engender stereotypes. However, if the prompt is “_a photo of black/white people and a house_”, the model may engender stereotypes that the _white people’s_ house is better than the _black people’s_ house. It is noted that previous mitigation approaches have yet to mitigate these association-engendered stereotypes. Our approach, \(\blacklozenge\), demonstrates the capability to effectively mitigate these stereotypes.

**Stereotypes in T2I models.** Although the current image quality and capabilities generated by T2I are gradually approaching maturity, it is worth noting that various biases and stereotypes may still arise from neutral prompt words (Zhou et al. (2024)). Fraser et al. (2023) and Wan and Chang (2024) found that text-generated image models often engender stereotypes of gender, race, and demographics in sociology. These biases can manifest in multiple aspects, such as occupations (Bianchi et al. (2023); Cho et al. (2023); Luccioni et al. (2023)), objects (Mannering (2023)) and adjectives (Luccioni et al. (2023); Naik and Nushi (2023)). Additionally, T2I diffusion models may exhibit gender bias when depicting interactions between two or more people. Based on the above findings, previous researchers proposed stereotype detection frameworks such as Language Agent (Wang et al. (2023)) and T2IAT detection (Wang et al. (2023)). These research results provide practical tools for identifying stereotypes and lay a solid foundation for further mitigating stereotypes.

**Stereotypes mitigation in T2I models.** Existing approaches to mitigate stereotypes in T2I diffusion models have effectively mitigated some of the stereotypes but still have some limitations. Friedrich et al. (2023) randomly introduced additional text clues by identifying known occupations in the prompts to ensure a fair distribution of the generated images. However, this approach may ineffectively address biases related to occupations that are not predefined. Kim et al. (2023) developed a desereotyping loss function and adjusted specific parameters of the soft prompts to balance the sensitive attributes of the generated images but only achieved de-stereotyping in the T2I model containing occupational prompts. Chuang et al. (2023) proposed a technique that involves projecting biased directions in text embeddings and debiasing by utilizing text data with a calibrated projection matrix. Fine-tuning the diffusion model by modifying the capabilities of the pre-trained model has also proven to be an effective strategy. Inspired by Gal et al. (2023); Zhang et al. (2023); Brooks et al. (2023); Dai et al. (2023); Shen et al. (2024) fine-tuned the sampling process of the diffusion model and used an optimized loss function to align the T2I model with fairness principles directly. Moreover, He et al. (2024) utilized an iterative distribution alignment approach to align biased distributions with a unified distribution. Schramowski et al. (2023) built a Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD) capable of suppressing sensitive image portions during diffusion. Previous researchers adjusted the original T2I model and had to consider the image quality and mitigate stereotypes in the original T2I model. They mainly focused on mitigating non-association-engendered stereotypes in the T2I model (such as those engendered by occupation/gender), so it is unable to mitigate the stereotypes generated when multiple objects are associated effectively.

## 3 Our framework: mitigate association-engendered stereotypes (\(\mathtt{MAS}\))

In this section, we construct a mathematical model of stereotypes in T2I. Based on this model, we propose a novel metric, _Stereotype Distribution Total Variation_ (_SDTV_), for evaluating stereotypes. Then, we model the stereotype mitigation problem as a probability distribution alignment problem and build a new stereotype mitigation framework, Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes (\(\mathtt{MAS}\)). Finally, we train _PIS CLIP_ and _Sensitive Transformer_ models to construct sensitive constraints, which guide the stereotype probability distribution to align with the stereotype-free probability distribution.

### Modeling stereotypes in T2I

Inspired by Shen et al. (2024), we denote the object of the image as \(x\) and the object's sensitive attributes as \(s\) (such as _gender, race, and adjective_). We introduce the probability distribution function (PDF) \(P(s=v(s)|x)\) to quantify the likelihood of the image's object exhibiting specific sensitive attributes, where \(v(s)\) represents the value of the sensitive attribute. For instance, when

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline
**Abbreviation** & **Stereotype Categories** & **Prompt** \\ \hline S-O \& S-SA & Single Object with a Single Sensitive Attribute & A photo of [OBJECT]. \\ S-O \& M-SA & Single Object with Multiple Sensitive Attributes & A photo of [SA] [OBJECT]. \\ M-O \& S-SA & Multiple Objects with a Single Sensitive Attribute & A photo of [OBJECT] and [OBJECT]. \\ M-O \& M-SA & Multiple Objects with Multiple Sensitive Attributes & A photo of [OBJECT] and [OBJECT] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Stereotype categories and prompt word templatesthe generated image's object \(x\) is _person_ and \(s\) is _gender_, \(v(s)\) could be _male_ or _female_. The PDF represents the probability of a person appearing as male or female in the sensitive attribute of gender. Furthermore, to distinguish the difference between association-engendered stereotypes and stereotypes explored by previous work (Kim et al. (2023); He et al. (2024); Shen et al. (2024)), we categorize stereotypes into four distinct categories (Table 1) based on the association between objects and sensitive attributes: a single object with a single sensitive attribute (S-O \(\&\) S-SA, non-association-engendered stereotypes), a single object with multiple sensitive attributes (S-O \(\&\) M-SA, non-association-engendered stereotypes), multiple objects with a single sensitive attribute (M-O \(\&\) S-SA, association-engendered stereotypes), multiple objects with multiple sensitive attributes (M-O \(\&\) M-SA, association-engendered stereotypes). Here, we utilize a joint PDF to define categories with multiple objects with multiple sensitive attributes.

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots)=P\big{(}s_{x_{1}}=v(s_{x_{1}}),s_{x_{2}}=v(s_{x_{2}}), \dots|x_{1},x_{2},\dots\big{)},\] (1)

where \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) represent the two objects in the image. For instance, in Figure 1, \(x_{1}\) corresponds to a _people_, and \(x_{2}\) corresponds to a _house_. The variables \(s_{x_{1}}\) and \(s_{x_{2}}\) denote the _race_ and _house's description_. See Appendix A for more PDF definitions of other stereotype categories.

### A new metric to evaluate stereotypes: _Sdstv_

Stereotypes engender when a sensitive attribute in an image consistently presents one or a few states in most instances (Naik and Nushi (2023)). Therefore, Saravanan et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2023) have utilized various metrics to evaluate the stereotype from the perspective of the overall proportion of different subgroups. However, when evaluating association-engendered stereotypes, the proportion of subgroups in the population cannot accurately evaluate association-engendered stereotypes. To address this shortcoming, we propose a new stereotype evaluation metric using total variation distance based on the probability distribution model of stereotypes in T2I.

Consider a T2I model, denoted as \(\mathcal{G}\), which generates an image, and \(x\) is an object of the image. We define a set \(S_{x}\) denotes that object \(x\) contains multiple sensitive attributes such that \(S_{x}=\{\text{gender, race, region,}\dots\}\). We assign the sensitive attributes as \(v(s_{x})^{\text{T}},v(s_{x})^{2},\dots,v(s_{x})^{\mathcal{Y}}\) for each sensitive attribute \(s_{x},\,\forall\,s_{x}\in S_{x}\) (e.g. \(v(s_{x})=\textit{female},v(s_{x})=\textit{black},\dots\)). For an object (i.e., \(x=\)"_doctor_" or \(x=\)"_nurse_"), the stereotype-free T2I model should generate images with equal probability across different sensitive attribute values and should avoid significant probability

Figure 2: Overview of our proposed MAS. (1) In the PIS model pre-training stage, we adjust the traditional CLIP structure from the original “text-image” two-dimensional mapping to a “text-image-text” three-dimensional mapping, thereby obtaining a mapping of prompts to stereotypes. (2) In constructing sensitive constraints, we propose a _Sensitive Transformer_ based on the transformer structure to construct sensitive constraints for each prompt. (3) In the stage of adding sensitive constraints to the T2I, we embed the sensitive constraints into the T2I diffusion model to guide the generation of stereotype-free images.

distribution disparities caused by the dependence of sensitive attributes on the object generating. To evaluate the extent of stereotypes, we calculate the difference in probability distributions for each sensitive attribute value using the Total Variation distance Chung et al. (1989): \(D_{TV}(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x),p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x))\). Therefore, based on the PDF definition of stereotype types in Section 3.1, the _SDTV_ value of model \(\mathcal{G}\) under single-object \(x\) with single-sensitive attribute \(v(s_{x})\) is:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G})=\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\bigg{\{}D_{TV}\bigg{(}p_ {\theta}\big{(}s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x\big{)},p_{\theta}\big{(}s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j} |x\big{)}\bigg{)}\bigg{\}}.\] (2)

In practice, for a given prompt text \(\tau\) in T2I models, the sensitive attribute's probability of the generated images under this prompt \(\tau\) is represented as \(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)\). For instance, consider the sensitive attribute of gender (\(s_{x}=\)"_gender_") when the input prompt \(\tau\) is set to "_a rich person_", the gender-sensitive attributes' probability of the corresponding generated images are considered and set to \(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i})|x,\tau)\) (where \(v(s_{x})^{i}\) represents "_male_") and \(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j})|x,\tau)\) (where \(v(s_{x})^{j}\) represents "_female_") respectively. We could incorporate the prompt and sensitive attribute and obtain the following:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G})=\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\bigg{|}\bigg{(}p_{ \theta}\big{(}s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau\big{)}-p_{\theta}\big{(}s_{x}=v(s_{x}) ^{j}|x,\tau\big{)}\bigg{)}\bigg{|},\] (3)

where \(\theta\) is the parameter of model \(\mathcal{G}\). Given an input prompt \(\tau\), \(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)\), and \(p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x,\tau)\) represent the probabilities that the sensitive attribute appears as \(v(s_{x})^{i}\) and \(v(s_{x})^{j}\) in the output, where \(\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}\) and \(i\neq j\). If the value of \(SDTV(\mathcal{G})\) is considerable, it suggests that the image exhibits very severe stereotypes. Conversely, suppose its value is close to 0. In that case, it implies that, under the given prompt conditions, the sensitive attributes displayed in the generated image are relatively evenly distributed, indicating no apparent stereotypes in this sensitive attribute dimension. When calculating the _SDTV_ of association-engendered stereotypes, we deal with multiple objects and sensitive attributes simultaneously, so we need to adjust Equation (3). Let's define a set of objects \(X=\{X_{h},X^{\prime}_{h}\}\), where \(X_{h}\) and \(X^{\prime}_{h}\) represent the sets of human and non-human objects, respectively. For a human object \(x_{h}\in X_{h}\) with sensitive attributes \(S_{h}\), and a non-human object \(x^{\prime}_{h}\in X^{\prime}_{h}\) with descriptions \(S^{\prime}_{h}\), we can adjust Equation (3) accordingly to obtain:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G})=\mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{\begin{subarray}{c}s_{h}\in S_{h}\\ s_{h}\in S^{\prime}_{h}\end{subarray}}\left(\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{ Y}}\bigg{|}p_{\theta}(s_{h}=v(s_{h})^{i}|s^{\prime}_{h}=v(s^{\prime}_{h})^{m}, \tau)-p_{\theta}(s_{h}=v(s_{h})^{j}|s^{\prime}_{h}=v(s^{\prime}_{h})^{m},\tau )\bigg{|}\right),\] (4)

The sensitive attribute \(s_{h}\) and describe \(s^{\prime}_{h}\) have \(\mathcal{Y}\) and \(\mathcal{Z}\) corresponding values, respectively. See Appendix B for the detailed proof process of the _SDTV_.

### Mitigating association-engendered stereotypes

Our framework aims to alter the stereotype probability distribution in T2I to align it with a stereotype-free probability distribution. As shown in Figure 2, we construct MAS to implement this alignment process, which consists of two main network structures, _PIS CLIP_ and _Sensitive Transformer_. _PIS CLIP_ learns prompts, images, and stereotypes in T2I and constructs mapping of prompts to stereotypes; _Sensitive Transformer_ builds sensitive constraints based on prompts and mapping of prompts to stereotypes. Finally, we embed sensitive constraints into the T2I model by utilizing the _Sensitive Transformer_, which guides the probability distribution associated with stereotypes toward alignment with the stereotype-free distribution.

**Algorithm 1** Prompt-Image-Sterotype CLIP Algorithmprompts, images, and stereotype descriptions. Inspired by CLIP (Radford et al. (2021)), we construct a novel three-dimensional mapping approach to learn the features and relationships of prompt-image stereotypes. We use a T2I-generated image, which contains a stereotype, as a bridge to create three pairs: <prompt, image>, <image, stereotype>, and <prompt, stereotype> for training. _PIS CLIP_ learns the potential mapping relationship between the prompt and the stereotype by maximizing the cosine similarity of these three pairs. We optimize a symmetric cross-entropy loss based on these similarity scores. Algorithm 1 presents the process of the _PIS CLIP_ (See Appendix C.1 for more detailed experimental settings).

_Sensitive Transformer._ In _PIS CLIP_, we learn and establish a mapping of prompts to stereotypes. Then, based on this learned mapping, we can create sensitive constraints for prompts. When given a prompt, we aim to provide specific sensitive constraints tailored to that prompt. To achieve this, we approach this as a query problem: the aim is to construct the value (V: sensitive constraints) by matching a query (Q: prompts) with keys (K: the mapping of prompts to stereotypes). We implement this task based on the transformer architecture (Vaswani et al. (2017)).

\[\mathrm{Sensitive\ Matrix(V)=softmax(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})V.}\] (5)

In Equation (5), the input consists of queries and keys of dimension \(d_{k}\). We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by \(\sqrt{d_{k}}\), and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.

**Sensitive Constraints Guide Distribution Alignment.** Consider a T2I diffusion model \(\mathcal{G}\), which generates images \(x\) with a sensitive attribute \(s\). The attribute \(s\) can have \(\mathcal{Y}\) different categories and needs to align with a target distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) that is free of stereotypes. We use a prompt to generate a batch of images, denoted as \(\mathcal{I}=\{x_{i}^{v(s)}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\). For the PDF of the sensitive attribute of image \(x\), \(h(x^{v(s)^{i}})\), let \(h(x^{v(s)^{i}})=p_{x}^{v(s)^{i}}=[p_{x}^{v(s)^{1}},p_{x}^{v(s)^{2}},\cdots,p_{ x}^{v(s)^{\mathcal{Y}}}],i\in|\mathcal{Y}|\), where \(p_{x}^{v(s)}\) represents the estimated probability of generating images with stereotypes using model \(\mathcal{G}\). Assume another set of images, \(\tilde{\mathcal{I}}=\{x_{i}^{u(s)}\}_{i\in\mathbb{N}}\), generated with the same prompt P but without stereotypes. The probability distribution of its sensitive attribute is \(h(x^{u(s)^{i}})=p_{x}^{u_{i}(s)^{i}}=[p_{x}^{u(s)^{1}},p_{x}^{u(s)^{2}},\cdots, p_{x}^{u(s)^{\mathcal{Y}}}],i\in|\mathcal{Y}|\), and the corresponding probability distribution without stereotypes is denoted as \(p_{x}^{u(s)}\). We compute the distribution distance between \(p_{x}^{v(s)}\) and \(p_{x}^{u(s)}\).

\[\sigma^{*}=\underset{\sigma\subseteq S_{\mathcal{Y}}}{\mathrm{arg\,min}}\ \sup|\sigma(p_{x}^{v(s)})-p_{x}^{u(s)}|,\] (6)

where \(S_{\mathcal{Y}}\) is the constraint space, \(S_{\mathcal{Y}}=\{V(s_{1}),V(s_{2}),\ldots,V(s_{n})\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\), \(V(s)=[v(s)^{1},v(s)^{2},\ldots,\)\(v(s)^{\mathcal{Y}}]\), and \(\sigma\) is a set of constraints within this space. The optimal constraint for minimizing the distance between two probability distributions in the constraint space is \(\sigma^{*}\). The \(\sigma\) contains all possible sensitive attributes \(S=\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\) and their value corresponding to the prompts. When a sensitive constraint \(\sigma\) is added to the input of the T2I diffusion model, it is combined with the original prompt embedding to form a new input for the T2I sampling process. Since the new input includes the sensitive constraint information, it guides the T2I process to produce a new output \(\sigma(p_{x}^{v_{i}(s)})=[p_{x}^{v(s)^{1}_{\sigma}},p_{x}^{v(s)^{2}_{\sigma}}, \cdots,p_{x}^{v(s)^{\mathcal{Y}}_{\sigma}}]\). \(\sigma(p_{x}^{v_{i}(s)})\) is a distribution that closely approximates the stereotype-free distribution \(p_{x}^{u(s)}\).

## 4 Experiment

We conduct experiments on popular T2I diffusion pipelines to evaluate the generalizability of our approach across various T2I diffusion pipelines, which include \(\blacklozenge\)_runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5_(SD-1.5) (Rombach et al. (2022)), \(\blacklozenge\)_stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0_ (SDXL) (Meng et al. (2021)), \(\blacklozenge\)_ByteDance/SDXL-Lightning_ (Lightning) (Lin et al. (2024)), \(\blacklozenge\)_stabilityai/sdd-turbo_ (Turbo) (Sauer et al. (2023)), and \(\blacklozenge\)_stabilityai/stable-cascade_ (Cascade) (Permis et al. (2024)). All these models are openly accessible from Hugging Face*. As mentioned above, we apply our stereotype mitigation approach to the five mainstream T2I diffusion pipelines. We use the optimal sampler and keep the same hyperparameters setting to generate images for all T2I diffusion pipelines (See Appendix C.2 for detail experiment setting). We create ten prompts for each of the four categoriesof stereotypes discussed in Section 3.1, generate \(100\) images per prompt, and calculate attribute probability distributions by utilizing \(100\times 10=1000\) images. In addition, for comparison, we test each pipeline using two sets of data, one from the original pipeline and the other from the pipeline with MAS. We utilize the _SDTV_ value to evaluate the severity of stereotypes in T2I models. For four types of stereotypes, we apply the corresponding _SDTV_ to evaluate the severity of each type (See Appendix B for detailed calculation methods for the _SDTV_s corresponding to different types of stereotypes).

### Mitigation effects

**Evaluation of stereotype mitigation effectiveness across different T2I diffusion models.** Table 2 reports the performance of our stereotype mitigation approach. Our approach effectively mitigates the association-engendered stereotypes in T2I and maintains excellent performance in mitigating the non-association-engendered stereotypes. Besides, Table 2 shows that the latest T2I models (Lightning, Turbo, and Cascade) display more pronounced stereotypes than their predecessors, SD-1.5 and SD XL. Nevertheless, our approach performs robust generalizability, demonstrating superior performance in mitigating stereotypes across various scenarios, including traditional and the latest T2I models involving non-association-engendered/association-engendered stereotypes (Figure 3).

**Comparative evaluation with different stereotype mitigation approaches.** To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a comparative analysis with state-of-the-art methods. Table 3 shows that our approach outperforms six other solutions, demonstrating fewer stereotypes for all eight single-object and multi-object scenarios. Our approach offers a distinct advantage compared to the prompt fine-tuning approach. We directly learn the relationship between prompts, images, and stereotypes, which enables us to construct more targeted constraints for the stereotypes in T2I rather than relying on broadly sensitive attributes as supplements. As a result, our approach can maintain an effective mitigation strategy even when faced with more complex and concealed stereotypes. Compared to the model fine-tuning approach (Shen et al. [2024]), our approach only requires integration within the T2I workflow to perform mitigation, eliminating the need to retrain the original T2I model. During the training stage, the fine-tuning mitigation approach must ensure that it cannot affect

the original T2I diffusion model's alignment of text to image. Therefore, not all resources can be utilized to learn stereotypes, significantly limiting the learning of more types of stereotypes. However, our model can fully use computing resources to learn more types of stereotypes. This enables our approach to demonstrate a practical mitigation effect in covert stereotype scenarios involving multiple objects.

### Generalization

**Semantics preservation experiment.** The primary fundamental of T2I is to ensure that the generated image is consistent with the provided prompt. To achieve this, we conduct semantics preservation (S.P.) (Pezone et al. (2024); Radford et al. (2021)) experiments where we encode prompt, text, and images using CLIP's (_Vit-L1/4_) text-image encoder. In Table 4, we report (1) CLIP-T2I: the CLIP score between generated images and prompts; (2) CLIP-I2I: the similarity between stereotypes-mitigated T2I and original T2I-generated images for the same prompts and hyperparameters. The stereotype-mitigated T2I diffusion model can remain consistent with the original T2I diffusion model in semantics preservation.

**Generalization to non-template prompts.** We summarize more than \(300\) relevant template prompt words from the work of Chuang et al. (2023) and Li et al. (2024), listed in Appendix D, which contains prompt words related to occupation, adjectives, region, race, gender, etc. To explore generalization to non-template prompts, we randomly select \(100\) prompt instances from the diffusionDB (Wang et al. (2022)) dataset--data that might inadvertently perpetuate stereotypes. Table 5 shows the evaluation results and demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach in mitigating stereotypes. Although we only implement stereotype mitigation for template prompts, the stereotype-mitigation effect also generalizes to more complex non-templated prompts. We list some images generated with non-template prompts in Appendix F.

**Impact on T2I diffusion models.** Since our approach integrates a _Sensitive Transformer_ model into the original T2I workflow, it could introduce additional overhead to the T2I model or impact the quality of the generated images. To evaluate these potential effects, we conduct a series of experiments focusing on the quality of image generation and the efficiency of the generation process. We set four different batch sizes (\(10,20,50,100\)) for the five different T2I diffusion models. We evaluate the impact of using MAS on the quality and efficiency of generated images of original T2I by measuring the Frechet Inception Distance (FID) (Heusel et al. (2017)) value of generated images and the time taken to generate images in different batch sizes. Table 6 demonstrates the evaluation results. Our mitigation approach maintains comparable image quality and generation efficiency to the original T2I diffusion models. Compared to other approaches, although our solution adds sensitive constraints to the original T2I diffusion model, it only introduces low additional overhead.

**Stereotype mitigation experiments in more T2I scenarios.** This section aims to evaluate the effectiveness of MAS in mitigating stereotypes in more complex T2I scenarios. In practical T2I generation processes, it is necessary to incorporate models such as LoRA and ControlNet to control the image's style and structure. Consequently, our mitigation approach must be capable of reducing stereotypes in multi-model collaboration T2I scenarios. We conduct stereotype mitigation experiments by combining several mainstream models, including the diffusion-based retraining model Realistic+ (R-SD), LoRA models, and ControlNet models (Con). Table 7 demonstrates that our stereotype mitigation approach maintains outstanding performance even in T2I generation scenarios involving multiple model combinations. See Appendix G.1 and Appendix G.2 for detailed descriptions of the experiment and examples of images.

Conclusion

In this paper, we took the first step toward mitigating association-engendered stereotypes in Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models. We innovatively modeled stereotypes as a probability distribution alignment problem and constructed a probability distribution model for both non-association-engendered and association-engendered stereotypes. Then, we proposed the Mitigate Association-engendered Stereotypes (MAS) framework for the first time. MAS learned the mapping of prompts, images, and stereotypes and constructed sensitive constraints to guide the T2I diffusion model in generating stereotype-free images by embedding these sensitive constraints into the T2I diffusion process. Additionally, we proposed a novel metric to evaluate stereotypes, _Stereotype Distribution Total Variation_ (_SDTV_). Finally, comprehensive experiments demonstrated that we contribute an effective mitigation approach for association-engendered stereotypes in T2I, establishing a more ethical and reliable foundation for future text-to-image generation development.

## 6 Limitations

This research effectively mitigated both non-association-engendered and association-engendered stereotypes. While it successfully addressed the identified stereotypes, exploring other subtle stereotypes will be an interesting direction for future research. To our knowledge, modeling the problem as aligning existing distributions with target distributions holds significant potential for further extension into research areas such as debiasing and detoxification in large models. Investigating these avenues could provide deeper insights and more comprehensive solutions to ethical issues in generative models.

### Probabilistic model of four types of stereotypes

In our research, we define stereotype as the representation that links objects to sensitive attributes. Specifically, for generated images, we denote the object as \(x\), the subject's sensitive attribute as \(S_{x}\), and the attribute value of s as \(v(s_{x})\). Based on this foundation, we introduce the PDF \(P(s_{x}=v(s_{x}))\) to describe the likelihood of an image subject displaying specific sensitive attributes. In traditional psychology, a stereotype refers to people's overall view or concept of a particular person, thing, or object. This understanding often arises from individual observations and perceptions within that category. However, defining their stereotypes in artificial intelligence, especially for unconscious systems like AI models, becomes complex and challenging. The lack of clear definitions poses a significant challenge for our study. Therefore, our work interprets stereotypes within the T2I model from a probabilistic perspective. By carefully examining different stereotypes, we categorize them into four distinct types:

* Single Object with a Single Sensitive Attribute
* Single Object with Multiple Sensitive Attributes
* Multiple Objects with a Single Sensitive Attribute
* Multiple Objects with Multiple Sensitive Attributes

We utilize random conditional probability distributions for single object with single sensitive attribute to describe their behavior.

\[f(x)=P(s_{x}=v(s_{x})|x).\] (7)

The formula 7 represents the probability density distribution of the attribute value \(v(s_{x})\) of the object \(x\) concerning the sensitive attribute \(s_{x}\). For instance, consider the prompt phrase "_a photo of a nurse_". In this case, the object depicted in the image is a nurse. If we pay attention to the sensitive attribute of gender, the object in the picture always displays "_female_" gender-sensitive attribute values (\(v(s_{x})\)).

We utilize multiple dimension-sensitive attributes of a single object by using probability distributions under various conditional constraints:

\[f(x)=P(s_{x}^{1}=v(s_{x}^{1}),s_{x}^{2}=v(s_{x}^{2}),\dots|x).\] (8)

i.e. still taking the prompt as "_a photo of a nurse_" as an example, but this time, in formula 8, we focus on sensitive attributes such as "\(s_{x}^{1}=\textit{gender}\)", "\(s_{x}^{2}=\textit{race}\)", then the image always shows "\(v(s_{x}^{1})=\textit{female}\)", " \(v(s_{x}^{2})=\textit{white race}\)" sensitive attribute value.

For generated images of multiple objects \((x_{1},x_{2})\), we use a joint probability density distribution to describe the stereotypes of multiple objects.

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots)=P\big{(}s=v(s)|x_{1},x_{2},\dots\big{)}.\] (9)

The formula 9 describes how multiple objects within the image collectively exhibit the same sensitive attributes. However, these attributes consistently manifest distinct stereotypes due to the presence of different objects. For instance, consider the prompt "_a photo of a doctor and a nurse._" When the object is a "\(x_{1}=\textit{doctor}\)," it invariably appears as "\(v(s)=\textit{male}\)". Conversely, when the object is a "\(x_{2}=\textit{nurse}\)", it consistently portrays a "\(v(s)=\textit{female}\)", thus reflecting gender stereotypes.

Likewise, we utilize the joint probability density function:

\[f(x_{1},x_{2},\dots)=P\big{(}s_{x_{1}}=v(s_{x_{1}}),s_{x_{2}}=v(s_{x_{2}})|x_ {1},x_{2},\dots\big{)}.\] (10)

The formula 10 represents the stereotype probability distribution across multiple objects and multiple sensitive attributes. i.e., when the prompt is "_a photo of a black man/white man and his house_", a common stereotype emerges: the "_white man's_" house tends to be portrayed as more **better** than the "_black man's_" house. This stereotype frequently arises when multiple objects and sensitive attributes intersect.

### Illustrations of four stereotypes

## Appendix B _Sdtv_ Main Proof.

### _Sdtv_'s inference and proof process

In section 3.2, we have explained the variables in the _SDTV_ formula. The single-object with single-sensitive attribute proof process is as follows:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G}) =\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\left\{D_{TV}\bigg{(}p_{\theta} (s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x),p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x)\bigg{)}\right\}\] \[=\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\left\{D_{TV}\bigg{(}\int p_{ \theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)d\tau-\int p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x, \tau)d\tau\bigg{)}\right\}\] \[=\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\left\{D_{TV}\bigg{(}\mathbb{ E}_{p(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|\tau)}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)-\mathbb{E}_{p(s_{x} =v(s_{x})^{j}|\tau)}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x,\tau)\bigg{)}\right\}\] \[=\max_{\{i,j\}\subseteq\mathcal{Y}}\left|\bigg{(}p_{\theta}(\tau ^{v(s_{x})^{i}}|x)-p_{\theta}(x|\tau^{v(s_{x})^{j}}|x)\bigg{)}\right|\]

Based on the above proof, we consider a sensitive attribute set \(S_{x}=\{\text{gender, race, region,...}\}\), which contains different attributes. We evaluate the extent of single-object with multi-sensiti

Figure 4: Description of the four stereotypes. Previous works have effectively mitigated non-association-engendered stereotypes but cannot mitigate association-engendered stereotypes effectively.

attribute stereotypes by calculating the average _SDTV_ values of all attributes.

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G}) =\mathbb{E}_{|S_{x}|}\bigg{\{}\sum_{s_{x}\in S_{x}}\max_{\{i,j\}\leq \mathcal{Y}}\bigg{[}D_{TV}\bigg{(}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau),p_{ \theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x,\tau)\bigg{)}\bigg{]}\bigg{\}}\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{|S_{x}|}\bigg{\{}\sum_{s_{x}\in S_{x}}\max_{\{i,j\} \leq\mathcal{Y}}\bigg{|}\bigg{(}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)-p_{ \theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{j}|x,\tau)\bigg{)}\bigg{|}\bigg{\}}\]

Similarly, we expand the object set \(X=\{x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\), where the set \(X\) contains multiple different objects, and calculate the average _SDTV_ of all objects to evaluate the multi-objects with single-sensitive attribute stereotype extent of the image:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G}) =\mathbb{E}_{|X|}\bigg{\{}\sum_{x}^{X}\max_{\{i,j\}\leq\mathcal{Y }}\bigg{[}D_{TV}\bigg{(}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x),p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_ {x})^{j}|x)\bigg{)}\bigg{]}\bigg{\}}\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{|X|}\bigg{\{}\sum_{x}^{X}\max_{\{i,j\}\leq\mathcal{Y }}\bigg{|}\bigg{(}p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{x})^{i}|x,\tau)-p_{\theta}(s_{x}=v(s_{ x})^{j}|x,\tau)\bigg{)}\bigg{|}\bigg{\}}\]

Based on the above process, we simultaneously expand the object and attribute dimensions. Let's define a set of objects \(X=\{X_{h},X_{h}^{\prime}\}\), where \(X_{h}\) and \(X_{h}^{\prime}\) represent the sets of human and non-human objects, respectively. For a human object \(x_{h}\in X_{h}\) with sensitive attributes \(S_{h}\), and a non-human object \(x_{h}^{\prime}\in X_{h}^{\prime}\) with descriptions \(S_{h}^{\prime}\), we can adjust Equation (3) accordingly to obtain:

\[SDTV(\mathcal{G})=\mathbb{E}_{\begin{subarray}{c}s_{h}\in S_{h}\\ s_{h}^{\prime}\in S_{h}^{\prime}\end{subarray}}\bigg{(}\max_{\{i,j\}\leq \mathcal{Y}}\bigg{|}p_{\theta}(s_{h}=v(s_{h})^{i}|s_{h}^{\prime}=v(s_{h}^{ \prime})^{m},\tau)-p_{\theta}(s_{h}=v(s_{h})^{j}|s_{h}^{\prime}=v(s_{h}^{ \prime})^{m},\tau)\bigg{|}\bigg{)}\,,\]

### Why is it the maximum and not the average?

We compute the distances between the two distributions using the total variation distance (\(D_{TV}\)). The evaluation typically utilizes the average in the study by Dwork et al. (2012) and Yang et al. (2022). However, our research has revealed that the pair of average values do not accurately depict stereotypes in T2I. Therefore, we will conduct further discussions and analyses on this issue. Ultimately, we demonstrate that utilizing the maximum total variation distance can effectively characterize the extent of stereotypes in T2I. Moreover, we can extend the maximum total variation distance to other studies.

As depicted in Figure 5, two scenarios exist for the distribution values of sensitive attributes in T2I. In one scenario, the \(D_{TV}\) value is high only for specific sensitive attribute values, while it remains consistently low for other attributes. The diagram in Figure 5(a) shows that if we use the average \(D_{TV}\) value to represent model \(\mathcal{G}\) under the sensitive attribute \(S\), it will significantly reduce the extent of stereotype in model \(\mathcal{G}\). Conversely, using the maximum value can accurately describe the extent of stereotype in model \(\mathcal{G}\) under attribute \(S\).

**Example.** We analyze how model \(\mathcal{G}\) stereotypes are based on the attribute of race (\(s=\)_race_). The potential values for the sensitive attribute \(s\) are \(v(s)=\{\)_white, black, yellow, brown,..._\(\}\). Consider the scenario illustrated in Figure 5(a), where the \(D_{TV}\) value for the white and brown categories is assumed to be the highest at \(0.9\). In contrast, it falls between \(0.2\) and \(0.4\) for other racial categories.

Figure 5: Comparing maximum and average \(D_{TV}\) values to evaluate stereotypes in extreme and common T2I scenarios.

When we calculate the average, the _SDTV_ value of model \(\mathcal{G}\) is roughly \(0.3\). Model \(\mathcal{G}\) has significantly reduced its extent of stereotypes in the attribute dimension of race by almost **three times**. However, the _SDTV_ value, calculated using the maximum value, is \(0.9\). This value indicates that the model still has a clear preference for one of the sensitive attribute values related to the sensitive attribute of race, thereby displaying severe stereotypes.

Another situation is that the high \(D_{TV}\) of some sensitive attribute values maintains a relatively balanced state. As shown in Figure 5(b), at this time, using the mean _SDTV_ value to describe the stereotype extent of model \(\mathcal{G}\) will still lower the extent of sensitive attributes of the model, and at this time, _SDTV_ will remain at a low level. Thus, we mistakenly believe that model \(\mathcal{G}\) does not exhibit stereotypes.

**Example.** We analyze how model \(\mathcal{G}\) stereotypes are based on the attribute of race (\(s=\)_race_). Among them, the possible values of the sensitive attribute \(s\) are \(v(s)=\{\)_white, black, yellow, brown,_,..._\(\}\). We consider a balanced case, as shown in Figure 5(b), to calculate several races. When looking at the \(D_{TV}\), it can be seen that the high \(D_{TV}\) value of model \(\mathcal{G}\) remains in the range of \(0.5-0.6\), while other \(D_{TV}\) are around \(0.2\). When using the average, the _SDTV_ value of model \(\mathcal{G}\) equals approximately \(0.3\). The model does not show a very obvious stereotype. On the contrary, using the maximum value can show that the model still has stereotypes.

Some other thoughts from the perspective of mitigation: when we use the maximum value \(D_{TV}\) as a description, at the exact moment, we only need to pay attention to the attribute value corresponding to the most severe stereotype under the current _SDTV_ performance. At this time, when facing the extreme situation in Figure 5(a), we focus on mitigating the stereotype under this attribute value, which can significantly alleviate the T2I model stereotype; when facing the situation in Figure 5(b), When we mitigate the maximum \(D_{TV}\), the _SDTV_ will still show the maximum \(D_{TV}\) among the remaining attribute values, and then continue to mitigate the maximum to achieve the step-by-step mitigation of stereotypes in the T2I model. On the contrary, when we use mean _SDTV_ as a description, we will disperse the focus of mitigation to all possible attribute values, and the effect of dispersed mitigation will not be able to solve the stereotype problem effectively.

Experiment Setting

### Training the _Pis CLIP_ and the _Sensitive Transformer_

**Dataset.** Our training data sources are mainly divided into three channels: (1) The first channel comes from the collected objects and sensitive attributes. We embed objects and sensitive attributes into the prompt word template as the prompts input of the T2I diffusion model and generate \(100\) batches images for each prompt. (2) The second channel comes from existing datasets, including COCO (Lin et al. (2014)), FairFace (Karkkainen and Joo (2021)), and LAION-5B (Schuhmann et al. (2022)), and extracts the stereotype images in these datasets. (3) The third channel comes from the prompt datasets. We extract prompts with sensitive attributes and objects from the existing prompt datasets. Then, we use the five popular T2I diffusion models (SD-1.5, SD XL, Lightning, Turbo, and Cascade) to generate images for each prompt. The composition of image data is as follows:

**Train setting.** We train _PIS CLIP_ for 15K iterations, using the Adam optimizer with learning rate 5e-5 based on CLIP's pre-training model _ViT-L14_. The _PIS CLIP_ training takes around 120 hours on 4 NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs.

Additionally, Tables 2\(\sim\)7 illustrate that the greater the stability of the T2I diffusion model, the smaller the error bounds. All evaluation experiments are performed on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU.

In this experiment, we utilize three models. Realistic, a retrained stable diffusion model known for its realistic style, has been downloaded over 1 million times on Civitai3. We use the LoRA model _Add More Details4_ to enhance the details in the images generated by Realistic. Additionally, we utilize the ControlNet model to adjust the image structure. In the evaluation stage, we calculate the _SDTV_ values in different T2I scenarios with multi-model combinations using the same experiment settings and evaluation methods as Appendix C.2.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our abstract and introduction accurately reflect the contributions and scope of the paper. In Sections 3 and 4, we provide detailed theoretical explanations and comprehensive experimental validation of the contributions proposed in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations of the paper in section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide detailed and sufficient reference sources and proof processes for the mathematical models constructed in the paper in Appendix A and B. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide detailed information for all experiments in the paper to support the reproducibility of the results. In Appendix C, D, E and G, we report comprehensive experimental parameters, datasets, computational resources, prompts, and other relevant information. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the core code of the experiments and access links to the relevant datasets in the supplementary materials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide detailed information for all experiments in the paper to support the reproducibility of the results. In Appendix C, D, E and G, we report comprehensive experimental parameters, datasets, computational resources, prompts, and other relevant information. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the paper, we provide the error bounds for all experimental results and report the calculation methods for these results in Appendix D. In Tables 2 \(\sim\) 7, ".XX/.XX" represents the actual calculated mean, and "\(\pm\).XX/\(\pm\).XX" denotes the error bounds. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix C, we report the computational resources used for the experiments. The model training experiment is conducted on four NVIDIA A100-80GB GPUs, and all evaluation experiments are conducted on a single NVIDIA A100-80GB GPU. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All research in this paper complies with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in every aspect. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes]Justification: In this paper, we discuss the potential societal impacts of our work. Our research effectively mitigates association-engendered stereotypes in T2I, thereby reducing the generation of biased content by generative AI. This provides a strong assurance for the safe development of generative AI. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: To reduce the potential risks of T2I diffusion models generating unsafe images, we report the models, parameter settings, prompts, and other relevant configurations used in our experiments in Appendix C, D, E, F and G. These configurations help ensure the generation of safe images and reduce the risk of producing unsafe content. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All data, models, and baselines used in this paper are open source. We provide citations or footnotes for all sources throughout the paper.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the open-source code in the supplemental material. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
