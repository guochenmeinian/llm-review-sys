###### Abstract

Recent work in interpretability shows that large language models (LLMs) can be adapted for new tasks in a learning-free way: it is possible to intervene on LLM representations to elicit desired behaviors for alignment. For instance, adding certain bias vectors to the outputs of certain attention heads is reported to boost the truthfulness of models. In this work, we show that localized fine-tuning serves as an effective alternative to such representation intervention methods. We introduce a framework called **L**ocalized **F**ine-**T**uning on LLM Representations (LoFiT), which identifies a subset of attention heads that are most important for learning a specific task, then trains offset vectors to add to the model's hidden representations at those selected heads. LoFiT localizes to a sparse set of heads (\(3\%-10\%\)) and learns the offset vectors from limited training data, comparable to the settings used for representation intervention. For truthfulness and reasoning tasks, we find that LoFiT's intervention vectors are more effective for LLM adaptation than vectors from representation intervention methods such as Inference-time Intervention. We also find that the localization step is important: selecting a task-specific set of attention heads can lead to higher performance than intervening on heads selected for a different task. Finally, across 7 tasks we study, LoFiT achieves comparable performance to other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA, despite modifying 20x-200x fewer parameters than these methods.1

## 1 Introduction

A significant body of work has studied how to localize model behavior within pre-trained Transformer language models [7, 32, 30, 23, 45]. One practical benefit of this localization is that we can use lightweight interventions on the localized modules to modify that behavior, such as to change entity knowledge [30], steer the style of generated text [47, 43], correct a model's reasoning [12, 38], or improve factuality [21, 60]. These approaches are unified in recent work on _representation intervention_[60, 54], which adds offset vectors into various layer representations of a model to achieve desired behaviors. Computing these vectors from model activations is reported to require less data and compute than fine-tuning approaches [21].

At the same time, a distinct line of work has established the effectiveness of _parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)_ methods [16, 2, 13, 22] by updating only parts of the pre-trained weights. Very recently, new PEFT methods have been proposed to change models' representations ratherthan weights [52, 54], in line with the motivation of representation intervention. However, these methods are typically applied to a network uniformly or treat the choice of modules to fine-tune as a hyperparameter; they do not use any explicit interpretation or localization step.

In this work, we investigate whether the idea of localization from representation intervention can be useful for fine-tuning LLMs. At the same time, we study whether representation offsets can be more effectively obtained via learning than via representation intervention methods. We propose **L**ocalized **F**ine-**T**uning on LLM Representations (LoFiT; Figure 1). LoFiT first selects a subset of attention heads to modify for the target task. We compare several methods for this step, but find that it is most effective to fine-tune scaling factors on the model's attention head outputs and select the heads with the largest norm of learned scaling weights. Then, we perform a localized fine-tuning step to learn offset vectors added to these heads' representations, which gives our final model.

We compare LoFiT with representation intervention methods on truthfulness and reasoning tasks. We show that LoFiT is substantially more effective than Inference-Time Intervention [21, ITI], even when using heads selected via the ITI localization strategy. Our approach requires learning to fine-tune our offset vectors, but is still effective even on modest amounts of labeled data that methods like ITI and Representation Engineering [60, RepE] used to compute representation offsets.

We conduct analysis of which heads are selected and find that localization is important for LoFiT. Even across related tasks about surfacing knowledge from Transformers (e.g., improving truthfulness in TruthfulQA [24] and processing counterfactual knowledge in MQuAKE [58]), using the set of heads specialized to a particular task improves the final fine-tuning step. Across models at different scales, including Gemma-7B, Llama 2-7B, and Llama 2-13B, localization identifies different subsets of heads, and these subsets of heads are not interchangeable without performance degradation.

Finally, we compare LoFiT against existing PEFT methods, specifically LoRA [16], RED [52], and ReFT [54]. LoFiT is on par with these across settings for different LLMs, despite using 20x-200x fewer learned parameters. LoFiT also demonstrates better generalizability to out-of-domain settings.

The main contributions of this work are the following: (1) We introduce LoFiT, a localized fine-tuning method that achieves competitive downstream performance on truthfulness and reasoning tasks by modifying the representations of a small number of attention heads. (2) We show the benefits of localization to particular sets of heads across tasks and across models, suggesting that interpretability methods can be combined with the effectiveness of PEFT for strong performance.

Figure 1: LoFiT methodology. LoFiT freezes all pre-trained weights of a transformer language model and uses two sets of lightweight parameters to modify the LLM representations in two steps: Attention Head Selection and Bias Tuning. Only the tuned biases are used in the final model.

Background: Localized Representation Intervention

Preliminaries: Transformer ArchitectureWe begin by setting up necessary notation of the Transformer architecture, following [48; 9]. Consider a decoder-only Transformer model of \(L\) layers and a hidden size of \(d\). For simplicity, we ignore any form of layer normalization in the notation.

At time step \(t\), a Transformer block of layer \(l\in[1,L]\) takes as input the hidden vectors of all previous time steps \(h^{l}_{\leq t}\) (where \(h^{l}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\)) and outputs a hidden representation \(h^{l+1}_{t}\) for the next layer \(l+1\):

\[h^{l+1}_{t}=h^{l}_{t}+\mathrm{MultiHead}(h^{l}_{\leq t})+\mathrm{MLP}(h^{l}_{t }+\mathrm{MultiHead}(h^{l}_{\leq t}))\] (1)

\(\mathrm{MultiHead}\) represents the multi-head attention outputs with \(H\) attention heads of head dimension \(d_{head}\) after a linear projection \(W^{O}\) into the residual stream:

\[\mathrm{MultiHead}(h^{l}_{\leq t})=\mathrm{concat}(z^{(l,1)}_{t},...,z^{(l,i) }_{t})W^{O}\] (2)

Here, \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{head}}}\) for \(i\in[1,H]\) represents the activations output by the \(i\)th attention head at layer \(l\). \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\) is essentially the output representation of a single attention head.

Localized Representation Intervention (on Attention Heads)We define localized intervention \(I=\langle T,V\rangle\). Here, \(T=\{(l_{1},i_{1})\ldots(l_{K},i_{K})\}\) is a set of \(K\) attention heads to intervene on, where \(l_{j}\) denotes the target layer and \(i_{j}\) denotes the target head at the target layer. \(V=\{v^{i}_{l}\}_{(l,i)\in T}\) is the set of offset vectors, where \(v^{i}_{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{head}}}\).

At a high-level, localized representation intervention methods involve two steps:

**1) Localize the set of target attention heads \(T\) to intervene.** This is typically done by scoring every head \((l,i)\) in the network using a scoring function \(\mathcal{S}:(\mathbb{Z}^{+},\mathbb{Z}^{+})\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\). Specifically, the top-\(K\) locations are chosen according to \(\mathcal{S}(l,i)\).

**2) Compute offset vectors \(V\) for these targeted heads.**\(V\) can be learned or extracted in a learning free way. During _inference time_, these vectors will be added to offset the targeted attention activations. That is, \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\) will be overwritten as a linear combination with the offset vectors \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\gets z^{(l,i)}_{t}+\alpha v^{i}_{l}\) if \((l,i)\in T\) where \(\alpha\) is a constant.

Instantiations in the literatureSeveral representation intervention methods in literature can be cast in this framework [21; 57; 38]. For example, **Inference-time Intervention**[21; ITI] localizes \(T\) by training a logistic regression classifier to predict the truthfulness of responses using \(z^{l,i}_{t=-1}\) from the last timestep as the input features. It then selects top-\(K\) heads where the scoring function \(\mathcal{S}(l,i)\) is the probe accuracy on the validation set. Finally, ITI extracts the difference in representations of heads in \(T\) between truthful and untruthful responses as \(V\) through a forward pass, and adds \(V\) to the pre-trained representations of heads in \(T\) to improve truthfulness.

Our framework is also related to another family of representation intervention methods that intervene on MLP layers [47; 45] such as **Representation Engineering**[60, RepE], and even PEFT methods as well. For example, RepE extracts the difference vectors between two contrastive prompts as \(V\) and adds them to the representations of some MLP layers. BitFit [2] learns \(V\) in an end-to-end way and adds offset vectors to all modules that have a bias term. We choose to focus on attention heads, as recent interpretability research indicates that attention heads are semantically interpretable units for many key functionalities of LLMs such as induction [32] and retrieval [53], but we also compare with stronger PEFT methods in Section 6.

## 3 LoFiT: Localized Representation Fine-Tuning

We now present our method, Localized Representation Fine-tuning (LoFiT). Similar to the intervention framework as described in Section 2, LoFiT also aims to compute a set of the offset vectors \(V\) in the representation space targeted at a localized set of heads in \(T\). Unlike the learning-free alternatives,LoFiT uses a learning phase to select the heads, then also optimizes the offset vectors. As illustrated in Figure 1, our approach also follows a two-step framework.

**Step 1. Attention Head Selection:** The first step of LoFiT learns to select a set of potentially impactful attention heads for learning the given task.

We incorporate a learnable scaling factor \(A^{i}_{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{houf}}}\) for any head at layer \(l\in[1,L]\) and index \(i\in[1,H]\) of the pre-trained LLM. \(A^{i}_{l}\) can be viewed as a vector of scalars to upscale or downscale each element in the activations \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\) of the attention head \(i\) at layer \(l\).

With the scaling factors, during a forward pass, the activation \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\) is rescaled by \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\leftarrow(1+A^{i}_{l})\odot z^{(l,i)}_{t}\). We freeze all pre-trained weights and learn \(A^{i}_{l}\) end-to-end with the cross-entropy loss on a small amount of labeled data from the task of interest. During training, \(A^{i}_{l}\) is initialized from \(\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma_{A})\). We regularize the optimization with an L1 normalization with a scaling hyperparameter \(\lambda\) to encourage sparsity for better head selection.

Once we have learned \(A^{i}_{l}\), we score each head using the norm of \(A\), i.e., \(\mathcal{S}(i,j)=\|A^{i}_{l}\|\). A large score \(\mathcal{S}(i,j)\) indicates a stronger intervention is needed for a particular head.2 Therefore, we select the set of top-\(K\) attention heads as the target locations \(T\). \(K\) and \(\sigma_{A}\) are adjustable hyperparameters.3

Footnote 2: One could also tune the offset vectors and select attention heads with the largest norm of the offset vectors. In our experiments in Section 5, we find this is less effective than tuning the scaling factors for localization. We hypothesize that this is because scaling only amplifies or suppresses the existing pre-trained representations as opposed to directly editing them, which potentially prevents overfitting in the localization step.

**Step 2. Bias Tuning:** The second step of LoFiT learns the offset vectors \(V\) added to the hidden representations of each attention head in \(T\). We freeze all pre-trained weights and add learnable parameters \(\text{V}=\{v^{i}_{l}\ |(l,i)\in T\}\) such that during a forward pass, the activation \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\) will have an added offset bias vector: \(z^{(l,i)}_{t}\gets v^{i}_{l}\oplus z^{(l,i)}_{t}\). During training, we learn \(V\) with the cross-entropy loss on the same training data. \(v^{i}_{l}\) is initialized from \(N(0,\sigma_{v})\) and \(\sigma_{v}\) is an adjustable hyperparameter.

At inference time, the learned biases \(V\) are added to the hidden representations of the target attention heads \(T\) in the same way as a forward pass during training.

## 4 Experimental Setup

We evaluate LoFiT on question answering (QA), multi-hop reasoning, and counterfactual reasoning tasks, which are common settings for evaluating interpretability-motivated methods [21; 60]. We focus on a relatively low data condition: for each dataset, we sample 500 training points or fewer, to be consistent with the common low-data setup of representation intervention methods.

**TruthfulQA**[24] is a QA dataset with questions where humans are likely to give false answers because of common misconceptions. Representation interventions such as ITI [21] have shown success in eliciting truthful responses from LLMs without tuning. We follow the setup in [21] to split TruthfulQA into train/dev/test sets into 326/82/407 questions and use two-fold cross validation. We report MC1 and MC2 accuracy in the results; details of these metrics can be found in Appendix A.1.

**CLUTRR**[41] is a deductive reasoning dataset requiring multi-hop reasoning over family relationships. We use the subset of 2-hop questions and randomly split the data into train/dev/test sets of 300/450/450 QA pairs. The evaluation metric is exact match (EM).

**MQuAKE**[58] is a knowledge editing benchmark for evaluating the propagation of edited knowledge to related facts. We convert the subset of 2-hop knowledge propagation into an in-context knowledge editing setup by prepending "_Imagine that <Edited Knowledge_>" to the question of related facts, following [6]; we use this setup to evaluate if our method can learn simple reasoning over counterfactuals. Data is randomly split into train/dev/test sets of 134/95/864 QA pairs. The evaluation metric is exact match (EM).

**Representation Intervention Baselines** Our primary aim in this work is to compare LoFiT with other representation intervention techniques. In Section 6, we will also compare it against other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. Here, we focus our comparisons on three main baselines: 0-shot prompting, Inference-time Intervention [21, ITI], and Representation Engineering [60, RepE]. **ITI** is a representation intervention method to improve LLM truthfulness. **RepE** steers LLMs towards certain behaviors, including honesty and counterfactual knowledge, by using representations extracted from contrastive prompts. Details of both are discussed in Section 2.

Models and TrainingWe use Llama 2-7B [46], Llama 2-13B, and Gemma-7B [44] for experiments. Unless explicitly stated, we use the pre-trained base version of each model. When training with LoFiT, we learn the same scalars and biases for every token position of the input sequence. When performing inference with LoFiT, we use greedy decoding and we add the bias terms at the targeted attention heads to every decoding step. Prompt templates can be found in B. Configuration details and hyperparameters for LoFiT and the baselines can be found in Appendices C and D.

For CLUTRR and MQuAKE, we use cross-entropy loss with gold responses for fine-tuning. For TruthfulQA, we use direct preference optimization [37] by pairing the gold truthful responses and untruthful responses as preference data for fine-tuning, as SFT has been shown ineffective in [21].

For all experiments in Section 5, we select \(3\%\) attention heads for each model for LoFiT and ITI: precisely, \(K=16\) for Gemma-7B, \(K=32\) for Llama 2-7B, and \(K=48\) for Llama 2-13B.4 We use the top-1 layer for layer-based baselines, including RepE. Such granularity has been shown to be the minimum effective level of representation interventions [21, 60].

Footnote 4: We conduct an analysis on the percentage of attention heads used for LoFiT bias tuning versus the accuracy on MQuAKE and CLUTRR to determine the best \(K\) and results can be found in Appendix F.

## 5 Results: Effectiveness of Localization

We first discuss the overall performance of LoFiT. We find that learning-based localized intervention can be much more effective than learning-free alternatives, even with limited training data. As shown in Table 1, fine-tuning the representations of specific attention heads with LoFiT outperforms the baselines by a large margin across all settings.

The rest of this section will focus on our primary question on the _effectiveness of localization_: is localizing attention heads important for learning downstream tasks in the LLM representation space? If so, how task-specific are these sets of attention heads?

### Importance of LoFiT Heads

To validate the effectiveness of our localization method, we compare it with other head selection methods by tuning the biases \(V\) for a set of heads \(T\) selected by the following baseline methods.

\end{table}
Table 1: Test accuracy of LoFiT using Gemma-7B, Llama 2-7B, and Llama 2-13B against representation intervention baselines. Results are averaged over 2 random seeds and the best results are bolded. For ITI and LoFiT, we select \(3\%\) attention heads for each model. LoFiT outperforms baselines by a large margin across all settings on all models.

**Random sampling:** We randomly sample \(K\) heads from the uniform distribution.5

Footnote 5: We considered other random selection schemes, including sampling the same number of heads from each layer and biased sampling towards more important layers, but they worked worse than uniform random sampling.

**Probing for layers:** Along with other mechanistic interpretability works [30, 40], RepE focuses on layers as the subject matter for localizing functionality in LLMs. We examine if localizing important layers is better than important attention heads. Given a prompt in training data, we concatenate the gold response with it and a sampled incorrect response with it to create a pair of contrastive responses. We extract the pre-trained representations of all attention heads at each layer at the last token of both responses through a forward pass and concatenate them. We then train a logistic regression classifier for each layer to predict the correctness of responses using the concatenated representations as the input features, i.e., \(z_{t=-1}^{l}=\mathrm{concat}(z_{t=-1}^{(l,1)},...,z_{t=-1}^{(l,i)})\) for \(i\in[1,H]\). We define the scoring function over heads as a scoring function over layers \(\mathcal{S}(\star,l)\), which is the probe accuracy on the validation set.

**Bias-based selection:** Prune-then-retrain is a common paradigm in neural network sparsification literature [59, 36] by re-training models on a sparse set of fine-tuned weights. We adapt this paradigm as the bias-based head selection baseline: we fine-tune the biases for the hidden representations of all attention heads \(v_{l}^{i}\), and select the top-\(K\) attention heads where the scoring function \(\mathcal{S}(i,l)=\|v_{l}^{i}\|\).

**ITI head selection:** ITI shows that training a linear probe using the hidden representations of each attention head can help identify important heads for truthful generation. We select the top-\(K\) heads based on ITI head selection method as described in Section 2.

ResultsTable 2 shows that selecting attention heads based on LoFiT or probing results in consistently better downstream accuracy than random sampling and intervening on an entire layer. This indicates the effectiveness of localized interventions at the attention head level for learning the given tasks. Moreover, fine-tuning the representations of LoFiT heads outperforms all other head localization methods in most settings. This shows that LoFiT is a strong localization method for finding some optimal sets of attention heads for learning the interventions.

### Task Specificity of Localized Interventions

While localized interventions outperform ones without localization for the same task, we are also interested in the localization across tasks: is the localized set of attention heads task-specific, or is it generally helpful for learning any task in the representation space? To answer this question, we run a specificity experiment by changing the sets of heads to tune, specifically using the selected heads from a task different from the one we tune the bias. We compare the accuracy of LoFiT using different-task heads with the same-task accuracy and we use randomly sampled heads as a baseline.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l c c c c c} \hline \hline  & & Probe-layers & Random & Bias-based & ITI-heads & LoFiT \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Gemma-7B} & TruthfulQA & 46.7 & 55.2 & 56.7 & 56.7 & **60.5** \\  & MQuAKE & **71.2** & 65.2 & 71.0 & 69.2 & 69.4 \\  & CLUTRR & 83.3 & 86.0 & 86.7 & 84.8 & **86.7** \\  & _Average_ & 67.1 & 68.8 & 71.5 & 70.2 & **72.2** \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Llama 2-7B} & TruthfulQA & 52.6 & 46.6 & 52.3 & 57.1 & **58.1** \\  & MQuAKE & 72.8 & 71.9 & 72.2 & **73.8** & 73.4 \\  & CLUTRR & 86.7 & 88.0 & 88.2 & 86.7 & **89.7** \\  & _Average_ & 70.7 & 68.8 & 70.9 & 72.5 & **73.7** \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Llama 2-13B} & TruthfulQA & 31.5 & 54.3 & 40.1 & 56.5 & **56.7** \\  & MQuAKE & 74.1 & 67.1 & 71.1 & 74.6 & **76.2** \\  & CLUTRR & 85.6 & **90.7** & 90.9 & 87.6 & 89.7 \\  & _Average_ & 63.7 & 70.7 & 67.4 & 72.9 & **74.2** \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{_Average_} & 67.2 & 69.4 & 69.9 & 71.9 & **73.4** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Bias tuning accuracy using attention heads from LoFiT against other head selection methods. For TruthfulQA, we report MC1 accuracy. Best results are bolded. Fine-tuning the representations of LoFiT heads leads to consistently better performance than other head selection methods.

Figure 2 shows that localized interventions by LoFiT are task-specific for TruthfulQA and MQuAKE: tuning biases on same-task heads is consistently better than tuning on different-task heads by a significant margin across all models. For TruthfulQA, using different-task heads can lead to as large as \(10\%\) absolute performance degradation and can even be worse than random head selection (e.g., for Llama 2-13B), suggesting that the selected heads might have very specific functions. On the contrary, CLUTRR does not require a task-specific set of heads to achieve good performance, possibly because LLMs can be easily adapted without task-specific localization for this relatively easy task. In addition, examples in Appendix E show that some offset biases learned by LoFiT might also carry task-specific concepts.

### Granularity of Localization

We further examine where the task-specific heads reside in LLMs: do the localized sets overlap, or tend to select heads from similar layers? We illustrate the distribution of LoFiT heads over layers in Figure 3. Across all models, task-specific distributions peak in some contiguous sets of layers within the same model rather than being widely spread across layers or concentrated in a single layer. For the two Llama 2 models, peaks of different tasks are qualitatively very different from each other. We report Jaccard similarities of the selected head sets in Appendix G; head sets for different tasks are only mildly overlapping. These findings demonstrate that there is not a single set of heads best for fine-tuning across all tasks.

Figure 3: Distribution of LoFiT heads over layers for different tasks. Across tasks, LoFiT heads are often located in different parts of the model, and layer selection differs between Llama2 and Gemma.

Figure 2: Test accuracy of using LoFiT heads learned from a different task. Colors reflect relative accuracy with respect to using same-task heads, with same-task heads (diagonals) representing \(100\%\) relative accuracy. Different-task results with \(*\) are significantly lower than the same-task result at the significance level of \(0.05\) with a paired bootstrap test and results with \(+\) are significantly lower at the level of \(0.1\). For TruthfulQA, we report MC1 accuracy. Across models, task-specific heads consistently outperform different-task heads for TruthfulQA and MQuAKE.

## 6 Comparison with PEFT Methods

We also compare LoFiT with existing PEFT methods, **LoRA**[16], **RED**[52], and **ReFT**[54]. LoRA learns offsets to weight parameters (rather than representations, as we do) via a product of two low-rank matrices. RED fine-tunes scaling factors and biases on the hidden representations of LLMs, similar to combining Step 1 and Step 2 of LoFiT. ReFT learns to edit the hidden representations with a linear projection in a lower-dimensional subspace. Unlike LoFiT, RED and ReFT involve no localization. Details for ReFT can be found in Appendix C. We also include a half-parameter version of RED (_RED (Half)_) as an additional baseline where only the layers in the second half of the network are tuned.

Our focus is on datasets where models can be steered to have the right behavior, e.g., by interpretability-motivated methods from Section 4. However, for completeness, we also include a representative selection of datasets from [17] for PEFT methods that cover commonsense reasoning, open-book/closed-book QA, and mathematical reasoning: SIQA [39], ARC-Challenge [5], BoolQ [4], and SVAMP [35]. We stick to the low-data setting by sampling 500 training examples or fewer; details can be found in Appendix C. For all the following experiments, we select \(10\%\) attention heads for each model: \(K=48\) for Gamma-7B, \(K=96\) for Llama 2-7B, and \(K=160\) for Llama 2-13B.

Table 3 compares LoFiT results with PEFT methods. The results show that across settings from Section 4, LoFiT outperforms ReFT on average, and gives results comparable to LoRA with 200x fewer learned parameters and to RED with 20x fewer learned parameters. On commonsense and mathematical reasoning datasets, LoFiT falls slightly short of LoRA and RED, but outperforms ReFT and the parameter-matched version of RED. This is probably because these tasks require resurfacing of memorized world knowledge from the pre-trained model and the benefit of having more parameter

Table 3: Test accuracy of LoFiT and state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Results are averaged over 2 random seeds and the best results are bolded. For LoFiT, we select \(10\%\) attention heads. With 20x - 200x fewer learned parameters, LoFiT is comparable to PEFT models across models and even outperforms them in some settings.

updates outweighs the benefit of localization. Nevertheless, these results show that localization can enable further targeting of parameter updates without impacting task accuracy.6

Footnote 6: Our two-step procedure requires fitting additional parameters in the first stage. However, even accounting for these parameters, which are not used in the final model, we still modify fewer parameters than PEFT methods: half the parameters of RED and \(3\%\) of LoRA even if counting both sets.

Data efficiencyWe further compare LoFiT against PEFT methods using different numbers of training examples \(n\). We analyze the data efficiency of LoFiT on CLUTRR and MQuAKE with Llama 2-7B. Figure 4 shows that in the extremely low data settings (\(n\leq 100\)), LoFiT performs better than LoRA and RED, showing that LoFiT is very data efficient. For \(300\leq n\leq 1000\), LoFiT is still comparable to LoRA and RED with fewer parameters.

Open-ended GenerationWhile being fine-tuned for discriminative tasks in the above experiments, LoFiT also shows good performance on the open-ended generation task of TruthfulQA. We fine-tune with LoFiT and other methods on TruthfulQA with the same setup in Section 4 and evaluate its open-ended generation on TruthfulQA test questions with GPT-4. We prompt GPT-4 to evaluate the informativeness (_Info_) and truthfulness (_True_) of model responses given the question and the gold labels.7 Table 4 shows that LoFiT leads to truthful and informative responses that are comparable to PEFT methods and are better than ITI. Example outputs can be found in Appendix H.

Footnote 7: Details of GPT-4 evaluation prompt can be found in Appendix A.2

Out-of-Domain GeneralizationBenefiting from the small number of parameter updates, LoFiT can potentially generalize well to out-of-domain tasks after fine-tuning. We show a case study on TruthfulQA: we first fine-tune Llama 2-7B-chat on TruthfulQA and then evaluate 0-shot on three out-of-domain question-answering benchmarks: TriviaQA [18], Natural Questions [20, NQ], and MMLU [14]. We follow the same evaluation scheme in [21] to convert TriviaQA and Natural Questions into multiple-choice questions and report accuracy.8 Table 5 shows that LoFiT suffers less from overfitting on TruthfulQA as its

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l c c c} \hline \hline  & & True & Info & True \(\times\) Info \\ \hline \multirow{5}{*}{Llama 2-7B} & 0-shot & 35.7 & **92.7** & 33.1 \\  & ITI & 52.3 & 81.4 & 42.6 \\  & LoRA & 64.3 & 88.0 & 56.6 \\  & RED & 66.5 & 91.4 & **60.8** \\  & LoFiT & **67.2** & 87.5 & 58.9 \\ \hline \multirow{5}{*}{Llama 2-13B} & 0-shot & 38.6 & 93.9 & 36.3 \\  & ITI & 46.9 & 78.5 & 36.8 \\ \cline{1-1}  & LoRA & 67.2 & 90.5 & 60.8 \\ \cline{1-1}  & RED & 67.0 & **94.6** & **63.4** \\ \cline{1-1}  & LoFiT & **67.5** & 90.7 & 61.2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: GPT-4 evaluation of open-ended generation quality to TruthfulQA. LoFiT is comparable to PEFT methods in terms of truthfulness and informativeness, and outperforms 0-shot and ITI baselines by a large margin.

Figure 4: LoFiT performance using different numbers of training examples \(n\) on CLUTRR and MQuAKE with Llama 2-7B. For LoFiT, we tune \(10\%\) of the attention heads. Results are averaged over two runs. In the low data settings (\(n\leq 100\)), LoFiT is more data efficient than LoRA and RED. For \(n\geq 300\), LoFiT is still comparable to LoRA and RED with fewer parameters.

performance on TriviaQA and MMLU does not drop from the non-fine-tuned base model, and it even improves on NQ while OOD performance degradation can be observed in ITI and PEFT baselines.

## 7 Related Work

Recent interpretability work has shown that certain semantics can be encoded in identifiable circuits or modules of transformer language models in human-interpretable ways, including entity knowledge [30], factual associations [11], logical reasoning [55], and arithmetic reasoning [42]. Moreover, mechanistic interpretability methods, especially causal intervention, have revealed that such semantics can be attributed to specific attention heads [23; 21; 28], MLP layers [40; 30], neurons [49], or subnetworks [1]. Inspired by these findings, a line of work has explored intervening on pre-trained language models by manipulating and editing hidden representations at some specific locations in transformers with lightweight or no tuning to perform specific tasks or for controllable generation, including alignment [60], style transfer [43; 47], reasoning [12], truthfulness [21], and knowledge editing [30]. We follow this vein of work, but we do not use neuron-level localization methods.

Separately from interpretability, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been broadly used to selectively change a small fraction of pre-trained model parameters to learn specific downstream tasks. State-of-the-art PEFT methods [15; 16; 54; 52; 19] can learn to adjust less than \(1\%\) of the pre-trained parameters and match or even outperform vanilla full fine-tuning methods on various benchmarks. Concurrent to our work, ReFT [54] proposes to integrate interventions on representations into PEFT as a strong alternative fine-tuning method. However, ReFT does not use a localization step derived from interpretability methods and instead treats layers to tune as hyperparameters. We believe our approach, focusing on a subset of the network, has benefits for continual learning and can support techniques like model merging.

## 8 Conclusion

In this work, we introduce LoFiT, a two-step localized fine-tuning method for LLMs that selects a subset of attention heads and learns task-specific offset vectors to be added to the hidden representations of the targeted attention heads. We show the strong downstream performance of LoFiT on tasks involving truthfulness and reasoning, outperforming representation intervention methods (ITI and RepE) and matching strong PEFT methods (LoRA) with fewer learned parameters. We also show that LoFiT is effective at localizing task-specific attention heads for learning downstream tasks, showing that interpretability insights have a part to play in improving LLM fine-tuning processes.

**Limitations:** Our experiments in this work focus on English-language truthfulness and reasoning datasets with short contexts and responses; different model behaviors and localization might be observed for tasks with long context or long-form generation [53; 25]. We selected these tasks following past interpretability work and to enable straightforward evaluation. In addition, we only evaluate autoregressive Transformer language models with up to 13B parameters; different behavior could be observed at the largest scales, although we note that past interpretability work has shown localization on larger models (\(\geq 70B\)) as well [23].

Table 5: Out-of-domain generalization performance of LoFiT on Llama 2-7B-Chat after fine-tuning on TruthfulQA. 0-shot prompts are used for OOD evaluation. “No-FT” represents the base model without being fine-tuned on TruthfulQA. In-domain evaluation results on TruthfulQA are also included for reference. Compared to PEFT methods, LoFiT better preserves the existing capabilities of the base model after being fine-tuned across all settings.

TruthfulQA Evaluation

### Evaluation of Multiple-Choice Questions

The multiple-choice setting of TruthfulQA evaluates whether a model is able to select the true responses to a question out of several false responses that are related to common misconceptions. The two standard metrics used for this setting, as proposed in the original paper implementation of TruthfulQA [24], are the following:

**MC1 (Single-true):** Given a question, there is a single correct response out of 4-5 responses. The model evaluates each response independently by computing the log probability as the continuation of the question, and the model gets a score of 1 for a question only if it assigns the highest log probability to the single correct answer and 0 otherwise. The MC1 accuracy is the average score across all questions.

**MC2 (Multi-true)** Given a question, there are multiple correct responses provided. The score for a question is the sum of the normalized probability assigned to each true response. The MC2 accuracy is the average score across all questions.

### Evaluation of Open-ended Generation with GPT-4

Another setting of TruthfulQA asks the model to generate an answer given a question and evaluate the quality of the answer. The original paper proposes two evaluation metrics: Truthfulness (_True_) and Informativeness (_Info_). Truthfulness reflects the correctness of the answer with respect to real-world facts while informativeness refers to the helpfulness of the response: a model that always answers "I have no comment" will get perfect truthfulness scores but low informativeness scores. The product of truthfulness and informativeness (_True_\(\times\)_Info_) is used to evaluate the overall quality.

The automatic evaluation the original paper [24] proposes is using a fine-tuned version of the GPT-3-6.7B model (GPT-3 Curie) [3] as a classifier for truthfulness and informativeness using a labeled collection of truthful and informative responses. Follow-up work, including ITI [21], also uses the same evaluation strategy for open-ended generation. However, at the time of this work, GPT-3 Curie is no longer supported by OpenAI and is thus not accessible for evaluation.

Instead, we prompt the latest GPT-4 model [33] (specifically, _gpt-4-0314_) to evaluate the truthfulness and informativeness of model-generated responses. For truthfulness evaluation, we provide the gold labels as the references in the prompt and prompt GPT-4 for a true/false response. For informativeness evaluation, because gold labels from TruthfulQA are not necessarily informative (for example, "I have no comment" is one of the gold labels for many questions), we include few-shot examples from [24] with the hand-labeled informative scores for each example in the prompt, and prompt GPT-4 to provide an informative score for the given response. Following [24], we consider a response with a score \(\geq 0.5\) as informative and not informative otherwise. The exact prompts we used are the following.

**Prompt:**

"You will be given a question about the real world and a response to the question. Your task is to judge if the response is truthful to the question without lying about facts in the real world or falling prey to any common myths. You will be given some examples of correct responses and incorrect responses and you can use them as a reference for your judgment. Your response should be a single word: true, or false.

Question: {question}

Examples of correct responses: {gold responses from the test set}

Examples of incorrect responses: {incorrect responses from the test set}

Now, provide your true/false judgment of the following response: {generated response}

This response is: "

**Prompt A.2. GPT-4 Evaluation of Informativeness**

**Prompt:**

"You will be given a question about the real world and a response to the question. Assume that you do 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

by the model. We use the following prompt for CLUTRR. In preliminary experiments, we found that LLMs sometimes refuse to answer and indicate that relationships in the provided story are incorrect based on names and relations of known people in the real world, so we include further clarifying instructions in the prompt in addition to basic formatting.

``` Prompt:
1Read the following story about a family. (Stoy) Assume the relations described in the story are all true. Based on relations between the fictional characters in the story (assume the relations are all true) and your commonsense knowledge about family relationship, how is [Character2] related to (Character1)? Answer: (Character2) is (Character1)'s" ```

### Siqa

We use the prompt from [17] for SIQA.

``` Prompt:
1Please choose the correct answer to the question. Question: {context} {question} A. {answerA} B. {answerB} C. {answerC} Answer:" ```

### ARC-c

We use the prompt from [17] for ARC-c.

``` Prompt:
1Please choose the correct answer to the question. Question: {question} A. {answerA} B. {answerB} C. {answerC} Answer:" ```

### BoolQ

We use the prompt from [17] for BoolQ. BoolQ does not have answer options as the answers can only be True/False.

``` Prompt:
1" ```

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:20]

BoolQ [4]BoolQ is a closed-book QA dataset. We sampled 100 training examples and 100 validation examples for training. We used the test split of 3270 examples for evaluation.

Svamp [35]SVAMP is a math word problem dataset. We split the dataset into train/dev/test splits of 350/350/300 examples, and we trained the models using the gold equation and the final answer as the label (rather than just using the final answer).

We converted SIQA, ARC-c, and BoolQ into a unified multiple-choice QA format using prompts from [17]. Following [17], we evaluate the models based on whether they can correctly generate the option (rather than using the log-likelihood scoring of the sequence of each option). The prompts can be found in Appendix B.

## Appendix D Hyperparameters

For all experiments on TruthfulQA, MQuAKE, CLUTRR, and SVAMP, we fine-tuned for \(5\) epochs with a batch size of \(8\) for all methods except ReFT; we will discuss the specific hyperparameters for ReFT in later sections. For all experiments on SIQA, and ARC-c, we fine-tuned for \(3\) epochs with a batch size of \(8\) to prevent memorization of world knowledge. For BoolQ, we fine-tuned for \(3\) epochs with a batch size of \(4\) for Llama 2-7B and of \(2\) for Llama 2-13B to fit the long passage context into a single GPU. We used the same implicit reward hyperparameter of direct preference optimization \(\beta=0.5\) for TruthfulQA experiments. Method-specific hyperparameters can be found in the following subsections.

### LoFiT

Hyperparameters of LoFiT used in each experiment are summarized in Table 6. Because LoFiT for different models involves different numbers of learned parameters, we did not use the same set of hyperparameters throughout; instead, we tuned the following hyperparameters with grid search. Specifically, we found that a small L1 regularization term is good for enforcing the learning of a sparse set of effective attention heads, which is also suggested by model sparsification literature [34]. We also found that when using fewer heads, a larger learning rate is needed to stabilize training for LoFiT.

In addition to hyperparameters listed in Table 6, we used the following hyperparameters uniformly across all experiments for LoFiT: \(\sigma_{A}=\sigma_{v}=0.001\) for the initialization of LoFiT. We found that this set of initialization is robust to random seeds.

### Representation Intervention Baselines

ItiIn preliminary studies, we tuned the scaling factor \(\alpha\) of the offset vectors over a range of values suggested in the original paper [21]. We tuned \(\alpha\) on a validation set of each dataset and we found that \(\alpha=15\) worked robustly across all settings.

RepEIn preliminary studies, we tuned the scaling factor \(\alpha\) of the offset vectors on a validation set of each dataset and found that \(\alpha=5\) worked best across settings.

### PEFT Baselines

LoRAIn preliminary studies, we experimented with different configurations of LoRA, including applying LoRA weights to MLP layers and changing the rank and \(\alpha\). We found that the following configuration strikes the best balance across settings between overfitting with too many parameters and under-tuning with too low rank: we fine-tuned the \(Q\) projection and \(V\) projection matrices of all attention heads, used \(\mathrm{rank}=8\), \(\alpha=8\), and applied a dropout rate of \(0.1\) to prevent overfitting. We performed a hyperparameter sweep for the learning rate on the validation set of each dataset and the optimal configurations for each model and dataset can be found in Table 7.

RedSuggested by the original RED paper [52] and confirmed in our preliminary studies, fine-tuning all attention heads with RED is better than other alternative RED configurations, including tuning MLP layers and tuning all modules, across settings. We performed a hyperparameter sweep for the learning rate on the validation set of each dataset and the optimal configurations for each model and dataset can be found in Table 7.

ReFTThe ReFT paper [54] indicates that ReFT has the following important hyperparameters to tune: layers to apply interventions, the rank of the subspace, token positions in the input where the interventions are applied, and learning rate. In addition, in our preliminary experiments, we found that ReFT is very sensitive to hyperparameter choices and batch size also has an impact on the ReFT performance. Therefore, we performed grid search for the aforementioned hyperparameters to select

## Appendix E Interpreting LoFiT Offset Vectors

Prior work in interpretability literature [8; 11] shows that hidden representations of LLMs can be interpreted as human-interpretable concepts through the "Logit Lens" [31], projecting the representations onto the vocabulary space with the model's unembedding matrix and inspecting the decoded vocabulary. We apply Logit Lens to project the learned LoFiT offset bias vector \(v_{i}^{l}\) of the \(i\)th head at layer \(l\) to vocabulary, apply a softmax over the projection, and decode the top-\(10\) tokens. Note that the vanilla Logit Lens only applies to the hidden state rather than attention outputs, so we follow [56] to adapt Logit Lens for attention outputs. We found that some offset biases are related to task-specific, human-interpretable concepts in a context-independent way.

Examples in E.1 show that top tokens in some offset biases of Llama 2-7B fine-tuned on CLUTRR are related to family relationships, especially some high-level family concepts that do not explicitly appear in the training data (e.g. _ancest_, _founder_, _family_, _descend_). In addition, top tokens of some TruthfulQA offset biases show words that are used to clarify answers (e.g., _actual_, _except_, _particularly_, _rarely_).

Example E.1: **Top-10** Desededed tokens from LoFiT Offset Vectors (Llama 2-7B)

**Fine-tuned on CLUTRR: Head (19,7):**: "ousin, cousin, father, Brothers, father, uncle, sib, brothers, brother, sister"
**Head (22,26):**: "ancest, parent, padre, anci, pere, founder, father, prede, father, parents"
**Head (30,12):**: "5pa, Sigma, bro, brothers, Bro, sister, Sister, Bro, brother, Brothers"
**Head (31,27):**: "descend, family, brother, relatives, grands, family, Grand, uncle, grand, grand"
**Fine-tuned on TruthfulQA:**:

## Appendix F Effects of the Number of Heads \(K\) on Performance

For the bias tuning stage, the number of heads \(K\) has an impact on LoFiT performance. We conduct an analysis on the percentage of attention heads used for LoFiT bias tuning versus the accuracy on MQuAKE and CLUTRR. Results in Figure 5 show that the performance plateaus when \(K\) reaches \(10\%-20\%\) of the total number of attention heads and continues to increase as \(K\) gets larger before it reaches the above threshold. This is likely because the number of learned parameters is too small to be expressive when \(K\) is smaller than \(10\%\) of attention heads (<10K parameters). Based on these observations, we use \(3\%\) for extremely parameter-efficient scenarios and \(10\%\) for the best balance between parameter counts and performance.

## Appendix G Quantitative Evaluation of Similarity of LoFiT Heads

Accompanying the qualitative evaluation of the distribution of LoFiT heads for different tasks, we also quantitatively examine the similarity of LoFiT heads with the following metrics:

Jaccard similarityFor the same model and a fixed number of selected heads \(\mathrm{K}\), we compute the overlap between the two sets of LoFiT heads selected from a pair of tasks \((i,j)\) with Jaccard similarity, namely:

\[J(i,j)=\frac{|T_{i}\cap T_{j}|}{|T_{i}|}\] (3)

Earth Mover Distance of Head DistributionsAdjacent attention heads might share similar functionality in LLMs [29], and Jaccard might fail to capture such similarity. Therefore, we compare the similarity of head distributions over layers. For a pair of LoFiT sets, we normalize the number of heads selected in each layer in each set into a probability distribution over layers, and compute Earth Mover Distance between the two distributions.

Results are summarized in Figure 6. Along the diagonals, Jaccard similarities show that for the same task, LoFiT is able to robustly localize approximately the same set of heads when trained with different random seeds. Across all models, pairs of LoFiT sets for different tasks share less than a third of attention heads. In addition, Earth Mover Distances are relatively large between different

Figure 5: The effects of the percentage of attention heads \(K\) used for LoFiT Bias Tuning on LoFiT performance. Results are averaged over two runs. The test accuracy increases with \(K\) when \(K<10\%\) and plateaus when \(K\) reaches \(10\%-20\%\).

LoFiT sets, and in some cases, the distance from a task-specific set can be even larger than the distance from the random set. These results further show that task-specific LoFiT heads are located in distinct layers in LLMs.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our main claims of the effectiveness of LoFiT and the benefits of localization are accurately stated within the scope of truthfulness and reasoning tasks we investigate in Section 5 and Section 6 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Limitations are discussed in a separate paragraph in Section 8. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not introduce theoretical results. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code for experiments will be made publicly available. Experimental configurations to reproduce all experiments can be found in Appendix C and D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: As described in Section 4, all datasets we use for experiments are publicly accessible datasets. We will also release the exact data splits of these datasets we use in our code release. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All training details are specified in Appendix C and Appendix D. All details for evaluation, including the prompts and metrics, are included in Section 4, Appendix B, and Appendix H. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Statistical significance from paired bootstrap tests is reported in Section 5 to support our main claims about localization and task specificity. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Details of computational resources are provided in Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We checked every aspect in the Code of Ethics and confirmed that we follow the guidelines. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: There are no specific social impacts of this work separate from the general impacts of work on large language models, interpretability, and parameter-efficient tuning methods. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work does not introduce any new datasets or new foundation models that can potentially cause risk for misuse. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include license information in Appendix I. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All details of reproducing the data splits we use for experiments are included in Section 4 and Appendix B. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work involves no human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work involves no human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
