###### Abstract

Given the ubiquitous presence of time series data across various domains, precise forecasting of time series holds significant importance and finds widespread real-world applications such as energy, weather, healthcare, etc. While numerous forecasters have been proposed using different network architectures, the Transformer-based models have state-of-the-art performance in time series forecasting. However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from vulnerability to high-frequency signals, efficiency in computation, and bottleneck in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series with thousands of points. In this paper, we explore a novel perspective of enlightening _signal processing_ for deep time series forecasting. Inspired by the _filtering_ process, we introduce one simple yet effective network, namely _FilterNet_, built upon our proposed learnable _frequency filters_ to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals. Concretely, we propose two kinds of learnable filters in the FilterNet: (i) Plain shaping filter, that adopts a universal frequency kernel for signal filtering and temporal modeling; (ii) Contextual shaping filter, that utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. Equipped with the two filters, FilterNet can approximately surrogate the linear and attention mappings widely adopted in time series literature, while enjoying superb abilities in handling high-frequency noises and utilizing the whole frequency spectrum that is beneficial for forecasting. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and experimental results have demonstrated our superior performance in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency compared with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at 1.

## 1 Introduction

Time series forecasting has been playing a pivotal role across a multitude of contemporary applications, spanning diverse domains such as climate analysis [1], energy production [2], traffic flow patterns [3], financial markets [4], and various industrial systems [5]. The ubiquity and profound significance of time series data has recently garnered substantial research efforts, culminating in a plethora of deep learning forecasting models [6] that have significantly enhanced the domain of time series forecasting.

Previously, leveraging different kinds of deep neural networks derives a series of time series forecasting methods, such as Recurrent Neural Network-based methods including DeepAR [7], LSTNet [8],Convolution Neural Network-based methods including TCN [9], SCINet [10], etc. Recently, however, with the continuing advancement of deep learning, two branches of methods that received particularly more attention have been steering the development of time series forecasting, i.e., Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)-based methods, such as N-BEATS [11], DLinear [12], and FreTS [13], and Transformer-based methods, such as Informer [14], Autoformer [15], PatchTST [16], and iTransformer [17]. While MLP-based models are capable of providing accurate forecasts, Transformer-based models continue to achieve state-of-the-art time series forecasting performance.

However, forecasters based on Transformers are still suffering from _vulnerability_ to high-frequency signals, _efficiency_ in computation, and _bottleneck_ in full-spectrum utilization, which essentially are the cornerstones for accurately predicting time series composed of thousands of timesteps. In designing a very simple simulation experiment on the synthetic data only composed of a low-, middle- and high-frequency signal respectively (see Figure 1(a)), we find the state-of-the-art iTransformer [17] model performs much worse in forecasting (Figure 1(b) and Figure 1(c)). This observation shows that state-of-the-art Transformer-based model cannot utilize the full spectrum information, even for a naive signal of three different frequency components. In contrast, in the field of _signal processing_, a _frequency filter_ enjoys many good properties such as frequency selectivity, signal conditioning, and multi-rate processing. These could have great potential in advancing the model's ability to extract key informative frequency patterns in time series forecasting.

Thus, inspired by the _filtering_ process [18] in signal processing, in this paper, we introduce one simple yet effective framework, namely _FilterNet_, for effective time series forecasting. Specifically, we start by proposing two kinds of learnable filters as the key units in our framework: (i) Plain shaping filter, which makes the naive but universal frequency kernel learnable for signal filtering and temporal modeling, and (ii) Contextual shaping filter, which utilizes filtered frequencies examined in terms of its compatibility with input signals for dependency learning. The plain shaping filter is more likely to be adopted in predefined conditions and efficient in handling simple time series structures, while the contextual filter can adaptively weight the filtering process based on the changing conditions of input and thus have more flexibility in facing more complex situations. Besides, these two filters as the built-in functions of the FilterNet can also approximately surrogate the widely adopted linear mappings and attention mappings in time series literature [12; 14; 17]. This also illustrates the effectiveness of our FilterNet in forecasting by selectively passing or attenuating certain signal components while capturing the core time series structure with adequate learning expressiveness. Moreover, since filters are better fit in the stationary frequency domain, we let filters wrapped by two reversible transformations, i.e., instance normalization [19] and fast Fourier transform [20] to reduce the influence of non-stationarity and accomplish the domain transformation of time series respectively. In summary, our contributions can be listed as follows:

* In studying state-of-the-art deep Transformer-based time series forecasting models, an interesting observation from a simple simulation experiment motivates us to explore a novel perspective of enlightening _signal processing_ techniques for deep time series forecasting.
* Inspired by the _filtering_ process in signal processing, we introduce a simple yet effective network, _FilterNet_, built upon our proposed two learnable frequency filters to extract key informative temporal patterns by selectively passing or attenuating certain components of time series signals, thereby enhancing the forecasting performance.
* We conduct extensive experiments on eight time series forecasting benchmarks, and the results have demonstrated that our model achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art forecasting algorithms in terms of effectiveness and efficiency.

## 4 Methodology

As aforementioned, frequency filters enjoy numerous advantageous properties for time series forecasting, functioning equivalently to circular convolution operations in the time domain. Therefore, we design the time series forecaster from the perspective of frequency filters. In this regard, we propose _FilterNet_, a forecasting architecture grounded in frequency filters. First, we introduce the overall architecture of FilterNet in Section 4.1, which primarily comprises the basic blocks and the frequency filter block. Second, we delve into the details of two types of frequency filter blocks: the _plain shaping filter_ presented in Section 4.2 and the _contextual shaping filter_ discussed in Section 4.3.

### Overview

The overall architecture of FilterNet is depicted in Figure 2, which mainly consists of the instance normalization part, the frequency filter block, and the feed-forward network. Specifically, for a given time series input \(\mathbf{X}=[X_{1}^{1:L},X_{2}^{1:L},...,X_{N}^{1:L}]\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times L}\) with the number of variables \(N\) and the lookback window length \(L\), where \(X_{1}^{1:L}\in\mathbb{R}^{L}\) denotes the \(N\)-th variable, we employ FilterNet to predict the future \(\tau\) time steps \(\mathbf{Y}=[X_{1}^{L+1:L+\tau},X_{2}^{L+1:L+\tau},...,X_{N}^{L+1:L+\tau}]\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times\tau}\). We provide further analysis about the architecture design of FilterNet in Appendix A.

Instance NormalizationNon-stationarity is widely existing in time series data and poses a crucial challenge for accurate forecasting [19; 36]. Considering that time series data are typically collected over a long duration, these non-stationary sequences inevitably expose forecasting models to distribution shifts over time. Such shifts can result in performance degradation during testing due to the covariate shift or the conditional shift [37]. To address this problem, we utilize an instance normalization method, denoted as \(\mathrm{Norm}\), on the time series input \(\mathbf{X}\), which can be formulated as:

\[\mathrm{Norm}(\mathbf{X})=[\frac{X_{i}^{1:L}-\mathrm{Mean}_{L}(X_{i}^{1:L})}{ \mathrm{Std}_{L}(X_{i}^{1:L})}]_{i=1}^{N},\] (2)

where \(\mathrm{Mean}_{L}\) denotes the operation that calculates the mean value along the time dimension, and \(\mathrm{Std}_{L}\) represents the operation that calculates the standard deviation along the time dimension.

Correspondingly, the inverse instance normalization, denoted as \(\mathrm{InverseNorm}\), is formulated as:

\[\mathrm{InverseNorm}(\mathbf{P})=[P_{i}^{L+1:L+\tau}\times\mathrm{Std}_{L}(X_{ i}^{1:L})+\mathrm{Mean}_{L}(X_{i}^{1:L})]_{i=1}^{N},\] (3)

where \(\mathbf{P}=[P_{1}^{L+1:L+\tau},P_{2}^{L+1:L+\tau},...,P_{N}^{L+1:L+\tau}]\in \mathbb{R}^{N\times\tau}\) are the predictive values.

Figure 2: The overall architecture of FilterNet. (i) Instance normalization is employed to address the non-stationarity among time series data; (ii) The frequency filter block is applied to capture the temporal patterns, which has two different implementations, i.e., plain shaping filter and contextual shaping filter; (iii) Feed-forward network is adopted to project the temporal patterns extracted by frequency filter block back onto the time series data and make predictions.

Frequency Filter BlockPrevious representative works primarily leverage MLP architectures (e.g., DLinear [12], RLinear [23]) or Transformer architectures (e.g., PatchTST [16], iTransformer [17]) to model the temporal dependencies among time series data. As mentioned earlier, time series forecasters can be implemented through performing a _frequency filter process_ in the frequency domain, and thus we propose to directly apply the frequency filter in the frequency domain, denoted as \(\mathrm{FilterBlock}\), to replace the aforementioned methods for modeling corresponding temporal dependencies, such as:

\[\mathrm{FilterBlock}(\mathbf{Z})=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}) \mathcal{H}_{filter}),\] (4)

where \(\mathcal{F}\) is Fourier transform, \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\) is inverse Fourier transform and \(\mathcal{H}_{filter}\) is the frequency filter.

Inspired by MLP that randomly initializes a learnable weight parameters and Transformer that learns the data-dependent attention scores from data (further explanations are provided in Appendix B), we introduce two types of frequency filters, i.e., _plain shaping filter_ (\(\mathrm{PaFilter}\)) and _contextual shaping filter_ (\(\mathrm{TexFilter}\)). \(\mathrm{PaFilter}\) applies a random initialized learnable weight \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}\) to instantiate the frequency filter \(\mathcal{H}_{filter}\), and then the frequency filter process is reformulated as:

\[\mathrm{FilterBlock}(\mathbf{Z})=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}) \mathcal{H}_{\phi}).\] (5)

\(\mathrm{TexFilter}\) learns a data-dependent frequency filter \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}))\) from the input data by using a neural network \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}()\), and then the corresponding frequency filter process is reformulated as:

\[\mathrm{FilterBlock}(\mathbf{Z})=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}) \mathcal{H}_{\varphi}(\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}))).\] (6)

Feed-forward NetworkThe frequency filter block has captured temporal dependencies among time series data, and then we employ a feed-forward network (\(\mathrm{FFN}\)) to project them back onto the time series data and make predictions for the future \(\tau\) time steps. As the output \(\mathbf{P}\) of \(\mathrm{FFN}\) are instance-normalized values, we conduct an inverse instance normalization operation (\(\mathrm{InverseNorm}\)) on them and obtain the final predictions \(\hat{\mathbf{Y}}\). The entire process can be formulated as follows:

\[\mathbf{P} =\mathrm{FFN}(\mathbf{S}),\] (7) \[\hat{\mathbf{Y}} =\mathrm{InverseNorm}(\mathbf{P}).\]

### Plain Shaping Filter

\(\mathrm{PaFilter}\) instantiates the frequency filter by randomly initializing learnable parameters and then performing multiplication with the input time series. In general, for multivariate time series data, the channel-independence strategy in channel modeling has proven to be more effective compared to the channel-mixing strategy [12; 16]. Following this principle, we also adopt the channel-independence strategy for designing the frequency filter. Specifically, we propose two types of plain shaping filters: the universal type, where parameters are shared across different channels, and the individual type, where parameters are unique to each channel, as illustrated in Figure 3(a).

Given the time series input \(\mathbf{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times L}\) and the plain shaping filter \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}\), we apply \(\mathrm{PaFilter}\) by:

\[\mathcal{Z} =\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}),\] (8) \[\mathcal{S} =\mathcal{Z}\odot_{L}\mathcal{H}_{\phi},\quad\mathcal{H}_{\phi} \in\{\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Uni)},\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Ind)}\}\] \[\mathbf{S} =\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{S}),\]

Figure 3: The structure of frequency filters. (a) Plain shaping filter: the plain shaping filter is initialized randomly with channel-shared (left) or channel-unique (right) parameters, and then performs circular convolution (i.e., the symbol ) with the input time series; (b) Contextual shaping filter: the contextual shaping filter firstly learns a data-dependent filter and then conducts multiplication (i.e., the symbol \(\odot\)) with the frequency representation of the input time series.

where \(\mathcal{F}\) is Fourier transform, \(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\) is inverse Fourier transform, \(\odot_{L}\) denotes the element-wise product along \(L\) dimension, \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Uni)}\in\mathbb{C}^{1\times L}\) is the universal plain shaping filter, \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Ind)}\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times L}\) is the individual plain shaping filter, and \(\mathbf{S}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times L}\) is the output of \(\mathrm{PaiFilter}\). We further compare and analyze the two types of \(\mathrm{PaiFilter}\) in Section 5.3.

### Contextual Shaping Filter

In contrast to \(\mathrm{PaiFilter}\), which randomly initializes the parameters of frequency filters and fixes them after training, \(\mathrm{TexFilter}\) learns the parameters generated from the input data, allowing for better adaptation to the data. Consequently, we devise a neural network \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}\) that flexibly adjusts the frequency filter in response to the input data, as depicted in Figure 3(b).

Given the time series input \(\mathbf{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times L}\) and its corresponding Fourier transform denoted as \(\mathcal{Z}=\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z})\in\mathbb{C}^{N\times L}\), the network \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}\) is utilized to derive the contextual shaping filter, expressed as \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}:\mathbb{C}^{N\times L}\mapsto\mathbb{C}^{N\times D}\). First, it embeds the raw data by a linear dense operation \(\kappa:\mathbb{C}^{L}\mapsto\mathbb{C}^{D}\) to improve the capability of modeling complex data. Then, it applies a series of complex-value multiplication with \(K\) learnable parameters \(\mathcal{W}_{1:K}\in\mathbb{C}^{1\times D}\) yielding \(\sigma(\kappa(\mathcal{Z})\odot\mathcal{W}_{1:K})\) where \(\sigma\) is the activation function, and finally outputs \(\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}(\mathcal{Z})\). Then we apply \(\mathrm{TexFilter}\) by:

\[\mathcal{Z}=\mathcal{F}(\mathbf{Z}),\] (9) \[\mathcal{E}=\kappa(\mathcal{Z}),\] \[\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}(\mathcal{Z})=\sigma(\mathcal{E}\odot_{D} \mathcal{W}_{1:K}),\quad\mathcal{W}_{1:K}=\prod_{i=1}^{K}\mathcal{W}_{i}\] \[\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{E}\odot_{D}\mathcal{H}_{\varphi}(\mathcal{Z }),\] \[\mathbf{S}=\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{S}),\]

where \(\odot_{D}\) denotes the element-wise product along \(D\) dimension and \(\mathbf{S}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\) is the output. The contextual shaping filter can adaptively weight the filtering process based on the changing conditions of input and thus have more flexibility in facing more complex situations.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we extensively experiment with eight real-world time series benchmarks to assess the performance of our proposed FilterNet. Furthermore, we conduct thorough analytical experiments concerning the frequency filters to validate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.

### Experimental Setup

DatasetsWe conduct empirical analyses on diverse datasets spanning multiple domains, including traffic, energy, and weather, among others. Specifically, we utilize datasets such as ETT datasets [14], Exchange [38], Traffic [15], Electricity [15], and Weather [15], consistent with prior studies on long time series forecasting [16; 17; 25]. We preprocess all datasets according to the methods outlined in [16; 17], and normalize them with the standard normalization method. We split the datasets into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:2:1 ratio. More dataset details are in Appendix C.1.

BaselinesWe compare our proposed FilterNet with the representative and state-of-the-art models to evaluate their effectiveness for time series forecasting. We choose the baseline methods from four categories: (1) Frequency-based models, including FreTS [13] and FITS [32]; (2) TCN-based models, such as MICN [39] and TimesNet [40]; (3) MLP-based models, namely DLinear [12] and RLinear [23]; and (4) Transformer-based models, which include Informer [14], Autoformer [15], Pyraformer [26], FEDformer [25], PatchTST [16], and the more recent iTransformer [17] for comparison. Further details about the baselines can be found in Appendix C.2.

Implementation DetailsAll experiments are implemented using Pytorch 1.8 [41] and conducted on a single NVIDIA RTX 3080 10GB GPU. We employ MSE (Mean Squared Error) as the loss function and present MAE (Mean Absolute Errors) and MSE (Mean Squared Errors) results as the evaluation metrics. For further implementation details, please refer to Appendix C.3.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

Shared vs. Unique Filters Among ChannelsTo analyze the different channel strategies of filters, we further conduct experiments on the ETH and Exchange datasets. Specifically, we compare forecasting performance under different prediction lengths between two different types of frequency filters, i.e., \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Uni)}\) and \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Ind)}\). In \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Uni)}\), filters are shared across different channels, whereas \(\mathcal{H}_{\phi}^{(Ind)}\) signifies filters unique to each channel. The evaluation results are presented in Table 2. It demonstrates that filters shared among different channels consistently outperform across all prediction lengths. In addition, we visualize the prediction values predicted on the ETH1 dataset by the two different types of filters, as illustrated in Figure 11 (see Appendix G.1). The visualization reveals that the prediction values generated by filters shared among different channels exhibit a better fit than the unique filters. Therefore, the strategy of channel sharing seems to be better suited for time series forecasting and filter designs, which is also validated in DLinear [12] and PatchTST [16].

Visualization of PredictionWe present a prediction showcase on ETH1 dataset, as shown in Figure 5. We select iTransformer [17], PatchTST [16] as the representative compared methods. Comparing with these different state-of-the-art models, we can observe FilterNet delivers the most accurate predictions of future series variations, which has demonstrated superior performance. In addition, we include more visualization cases and please refer to Appendix G.3.

Visualization of Frequency FiltersTo provide a comprehensive overview of the frequency response characteristics of frequency filters, we conduct visualization experiments on the Weather, ETH, and Traffic datasets with the lookback window length of 96 and the prediction length of 96. The frequency response characteristics of learned filters are visualized in Figure 7. From Figures 7(a) and 7(b), we can observe that compared with Transformer-based approaches (e.g., iTransformer [17], PatchTST [16]) tend to attenuate high-frequency components and preserve low-frequency information, FilterNet exhibits a more nuanced and adaptive filtering behavior that can be capable of attending to all frequency components. Figure 7(c) demonstrates that the main patterns of the Traffic dataset primarily resides in the low-frequency range. This observation also explains why iTransformer performs well on the Traffic dataset, despite its low-frequency nature. Overall, Figure 7 demonstrates

that FilterNet possesses comprehensive processing capabilities. Moreover, visualization experiments conducted on the ETTm1 dataset across various prediction lengths, as shown in Figure 8, further illustrate the extensive processing abilities of FilterNet. Additional results conducted on different lookback window lengths and prediction lengths can be found in Appendix G.2.

Efficiency AnalysisThe complexity of FilterNet is \(\mathcal{O}(\log L)\) where \(L\) is the input length. To comprehensively assess efficiency, we evaluate it based on two dimensions: memory usage and training time. Specifically, we choose two different sizes of datasets: the Exchange (8 variables, 7588 timestamps) and Electricity datasets (321 variables, 26304 timestamps). We compare the efficiency of our FilterNet with the representative Transformer- and MLP-based methods under the same settings (lookback window length of 96 and prediction length of 96), and the results are shown in Figure 6. It highlights that FilterNet surpasses other Transformer models, regardless of dataset size. While our approach exhibits similar efficiency to DLinear, our effective results outperform its performance. In Appendix E, we further conduct ablation studies to validate the rationale of FilterNet designs.

## 6 Conclusion Remarks

In this paper, we explore an interesting direction from a signal processing perspective and make a new attempt to apply frequency filters directly for time series forecasting. We propose a simple yet effective architecture, _FilterNet_, built upon our proposed two kinds of frequency filters to accomplish the forecasting. Our comprehensive empirical experiments on eight benchmarks have validated the superiority of our proposed method in terms of effectiveness and efficiency. We also include many careful and in-depth model analyses of FilterNet and the internal filters, which demonstrate many good properties. We hope this work can facilitate more future research integrating signal processing techniques or filtering processes with deep learning on time series modeling and accurate forecasting.

More Analysis about the Architecture of FilterNet

The Necessity of Instance Normalization BlockFrom the frequency perspective, the mean value is equal to zero frequency component. Specifically, given a signal \(x[n]\) with a length of \(N\), we can obtain its corresponding discrete Fourier transform \(\mathcal{X}[k]\) by:

\[\mathcal{X}[k]=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]e^{2\pi jnk/N}\] (10)

where \(j\) is the imaginary unit. We set \(k\) as 0 and then,

\[\begin{split}\mathcal{X}[0]&=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0 }^{N-1}x[n]e^{2\pi jn0/N}\\ &=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n].\end{split}\] (11)

According the above equation, we can find that the mean value \(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}x[n]\) in the time domain is equal to the zero frequency component \(\mathcal{X}[0]\) in the frequency domain. Similarly, we can also view the standard deviation from the frequency perspective, and it is related to the power spectral density.

According to these analysis, the instance normalization is analogous to a form of data preprocessing. Given that filters are primarily crafted to discern particular patterns within input data, while instance normalization aims to normalize each instance in a dataset, a function distinct from the conventional role of filters, we treat instance normalization as a distinct block within our FilterNet architecture.

Frequency Filter BlockRecently, Transformer- and MLP-based methods have emerged as the two main paradigms for time series forecasting, exhibiting competitive performance compared to other model architectures. Building on prior work that conceptualizes self-attention and MLP architectures as forms of global convolution [35; 13], it becomes apparent that frequency filters hold promise for time series forecasting tasks. Just as self-attention mechanisms capture global dependencies and MLPs learn to convolve features across the entire input space, frequency filters offer a means to extract and emphasize specific temporal patterns and trends from time series data. By applying frequency filters to time series data, we can learn recurring patterns, trends, and periodic behaviors that are essential for forecasting future time series data and making accurate predictions.

Feed-forward NetworkIncorporating a feed-forward network within the FilterNet architecture is essential for enhancing the model's capacity to capture complex relationships and non-linear patterns within the data. While frequency filters excel at extracting specific frequency components and temporal patterns from time series data, they may not fully capture the intricate dependencies and higher-order interactions present in real-world datasets [17]. By integrating a feed-forward network, the model gains the ability to learn hierarchical representations and abstract patterns from the input data, allowing it to capture more nuanced relationships and make more accurate predictions. This combination of frequency filters and a feed-forward network leverages the strengths of both approaches, enabling the model to effectively process and analyze time series data across different frequency bands while accommodating the diverse and often nonlinear nature of temporal dynamics. Overall, the inclusion of a feed-forward network enriches the expressive power of FilterNet, leading to improved forecasting performance and robustness across various domains.

## Appendix B Explanations about the Design of Two Filters

Self-attention mechanism is a highly data-dependent operation that both derives its parameters from data and subsequently applies these parameters back to the data. Concretely, given the input data \(X\), the self-attention can be formulated as:

\[\mathrm{SA}(Q,K,V)=\mathrm{softmax}(\frac{QK^{T}}{\sqrt{d_{k}}})V,\] (12)

where \(Q\) (queries), \(K\) (keys), and \(V\) (values) are linear transformations of the input data X, as:

\[Q=W_{Q}X,K=W_{K}X,V=W_{V}X,\] (13)where \(W_{Q}\), \(W_{K}\), and \(W_{V}\) are learned weight matrices. Since the values \(Q\), \(K\), and \(V\) are derived directly from the input data \(X\), the attention scores \(\mathrm{SA}\) are inherently dependent on the data.

Unlike self-attention mechanism that dynamically adapts to the input data during inference, MLPs maintain a consistent architecture regardless of the dataset characteristics. Specifically, for the input data \(X\), \(\mathrm{MLP}\) can be formulated as:

\[\mathrm{MLP}(X)=WX+b,\] (14)

where \(W\) are the learned weights and \(b\) are the learned biases. Once trained, the weights \(W\) and biases \(b\) remain static, meaning that they do not dynamically change in response to new data inputs.

MLPs are straightforward, less data-dependent models that apply fixed transformations to the input data, making them suitable for tasks with static relationships between the input data. In contrast, self-attention mechanisms are highly data-dependent, dynamically computing attention scores based on the input data to capture complex, context-specific dependencies, making them ideal for tasks requiring an understanding of sequential or structured data.

Inspired by the two paradigms, FilterNet designs two corresponding types of filters: plain shaping filters and contextual shaping filters. Plain shaping filters offer stability and efficiency, making them suitable for tasks with static relationships. In contrast, contextual shaping filters provide the flexibility to capture dynamic dependencies, excelling in tasks that require context-sensitive analysis. This dual approach allows FilterNet to effectively handle a wide range of data types and forecasting scenarios, combining the best aspects of both paradigms to achieve superior performance.

## Appendix C Experimental Details

### Datasets

We evaluate the performance of our proposed FilterNet on eight popular datasets, including Exchange, Weather, Traffic, Electricity, and ETT datasets. In detail, the Exchange2 dataset collects daily exchange rates of eight different countries including Singapore, Australia, British, Canada, Switzerland, China, Japan, and New Zealand ranging from 1990 to 2016. The Weather3 dataset, including 21 meteorological indicators such as air temperature and humidity, is collected every 10 minutes from the Weather Station of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry in 2020. The Traffic [15] dataset contains hourly traffic data measured by 862 sensors on San Francisco Bay area freeways, which has been collected since January 1, 2015. The Electricity4 dataset collects the hourly electricity consumption of 321 clients from 2012 to 2014. The ETT5 (Electricity Transformer Temperature) datasets contain two visions of the sub-dataset: ETTh and ETTm, collected from electricity transformers every 15 minutes and 1 hour between July 2016 and July 2018. Thus, in total we have 4 ETT datasets (ETTm1, ETTm2, ETTh1, and ETTh2) recording 7 features such as load and oil temperature. The details about these datasets are summarized in Table 3.

### Baselines

We choose twelve well-acknowledged and state-of-the-art models for comparison to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed FilterNet for time series forecasting, including Frequency-based models, TCN-based models, MLP-based models, and Transformer-based models. We introduce these models as follows:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Datasets & ETTh1 & ETTh2 & ETTm1 & ETTm2 & Electricity & Weather & Traffic & Exchange \\ \hline \hline Variables & 7 & 7 & 7 & 7 & 321 & 21 & 862 & 8 \\ Timesteps & 17420 & 17420 & 69680 & 69680 & 26304 & 52696 & 17544 & 7588 \\ Frequency & Hourly & Hourly & 15min & 15min & Hourly & 10min & Hourly & Daily \\ Information & Electricity & Electricity & Electricity & Electricity & Weather & Traffic & Economy \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The details of datasets.

**FireTS**[13] introduces a novel direction of applying MLPs in the frequency domain to effectively capture the underlying patterns of time series, benefiting from global view and energy compaction. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/aikunyi/FireTS. To ensure fair and objective comparison, the results showed in Table 4 are obtained using instance normalization instead of min-max normalization in the original code.

**FITS**[32] performs time series analysis through interpolation in the complex frequency domain, enjoying low cost with 10k parameters. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/VEWOXIC/FITS. Because its original paper doesn't provide the forecasting results with the fixed lookback length \(L=96\), we report the performance of FITS with lookback length \(L=96\) under five runs in Table 1.

**MICN**[39] employs multi-scale branch structure to model different potential patterns separately with linear complexity. It combines local features and global correlations to capture the overall view of time series. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/wanghq21/MICN. The experimental results showed in Table 4 follow its original paper.

**TimesNet**[40] transforms 1D time series into a set of 2D tensors based on multiple periods to analyse temporal variations. The above transformation allows the 2D-variations to be easily captured by 2D kernels with encoding the intraperiod- and interperiod-variations into the columns and rows of the 2D tensors respectively. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/thuml/TimesNet. The results showed in Table 1 follow iTransformer [17] and the results showed in Table 5 follow RLinear [23].

**DLinear**[12] utilizes a simple yet effective one-layer linear model to capture temporal relationships between input and output sequences. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/cure-lab/LTSF-Linear. We report the performance of DLinear with lookback length \(L\in\{96,336\}\) under five runs in Table 1 and 5.

**RLinear**[23] uses linear mapping to model periodic features in multivariate time series with robustness for diverse periods when increasing the input length. It applies RevIN (reversible normalization) and CI (Channel Independent) to improve overall forecasting performance by simplifying learning about periodicity. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/plumprc/RTSF. The experimental results showed in Table 1 follow iTransformer [17].

**Informer**[14] enhances Transformer with KL-divergence based ProbSparse attention for \(O(L\log L)\) complexity, efficiently encoding dependencies among variables and introducing a novel architecture with a DMS forecasting strategy. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020 and the experimental results showed in Table 4 follow FEDformer [25].

**Autoformer**[15] employs a deep decomposition architecture with auto-correlation mechanism to extract seasonal and trend components from input series, embedding the series decomposition block as an inner operator. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/thuml/Autoformer and the experimental results showed in Table 4 follow FEDformer [25].

**Pyraformer**[26] introduces pyramidal attention module (PAM) with an \(O(L)\) time and memory complexity where the inter-scale tree structure summarizes features at different resolutions and the intra-scale neighboring connections model the temporal dependencies of different ranges. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/ant-research/Pyraformer and the experimental results showed in Table 4 follow DLinear [12].

**FEDformer**[25] implements sparse attention with low-rank approximation in frequency domain, enjoying linear computational complexity and memory cost. And it proposes mixture of experts decomposition to control the distribution shifting. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/MAZiqing/FEDformer and the experimental results showed in Table 1 follow iTransformer [17].

**PatchTST**[16] divides time series data into subseries-level patches to extract local semantic information and adopts channel-independence strategy where each channel shares the same embedding and Transformer weights across all the series. The official implementation is available at https://github.com/yuqinie98/PatchTST. The experimental results showed in Table 1 follow iTransformer [17]. And because iTransformer doesn't provide the prediction results with lookback length \(L=336\), we report the performance of PatchTST with lookback length \(L=336\) under five runs in Table 5.

## Appendix G Visualizations

### Visualization of Channel-shared vs Channel-unique Filters

To further compare the channel-shared and channel-unique filters, we visualize the prediction values by the corresponding filters. The results are shown in Figure 11. The figure demonstrates that the values predicted by channel-shared filters closely align with the ground truth compared to those predicted by channel-unique filters. This observation is consistent with the findings presented in Table 2, indicating the superiority of channel-shared filters.

### Visualization of Frequency Filters

We further conduct visualization experiments to explore the learnable filters under different lookback window lengths and prediction lengths. The experiments are performed on the Electricity dataset, and the results are illustrated in Figure 12. These figures illustrate that FilterNet possesses full spectrum learning capability, as the learnable filters exhibit values across the entire spectrum. Besides, we observe that the frequency primarily concentrates in the low and middle ranges which explains that some works based on low-pass filters can also achieve good performance.

### Visualizations of Predictions

To further offer an evident comparison of our model with the state-of-the-art models, we present supplementary prediction showcases on ETTm1 dataset, and the results are shown in 13. We choose the following representative models, including iTransformer [17], PatchTST [16], and DLinear [12], as the baselines. Comparing with these different types of state-of-the-art models, FilterNet delivers the most accurate predictions of future series variations, demonstrating superior performance.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The main claims are clearly written in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed the limitation of our method in the conclusion remarks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: No theoretical proofs.

Justification:

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We included the implementation details in the main paper and the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will include the source data and code. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see implementation details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in the appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The average improvement of FilterNet over all baseline models is statistically significant at the confidence of 95%. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see implementation details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper is with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed the broader impact of time series forecasting in both abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not have this risk. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We included it in implementation details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: N/A. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: N/A. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: N/A. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
