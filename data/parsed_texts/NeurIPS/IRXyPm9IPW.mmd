###### Abstract

Recent studies have demonstrated the exceptional potentials of leveraging human preference datasets to refine text-to-image generative models, making it to generate more human-preferred images. Despite these advances, current human preference datasets are either prohibitively expensive to construct or suffer from a lack of diversity in preference dimensions, resulting in limited applicability for instruction tuning in open-source text-to-image generative models and hinder further exploration. To address these challenges, we first leverage multimodal large language models to create **VisionPrefer**, a fine-grained preference dataset that captures multiple preference aspects (prompt-following, aesthetic, fidelity, and harmlessness). Then we train a corresponding reward model, **VP-Score**, over VisionPrefer to guide the tuning of text-to-image generative models. The preference prediction accuracy of VP-Score is validated to be comparable to that of human annotators. To validate the effectiveness of VisionPrefer and VP-Score, we adopt two reinforcement learning methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), to supervised fine-tune generative models, and extensive experimental

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-image generative models [23; 21; 19; 26] have experienced rapid advancements in recent years. For example, large-scale text-to-image diffusion models, exemplified by Imagen [24] and DALL-E 2 [19], have demonstrated the capability to generate high-quality and creative images when provided with textual prompts. However, despite recent progress, current generative models still exhibit misalignment with human preferences, such as conflicts with text prompts or incorrect content [17]. A pivotal approach to addressing this issue is utilizing Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [16; 27; 1] to supervised fine-tune text-to-image generative models with preference data [13; 3; 5; 17].

Preference data is crucial for aligning generative models with text prompts. However, existing human-crafted preference datasets, such as HPD v2 [33; 32] and Pick-a-Pic [10], either provide only broad, general preference comparisons without fine-grained, accurate preference evaluations, or they are limited in size. Additionally, using humans for preference annotation is expensive and time-consuming, restricting progress in this research area.

Drawing inspiration from recent research utilizing AI-generated preference data as training supervise signal for Large Language Models (LLMs) alignment on Natural Language Processing domain [12; 2], we pose the following question:

_Can Multimodal Large Language Models act as a Human-Aligned Preference Annotator_

_for Text-to-Image Generation?_

These multimodal large language models (MLLMs), trained on web-scale text and text-image pairs, have already demonstrated formidable capabilities in image understanding. To this end, we first introduce VisionPrefer, a publicly available AI-generated dataset that features millions of finely-grained preferences concerning model-generated images. Compared with existing human preference datasets, VisionPrefer offers the following benefits:

* **Scalability & Low Cost**: As shown in Table 1, VisionPrefer encompasses 1.2 M preference choices across 179 K pairs of images, establishing it as the largest text-to-image generation preference dataset to date. Additionally, because VisionPrefer is annotated by MLLMs, it can be easily expanded further and the construction cost is significantly lower than human annotation.
* **Fine-grained preference**: To more accurately and diversely evaluate the preference scores of generated images, we carefully develop a detailed preference annotation guideline for MLLMs, which covers four distinct aspects: _Prompt-Following_, _Fidelity_, _Aesthetic_, and _Harmlessness_. The detail requirement for each aspect is presented at Table 3.
* **Comprehensive feedback formats**: Unlike existing benchmarks that provide only rankings or preference indices, our VisionPrefer not only provides preference rankings but also includes preference scores and textual explanations for the preference annotations from each aspect, which makes VisionPrefer more versatile, e.g., allowing it to serve as a textual guiding resource for image re-editing and refinement.

Building on the VisionPrefer, we conducted an extensive investigation into its most effective utilization. First, we developed a preference reward model named VP-Score optimized on VisionPrefer, trained to evaluate generated images based on their likelihood of being preferred by humans. Experimental results demonstrate that VP-Score exhibits a competitive correlation with human preferences compared to existing human preference reward models. Moreover, we employ two reinforcement learning methods, Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), to enhance generative models to better align with human preferences. As illustrated in Figure 1, VisionPrefer markedly enhances text-image alignment in compositional image generation across diverse aspects, such as aesthetics. In summary, our contributions are as follows:* We construct VisionPrefer, a large-scale, high-quality, and fine-grained preference dataset for text-to-image generative alignment. Compared with existing preference datasets, VisionPrefer has the advantages of scalability, fine-grained annotations, and comprehensive feedback format.
* Based on VisionPrefer, we propose a reward model, VP-Score, which achieves a competitive correlation with human preferences with other automated human preference metrics.
* Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of both VisionPrefer and VP-Score. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of them to gain a deeper understanding of how AI-generated synthetic data and models trained on such data impact future research in this domain.

## 2 Related Work

**Text-to-Image Generative Models Alignment.** While existing text-to-image generative models often generate images that do not closely match human preferences, thus alignment in the context of diffusion has garnered increasing attention [28; 10; 5; 17; 28]. There are two main types of text-to-image generative models alignment algorithms: (i) _Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)_. For example, reward weighted method [13] first explores using human feedback to align text-to-image models with human preference. ReFL [34] trains a reward model, ImageNetward, using human preferences and subsequently utilizes it for fine-tuning. (i) _Direct Policy Optimization (DPO)_. DPOK [7] fine-tunes text-to-image diffusion models by using policy gradient to maximize the feedback-trained reward. ZO-RankSGD [28] optimizes diffusion in an online fashion with human ranking feedback. RAFT [5] and AlignProp [17] tune the generative model to directly increase the reward of generated images. Several manually annotated preference datasets are proposed to support above algorithms [32; 34; 10]. Their overall statistics are shown in Table 1. These manually annotated data have two drawbacks. First, manual annotation need heavy cost, leading to a small-size set. Second, manual annotations are prone to specific biases [32].

**Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback.**[2] introduced the idea of Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), which used LLM-labeled preferences in conjunction with human-labeled preferences to jointly optimize for the two objectives of helpfulness and harmlessness. Recent works have also explored related techniques for generating rewards from LLMs [20; 11; 35]. These works demonstrate that LLMs can generate useful signals for reinforcement learning fine-tuning. However, RLAIF for text-to-image generative model alignment is less explored. [30] leveraged MLLMs to assess the alignment between generated images and input texts, focusing on aspects like object number and spatial relationship. T2I-CompBench [9] utilized MLLMs like BLIP-VQA to evaluate the text-to-Image generative models. Our work diverges from previous works in two principal ways. (1) Previous approaches provided limited data, sometimes even less than what's annotated manually (e.g., 6K in [9]). (2) Prior methods had limited aspects in alignment, lacking consideration for aspects such as fidelity [30].

## 3 VisionPrefer

We introduce VisionPrefer, a fine-grained preference dataset constructed by collecting feedback from MLLMs annotators. The collection pipeline of VisionPrefer is shown in Figure 2, which mainly consists of three steps: prompt generation, image generation and preference generation.

**Step-1: Prompt Generation.** We generate prompts based on DiffusionDB [29], a large-scale text-to-image prompt benchmark containing 1.5M user-written prompts following two steps: (1) Polish. As discussed in [32], a significant portion of the prompts in the DiffusionDB is biased towards certain

\begin{table}

\end{table}

styles (e.g., "Greg Rutkowski" appears in around 15% of prompts). We utilize GPT-4 to polish prompts in DiffusionDB to obtain unbiased prompts following instructions shown in Appendix F.1. (2) NSFW Filting. We employ state-of-the-art NSFW detectors [8] to compute an NSFW score for each prompt and filter out prompts that exceed a certain threshold, following [29]. After these two steps, we combine both polished prompts and the original prompts in DiffusionDB as our final prompt benchmark, which contains 179K prompts.

**Step-2: Image Generation.** We generate images using different text-to-image generative models (see details in Appendix C.2) by sampling textual prompts constructed in Step-1 as input. For each prompt, we generate four images by randomly selecting different generative models from the model pools with different classifier-free guidance scale values, to ensure high diversity. This diversity allows for a comprehensive evaluation of a preference prediction model's generalization capability and facilitates the training of a more generalizable model. Finally, we obtain 0.716M images.

**Step-3: Preference Generation.** We employ state-of-the-art multimodal large language model, GPT-4 V, to provide three types of feedback: (1) _Scalar scores_ that indicate the fine-grained quality regarding multiple aspects, (2) _Preference ranking_ according to the scalar scores, and (3) _Textual explanations_ that give detailed guidance on how to improve the completion, encompassing four distinct fine-grained aspects namely: _Prompt-Following_, _Aesthetic_, _Fidelity_, and _Harmlessness_ for each generated image (See the example in Table 12). Detailed input instructions for GPT-4 V to annotate preference labels are in Appendix F.2. Finally, we obtain 1.2M preference choices.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we first train a corresponding reward model named VP-Score and evaluate it on existing human-preference datasets (SS 4.1). Next, we enhance existing text-to-image generative models by adopting two reinforcement learning algorithms (SS 4.2) to validate the efficacy of VisionPrefer and VP-Score. After that, we design a simple pipeline to edit generated images with the textual explanations in VisionPrefer(SS 4.3).

### Reward Modeling

**Training Setting.** We train the VP-Score over VisionPrefer. VP-Score adopts the same model structure as ImageReward [34], which is a open-source human-preference reward model and utilizes BLIP [14] as the backbone. Similarly to training the reward model for the language model [27, 16], we formulate the preference annotations in VisionPrefer as rankings. Specifically, we employ the average scores of each sample in VisionPrefer across four aspects as the final preference score, and then we have \(k\) images ranked generated by the same prompt \(\mathbf{T}\) according to final preference score (the best to the worst are denoted as \(\mathbf{x}_{1}\succ\mathbf{x}_{2}\succ...\succ\mathbf{x}_{k}\)). For each comparison, if \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) is better and \(\mathbf{x}_{j}\) is worse, the loss function can be formulated as:

\[\text{loss}(\theta)=-\mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{T},\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{x}_{j}) \sim\mathcal{D}}\left[\log\left(\sigma\left(f_{\theta}\left(\mathbf{T}, \mathbf{x}_{i}\right)-f_{\theta}\left(\mathbf{T},\mathbf{x}_{j}\right)\right) \right)\right] \tag{1}\]

where \(f_{\theta}(\mathbf{T},\mathbf{x})\) is a scalar value of reward model for prompt \(\mathbf{T}\) and image \(\mathbf{x}\).

**Evaluation Results.** We evaluate the preference prediction accuracy on the test sets among three human preference datasets: ImageRewardDB [34], HPD v2 [32] and Pick-a-Pic [10]. Furthermore,

Figure 2: VisionPrefer construction pipeline. We sample textual prompts and text-to-image generative models from pools to generate diverse comparison data, then query GPT-4 V with detailed illustrations for fine-grained and high-quality annotations in both textual and numerical formats.

to better demonstrate the model's generalization performance, we computed the harmonic mean of accuracy across three sets for each model as an overall indicator of model performance. We use the CLIP score [18], BLIP score [14], Aesthetic score [25], ImageReward [34], HPS [33], HPS v2 [32] and PickScore [10] as baselines to compare with the VP-Score.

The results are presented at Table 2. Our VP-Score demonstrates strong competitiveness compared to the current state-of-the-art reward models trained on human preference data. It achieves the second-best average performance among all preference reward models, following only HPS v2. Moreover, our model achieves optimal performance on the ImageRewardDB dataset, achieving a 0.6 performance gain compared to HPS v2. These results validate that leveraging fine-grained feedback provided by MLLMs enables learning a proficient human preference reward model.

### Fine-tuning Text-to-Image Generative Models

We aim to leverage the constructed preference dataset to align the performance of generative models more closely with human preferences. We utilize two popular reinforcement learning methods for fine-tuning: (1) Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), where select ReFL [34] as our PPO implementation to adjust the generative model. (2) Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which allows for direct model fine-tuning using preference data without a reward model, employing D3PO [36] as our DPO implementation. We use Stable Diffusion v1.5 [22] as the text-to-image generative model.

**Training Setting.** For PPO experiments, we randomly sample 20,000 real user prompts from DiffusionDB [29] and 10,000 prompts in ImageRewardDB [34] as the training dataset. We compare VP-Score against five open-source reward models, including ImageReward [34], PickScore [10], and HPS v2 [32], all trained on large-scale preference datasets (see Table 1). All models are fine-tuned with identical data and settings for consistency. For DPO experiments, we compare our VisionPrefer along with three open-source large-scale human-annotated preference datasets, ImageRewardDB [34], HPD [33] and Pick-a-Pic [10] (see in Table 1). Notably, VisionPrefer scores are averaged across four aspects for fine-tuning, with an analysis on individual aspect scores presented in SS 5. Both PPO and DPO use the same test benchmarks: 400 real user prompts from DiffusionDB [29], 200 prompts from ImageRewardDB [34] and 400 prompts from HPD v2 [33]. Further details are in Appendix D.

**PPO Results.** First, we visualize the evolution of various metrics as the model training steps increase when using our VP-Score as the reward function at Figure 3. As training progresses, all metrics, including human preference metrics like HPS v2, show an increasing trend. This indicates consistency

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Model & ImageRewardDB & HPD v2 & Pick-a-Pic & Average \\ \hline CLIP ViT-H/14 [18] & 57.1 & 65.1 & 60.8 & 60.82 \\ Aesthetic [25] & 57.4 & 76.8 & 56.8 & 62.44 \\ ImageReward [34] & 65.1 & 74.0 & 61.1 & 66.31 \\ HPS [33] & 61.2 & 77.6 & 66.7 & 67.84 \\ PPickScore [10] & 62.9 & 79.8 & **70.5** & 70.40 \\ HPS v2 [32] & 65.7 & **83.3** & 67.4 & **71.32** \\ VP-Score & **66.3** & 79.4 & 67.1 & 20.46 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

between our VP-Score and other human preference metrics, demonstrating that VP-Score reliably aligns generative model outputs with human preferences.

Then, we conduct a human preference study. Specifically, we use these fine-tuned generative models to generate 64 images for each prompt in evaluation dataset, followed by a top-3 selection by the corresponding reward models. Finally, ten human annotators rank these selected images. The results are presented at Figure 4, detailed win count and win rates can be found in Table 4. We observed that VP-Score fine-tuned generative model's Win+Tie ratio exceeds 50% when compared to all other models across all three test benchmarks, including some trained on large-scale human preference datasets like HPS v2. This suggests that, compared to other human preference reward model, VP-Score can serve as a reliable and competitive reward model for fine-tuning generative models to produce outputs closer to human preferences. This further underscores the effectiveness and competitiveness of VisionPrefer.

The corresponding qualitative results shown at Figure 5 demonstrate that VisionPrefer fine-tuned generative model can generate images that are more aligned to text and with higher fidelity and avoid toxic contents. More qualitative results can be found in Figure 13.

**DPO Results.** We conduct a human preference study using the same procedure as PPO experiments at Figure 6, detailed win count and win rates can be found in Table 5. We found that the Win+Tie ratio of the generative model optimized on our VisionPrefer, when compared to the other three large-scale human datasets, exceeds 50%, substantiating the competitiveness of our VisionPrefer against human-annotated preference data. We show the qualitative results in Figure 7. The results indicate that fine-tuning the generative model directly on our VisionPrefer using DPO yields performance comparable to that of fine-tuning the generative model on large-scale human-annotated preference dataset (e.g., Pick-a-Pick). Specifically, the generated results are more aligned with human preferences, exhibiting increased visual detail, better conformity to input prompts. More qualitative results can be found in Figure 14. These experimental outcomes collectively affirm the efficacy of using preference data generated by MLLMs.

### Editing Generated Images with VisionPrefer

Unlike existing preference datasets, our VisionPrefer not only provides preference rankings and scores for images but also includes corresponding textual explanations. This makes VisionPrefer

more versatile, enabling applications such as editing images based on textual explanations to better align with human preferences.

We design an image editing pipeline as in Figure 8, which contains two main steps: (1) Integrate the textual explanations from VisionPrefer into a specific prompt template and input it into LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), encouraging the LLMs to output one or more concise editing instructions to address the issues raised in the textual explanations. (2) Input these generated editing instructions into an image editing model (e.g., InstructPix2Pix [4]), guiding it to edit images and address issues. This pipeline is simple in structure and can perform better by substituting more advanced LLMs and editing models.

**Training Setting.** To explore the effectiveness of the textual explanations provided by VisionPrefer, we randomly selected 200 text-image pairs with scores below 3 (out of a maximum score of 5) as test cases. Following the outlined process, we performed image edits and evaluate the results before and after editing using existing reward models and conducted human studies with 10 participants.

**Results.** The evaluation results for images before and after editing are summarized in Figure 9. We found that both the reward models and human studies indicate a Win ratio > 50%, demonstrating that the edited images are superior to the original ones. This also validates the effectiveness of the textual explanations provided by VisionPrefer and the design of our pipeline.

## 5 Analysis

**Which MLLMs is the Best Annotator?**

The annotation of VisionPrefer heavily relies on GPT-4 V. Although many researchers pointed out that GPT-4 V capable of providing meticulous judgments and feedback [31, 6], we still concern whether the GPT-4 V preferences are qualified. We then conduct a probing experiment by utilizing different MLLMs, GPT-4 V, Gemini-pro-V and LLaVA 1.6-34B, to provide their preference on two existing human-preference datasets (HPD [33] and ImageRewardDB [34]). The corresponding pair-wise preference prediction accuracy is shown in Figure 10 (a). We observed that the accuracy

Figure 8: Overview of the proposed image editing pipeline with the textual explanations in VisionPrefer.

Figure 7: Qualitative results for DPO experiments. SD 1.5 denotes the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model without any fine-tune. See Appendix for more samples.

of GPT-4 V surpasses that of both LLaVA 1.6-34B and Gemini-pro-V on both datasets, achieving accuracy rates exceeding or approaching 70%, and LLaVA 1.6-34B notably scoring significantly lower than the former two. According to previous research [6, 32], the agreement rate between qualified human annotators is also around 70% (65.3% for ImageRewardDB and 78.1% for HPD). Therefore, the probing experiment validates that GPT-4 V can be a well human-aligned annotator, thus ensure the quality and reliability of our VisionPrefer.

To further validate the efficacy on preference annotation ability of GPT-4 V, we utilize Gemini-pro-V and LLaVA 1.6-34B to collect similar amount of data (1.2 M pair-wise preference choices) following the same collection pipeline described in Section 3. Then we train the corresponding reward model on these two datasets and show the performance in Figure 10 (b). As we can see, consistent with the aforementioned conclusion, the testing accuracy of the reward model trained on data annotated by GPT-4 V exhibits the highest performance, followed by Gemini-pro-V. This demonstrates that GPT-4 V is currently the most proficient annotator for text-to-image generation.

**Encouraging GPT-4 V(ision) for Enhanced Annotations.**

* **Prompt Manner.** As described in Section 3, during the construction of VisionPrefer, we encourage GPT-4 V to directly output scores for various aspects (e.g., aesthetic) of each image (denoted as score feedback). Another straightforward prompting manner (denoted as rank feedback) is encourage GPT-4 V to directly provide a ranking of images (\(\alpha\) and \(\beta\)) in a certain aspect (i.e., \(\alpha\succ\beta\), \(\beta\succ\alpha\), or \(\alpha=\beta\)). It is interesting to explore which prompting manner is best suit for AI Annotators. We randomly sampled 1,000 samples from ImageRewardDB and 500 samples from HPD, and utilized the two aforementioned prompt manners to ascertain GPT-4 V's annotations. The results are presented at Figure 10 (c), we observe that in both datasets, the accuracy achieved using score feedback is higher than that achieved using rank feedback.
* **Temperature \(\tau\).** Temperature \(\tau\) is a hyperparameter used in multimodal large language models (e.g., GPT-4 V) to control the randomness and creativity of the generated results. A lower value of the temperature parameter will lead to a more predictable and deterministic output, while a higher value will produce a more random and surprising output. We investigate the influence of the variation in \(\tau\) on both the accuracy of annotation and annotation consistency (where the same input yields identical annotation results). The results are shown in Figure 10 (d), we observe a decrease in accuracy as \(\tau\) increases, indicating that lower values of \(\tau\) should be set when conducting preference annotations. Furthermore, as \(\tau\) increases, annotation consistency continues to decline, which is sensible because more randomness in the results leads to different preference outcomes for identical inputs over time.

**Fine-Grained Feedback Leads to Better Results.**

* **Better Reward Modeling.** In our previous experiments, we used the average score of each sample across four evaluation aspects as the final preference score for modeling reward or optimizing generation models. Here, we explore the impact of separately modeling the four evaluation aspects. We first train four reward models on these four different aspect in VisionPrefer, namely VP-Score-P,

Figure 10: (a) Pair-wise preference prediction accuracy comparison across three MLLMs on two human-preference datasets (b) Results of preference prediction accuracy for reward models trained on preference datasets annotated by different MLLMs annotators. (c) Preference prediction accuracy for score feedback and ranking feedback. (d) Visualization depicting the variation of annotation accuracy and consistency with changes in temperature \(\tau\). (e) Preference prediction accuracy among reward models trained on different aspects of preference data in VisionPrefer.

VP-Score-A, VP-Score-F and VP-Score-H, respectively. The corresponding preference accuracy are presented at Figure 10(e). We can observe that the accuracy of reward models individually trained using a single aspect preference data is consistently lower than VP-Score, which validates the effectiveness of our approach in designing four evaluation aspects to model the preference level.
* **Better Prompt-Following.** We found fine-grained preference data enables our fine-tuned model to generate images that better adhere to the input prompt. For instance, as shown in Figure 11, the top-3 sampled images generated from our fine-tuned model all satisfy the "holding" prompt requirement, whereas only HPS v2 among baseline models achieves this.
* **More Aesthetically Pleasing.** Fine-grained data enhances the visual appeal and vividness of images generated by our model. As shown in Figure 12, our results exhibit enhanced luminosity, dynamic sensation, and increased detail, aligning more closely with human aesthetic preferences.
* **Enhance Image Safety.**Using unsafe prompts from [36], we generated 1K images and assessed safety using the Diffusion library's NSFW detector. The NSFW ratio for models fine-tuned with VP-Score (4.4%) was substantially lower compared to HPS v2 (21.1%) and PickScore (22.3%) fine-tuned models, indicating our preference scoring's effectiveness in reducing harmful content generation.

**More related details and ablation studies about the effectiveness of fine-grained feedback can be found in Appendix B**.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we explore utilizing MLLMs to construct a large-scale high-quality feedback dataset, VisionPrefer, for diffusion models alignment and refining. Costly experiments conducted across various experimental settings have validated the efficacy of VisionPrefer. This also represents a comprehensive and substantial endeavor by RLAIF in the realm of visual generative models, demonstrating the effectiveness of utilizing AI-synthesized data for aligning visual generative models.

Efficiency of Fine-Grained Feedback

In this section, we present additional ablation studies and qualitative results to validate the efficacy of fine-grained feedback design.

### Better Prompt-Following.

To further substantiate that "Prompt-Following" rating labels in VisionPrefer can enhance the ability of fine-tuned models to generate images that more accurately align with the input prompts, we removed the "Prompt-Following" rating labels from the VisionPrefer, preserving labels for the other three aspects, and train a reward model, which we named VP-Score\({}^{\dagger}\). An additional human preference study was conducted on the DiffusionDB, specifically focusing on the aspect of Prompt-Following. The outcomes, presented in Table 7, indicate two key findings: Firstly, VP-Score exhibits competitive performance in comparison to HPS v2. Secondly, the efficacy of VP-Score\({}^{\dagger}\) experiences a notable decline with the omission of Prompt-Following rating labels. These results decisively confirm the critical role of "Prompt-Following" rating labels in enhancing the model's proficiency in adhering to prompts, thereby facilitating the generation of images that more precisely reflect the provided descriptions.

Besides, we provide additional visualization results in Figure 17 to validate that generative models guided by VP-Score are capable of producing images that more closely adhere to the descriptions provided in the prompts.

### More Aesthetically Pleasing.

Similar to the last section, we removed the "Aesthetic" rating labels from the VisionPrefer and trained a reward model named VP-Score\({}^{\clubsuit}\). Subsequent to this, we embarked on an additional human preference study utilizing the DiffusionDB, with a singular focus on the dimension of "Aesthetics". The findings, elucidated in Table 8, revealed that VisionPrefer achieved the best performance, while the exclusion of aesthetic labels markedly diminished the operational efficiency of VP-Score\({}^{\clubsuit}\). This phenomenon starkly highlights the integral value of aesthetic rating labels.

Further, we showcase additional visual outcomes in Figure 18. Our observations indicate that generative models refined under the auspices of VP-Score manifest the capacity to engender imagery replete with more vibrant detail and sophisticated interplays of light and shadow.

### Reduce Image Distortion.

To ascertain the impact of "Fidelity" rating labels, we excised these labels from the VisionPrefer and subsequently trained a reward model VP-Score\({}^{\diamondsuit}\). A human preference study, concentrated solely on the "Fidelity" aspect, is documented in Table 9. This study utilized the "anything" prompts delineated in [36], encompassing 442 prompts, as the evaluation benchmark. The outcomes illustrate that generative models guided by our VP-Score manifest competitive performance. In contrast, VP-Score\({}^{\diamondsuit}\) exhibits a discernible performance decrement relative to VP-Score.

Additionally, the visualization results showcased in Figure 19 demonstrate that models optimized under the guidance of VP-Score excel in producing images with diminished distortion, e.g., less distortion of human hands. Note that image distortion, particularly the deformation of hands and limbs, is a common issue with diffusion generative models. Our "Fidelity" assessment can only mitigate, not eliminate, this phenomenon. Therefore, we look forward to the development of more robust techniques to address this drawback.

### Enhance Image Safety.

Similarly, we removed the "Harmlessness" labels from the VisionPrefer and trained a corresponding reward model named VP-Score\({}^{\spadesuit}\). Then we employ unsafe prompts provided in [36] to generate 1K images and utilize the built-in NSFW detector in the diffusion library1 to quantify the frequency of generating harmful content. Detailed results is presented in Figure 16. We find that VP-Score\({}^{\clubsuit}\), trained without the "Harmlessness rating" labels, exhibited a significant increase in the NSFW ratio

Figure 17: Fine-grained feedback enhances the alignment of generated content with the input prompts. For instance, in the first column of the figure, only the generative model optimized under the guidance of VP-Score accurately produces a face that adheres to the description of being ’crafted from the tree’s bark.’ In the second column, solely the VP-Score-guided generative model successfully constructs the image of a pirate, whereas the other models merely generate images of pirate ships. SD 1.5 denotes the Stable Diffusion v1.5 model without any fine-tune.

Statistics of VisionPrefer

In this section, we provide more details of VisionPrefer. We encourage readers to delve into Section C.3, where we analyze the characteristics of preferences generated by GPT-4 V. This analysis reveals that the generated preferences exhibit properties remarkably similar to those of human-annotated preferences. Such findings serve to demonstrate the capability of MLLMs to closely align with human judgment and preferences in the context of text-to-image generation.

### Prompts.

A key step in VisionPrefer contruction pipeline is utilizing GPT-4 to polish the existing prompt benchmarks. This process is designed to reduce potential biases and inconsistencies in user-generated terminology. We present examples of original prompts alongside their polished counterparts at Table 10, and quantitatively illustrates the frequency distribution of certain stylistic words and conflicting prompts at Figure 20. Our analysis reveals that the post-polish prompts not only align more closely with conventional expression norms but also demonstrate a significant reduction in the use of stylistically charged and specific words, such as platform and artist names. Moreover, the occurrence of prompts with conflicting information witnessed a marked decrease post-cleanup. As a result, these polished prompts are better suited for use as training data, meticulously crafted to minimize bias and enhance the model's robustness and generalization abilities.

### Images.

Within VisionPrefer, images are generated by employing four state-of-the-art text-to-image generative models. These models are ranked as the top four on the Hugging Face leaderboard, specifically: Stable Diffusion v1-52, Stable Diffusion 2.13, Dreamlike Photoreal 2.054, Stable Diffusion XL5. Detailed descriptions of these models and the distribution of images generated by each within our dataset are methodically outlined in Table 11. For illustrative purposes, Figure 21 showcases representative images produced by each of these models.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline

\end{table}
Table 11: Image sources of VisionPrefer.

Figure 22: Distribution of GPT-4 V’s scoring across four aspects in VisionPrefer.

### Preferences.

All preferences in VisionPrefer were generated using GPT-4 V API. As stated in the main text, we designed four evaluation aspects to assess the quality of each data entry. For each aspect, we individually invoked the GPT-4 V API to generate the corresponding preferences, the corresponding prompts regarding to these four aspects can be found depicted in Section F.2. Please refer to Table 12 to see some annotation examples.

We illustrate the distribution of GPT-4 V's ratings across four distinct aspects within VisionPrefer in Figure 22. Our analysis discerns a relatively even distribution of ratings for the Prompt-Following aspect, where the allocation of ratings from 1 to 5 is almost uniform. Conversely, in the domains of Fidelity and Harmlessness, GPT-4 V exhibits a propensity towards assigning the highest rating of 5 to a predominant share of the samples. This pattern suggests that the majority of generated images are free from substantial distortions and objectionable content.

VisionPrefer offers a unique opportunity to leverage GPT-4 V' preferences for unbiased analysis. A critical step in the construction of VisionPrefer is the random application of class-free guidance values (from 3 to 12), aiming to enhance the generalization of VisionPrefer. We analyze the impact of changing the class-free guidance values of Stable Diffusion XL on its performance. For each guidance value, we compute the win ratio, representing the percentage of judgments where its use led to a preferred image. We also calculate the corresponding tie and lose ratios for each scale, enabling a detailed analysis of which classifier-free guidance scales are more effective. The results are presented at Figure 23 (a), and we find higher guidance value always lead to a higher win rate, e.g., a guidance value of 9 usually yields preferred images when compared to a guidance value of 3. _This conclusion is in well agreement with the conclusions obtained in the human-annotated preference dataset [10]_.

Additionally, by comparing preferences for images generated by different generative models in response to identical prompts, we are able to identify the model that is more favorably rated by GPT-4 V. For instance, considering judgments in which one image was generated by Dreamlike Photoreal 2.05 and the other by Stable Diffusion 2.1, we can evaluate which model is more performant. As shown in Figure 23 (b), we find that GPT-4 V typically exhibits a preference for Dreamlike Photoreal 2.05 over Stable Diffusion 2.1. _This preference aligns with the characteristics of human-annotated preference data [10], demonstrating a consistency between the MLLMs generated preferences and human judgment._

**Rating**: 3

**Rationale**: The image displays architecture with a slightly more complex design, deviating from strict minimalism. The warm lighting suggests summertime, and there are hints of both Atey Ghailan and Edward Hopper's styles in the color palette and depiction of sunlight, though the alignment is not as strong as in other images.

**Rating**: 5

**Rationale**: This image strongly aligns with the input text, featuring a minimalist architectural scene with a clear influence of Edward Hopper's style in the composition and use of light. The simplicity and color choice also reflect the summer theme and Atey mood.

**Rating**: 5

**Rationale**: The image depicts a minimalist house with the colors are rich and vibrant. The stylc is very reminiscent of Atey Ghailan’s work, with its simple shapes and warm colors. No errors are present.

**Rating**: 4

**Rationale**: The image is minimalist and the image has a clear, crisp style similar to Edward Hopper's work. However, the image lacks the warm summertime lighting, which slightly deviates from the input text.

**Rating**: 5

**Rationale**: The image is minimalist and the image has a clear, crisp style similar to Edward Hopper's work. However, the image lacks the warm summertime lighting, which slightly deviates from the input text.

Training Details

### Reward Model Training

Following [34], we load the pre-trained checkpoint of BLIP (ViT-L for image encoder, 12-layers transformer for text encoder) as the backbone of VP-Score, and initialize MLP head according to \(\mathcal{N}(0,1/(d_{model}+1))\) decaying the learning rate with a cosine schedule. To avoid the overfitting of reward model during training phase and reach up to the best preference accuracy, VP-Score is fixed 70% of transformer layers and is trained on 4 \(\times\) 32 GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs, with a per-GPU batch size of 16.

### Boosting Generative Models

**PPO.** Following the setting in ReFL [34], we fine-tuned all text-to-image generative models employing the PNDM noise scheduler and half-precision computation on an array of 8 \(\times\) 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs. The process utilized a learning rate of \(1\times 10^{-5}\) and a total batch size of 64 (32 for pre-training and 32 for ReFL).

**DPO.** Following the setting in [36], we conducted a total of 400 epochs during the training process, utilizing a learning rate of \(3\times 10^{-5}\) and the Adam optimizer, alongside half-precision computation. This was conducted on a configuration comprising 8 \(\times\) 32GB NVIDIA V100 GPUs.

## Appendix E Cost of VisionPrefer Construction

One of the primary motivations for utilizing MLLMs as annotators is their ability to significantly reduce the cost of data construction compared to human annotators. Take construction process of the two largest existing human preference datasets as an example, during the construction process of Pick-a-Pic [10], approximately 6,394 web users participated in tagging images with their preferences. For the development of HPD v2 [32], a total of 57 high-quality annotation experts were employed and trained to construct preference labels. Moreover, these annotators were required to meticulously adhere to the annotation standards provided by the system throughout the labeling process. Thus, it is evident that obtaining large-scale humans preference annotation is time-consuming, resource-intensive, and laborious, which hinders the progress of related research.

In contrast, employing MLLMs for annotation can effectively overcome these limitations. Utilizing the construction process of VisionPrefer as an example, each invocation of the GPT-4 V API is capable of tagging four images with preference labels pertaining to a specific aspect (e.g., prompt-following aspect), meaning a single API call can generate \(C_{4}^{2}\) preference ranking results in that aspect. Throughout the construction of VisionPrefer, each GPT-4 V API can accommodate approximately 10,000 requests per day, thus generating around 60,000 preference ranking results in a given aspect per day. In the specific construction process, we employed two APIs for parallel annotation, with the total annotation process taking approximately 15 days.

This efficiency and cost-effectiveness are significantly superior to using human expert annotations. Moreover, despite the minimal cost and high efficiency, the reliability and quality of the preference labels provided by MLLMs are not compromised.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper includes our motivation, preference data construction details, experimental settings, quantitative experimental results, and qualitative visual examples that reflect and justify the claims in our abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The analysis section contains a discussion of limitations in our work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We state the reference before illustrating formulations.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide a detailed description of the dataset construction process, implementation for training the reward model, and offer a multitude of visualization examples. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We will public our data and code upon paper acceptance, due to the management regulations of our institution. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Full training and testing details are in SS4 and Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: It would take too long with our available computational resources to repeat all experiments multiple times. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the name of GPU we used for experiments in Setup. We include extra cost in Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: All relevant human questions and relevant datasets have been checked for privacy compliance prior to experiments and submission. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our work supports the alignment of generative models with human values, and its societal impact is discussed in the introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our contribution does not include new datasets or pre-trained models that pose a risk of misuse. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code that we derive from earlier work is properly licensed and referenced. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide detailed illustration of new data benchmark and visualized examples. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [No] Justification: We only recruited participants for user experiments to validate the effectiveness of our model, where they were asked to choose from generated images. No human participants were involved in the dataset construction or model training process. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our experiment solely involves measurement and does not entail behavioral manipulation; therefore, we did not apply for IRB approval. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
