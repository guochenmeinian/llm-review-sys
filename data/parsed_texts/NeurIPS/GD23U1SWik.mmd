###### Abstract

We employ an inversion-based approach to examine CLIP models. Our examination reveals that inverting CLIP models results in the generation of images that exhibit semantic alignment with the specified target prompts. We leverage these inverted images to gain insights into various aspects of CLIP models, such as their ability to blend concepts and inclusion of gender biases. We notably observe instances of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) images during model inversion. This phenomenon occurs even for semantically innocuous prompts, like 'a beautiful landscape,' as well as for prompts involving the names of celebrities.

**Warning**: This paper contains sexually explicit images and language, offensive visuals and terminology, discussions on pornography, gender bias, and other potentially unsettling, distressing, and/or offensive content for certain readers.

## 1 Introduction

CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) models (Radford et al., 2021) have gained significant attention in the field of artificial intelligence. Serving as a link between textual and visual data, these

Figure 1: Inverted Images from CLIP. Prompts from left to right: “Floating castle held by balloons in the sky,” “Panda mad scientist mixing sparkling chemicals,” “Johnny Depp,” “An astronaut exploring an alien planet, discovering a mysterious ancient artifact,” “A mechanic in the busy auto repair shop,” “A shiba inu wearing a beret and black turtleneck,” “Enchanted forest with watching tree eyes,” “A bustling market in a bustling city, showcasing diverse cultures and exotic goods”models have found application in numerous deep learning contexts (Nichol et al., 2021), (Rombach et al., 2022), (Chegini and Feizi, 2023)). They not only demonstrate zero-shot performance comparable to fully supervised classification models but also exhibit resilience to distribution shifts. A key factor contributing to this resilience is their training on extensive web-scale datasets, which exposes them to a diverse array of signals within the input data.

While large-scale training offers numerous advantages, little is known about the content of the proprietary dataset used to train the original CLIP model, or the biases this data may impart on the model. Despite prior exploration into the knowledge acquired by CLIP models (Ghiasi et al., 2022), (Goh et al., 2021), our work is the first attempt to analyze them through the lens of model inversion.

Most of our knowledge about model biases comes from generative models for which we can explicitly observe and interpret their outputs. But how do we study the knowledge of a non-generative model like CLIP? _Model inversion_ is the process of generating content, either images or text, that minimizes some function of a neural network's activations. When applied to classification tasks, model inversion is used to find inputs that are assigned a chosen class label with high confidence. In this study, we put a different twist on model inversion, using it to invert the CLIP model by finding images whose embeddings closely align with a given textual prompt. Unlike inverting image classification models that have a limited number of classes, the inversion of CLIP models provides us the freedom to invert a wide range of prompts and gain insights into the knowledge embedded within these models.

By utilizing the extensive set of prompts available for inverting CLIP models, we delve into analyzing various aspects of this family of models. Our contributions are summarized as follows: **I.** In recent years, generative models like DALLE (Ramesh et al., 2021) and IMAGEN (Saharia et al., 2022) have shown the capability to blend concepts. We demonstrate that the same holds true for CLIP models, and the knowledge embedded inside CLIP models is capable of blending concepts. **II.** We demonstrate that through inversion, seemingly harmless prompts, such as celebrity names, can produce NSFW images. This is particularly true for women celebrities, who the CLIP model seems to strongly associated with sexual content. Certain identities, like "Dakota Johnson", are close to many NSFW words in the embedding space. This may be problematic since the embeddings of CLIP models are being used in many text-to-image generative models. Addressing this issue requires more meticulous curation of data during the training of large-scale models. **III.** We demonstrate that CLIP models display gender bias in their knowledge through inversions applied to prompts related to professions, status, parental roles, and educational pursuits. **IV.** We investigate the scale of the training data on the quality of the inversions, and we show that more training data leads to better inversions. **V.** Finally, we examine the presence of textual components within the inverted images, a phenomenon that occurs more pronouncedly when TV regularization is not used in the loss function.

### Class Inversion

Class inversion is the procedure of finding images that activate a target class maximally. The process starts by initializing input x randomly and utilizing gradient descent to optimize the expression

\[\max_{x}L(f(x),y)+R(x),\]

where \(f\) denotes a trained classification neural network, \(L\) is the classification loss function (typically cross-entropy), and \(y\) is the target label. Regularization term \(R\) aims to prevent the optimized image from devolving into meaningless noise by incorporating priors associated with natural images. DeepDream (Mordvintsev et al., 2015) uses two regularization terms: \(\mathcal{R}_{\ell_{2}}(\mathbf{x})=\|\mathbf{x}\|_{2}^{2}\) which penalizes the magnitude of the optimized image, and \(\mathcal{R}_{tv}(\mathbf{x})\) which penalizes Total Variation forcing adjacent pixels to have similar values. DeepInversion (Yin et al., 2020) uses an additional regularization term

\[\mathcal{R}_{feat}(\mathbf{x})=\sum_{k}\big{(}\|\mu_{k}(\mathbf{x})-\hat{\mu}_ {k}\|_{2}+\|\sigma_{k}^{2}(\mathbf{x})-\hat{\sigma}_{k}^{2}\|_{2}\big{)}\]

where \(\mu_{k},\sigma_{k}^{2}\) are the batch mean and variance statistics of the \(k\)-th convolutional layer, and \(\hat{\mu}_{k},\hat{\sigma}_{k}^{2}\) are the running mean and running variance of the \(k\)-th convolutional layer. The \(\mathcal{R}_{feat}\) is only applicable to architectures using batch normalization (Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015), restricting its application for other networks, such as ViTs (Dosovitskiy and Brox, 2016) and MLPs (Tolstikhin et al., 2021). In this study, we explore the inversion of CLIP models. Unlike traditional models with predefined classes during training, CLIP models undergo training with language supervision, wherein specific classes are not explicitly specified.

### CLIP Visualization

Exploring CLIP models from a visualization standpoint has been previously undertaken, and we present a brief summary of the insights derived from such examinations. A study conducted by (Ghiasi et al., 2022) revealed that CLIP features exhibit activation based on semantic features rather than visual characteristics. For instance, they identified features activated by concepts such as death and music despite the absence of visual similarity among the images that triggered these features. Additionally, (Goh et al., 2021) found that akin to the human brain, CLIP models possess multi-modal neurons that respond to the same concept in photographs, drawings, and images of their name. However, our investigation in this work focuses on unraveling the knowledge embedded in CLIP models through the lens of model inversion.

### Bias and NSFW content

Recent research in deep learning has aimed at tackling biases and NSFW content in large multimodal datasets like LAION-400M and text-to-image generative models. Concerns raised by (1) highlight explicit and problematic content in LAION-400M, with (Birhane et al., 2023) indicating a \(12\%\) increase in hateful content with the growth of the LAION dataset. This underscores the crucial need for dataset curation practices to minimize harmful biases.

In the realm of Text-to-Image generative models, (Perera and Patel, 2023) delves into bias within diffusion-based face generation models, particularly regarding gender, race, and age attributes. Their findings reveal that diffusion models exacerbate bias in training data, especially with smaller datasets. Conversely, GAN models trained on balanced datasets exhibit less bias across attributes, emphasizing the necessity to address biases in diffusion models for fair outcomes in real-world applications. A promising solution introduced by (Gandikota et al., 2023) is the Erased Stable Diffusion (ESD) method, designed to permanently remove unwanted visual concepts from pre-trained text-to-image models. ESD fine-tunes model parameters using only text descriptions, effectively erasing concepts such as nudity and artistic styles. This approach surpasses existing methods and includes a user study, providing code and data for exploration.

Additionally, (Luccioni et al., 2023) proposes an assessment method focusing on gender and ethnicity biases, revealing the under-representation of marginalized identities in popular systems like Stable Diffusion and Dall-E 2. Furthermore, the "Safe Latent Diffusion (SLD)" method presented in (Schramowski et al., 2023) actively suppresses NSFW content in text-conditioned image models, addressing challenges posed by NSFW image prompts.

Method

A CLIP model consists of two key networks. The first is the visual encoder network, denoted as \(V\), responsible for creating image embeddings. The second is the text encoder network, marked as \(T\), which generates embeddings for textual content. The training process of a CLIP model is guided by a contrastive loss function designed to both increase the similarity between an image and its associated caption and reduce the similarity between that image and all other captions in the same batch. To invert a CLIP model for a prompt \(p\), we solve the following optimization problem starting from a random noise:

\[\max_{x}cos(V(A(x)),T(p))+Reg(x)\]

which \(cos(.)\) is the cosine similarity, \(A\) is a random augmentation chosen at each iteration step, and \(Reg\) are regularization terms used.

We adopt using augmentations from (Ghiasi et al., 2022b) into our methodology. These augmentations are employed to invert classification models and serve as image priors. Specifically, if an image is classified as a bird, its augmentation is also expected to be classified as a bird. Similarly, in CLIP inversion, if an image aligns with a given prompt, its augmentations must align with that prompt as well. The main augmentation used in (Ghiasi et al., 2022b) is ColorShift; however, we incorporate random affine and color jitter as augmentations in our experiments. Using random affine transformation instead of ColorShift has a significant impact on the quality of the inverted images, as showcased in Figure 15. More Details can be found in Section 6.

We also integrate the ensembling technique outlined in (Ghiasi et al., 2022b), where we concurrently optimize \(b\) augmented versions of the input to align with the prompt, with \(b\) representing the batch size.

We use Total Variation (TV) and L1 loss as regularization terms as also been used in (Mordvintsev et al., 2015).

\[Reg(x))=\alpha TV(x)+\beta||x||_{1}.\]

The sequence of images, evolving from random noise, is illustrated in Figure 2. We begin at a resolution of 64 and gradually increase to 128 and then to 224 at iterations 900 and 1800, respectively. The optimization process encompasses a total of 3400 steps.

## 4 Analysis

In this section, we investigate the varied insights enabled by model inversion for CLIP models. We begin by exploring the capacity of model inversion to generate novel concepts. Following this, we provide an analysis of NSFW content detected within these inversions. Next, we probe gender biases present in CLIP models and also their limitations in making accurate associations. Lastly, we explore the impact of the scale of training data.

### Blending concepts

Furthermore, using celebrity names as prompts can lead to the generation of NSFW images through inversion. We can see examples of these images in Figure 5. We count the NSFW-flagged images out of 100 inverted images using the stable diffusion safety checker for each of these prompts to quantify the extent of potentially NSFW content generated through inversion. As depicted in table 3, there is a notable prevalence of NSFW-flagged images for female celebrities. For example, for the prompt "Dakota Johnson" 94 images out of 100 images are flagged as NSFW. Providing analysis on this prompt, we find the closest words in the embedding space to the embedding of "Dakota Johnson". Surprisingly, as shown in Table 2, we can find many NSFW words present in the list of words. More examples are in table 8. This situation can present challenges, particularly since CLIP models serve as text encoders in numerous text-to-image generative models.

The proximity of a celebrity name's embedding to NSFW words can be undesirable. In a separate experiment, as illustrated in Table 5, we identify the words closest to the embedding of an image featuring "Dakota Johnson" on the internet. Once more, among the first 200 closest words, there are several instances of NSFW words. This underscores the existence of NSFW content during the training of CLIP models, emphasizing the necessity for enhanced curation of training data, especially when involving authentic human images.

Initial experiments counting the number of NSFW images for celebrity names utilized a ViT-B16 OpenAI to the public. Upon conducting the same experiment with a ViT-B16 OpenCLIP model (Ilharco et al., 2021) trained on Laion2b (Schuhmann et al., 2022), the incidence of inappropriate NSFW-flagged images notably decreases. However, when utilizing models trained on Laion400M (Schuhmann et al., 2021), the number of NSFW flagged images rises once more. The presence of troublesome explicit images in Laion400M is investigated by Birhane et al. (2021). Once again, this underscores the critical importance of meticulously curating training data for CLIP models. The results are shown in Table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline Prompt & Man & Woman & Man & Woman & Man & Woman \\ \hline STATUS RELATED & NEUTRAL & FEMALE & & MALE \\ \hline A thief, dangerous person, criminal & **96** & 4 & 0 & **100** & **99** & 1 \\ A person with a low-paying job & **97** & 3 & 0 & **100** & **98** & 2 \\ A person with a high-paying job & **96** & 4 & 0 & **100** & **99** & 1 \\ A successful student in university & **98** & 2 & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ \hline PROFESSION RELATED & & & & & & \\ \hline A nurse in the pediatric ward & 0 & **100** & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ A kindergarten teacher in the colorful classroom & 0 & **100** & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ A midwfe in the delivery room & 0 & **100** & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ A firefighter at the scene of a blazing fire & **99** & 1 & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ A construction worker at a bustling construction site & **99** & 1 & 0 & **100** & **100** & 0 \\ A mechanic in the busy auto repair shop & **97** & 3 & 0 & **100** & **99** & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: For each prompt, we generate 100 inverted images and conduct classification to determine whether these inverted images are associated with a man or a woman. The classification is performed using a separate CLIP model. The “Neutral” column indicates prompts as shown in the table. The “FEMALE” and “MALE” columns represent scenarios where gender specification is added to the prompt. For instance, using “A male nurse in the pediatric ward.”

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l c c c|} \hline Prompt & CLIP & OpenC2B & OpenC400M \\ \hline Jennifer Anniston & 9 & 6 & 50 \\ Dakota Johnson & 94 & 43 & 53 \\ Demi Lovato & 80 & 11 & 29 \\ Zendaya & 60 & 7 & 20 \\ Jennifer Lopez & 88 & 19 & 32 \\ Johnny Depp & 18 & 14 & 18 \\ Leonardo DiCaprio & 22 & 1 & 4 \\ Brad Pitt & 9 & 25 & 19 \\ George Clooney & 7 & 2 & 3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Experimental Details

We utilize Adam as our optimizer with a learning rate set to 0.1. To implement various random augmentations for different inputs within the batch, we employ the Kornia library. Unlike PyTorch's default augmentations, which use the same augmentation for all images in a batch, we require different augmentations for each element in the batch due to identical inputs. In our experiments, we employ random affine, and color jitter.. We apply random affine and color jitter with a probability of 1. For random affine, we configure degrees, translate, and scale parameters to 30, [0.1, 0.1], and [0.7, 1.2], respectively. Regarding color jitter, we set the parameters for brightness, contrast, and saturation to 0.4 each and hue to 0.1. We complete a total of 3400 optimization steps. Initially, we begin with a resolution of 64, then increase it to 128 at iteration 900, and finally to 224 at iteration 1800. Each inversion experiment was conducted using a single RTX 4000 GPU, taking approximately 14 minutes per experiment.

## 7 Discussion and Limitations

We present a method for studying biases and knowledge inherent in CLIP models using qualitative methods that are typically only available for generative models. While the dataset used to train the original CLIP model is proprietary, visualization methods give us a glimpse into its construction. The strong tendency of the CLIP model to produce NSFW imagery across a wide range of contexts suggests that the dataset is not carefully curated, and it likely contains a considerable amount of NSFW content.

A notable limitation of this study is that we use generative strategies to extract conclusions from a model that is not typically operated in a generative way. While model inversion gives us a powerful window into CLIP's behaviors, and we argue that is the least biased approach known to date, these behaviors do not have to be represented in other operational modes.

## 8 Reproducibility

We have made our code publicly accessible at https://github.com/hamidkazemi22/CLIPInversion.

## 9 Impact Statement

We want to clarify that we have not intentionally sought to create any NSFW images during the inversion process. The emergence of such behavior is inherent to CLIP models. Despite not using any NSFW prompts, we have observed that specific prompts can still result in NSFW imagery. This raises a significant concern that warrants attention within the community. It underscores the importance of employing improved data filtering and curation techniques for training models on web-scale datasets.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract contains the summary of the paper's contributions, and in the introduction, we included the summary of our contributions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have a section titled "Discussion and Limitations" for discussing the limitations. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not present theoretical results, but it does provide a precise definition of the loss function used in our inversion method. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have made our code base publicly available and included a section that discusses the details of the experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have made our code publicly available, accompanied by a README page that explains how to run the experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The details of the experiments are provided in the section titled "Experimental Details." Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: This does not apply to our work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have specified the GPU type and runtime for our experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper does not intentionally produce NSFW content; it solely discusses the risks associated with using CLIP models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed this in the section titled "Broader Impact". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA] Justification: In our experiments, we used pre-trained models, and we did not release any models or datasets.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have cited all the assets used or discussed in the paper.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided instructions on how to run the experiments on our GitHub page. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
