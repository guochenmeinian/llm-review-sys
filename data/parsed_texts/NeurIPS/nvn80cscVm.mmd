###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed natural language processing and extended their powerful capabilities to multi-modal domains. As LLMs continue to advance, it is crucial to develop diverse and appropriate metrics for their evaluation. In this paper, we introduce a novel rank-based metric, _Diff-eRank_, grounded in information theory and geometry principles. Diff-eRank assesses LLMs by analyzing their hidden representations, providing a quantitative measure of how efficiently they eliminate redundant information during training. We demonstrate the applicability of Diff-eRank in both single-modal (e.g., language) and multi-modal settings. For language models, our results show that Diff-eRank increases with model size and correlates well with conventional metrics such as loss and accuracy. In the multi-modal context, we propose an alignment evaluation method based on the eRank, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance based on our method. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/waltonfuture/Diff-eRank.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT [4, 23], Chinchilla [17], and PaLM [7], have gained considerable attention for their outstanding performance in various natural language processing tasks. LLMs have expanded from single-modal models to multi-modal models, including MiniGPT-4 [49] and LLaVA [20], which have achieved remarkable results in various application scenarios. Pre-trained LLMs rely on large networks, computational power, and massive amounts of data, aiming for greater generalization capabilities.

LLMs understand the world knowledge through training on huge amounts of data. One famous belief [34] of how LLMs work is that larger models can find more shared hidden structures in data samples by eliminating redundant information through training. In particular, in the early phase of training, following random initialization, the representations derived from the training data tend to be somewhat chaotic. As training progresses, these representations become increasingly structured, and the model discards extraneous information from the training data, which resembles a process similar to "noise reduction". This perspective motivates us that LLM could be evaluated by characterizing the "noise reduction" process.

However, defining and quantifying the degree of "noise reduction" remains a significant challenge. To address this, we hypothesize that a reasonable metric should 1) reflect the geometric characteristics of the data such as the dimensionality of its representations, and 2) be rooted in information theory.

In this paper, we introduce _Diff-eRank_ (difference between effective ranks), an information-theoretic metric that fulfills both criteria, providing a measure for quantifying "noise reduction" in LLMs. In particular, we consider the _effective rank_ (eRank) of the representations extracted by an LLM from a dataset to measure the uncertainty, based on concepts from (quantum) information theory [30]. Through the removal of redundant information, eRank decreases, indicating the representations become more structured and compact. Thus, the reduction of representations' eRank can signify the degree of "noise reduction". Therefore, we can evaluate a well-trained LLM via the eRank reduction of the model representations _from its untrained status_. We remark that different from conventional metrics like loss, which are derived from the predictions of LLMs, the proposed Diff-eRank focuses on the model representations. Our approach offers a novel perspective of model assessment, independent of prediction-based metrics, and can provide new insights into the understanding of LLM's behavior.

To verify the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct experiments on the contexts of both uni-modal LLMs and multi-modal LLMs. In particular, for uni-modal LLMs, we compute Diff-eRanks for models within the OPT family [45] across various datasets. Intriguingly, we observe that Diff-eRank increases as the model scales, suggesting that larger models exhibit a stronger noise reduction ability. Moreover, Diff-eRank has a consistent trend when compared with (reduced) cross-entropy loss and benchmark accuracy, highlighting its potential as an effective and easy-to-use evaluation metric. For multi-modal (vision-language) LLMs, visual and language information is usually encoded separately by two independent encoders and aligned through a connecting layer. Therefore, evaluating the quality of modality alignment in multi-modal LLMs is crucial. Building on insights from uni-modal LLMs, we can assess modality alignment by examining the matching degree of eRanks between representations from different modalities. Additionally, this approach yields interesting observations within the context of such multi-modal architectures.

Our contribution can be summarized as follows:

* We propose a rank-based metric, Diff-eRank, for evaluating LLMs, where Diff-eRank reflects the "noise reduction" ability of pre-trained language models. Diff-eRank focuses on the model representations, different from conventional metrics such as loss and benchmark accuracy.
* We validate the effectiveness of Diff-eRank by observing its correlation with the trends in loss and downstream task accuracy as the model scales up.
* We also propose eRank-based modality alignment metrics for multi-modal LLMs, and verify that contemporary multi-modal LLMs exhibit strong alignment performance via our metrics.

## 2 Related Works

**Evaluation of Large Language Models.** Evaluation of LLMs is a fast-evolving field across various tasks, datasets, and benchmarks [5; 33; 36; 48]. Precise evaluations are important for the enhancement of language models' performance and reliability. Conventional metrics such as accuracy, F1 [29], BLEU [24] and ROUGE [18] estimate between the annotated label and the prediction generated by the language model in different downstream tasks. Other metrics like perplexity and cross-entropy loss are independent of annotated labels and can be computed solely based on the input texts. However, these metrics focus on "extrinsic" evaluation, assessing performance based on the predictions of LLMs. We propose Diff-eRank for "intrinsic" evaluation based on the input data's hidden representations of LLMs, concentrating on their "noise reduction" capabilities.

**Information Theory for Understanding Deep Learning.** Information theory has been used to gain significant insights into understanding neural networks. For example, the information bottleneck [37; 38] is instrumental in explaining supervised learning. Recently, researchers have also utilized information theory to understand and improve (vision) semi and self-supervised learning [32; 35; 46; 47]. Notably, Zhang et al. [46] find the closed-form connection of matrix entropy and effective rank when the matrix is positive semi-definite. As for language models, prior works [16; 25; 41] also used information theory to analyze hidden representations by training probes on specific downstream tasks to estimate the information contained in the pre-trained language model. Several other works explore the lossless compression of LLMs with arithmetic coding [10; 40] based on information theory. In this paper, we take a further step toward evaluating LLMs through the proposed Diff-eRank rooted in information theory, which represents a complementary perspective to these prior studies.

The Proposed Metric for Evaluating LLMs

In this section, we will introduce a rank-based metric called _Diff-eRank_ for evaluating LLMs. The proposed metric is based on the representations obtained by an LLM, fundamentally diverging from conventional metrics like loss, which are based on the model's predictions.

When processing a sequence of tokens, an LLM will generate a representation (i.e., the hidden states before the last classification head) for each token within the sequence. These high-dimensional representations are usually used to capture the semantic and syntactic information of the sentences. This inspires us to consider evaluating LLMs by analyzing these representations. In particular, we study the characteristics of these representations by examining their ranks through both the geometric and information-theoretic perspective. On the one hand, studying the rank of these representations allows us to measure the extent of linear independence among them, which corresponds to the effective dimensions in the representation space (i.e., the geometric structure). On the other hand, the rank is also related to the amount of information contained in these representations, while a lower rank indicates that the information has been structured or compressed. Therefore, we consider to leverage the rank of data representations encoded by LLMs for model evaluation.

However, the size of data representation matrix varies with the sample size, making it less suitable for consistent analysis. Therefore, instead of directly computing the rank of the data representations, we use the rank of their _covariance matrix_, which has a fixed size and also contains all the essential information. To see this, let \(\mathcal{S}=\{\mathbf{z}_{1},\mathbf{z}_{2},\ldots,\mathbf{z}_{N}\}\) denote the set of data representations, and \(\bar{\mathbf{z}}\) be the mean representation. The rank of data representation matrix can be re-formulated as

\[\mathrm{rank}([\mathbf{z}_{1}-\bar{\mathbf{z}},\cdots,\mathbf{z }_{N}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}]) =\mathrm{rank}\left(\frac{1}{N}[\mathbf{z}_{1}-\bar{\mathbf{z}},\cdots,\mathbf{z}_{N}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}][\mathbf{z}_{1}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}, \cdots,\mathbf{z}_{N}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}]^{\top}\right)\] \[=\mathrm{rank}\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar {\mathbf{z}})(\mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}})^{\top}\right),\]

where the last term is exactly the rank of covariance matrix. We remark that the above rank also equals to the dimension of the affine subspace spanned by \(\mathcal{S}\cup\{\bar{\mathbf{z}}\}\).

The formal construction of covariance matrix is shown as follows. For ease of analysis, each \(\mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}\) is being normalized.

**Definition 3.1** (Construction of Covariance Matrix).: Given a set of representations \(\mathcal{S}=\{\mathbf{z}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid i=1,2,\ldots,N\}\), the covariance matrix \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}}\) is constructed as

\[\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\frac{\mathbf{z}_ {i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}}{\|\mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}\|}\right)\left(\frac{ \mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}}{\|\mathbf{z}_{i}-\bar{\mathbf{z}}\|}\right) ^{\top},\]

where \(\bar{\mathbf{z}}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbf{z}_{i}/N\) is the mean representation and notation \(\|\cdot\|\) represents \(\ell_{2}\) norm.

Since rank is highly sensitive to outliers [27], we instead use its "continuous" counterpart, the _effective rank_ (eRank), when applied to the covariance matrix, defined as below.

**Definition 3.2** (eRank [27]).: The effective rank of any non-zero matrix \(\mathbf{A}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times N}\) is defined as

\[\mathrm{eRank}(\mathbf{A})=\exp\left(-\sum_{i=1}^{Q}\frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sum_{i =1}^{Q}\sigma_{i}}\log\frac{\sigma_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{Q}\sigma_{i}}\right),\]

where \(Q=\min\{N,d\}\) and \(\sigma_{1},\sigma_{2},\ldots,\sigma_{Q}\) are the singular values of matrix \(\mathbf{A}\).

We remark that the above eRank is closely related to the matrix entropy (i.e., Von Neumann entropy for matrices [42]), which is defined in Definition 3.3. In fact, Zhang et al. [46] point out that, for a covariance matrix of _normalized_ vectors, \(\mathrm{eRank}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}})\) is the same as \(\exp(\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}}))\).

**Definition 3.3** (Matrix Entropy).: Given a positive semi-definite matrix \(\mathbf{K}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) satisfying \(\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{K}\right)=1\), the matrix entropy of matrix \(\mathbf{K}\) is defined as

\[\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{K})=-\mathrm{tr}\left(\mathbf{K}\log\mathbf{K}\right).\]It is equivalent to the Shannon entropy [31] over the spectrum, i.e.,

\[\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{K})=-\sum_{i=1}^{d}\lambda_{i}\log\lambda_{i},\]

where \(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2},\ldots,\lambda_{d}\) are the eigenvalues of matrix \(\mathbf{K}\).

Note that eRank of the covariance matrix is commonly interpreted as a measure of the "degree of freedom" that the sentence contains in a geometric sense, one may wonder whether there is a more "information-theoretic" explanation for it. Interestingly, under the terminology of quantum information theory [44], if we regard the representation of each token as a _state_ in a quantum system, the construction given by Definition 3.1 is a standard process of constructing a _density matrix_. From the quantum noiseless coding theorem [30], the entropy of a density matrix \(\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}})\) represents the average number of qubits required to encode the states. Therefore, \(\exp\left(\mathrm{H}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{\mathcal{S}})\right)\) can be viewed as a measure of randomness for a sentence through the quantum information theory.

As eRank measures the amount of uncertainty in a system, we can now define Diff-eRank to measure the degree of "noise reduction" for an LLM.

**Definition 3.4** (Diff-eRank).: Given a sentence \(x\), an untrained language model \(M_{0}\), and a compute-optimal [17] trained language model \(M_{1}\), we obtain two sets of representations, \(M_{0}(x)\) and \(M_{1}(x)\), by processing each token of \(x\) through the respective models. Then the rank difference (i.e., Diff-eRank) between these two models based on sentence \(x\) is defined as follows:

\[\Delta\operatorname{eRank}(x,M_{0},M_{1})=\operatorname{eRank}\left(\mathbf{ \Sigma}_{M_{0}(x)}\right)-\operatorname{eRank}\left(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{1}(x) }\right),\]

where \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{i}(x)}\) is the covariance matrix of model \(M_{i}\)'s representations on sentence \(x\) for \(i\in\{0,1\}\).

Upon completing training, the model's data representations shift from being random to more structured, enabling it to effectively capture patterns and structures from the data. In the above definition, the effective ranks \(\operatorname{eRank}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{0}(x)})\) and \(\operatorname{eRank}(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{1}(x)})\) quantify the uncertainty in the representations of the untrained and trained models, respectively. Thus, Diff-eRank \(\Delta\operatorname{eRank}(x,M_{0},M_{1})\) measures how much uncertainty the model has reduced as a result of training.

The above definition applies to a single sentence but can be extended to a dataset consisting of multiple sentences. Specifically, Diff-eRank for the entire dataset can be defined as the average Diff-eRank across all sentences, formulated as follows.

**Definition 3.5** (Diff-eRank of a Dataset).: Given a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) consisting of sentences \(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\), an untrained language model \(M_{0}\), and a compute-optimal [17] trained language model \(M_{1}\), Diff-eRank of dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) is defined as

\[\Delta\operatorname{eRank}(\mathcal{D},M_{0},M_{1})=\exp\left(\frac{\sum_{i=1 }^{n}\mathrm{H}\left(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{0}(x_{i})}\right)}{n}\right)-\exp \left(\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathrm{H}\left(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{M_{1}(x_{i})} \right)}{n}\right).\]

In summary, Diff-eRank reflects the dimension reduction of the space spanned by data representations. It can be viewed as a measure of removing redundant information in the data for a compute-optimal language model. A higher Diff-eRank indicates more organized and structured internal representations of the model, therefore reflecting the model's increasing effectiveness in capturing patterns and regularities in the data.

## 4 Evaluations of Large Language Models

We start with evaluating different sizes of language models via Diff-eRank in Section 4.2. We find that Diff-eRank increases as the model scales up on various datasets. Additionally, we extend the application of eRank to multi-modalities beyond the language domain in Section 5.

### Experimental Settings

#### 4.1.1 Model Choice

We experiment by using popular transformer-based language models from OPT [45] family, ranging from 125 million to 13 billion parameters. Such diversity in OPT's model size allows for a comprehensive analysis across different scales of pre-trained language models in our experimental setting. We refer the reader to Appendix A for additional implementation details about the selection of language datasets.

#### 4.1.2 Metric for Comparison

Given a text sequence \(U=[u_{1},\dots,u_{T}]\), the cross-entropy loss of a language model \(M\) can be defined as

\[L(U,M)=-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{T}\log P(u_{i}|u_{1},\dots,u_{i-1}).\]

The cross-entropy loss is a canonical quantity in Shannon information theory, based on the model's predictions. As we study the rank difference between untrained model \(M_{0}\) and compute-optimal trained model \(M_{1}\) based on representation, we adopt the difference in loss for comparison, correspondingly. Therefore, we can similarly define reduced (cross-entropy) loss as

\[\Delta L(U,M_{0},M_{1})=L(U,M_{0})-L(U,M_{1}).\]

As the training progresses, the LLM gets better predictions on the input data, leading to an increase in reduced loss. Therefore, reduced loss can also be seen as a useful evaluation metric for LLMs, and we use it for comparison with Diff-eRank in our following experiments.

### The Trend of Diff-eRank with Model Size

To substantiate Diff-eRank as a viable metric for evaluation, we evaluate the series of OPT [45] models over different and diverse datasets using Diff-eRank and (reduced) loss for comparison. Specifically, we consider including pre-training datasets such as Wikipedia [14] and openwebtext2 [15], instruction dataset dolly-15k [8], and preference dataset hh-rhlf [2] for the diversity of their usage.

Figure 1 presents that Diff-eRank and reduced loss both increase progressively as the model scales up. The increase in reduced loss (equals to a decrease in cross-entropy loss) can be interpreted as larger models providing closer predictions to the actual values so that they can better capture the underlying patterns and relationships within the data. As for the increase in Diff-eRank based on hidden representations, it suggests that the redundant dimensions of the data can be effectively reduced in the larger models, thereby resulting in stronger "noise reduction" abilities and larger Diff-eRanks. Overall, the strong correlation between Diff-eRank and (reduced) loss indicates that Diff-eRank can provide a novel and inspirational evaluation for LLMs through the lens of "noise reduction" in dimension spaces. We summarize detailed results tables in Appendix B.

### Relationship among Benchmark Metrics

Based on the exploration in the earlier section, a natural question arises: does Diff-eRank relate to the downstream task accuracy of large language models? To address this question, we integrate accuracy

Figure 1: Comparison of Diff-eRank and reduced loss when model scales up across various datasets. Both Diff-eRank and reduced loss show an upward trend when the model scales up.

as a comparative metric in addition to Diff-eRank and reduced loss in our evaluations on benchmark datasets. We use the evaluation set of openbookqa [22] and piqa [3] by combining the question and correct answer of each piece of data as inputs.

The results presented in Table 1 illustrate a similar relationship among Diff-eRank, reduced loss, and downstream task accuracy. All of these three metrics increase when model size increases. Although occasional outliers are observed in the upward trends of these indicators, we think this is normal and does not affect the overall trend. Therefore, it can be concluded that Diff-eRank generally correlates with the trend of loss and accuracy, particularly as the model size scales within the same model family. An increase in Diff-eRank (i.e., a higher denoising ability of the model) corresponds to enhanced model performance (i.e., higher reduced loss and higher accuracy), which shows great potential in the evaluation of LLMs.

## 5 Evaluations of Multi-Modal Large Language Models

After verifying that Diff-eRank can indeed reflect the LLMs' intrinsic ability in the previous sections, our study extends to the evaluation of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [1; 20; 43; 49]. We define new metrics based on the eRank to evaluate the _modality alignment_.

### Experimental Settings

For our multi-modal experiments, we select two advanced and open-sourced MLLMs as shown in Table 5 in the appendix: LLaVA-1.5 [19] and MiniGPT-v2 [6]. Both the two MLLMs utilize a simple connector for aligning the vision encoder with the LLM, providing a streamlined approach to multi-modal learning. We conduct the experiments on two high-quality multi-modal instruction datasets: detail_23k [20] and cc_sbu_align [49]. Each piece of data in these datasets contains a triplet of image, instruction, and response. We concatenate the instruction and response of each triplet as the textual input in our experiments.

### Empirical Observations

Most of the MLLMs typically employ a projector mechanism (usually linear layer or MLP), which aligns image representations from a vision encoder (usually ViT [12]) with LLM's language representations. Our experiments include analyzing the effective rank of representation of images post vision encoder (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{1}\)) and post connector (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{2}\)), as well as the representation output by the LLM for individual images (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{3}\)), text (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{4}\)), and image-text pairs (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{5}\)), as shown in Figure 2. To measure the "modality alignment" of MLLMs, we introduce two distinct metrics based on eRank:

\[\text{Image Reduction Ratio}=\frac{\mathrm{eRank}_{1}-\mathrm{eRank}_{2}}{ \mathrm{eRank}_{1}},\]

and

\[\text{Image-Text Alignment}=\frac{\mathrm{avg}(\mathrm{eRank}_{3},\mathrm{e Rank}_{4},\mathrm{eRank}_{5})}{\mathrm{max}(\mathrm{eRank}_{3},\mathrm{e Rank}_{4},\mathrm{eRank}_{5})}.\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c c c c c} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Benchmarks} & \multirow{2}{*}{Indicators} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{OPT Models Size} \\  & & 125M & 1.3B & 2.7B & 6.7B & 13B \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{openbookqa} & Acc & 0.276 & 0.332 & 0.370 & 0.360 & **0.366** \\  & \(\Delta L\) & 5.734 & 6.138 & 6.204 & **6.258** & 6.236 \\ \cline{2-7}  & Diff-eRank & 1.410 & 2.140 & 2.338 & 2.280 & **3.032** \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{piqa} & Acc & 0.619 & 0.714 & 0.733 & 0.756 & **0.767** \\  & \(\Delta L\) & 6.472 & 6.928 & 6.999 & **7.077** & 7.068 \\ \cline{1-1}  & Diff-eRank & 4.647 & 6.294 & 6.774 & 6.950 & **7.267** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Comparison of benchmark metrics on openbookqa [22] and piqa [3]. Acc denotes benchmark accuracy and \(\Delta L\) indicates reduced loss. The results indicate that larger Diff-eRank values generally correspond to higher model performance.

On the one hand, the "_Image Reduction Ratio_" metric is formulated to quantify the reduction in effective rank from the vision encoder output (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{1}\)) to the post-connector stage (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{2}\)). Note that normalization is necessary here for a fair comparison because the vision encoder and connector are entirely different networks. This metric evaluates the connector network's efficiency in condensing and refining visual information during image-text alignment training. On the other hand, the "_Image-Text Alignment_" metric is designed to evaluate the closeness among the effective rank of representations post LLM processing, considering individual images (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{3}\)), text (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{4}\)), and image-text pairs (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{5}\)) as inputs. In particular, the absolute eRank can be seen as the amount of absolute uncertainty or randomness. The mentioned three eRanks show how much the model integrates and represents each modality. If these three eRanks from different modalities are close to each other, it means that they align well from the perspective of information theory. Thus, this metric reflects the degree of closeness (i.e., alignment) among different modalities. A higher alignment score indicates a more proficient alignment between image and text modalities for MLLMs.

Results in Table 2 exhibit the performance of two MLLMs, LLaVA-1.5 [19] and MiniGPT-v2 [6], across different datasets (detail_23k [20] and cc_sbu_align [49]). Both models align well as they all have a relatively high alignment score.

In particular, comparing the two models, LLaVA-1.5 and MiniGPT-v2 both exhibit similar "Image Reduction Ratio" scores, indicating efficient condensation of visual information. Additionally, LLaVA-1.5 outperforms MiniGPT-v2 in "Image-Text Alignment", suggesting a closer integration between visual and textual modalities. This finding is also consistent with their performance, as LLaVA-1.5 surpasses MiniGPT-v2 in most of benchmarks [9]. We leave exploring a more comprehensive evaluation for multi-modal models via effective rank as future work.

To further investigate the role of each component in MLLM, we conduct additional experiments to calculate the eRank after rotating the images clockwise. We summarize the results in Table 3. As the rotation of images introduces new semantic information into the model, by noticing all the image-related quantities (\(\mathrm{eRank}_{i}\) (\(i\neq 4\))) all _increase_ from the base model when performing rotation, this semantic influence can propagate through the model. Therefore, we suggest that the multi-modal model (including the connector and the language model) can indeed perceive subtle semantic variations in images, especially the position information. In addition, the "Image Reduction Ratio" score and "Image-Text Alignment" score both _decrease_ after conducting image rotation, suggesting that the connector performs less effectively in condensing visual information, and the rotated images

are less well-aligned with the corresponding text. This is primarily because the rotation alters the spatial relationships within the image, possibly making it more challenging for the model to maintain the coherence between visual and textual information. Overall, this experiment indicates that subtle changes in the vision encoder's understanding of images can be effectively conveyed to the LLM part and affect the MLLM's modality alignment. It demonstrates the validity of such a popular multi-modal architecture.

In conclusion, these rank-based approaches enable a thorough understanding of how well the multi-modal models align different modalities of data and how the models process and integrate different forms of input data.

## 6 Ablation Study

To better confirm the rationality of our algorithm and experimental design, we further conduct a series of ablation studies.

### Different Model Families

Besides observing Diff-eRank on the OPT family, we also conduct experiments on Cerebras-GPT [11] family and OpenELM [21] family. LLMs in these three families are all pre-trained well on public data and range in various sizes. To demonstrate that Diff-eRank is not dependent on specific datasets, we choose not to use benchmark datasets but instead select a general dataset. In particular, we adopt the dolly-15k [8] dataset to compute Diff-eRank along with reduced loss, and we calculate the average benchmark accuracy of winogrande [28] and piqa [3] for these three LLM families. The empirical findings in Figure 3 substantiate the increase of Diff-eRank within these LLM families as the models scale up, which correlates with the trend of reduced loss and benchmark accuracy. This observation shows the potential of Diff-eRank as an insightful metric for the evaluation of different model families.

### Algorithm Design

In this section, we choose other types of algorithms for designing Diff-eRank between untrained model \(M_{0}\) and trained model \(M_{1}\). The goal is to validate that the increasing type relation is robust to the algorithm we used.

We denote our standard computation of effective rank on a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) (Definition 3.5) as "Algorithm (a)", which calculates the effective rank based on the _average matrix entropy_. In addition, we also consider the operation of calculating the _average effective rank_ on a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\), denoted by "Algorithm (b)". Specifically, for an LLM \(M\), the effective rank on a dataset \(\mathcal{D}\) of Algorithm (b) is defined as

\[\mathrm{eRank}^{(b)}(\mathcal{D},M)=\frac{\sum_{x\in\mathcal{D}}\exp(\mathrm{H }(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{M(x)}))}{|\mathcal{D}|}=\frac{\sum_{x\in\mathcal{D}} \mathrm{eRank}(\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{M(x)})}{|\mathcal{D}|}.\]

Figure 3: Comparing Diff-eRank with reduced loss and benchmark accuracy across different model families, including OPT [45], Cerebras-GPT [11], and OpenELM [21].

Therefore, Diff-eRank between untrained model \(M_{0}\) and trained model \(M_{1}\) of Algorithm (b) can be formulated as

\[\Delta\operatorname{eRank}^{(b)}(\mathcal{D},M_{0},M_{1})=\operatorname{eRank}^ {(b)}(\mathcal{D},M_{0})-\operatorname{eRank}^{(b)}(\mathcal{D},M_{1}).\]

To compare these two ways for defining Diff-eRank, we conduct experiments using OPT models on dolly-15k dataset. The experimental results in Figure 4 demonstrate that Diff-eRank consistently increases across model sizes, irrespective of whether Algorithm (a) or Algorithm (b) is used. This observation verifies that the increasing trend for Diff-eRank is robust across different algorithms of effective rank defined on a dataset.

### Measure Diff-eRank on Different Layers

In our research, we predominantly concentrate on the last layer of LLMs, as it usually represents the most comprehensive information encoded by the model. This layer may offer the most indicative measure of Diff-eRank. Besides, we also extend our experiments to encompass additional layers within the models. Specifically, our investigations include analyses of the first layer, the middle layer, and the last layer for language models in the OPT [45] family on dolly-15k [8] dataset. Our findings in Table 4 reveal that only the Diff-eRank on the last layer reveals an increasing trend across model sizes, which indicates that it's reasonable to analyze data representation through the last layer that encodes the most comprehensive information of the model. This may be interpreted that LLM is an integrated system where information processing occurs across the entire architecture. If we rely on early layers for analyzing Diff-eRank, this could lead to a loss of important information and we may miss crucial information processing that occurs in subsequent layers. The last layer, on the other hand, integrates this information, providing a more complete representation of the input data. The observation in our experiments reveals that early layers do not exhibit clear patterns in terms of Diff-eRank. This underscores the importance of considering the model as a whole when analyzing the representation.

## 7 Conclusion and Discussion

We introduce Diff-eRank, a new metric that can measure the "noise reduction" ability of LLM based on data representation and reflects the extent to which a pre-trained LLM eliminates the redundant dimension in the information-theoretic sense. Our method reveals the geometric characteristics of the data and is grounded in information theory. The empirical investigations show that the Diff-eRank increases when the model scales and correlates with the trend of loss and downstream task accuracy. Moreover, we use this metric to define the alignment metrics for multi-modal LLMs and find contemporary models align very well.

However, we haven't conducted experiments to observe the change of Diff-eRank during the LLMs' whole pre-training and post training stages due to the limited computation resources. Future research may broaden the investigative scope by introducing the Diff-eRank in LLMs' complete training stages. In addition, some useful techniques like pruning, quantization, and distillation may benefit from such metrics that reveal internal redundancies. The Diff-eRank metric may aid in identifying which parts of the model can be compressed without significant loss of information. We hope that Diff-eRank will open up avenues for future studies to explore how such internal representation metrics can be integrated into different potential cases.

Additional Experiments

To further investigate how "Diff-eRank" changes during training, we conduct additional experiments to observe the behavior of Diff-eRank across different training stages for a fixed model size. In particular, we fix the model size by using the pre-trained OPT-1.3B [45] model and continually train it on a cleaned Wikipedia [14] dataset.

According to the additional experimental results in Table 10, we observe that the trend of Diff-eRank, first increasing before fully trained and then slightly decreasing when overfitting, aligns well with the trend of benchmark accuracy and the opposite trend of loss. This suggests that Diff-eRank may serve as a complementary metric that helps understand the LLM's "noise reduction" behavior during training, and monitor the training progress.

## Appendix D Additional Ablation Study

As mentioned in Appendix A.1, random sampling is employed to extract subsets from the whole datasets of Wikipedia [14] and openwebtext2 [15], each subset comprising 10,000 data entries, as these pre-training datasets are too large for computation. To assess the robustness of Diff-eRank in random selection, we incorporate variations in the sample sizes of the Wikipedia dataset in this ablation study. Table 11 illustrates that fluctuations in the sample size bring insignificant influence on the Diff-eRank, which affirms the stability of Diff-eRank in random sampling. Thus, this ablation study indicates the rationality of the random sampling process when dealing with large pre-training datasets in our experiments.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have mentioned in the abstract. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have mentioned limitations along with the conclusion in the last part of our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We provide them in our methodology part. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use open-sourced models, which are easy to reproduce. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide codes in our supplemental material. The data we used is all open-sourced. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide in our experimental settings. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide in our appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide it in our appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We follow NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We follow the license and terms of use in our experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
