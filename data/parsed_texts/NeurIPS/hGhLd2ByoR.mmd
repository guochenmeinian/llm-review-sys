###### Abstract

We reveal novel pathologies in existing unsupervised methods seeking to discover latent knowledge from large language model (LLM) activations--instead of knowledge they seem to discover whatever feature of the activations is most prominent. These methods search for hypothesised consistency structures of latent knowledge. We first prove theoretically that arbitrary features (not just knowledge) satisfy the consistency structure of a popular unsupervised knowledge-elicitation method: contrast-consistent search [9]. We then present a series of experiments showing settings in which this and other unsupervised methods result in classifiers that do not predict knowledge, but instead predict a different prominent feature. We conclude that existing unsupervised methods for discovering latent knowledge are insufficient, and we contribute sanity checks to apply to evaluating future knowledge elicitation methods. We offer conceptual arguments grounded in identification issues such as distinguishing a model's knowledge from that of a simulated character's that are likely to persist in future unsupervised methods.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) perform well across a variety of tasks [30; 10] in a way that suggests they systematically incorporate information about the world [7]. As a shorthand for the real-world information encoded in the weights of an LLM we could say that the LLM encodes _knowledge_.

Accessing that knowledge is hard, because the factual statements an LLM outputs do not reliably describe it [23; 2; 32]. For example, LLMs might repeat common misconceptions [26] or strategically deceive users [36]. If we could elicit the latent knowledge of an LLM [11] it would allow us to detect and mitigate "dishonesty" [17]. It would also help when supervising outputs that are difficult to understand as well as improving scientific understanding of the inner workings of LLMs. Importantly, this must be done without supervision because we lack a ground truth for what the model "knows", as opposed to what we know.

Contrast-consistent search (CCS) [9] is a prominent method proposed to address this problem by assuming that "knowledge" satisfies a consistency structure that few other features in an LLM are likely to satisfy. They use this consistency to construct a classifier which they claim detects a model's latent knowledge, a claim which is widely repeated in the literature (see Appendix B). We refute these claims by identifying classes of LLM features that also satisfy this consistency structure but are not knowledge. We prove two theorems: 1) a class of arbitrary binary classifiers are optimal under the CCS loss; 2) any classifier can be transformed to an arbitrary classifier with the same CCS loss. The upshot is that the CCS consistency structure is more than just slightly imprecise in identifying knowledge--it is compatible with arbitrary patterns.

We then show that other unsupervised methods in addition to CCS empirically do not discover knowledge, regardless of any inductive biases that might hypothetically be present. Two didactic experiments show that these methods can latch onto artificial distracting features instead of knowledge. Our third experiment moves towards realism by showing that these knowledge-discovery methods can latch onto implicit opinions. The fourth is almost fully natural: we show that the method's results are highly sensitive to reasonable prompt variants which have been used in the literature.

We conclude that existing unsupervised knowledge-discovery methods are insufficient in practice, and we propose principles for evaluating knowledge elicitation methods to prevent future "false-positives" in the literature. We hypothesise that our conclusions will generalise to more sophisticated methods, though perhaps not the exact experimental results: using different consistency structures of knowledge will likely suffer from similar issues to what we show here. Our key contributions are as follows:

* We prove that arbitrary features satisfy the CCS loss equally well.
* We show that unsupervised methods detect prominent features that are not knowledge.
* We show that the features discovered by unsupervised methods are sensitive to prompts and that we lack principled reasons to pick any particular prompt.

## 2 Background

**Contrastive LLM activations.** We focus on methods that train probes [1] using LLM activation data. This data is constructed using _contrast pairs_[9]. A contrast pair is a pair of strings with opposite 'claim' for some characteristic of interest which can be used to study the contrast in how an LLM represents that characteristic. For example, a contrast pair might be "Are cats mammals? Yes." and "Are cats mammals? No." Potentially, pairs like this could then be used to study how LLMs represent correctly/incorrectly answered questions.

Burns et al. [9] show how to generate such contrast pairs from a dataset of binary questions, \(Q=\{q_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}\), such as "Are cats mammals?" by, for example, appending "Yes." and "No." for a positive and negative member of a contrast pair \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\). The LLM's representations of each member of the pair can then be computed by looking at the activations from an intermediate layer after the sequence of tokens, \(\phi(x_{i}^{+})\) and \(\phi(x_{i}^{-})\). If one just looked at these activations, their differences might be dominated just by the presence of the tokens "Yes." or "No." Burns et al. [9] therefore propose a normalisation step which strips away the average effect of those tokens across the dataset: setting \(\tilde{\phi}(x_{i}^{+/-})\coloneqq(\phi(x_{i}^{+/-})-\mu^{+/-})/\sigma^{+/-}\) where \(\mu^{+/-},\sigma^{+/-}\) are \(\{\phi(x_{i}^{+/-})\}_{i=1}^{N}\)'s mean and standard deviation. This is meant to remove these tokens' unintended influence but prior work questions this, and some of our results also question this.

**Contrast-consistent Search (CCS) [9].** An unsupervised learning algorithm using contrast pairs constructed to reflect a characteristic of interest to recover the features of LLM activations that

Figure 1: **Prominent features distract unsupervised latent knowledge detectors** (see Section 4.2). **Left:** We apply two transformations to a dataset of movie reviews, \(\{q_{i}\}\). First (novel to us) we insert a distracting feature by appending either “Alice thinks it’s positive” or “Alice thinks it’s negative” at random to each question. Second, we create contrast pairs [9], \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\), appending “It is positive” or “It is negative” to each. **Middle:** The LLM activations for these strings are \(\phi(x_{i}^{+}),\phi(x_{i}^{-})\). **Right:** A PCA visualisation of the top-3 activation dimensions. Without “Alice...”, a classifier finds the review sentiment (orange/blue). But with “Alice...” a classifier finds Alice’s opinion (light/dark) ignoring review sentiment.

represent that characteristic. CCS uses the LLM's representations to predict correct labels, intending to study cases where the LLM's knowledge is true. CCS assumes that LLM knowledge representations are credences which follow probabilistic laws. Softly encoding this constraint, they minimise

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}=\sum\nolimits_{i=1}^{N}\overbrace{\left[p(x_{i}^{+})- (1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]^{2}}^{\mathcal{L}_{\text{gen}}}+\overbrace{\min\left\{ p(x_{i}^{+}),p(x_{i}^{-})\right\}^{2}}^{\mathcal{L}_{\text{gen}}}\] (1)

for a function from the normalised LLM activations from the contrast pairs: \(p(x)=\sigma(\theta^{T}\tilde{\phi}(x)+b)\) (a linear function with sigmoid). The motivation is that the \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{cons}}\) encourages negation-consistency (that a statement and its negation should have probabilities that add to one), and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{conf}}\) encourages confidence to avoid \(p(x_{i}^{+})\approx p(x_{i}^{-})\approx 0.5\). For inference on a question \(q_{i}\) the _average prediction_ is \(\tilde{p}(q_{i})=\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]/2\) and then the _induced classifier_ is \(f_{p}(q_{i})=\mathbf{I}\left[\tilde{p}(q_{i})>0.5\right]\). 1

Footnote 1: Because the predictor learns the contrast between activations, not absolute classes, Burns et al. [9] disambiguate by assuming that \(f_{p}(q_{i})=1\) to correspond to label \(a_{i}=1\) if the accuracy is greater than 0.5 (else it corresponds to \(a_{i}=0\)). We call this further step _truth-disambiguation_ and apply it to all methods similarly.

Activation clustering with PCA and k-means.We consider two other unsupervised learning methods. In both cases we cluster the _difference_ in contrastive activations, \(\{\tilde{\phi}(x_{i}^{+})-\tilde{\phi}(x_{i}^{-})\}_{i=1}^{N}\). In one case, these are clustered by applying principal component analysis (PCA) and thresholding the top component at 0 [9].2 The other clusters with k-means with two clusters.

Footnote 2: Emmons [16] point out that this is roughly 97-98% as effective as CCS according to the experiments in Burns et al. [9], suggesting that contrast pairs and standard unsupervised learning are doing much of the work, and CCS’s consistency loss may not be important. Our experiments largely agree with this finding—see Appendix D.6 for an additional experiment showing agreement between the predictions of these methods.

Logistic regression.As a supervised baseline, we use logistic regression on concatenated contrastive activations, \(\{(\tilde{\phi}(x_{i}^{+}),\tilde{\phi}(x_{i}^{-}))\}_{i=1}^{N}\) with labels \(a_{i}\), and treat this as a ceiling (since it uses labels).

Random baseline.We compare to a random baseline using a probe with random parameter values, treating that as a floor (as it does not learn from input data) [35]. Further details are in Appendix C.3.

## 3 Theoretical Results

Our theoretical results focus on CCS, showing that CCS's consistency structure isn't specific to knowledge. This implies that arguments for CCS's effectiveness cannot be grounded in conceptual or principled motivations from the loss construction. In later sections, we also address other methods which do not rely on these strong consistency assumptions and show that heuristic arguments grounded in inductive biases do not support using any of these as knowledge-discovery methods.

As illustration, consider the IMDb sentiment classification task [28]. A given question \(q_{i}\) considers whether a movie review has a particular _sentiment_, \(s(q_{i})\coloneqq\mathbf{I}\left[q_{i}\text{ has positive sentiment}\right]\), and is converted into a contrast pair of \(x_{i}^{+}\) and \(x_{i}^{-}\), each of which has a _claim_\(c(\cdot)\) about the sentiment. Specifically, \(c(x_{i}^{+})=1\), a claim that the sentiment is positive, and \(c(x_{i}^{-})=0\) for negative. The desired probe, \(p^{*}\), detecting the truth feature must check whether the sentiment and the claim agree. This can be done by XOR (denoted \(\oplus\)) of the sentiment and the claim:

\[p^{*}(x_{i}^{\pm})\coloneqq\mathbf{I}\left[x_{i}^{\pm}\text{ is false}\right]=s(q_{i})\oplus c(x_{i}^{\pm}).\] (2)

The induced probe for this feature is the sentiment as desired: \(f_{p^{*}}(q_{i})=s(q_{i})\). Our key insight is that the CCS loss is low just because of this XOR, not the sentiment, and so the same construction can work for arbitrary features of the question: given some feature \(h\), the probe \(p(x_{i}^{\pm})=h(q_{i})\oplus c(x_{i}^{\pm})\) gets low CCS loss and has an induced probe \(h\).

_Theorem 1_.: Let feature \(h:Q\rightarrow\{0,1\}\), be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\) be the contrast pair corresponding to question \(q_{i}\) and let \(c(x_{i}^{+})=1,c(x_{i}^{+})=0\). Then the probe defined as \(p(x_{i}^{\pm})=h(q_{i})\oplus c(x_{i}^{\pm})\) achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies \(\tilde{p}(q_{i})=h(q_{i})\).

That is, the classifier that CCS finds is under-specified: for _any_ binary feature, \(h\), on the questions, there is a probe with optimal CCS loss that induces that feature. The proof comes directly from inserting our constructive probes into the loss definition--equal terms cancel to zero (see Appendix A).

In Thm. 1, the probe \(p\) is binary since \(h\) is binary, but in practice probe outputs are produced by a sigmoid and so are in \((0,1)\). Can we say anything about this setting? We show that it is possible to transform a soft probe for one feature into a soft probe for any other arbitrary feature. In the binary case, the desired probe for feature \(h_{1}\) is \(p_{1}=h_{1}\oplus c\), and the desired probe for \(h_{2}\) is \(h_{2}\oplus c\). So, we have \(p_{2}=p_{1}\oplus h_{1}\oplus h_{2}\). To generalize this to soft probes, we extend \(\oplus\) as follows:

\[(a\oplus b)(x)\coloneqq[1-a(x)]\,b(x)+[1-b(x)]\,a(x).\] (3)

In addition, we correct the CCS loss to fix an unmotivated downwards bias in the loss proposed by Burns et al. [9] (see Appendix A.2). We also use this symmetrized loss in our experiments. After this, the transformation between probes works as desired, proving that there is an arbitrary classifier encoded by a probe with identical CCS loss to the original:

_Theorem 2_.: Let \(g:Q\rightarrow\{0,1\}\), be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\) be the contrast pair corresponding to question \(q_{i}\). Let \(p\) be a probe, whose average result \(\tilde{p}=0.5\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]\) induces a classifier \(f_{p}(q_{i})=\mathbf{I}\left[\tilde{p}(q_{i})>0.5\right]\). Define the transformed probe \(p^{\prime}(x_{i}^{\pm})=p(x_{i}^{\pm})\oplus[f_{p}(q_{i})\oplus g(q_{i})]\). Then \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p^{\prime})=\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p)\) and \(p^{\prime}\) induces the classifier \(f_{p^{\prime}}(q_{i})=g(q_{i})\).

However, which probe is actually learned depends on inductive biases; these could depend on the prompt, optimization algorithm, or model choice. These theorems prove that optimal arbitrary probes exist, but not necessarily that they are actually learned or that they are expressible in the probe's function space. But for inductive biases, no robust argument ensures the desired behaviour. The feature that is most prominent--favoured by inductive biases--could turn out to be knowledge, but it could equally turn out to be the contrast-pair mapping itself (which is partly removed by normalisation) or anything else. We do not have any theoretical reason to think that CCS discovers knowledge probes. In fact, experimentally, we now show that, in practice, several methods including CCS often discover probes for features other than knowledge.

## 4 Experiments

Our experiments a structured didactically. We begin with simplified experiments that use unrealistic but clear-cut interventions to develop understanding, gradually increasing realism. Section 4.4 closes with an experiment that uses entirely natural prompts that have been used by others, demonstrating that these issues appear in practice. Unless otherwise noted, experiments follow details below.

**Datasets.** We investigate three datasets used by Burns et al. [9].3 The IMDb dataset of movie reviews classifies positive/negative sentiment [28], BoolQ [13] answers yes/no questions about a passage, DBpedia [3] is text topic-classification. Prompt templates for each dataset are in Appendix C.1.4

Footnote 3: Others were excluded for legal reasons or because Burns et al. [9] found low predictive accuracy on them.

**Language Models.** We use three different language models. To directly compare to Burns et al. [9] we use T5-11B, [34] with 11 billion parameters. We further use an instruction fine-tuned version of T5-11B called T5-FLAN-XXL, [12] to understand the effect of instruction fine-tuning. Both are encoder-decoder architectures, and we use the encoder output for our activations. We also use Chinchilla-70B [21], with 70 billion parameters, which is larger scale, and a decoder-only architecture. We take activations from layer 30 (of 80) of this model, though see Appendix D.2.3 for results on other layers, often giving similar results. Notably, K-means and PCA have good performance at layer 30 with less seed-variance than CCS, suggesting contrast pairs and standard unsupervised learning, rather than the CCS consistency structure, are key (see Footnote 2).

**Experiment Setup.** In each experiment we compare a default setting which is the same/similar to that used in [9] to a modified setting that we introduce in order to show an effect - differing only in their text prompt. We then generate contrastive activations and train probes using the methods in Section 2: CCS, PCA, k-means, random and logistic regression. Training details can be found in Appendix C.3. For each method we use 50 random seeds. Our figures in general come in two types: violin plots which compare the accuracy of different methods; and three-dimensional PCA projections of the activations to visualise how they are grouped. We show one dataset and model, other datasets and models, shown in the appendix, are similar except where discussed.

### Discovering random words

Motivated by our theoretical results, we first introduce a distracting binary feature and show the unsupervised methods discover this feature rather than knowledge. We focus here on IMDB and Chinchilla (see Appendix D.1 for other datasets and models with similar results). Our default prompts use the standard template from Burns et al. [9] inserting different reviews and labels "positive" or "negative".

Our modified prompts further append a full stop and space, then one of two random words, "Banana" and "Shed". In the language of Thm. 1 we take a random partition of question indices, \(\{1,\dots,N\}=I_{0}\cup I_{1}\), with \(|I_{0}|=|I_{1}|\), and set the binary feature \(h\) such that \(h(q_{i})=0\) for \(i\in I_{0}\) and \(h(q_{i})=1\) for for \(i\in I_{1}\). "Banana" is inserted if \(h(q_{i})=0\), and "Shed" is inserted if \(h(q_{i})=1\). See Figure 1 for illustration - though here we append "Banana" or "Shed" to the end, rather than inserting "Alice...".

Our results are shown in Figure 1(a), displaying accuracy of each method (x-axis groups). Default prompts are blue and modified banana/shed prompts are red. We look at the standard ground-truth accuracy metric (dark), as well as a modified accuracy metric that measures whether Banana or Shed was inserted (light). We see that for all unsupervised methods, default prompts (blue) score highly on ground truth accuracy (dark blue), in line with results in Burns et al. [9]. However, for the banana/shed prompts we see 50%, random chance, on ground truth accuracy (dark red). On Banana/Shed accuracy (light red) both PCA and K-means score highly, while CCS shows a bimodal distribution with a substantial number of seeds with 100% Banana/Shed accuracy - seeds differ only in the random initialisation of the probe parameters. The takeaway is that CCS and other unsupervised methods do not optimise for ground-truth knowledge, but rather track whatever feature (in this case, banana/shed) is most prominent in the activations.

Figure 1(b) shows a visualisation of the top three components of PCA for the default (left) and modified (right) prompts. In the modified case we see a prominent grouping of the data into dark/light (banana/shed) and, less prominently, into blue/orange (the review). This provides visual evidence that both features (ground-truth and banana/shed) are represented, but the one which is most prominent in this case is banana/shed, in correspondence with Figure 1(a).

### Discovering an explicit opinion

It is unlikely that such a drastic feature, ending with "Banana"/"Shed", would actually exist in a real dataset. These words had nothing to do with the rest of the text. In our second experiment we make a more realistic modification: inserting a character's explicit opinion of whether the review is positive or negative. What we will find is that the unsupervised methods learn to predict the character's opinion, instead of the sentiment of the actual review, presumably by learning a probe that detects whether the claimed sentiment agrees with the character's opinion.

Figure 2: **Discovering random words. Chinchilla, IMDb. (a) The methods distinguish whether the prompts end with banana/shed rather than the review sentiment. (b) PCA visualisation of top-3 activation dimensions, in default (left) and modified (right) settings, shows the clustering into banana/shed (light/dark) rather than review sentiment (blue/orange).**

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

In the modified setting5, Alice answers the few-shot examples correctly, except when topic is company - and in that case gives explanations like "[...] Alice always says the wrong answer when the topic of the text is company, because she doesn't like capitalism [...]". What we are looking for is what the unsupervised methods predict on the final example when Alice has not yet stated an opinion: will it predict the correct answer, ignoring how Alice previously answered incorrectly about company; or will it predict Alice's opinion, answering incorrectly about company?

Footnote 5: Full prompt templates are provided in Appendix C.1.3, Implicit Opinion: Default and Anti-capitalist.

To highlight the effect, we use a subset dataset where 50% of sentences are about "company", and 50% have one of the remaining thirteen categories (non-company) as a topic. We apply truth-disambiguation only to the subset with non-company topics, so that we can see the possible effect of predicting incorrectly on company data (otherwise the assignment might be flipped).

Our results are shown in Figure 4. We look at default prompts (blue) and modified prompts (red) and split the data into whether the topic is company (dark) or non-company (light) and look at the standard ground-truth accuracy metric. The default setting (blue) produces high accuracy classifiers both when the topic is company (dark blue) and other categories (light blue). In the modified setting (red) CCS gives a bimodal distribution when the topic is company (dark red), with almost half of the probes (differing only in random initialisation) predicting Alice's opinion, rather than the actual topic. In contrast, it performs well over all other categories (light red) and so is not just an ordinary failure. Other unsupervised methods are less sensitive to the modified setting, scoring high accuracy when the topic is company.

However, when we visualise the first three PCA dimensions of the contrast pair activations (Figure 3(b)) we see four distinct clusters in the modified prompt case (right) showing how a detector might cluster either the actual topic choice (orange vs blue) or based on the data subset: non-company vs company (light vs dark). This shows these methods are still sensitive to the modified setting, which was not evident from the accuracy metric alone.

### Prompt template sensitivity

The next experiment is more natural because, rather than introducing a feature deliberately, we examine three natural prompt templates which have appeared in the literature and show how these change the discovered feature. We use TruthfulQA [26], a difficult question answering dataset which exploits the fact that LLMs tend to repeat common misconceptions.

Figure 4: **Discovering an implicit opinion.** (a) Default (blue) and modified (red) for company (dark) and non-company (light) data. The modified setting on company data (dark red) leads to a bimodal distribution for CCS with almost half of the probes (differing only in random initialisation) learning Alice’s opinion. In contrast, it performs relatively well over all other categories (light red). (b) PCA: Left – default activations show a possible separation along X-axis corresponding to topic choice (blue vs. orange) and further separation into company/non-company (light/dark). Right – modified activations show a more pronounced company/non-company split. All results are for Chinchilla 70B.

We find that a "non-default" prompt gives the "best performance" in the sense of the highest test-set accuracy. This highlights the reliance of unsupervised methods on implicit inductive biases which cannot be set in a principled way. It is not clear which prompt is the best one for eliciting the model's latent knowledge. Given that the choice of prompt appears to be a free variable with significant effect on the outcomes, conceptual motivations for the loss do not imply a principled foundation for the resulting classifier.

Our prompt templates can be found in Appendix C.1.4. Our "default" template is adapted directly from Burns et al. [9]. Two modified templates are adapted from Lin et al. [26]6 in which a Professor character is instructed to interpret questions literally. We used this text verbatim inserted into an instructing template in order to make sure that we were looking at natural prompts that people might ordinarily use without trying to see a specific result. We also try a "literal" prompt, removing explicitly mentioning a Professor, in case explicitly invoking a character matters.

Footnote 6: Lin et al. [26] found LLM generation performance improved using this prompt.

Results are shown in Figure 4(a) for Chinchilla70B. The default setting (blue) gives worse accuracy than the literal/professor (red, green) settings, especially for PCA and k-means. PCA visualisations are shown in Figure 4(b), coloured by whether the question is True/False, in the default (left), literal (middle) and professor (right) settings. We see clearer clusters in the literal/professor settings. Other models are shown in Appendix D.4, with less systematic differences between prompts, though the accuracy for K-means in the Professor prompt for T5-FLAN-XXL are clearly stronger than others.

## 5 Related Work

We want to detect when an LLM is dishonest [23; 2; 32], outputting text which contradicts its encoded knowledge [17]. An important part of this is to elicit latent knowledge from a model [11]. There has been some debate as to whether LLMs "know/believe" anything [6; 37; 24] but, for us, the important thing is that something in an LLM's weights causes it to make consistently successful predictions, and we would like to access that. Zou et al. [40] train unsupervised probes for a range of concepts including honesty, using pairs which need not take opposite truth values (as in Burns et al. [9]). Belrose et al. [5] use unsupervised probes on intermediate LLM layers to elicit latent _predictions_. Others (see [19] and references therein) aim to detect when a model has knowledge/beliefs about the world, to improve truthfulness.

Contrast-consistent search (CCS) [9] attempts to elicit latent knowledge using unsupervised learning on contrastive LLM activations (see Section 2), claiming that knowledge has special structure that can be used as an objective function which, when optimised, will discover latent knowledge. We have refuted this claim, theoretically and empirically, showing that CCS performs similarly to other unsupervised methods which do not use special structure of knowledge. Emmons [16] also observe

Figure 5: **Prompt sensitivity on TruthfulQA [26] for Chinchilla70B. (a) In default setting (blue), accuracy is poor. When in the literal/professor (red, green) setting, accuracy improves, showing the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant aspects of a prompt. (b) PCA of the activations based on ground truth, blue vs. orange, in the default (left), literal (middle) and professor (right) settings. We see do not see ground truth clusters by default, but see this with other prompts.**

this from the empirical data provided in [9]. Huben [22] hypothesises there could be many truth-like features, due to LLMs ability to role-play [38], which a method like CCS might find. Roger [35] discover multiple knowledge-like classifiers. Levinstein and Herrmann [24] finds that CCS sometimes learns features uncorrelated with truth, arguing that consistency alone cannot guarantee truth. Fry et al. [18] modify CCS to improve accuracy despite probes clustering around 0.5, casting doubt on the probabilistic interpretation of CCS probes. In contrast to all these works, we prove theoretically that CCS does not optimise for knowledge, and show empirically what non-knowledge features CCS instead finds.

Our focus in this paper has been on unsupervised learning, though several other methods to train probes to discover latent knowledge use supervised learning [4; 25; 29; 39; 14]. Following Burns et al. [9] we also reported results using a supervised logistic regression baseline, which we have found to work well on all our experiments, and which is simpler than in those cited works. Our result is analogous to the finding that disentangled representations seemingly cannot be identified without supervision [27]. There are also attempts to detect dishonesty by supervised learning on LLM outputs under conditions that produce honest or dishonest generations [31]. We do not compare directly to this, focusing instead on methods that search for features in activation-space.

## 6 Discussion and Conclusion

General principles.The specific experiments we use are tailored to the methods that we are evaluating. But they instantiate more general principles, which we provide in order to help future work catch similar issues. A proposed method should:

1. be invariant under irrelevant transformations of the prompt;
2. not be sensitive to specific personas;
3. should explain why and when inductive biases make the model's knowledge most salient;
4. should not be easily distracted by a non-knowledge feature.

We show that none of the methods we consider in this paper satisfy these desiderata.

Limitation: generalizability to future methods.Our experiments can only focus on current methods. Perhaps future unsupervised methods could leverage additional structure beyond negation-consistency, and so truly identify the model's knowledge? While we expect that such methods could avoid the most trivial distractors, we speculate that they will nonetheless be vulnerable to similar critiques. The main reason is that we expect powerful models to be able to simulate the beliefs of other agents [38]. Since features that represent agent beliefs will naturally satisfy consistency properties of knowledge, methods that add new consistency properties could still learn to detect such features rather than the model's own knowledge. Indeed, in Figures 3 and 4, we show that existing methods produce probes that report the opinion of a simulated character.7

Footnote 7: Note that we do not know whether the feature we extract tracks the beliefs of the simulated character: there are clear alternative hypotheses that explain our results. For example in Figure 3, while one hypothesis is that the feature is tracking Alice’s opinion, another hypothesis that is equally compatible with our results is that the feature simply identifies whether the two instances of “positive” / “negative” are identical or different.

Another response could be to acknowledge that there will be _some_ such features, but they will be few in number, and so you can enumerate them and identify the one that represents the model's knowledge [8]. Conceptually, we disagree: language models can represent _many_ features [15], and it seems likely that features representing the beliefs of other agents would be quite useful to language models. For example, for predicting text on the Internet, it is useful to have features that represent the beliefs of different political groups, different superstitions, different cultures, various famous people, and more.

Conclusion.Existing unsupervised methods are insufficient for discovering latent knowledge, though constructing contrastive activations may still serve as a useful interpretability tool. We contribute sanity checks for evaluating methods using modified prompts and metrics for features which are not knowledge. Unsupervised approaches have to overcome the identification issues we outline, while supervised approaches have the problem of requiring accurate human labels even in the case of models that know things human overseers do not. The relative difficulty of each remains unclear. Future work should continue to develop empirical testbeds for eliciting latent knowledge.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the proof and series of experiments as described, alongside the sanity checks and conceptual arguments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Limitations are discussed in the final section while assumptions are discussed in the context of the theorems that depend on them. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The assumptions and proofs are provided in detail in the appendices. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We fully describe the methods used and all prompts are provided in the appendix. The main results are reproducible with publicly available models, although the non-publicly available Chinchilla 70B model results are not reproducible. The datasets are all publicly available and their curation and formatting steps are described. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We are unable to make our code available because of proprietary dependencies, but publicly available code already exists implementing several of the key methods and could be modified by external researchers. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted. 6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: These details are provided in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All figures display a full scatter plot and density estimator violin. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments?

Answer: [No] Justification: These details depend on proprietary configurations and set-ups that are not directly transferable to other contexts.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research follows the code of ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
* If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
* The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: We do not foresee a negative social impact to understanding the limitations of existing methods in use. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: There are no such risks of misuse. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The original owners are properly credited where used. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No human subjects were used. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: No human subjects were used. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

## Appendix A Proof of theorems

### Proof of Theorem 1

We'll first consider the proof of Thm. 1.

_Theorem 1_.: Let feature \(h:Q\rightarrow\{0,1\}\), be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outcomes. Let \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\) be the contrast pair corresponding to question \(q_{i}\) and let \(c(x_{i}^{+})=1,c(x_{i}^{+})=0\). Then the probe defined as \(p(x_{i}^{\pm})=h(q_{i})\oplus c(x_{i}^{\pm})\) achieves optimal loss, and the averaged prediction satisfies \(\tilde{p}(q_{i})=h(q_{i})\).

Proof.: We'll show each term of \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}\) is zero:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{cons}} =\big{[}p(x_{i}^{+})-(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\big{]}^{2}\] (4) \[=[h(q_{i})-[1-\{1-h(q_{i})\}]]^{2}\] (5) \[=0\] (6) \[\mathcal{L}_{\text{conf}} =\min\big{\{}p(x_{i}^{+}),p(x_{i}^{-})\big{\}}^{2}\] (7) \[=\min\{h(q_{i}),1-h(q_{i})\}^{2}\] (8) \[=0\] (9)

where on the second line we've used the property that \(h(q_{i})\) is binary. So the overall loss is zero (which is optimal). Finally, the averaged probe is

\[\tilde{p}(q_{i}) =\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]\] (11) \[=\frac{1}{2}\Big{[}h(q_{i})+[1-\{1-h(q_{i})\}]\Big{]}=h(q_{i}).\] (12)

### Symmetry correction for CCS Loss

Due to a quirk in the formulation of CCS, \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{conf}}\) only checks for confidence by searching for probe outputs near 0, while ignoring probe outputs near 1. This leads to an overall downwards bias: for example, if the probe must output a constant, that is \(p(x)=k\) for some constant \(k\), then the CCS loss is minimized when \(k=0.4\)[35, footnote 3], instead of being symmetric around \(0.5\). But there is no particular reason that we would _want_ a downward bias. We can instead modify the confidence loss to make it symmetric:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{conf}}^{\text{sym}}=\min\big{\{}p(x_{i}^{+}),p(x_{i}^{-}), 1-p(x_{i}^{+}),1-p(x_{i}^{-})\big{\}}^{2}\] (13)

This then eliminates the downwards bias: for example, if the probe must output a constant, the symmetric CCS loss is minimized at \(k=0.4\) and \(k=0.6\), which is symmetric around \(0.5\). In the following theorem (and all our experiments) we use this symmetric form of the CCS loss.

### Proof of Theorem 2

We'll now consider Thm. 2, using the symmetric CCS loss. To prove Thm. 2 we'll first need a lemma.

**Lemma 1**.: _Let \(p\) be a probe, which has an induced classifier \(f_{p}(q_{i})=\mathbf{I}\left[\tilde{p}(q_{i})>0.5\right]\), for averaged prediction \(\tilde{p}(q_{i})=\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]\). Let \(h:Q\rightarrow\{0,1\}\), be an arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Define \(p^{\prime}(x_{i}^{\pm})=p(x_{i}^{\pm})\oplus h(q_{i})\). Then \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p^{\prime})=\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p)\) and \(p^{\prime}\) has the induced classifier \(f_{p^{\prime}}(q_{i})=f_{p}(q_{i})\oplus h(q_{i})\)._

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

Case \(h(q_{i})=1\):

\[f_{p^{\prime}}(q_{i}) =\mathbf{I}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left[1-p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-(1-p(x_{i}^{-})) )\right]>0.5\right]\] (40) \[=\mathbf{I}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{-})+(1-p(x_{i}^{+})) \right]>0.5\right]\] (41) \[=\mathbf{I}\left[1-\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}) )\right]>0.5\right]\] (42) \[=\mathbf{I}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-})) \right]\leq 0.5\right]\] (43) \[=1-\mathbf{I}\left[\frac{1}{2}\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}) )\right]>0.5\right]\] (44) \[=1-f_{p}(q_{i})\] (45) \[=(f_{p}\oplus h)(q_{i})\] (46)

Which gives the result, \(f_{p^{\prime}}(q_{i})=(f_{p}\oplus h)(q_{i})\). 

We are now ready to prove Thm. 2.

_Theorem 2_.: Let \(g:Q\rightarrow\{0,1\}\), be any arbitrary map from questions to binary outputs. Let \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\) be the contrast pair corresponding to question \(q_{i}\). Let \(p\) be a probe, whose average result \(\tilde{p}=0.5\left[p(x_{i}^{+})+(1-p(x_{i}^{-}))\right]\) induces a classifier \(f_{p}(q_{i})=\mathbf{I}\left[\tilde{p}(q_{i})>0.5\right]\). Define the transformed probe \(p^{\prime}(x_{i}^{\pm})=p(x_{i}^{\pm})\oplus[f_{p}(q_{i})\oplus g(q_{i})]\). Then \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p^{\prime})=\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p)\) and \(p^{\prime}\) induces the classifier \(f_{p^{\prime}}(q_{i})=g(q_{i})\).

Proof.: We begin with the loss. Note that \((f_{p}\oplus g)(q_{i})\) is binary, since \(f_{p}\) and \(g\) are binary, so we can apply Lemma 1 with \(h(q_{i})=(f_{p}\oplus g)(q_{i})\), which leads to the result: \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p^{\prime})=\mathcal{L}_{\text{CCS}}(p)\). Now the induced classifier.

\[f_{p^{\prime}} =f_{p}\oplus h\quad\text{by Lemma 1}\] (47) \[=f_{p}\oplus(f_{p}\oplus g)\] (48) \[=g\] (49)

where the last line can be deduced via addition \((\bmod 2)\), since \(f_{p}\) and \(g\) are binary and \(\oplus\) reduces to the xor operator on binary inputs. 

## Appendix B Review of CCS discussion in the literature

Although understanding the positioning of work in the context of the literature can be complicated, here we demonstrate that CCS as a proposed method for discovering latent knowledge has not faced questions along the lines this paper proposes at time of writing. In Table 1, we review the 20 most-cited papers citing CCS according to Google Scholar at time of writing (26 March 2024). We find that the concerns we raise are overlooked by the current literature.

### Dataset details

We now give details on the process through which we generate the activation data. First we tokenize the data according the usual specifications of each model (e.g. for T5 we use the T5 tokenizer, for Chinchilla we use the Chinchilla tokeniser). We prepend with a BOS token, right-pad, and we do not use EOS token. We take the activation corresponding to the last token in a given layer - layer 30 for Chinchilla unless otherwise stated, and the encoder output for T5 models. We use normalisation as in Burns et al. [9], taking separate normalisation for each prompt template and using the average standard deviation per dimension with division taken element-wise. We use a context length of 512 and filter the data by removing the pair \((x_{i}^{+},x_{i}^{-})\) when the token length for either \(x_{i}^{+}\) or \(x_{i}^{-}\) exceeds this context length. Our tasks are multiple choice, and we balance our datasets to have equal numbers of these binary labels, unless stated otherwise. For Chinchilla we harvest activations in bfloat16 format and then cast them to float32 for downstream usage. For T5 we harvest activations at float32.

### Method Training Details

We now give further details for the training of our various methods. Each method uses 50 random seeds.

#### c.3.1 Ccs

We use the symmetric version of the confidence loss, see Equation (13). We use a linear probe with \(m\) weights, \(\theta\), and a single bias, \(b\), where \(m\) is the dimension of the activation, followed by a sigmoid function. We use Haiku's [20] default initializer for the linear layer: for \(\theta\) a truncated normal with standard deviation \(1/\sqrt{m}\), and \(b=0\). We use the following hyperparameters: we train with full batch; for Chinchilla models we use a learning rate of \(0.001\), for T5 models, \(0.01\). We use AdamW optimizer with weight decay of \(0\). We train for \(1000\) epochs. We report results on all seeds as we are interested in the overall robustness of the methods (note the difference to Burns et al. [9] which only report seed with lowest CCS loss).

#### c.3.2 Pca

We use the Scikit-learn [33] implementation of PCA, with 3 components, and the randomized SVD solver. We take the classifier to be based around whether the projected datapoint has top component greater than zero. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair activations.

#### c.3.3 K-means

We use the Scikit-learn [33] implementation of K-means, with two clusters and random initialiser. For input data we take the difference between contrast pair activations.

#### c.3.4 Random

This follows the CCS method setup above, but doesn't do any training, just evaluates using a probe with randomly initialised parameters (as initialised in the CCS method).

#### c.3.5 Logistic Regression

We use the Scikit-learn [33] implementation of Logistic Regression, with liblinear solver and using a different random shuffling of the data based on random seed. For input data we concatenate the contrast pair activations. We report training accuracy.

## Appendix D Further Results

### Discovering random words

Here we display results for the discovering random words experiments using datasets IMDb, BoolQ and DBpedia and on each model. For Chinchilla-70BoolQ and DBPedia see Figure 6 (for IMDb see Figure 2). We see that BoolQ follows a roughly similar pattern to IMDb, except that the default ground truth accuracy is not high (BoolQ is arguably a more challenging task). DBpedia shows more of a noisy pattern which is best explained by first inspecting the PCA visualisation for the modified prompt (right): there are groupings into both choice 1 true/false (blue orange) which is more prominent and sits along the top principal component (x-axis), and also a grouping into banana/shed (dark/light), along second component (y-axis). This is reflected in the PCA and K-means performance here doing well on ground-truth accuracy. CCS is similar, but more bimodal, sometimes finding the ground-truth, and sometimes the banana/shed feature.

For T5-11B (Figure 7) on IMDB and BoolQ we see a similar pattern of results to Chinchilla, though with lower accuracies. On DBpedia, all of the results are around random chance, though logistic regression is able to solve the task, meaning this information is linearly encoded but perhaps not salient enough for the unsupervised methods to pick up.

T5-FLAN-XXL (Figure 8) shows more resistance to our modified prompt, suggesting fine-tuning hardens the activations in such a way that unsupervised learning can still recover knowledge. ForCCS though in particular, we do see a bimodal distribution, sometimes learning the banana/shed feature.

### Discovering an explicit opinion

#### d.2.1 Other models and datasets

Here we display results for the experiments on discovering an explicit opinion using datasets IMDB, BoolQ and DBpedia, and models Chinchilla-70B (Figure 9), T5-11B (Figure 10) and T5-FLAN-XXL (Figure 11). For Chinchilla-70B and T5 we use just a single mention of Alice's view, and for T5-FLAN-XXL we use five, since for a single mention the effect is not strong enough to see the effect, perhaps due to instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL. The next appendix D.2.2 ablates the number of mentions of Alice's view. Overall we see a similar pattern in all models and datasets, with unsupervised methods most often finding Alice's view, though for T5-FLAN-XXL the CCS results are more bimodal in the modified prompt case.

#### d.2.2 Number of Repetitions

In this appendix we present an ablation on the discovering explicit opinion experiment from Section 4.2. We vary the number of times the speaker repeats their opinion from 0 to 7 (see Appendix C.1 Explicit opinion variants), and in Figure 12 plot the accuracy in the method predicting the speaker's view. We see that for Chinchilla and T5, only one repetition is enough for the method to track the speaker's opinion. T5-FLAN-XXL requires more repetitions, but eventually shows the same pattern. We suspect that the instruction-tuning of T5-FLAN-XXL is responsible for making this model somewhat more robust.

Figure 6: Discovering random words, Chinchilla, extra datasets: Top: BoolQ, Bottom: DBpedia.

#### d.2.3 Model layer

We now look at whether the layer, in the Chinchilla70B model, affects our results. We consider both the ground-truth accuracy on default setting, Figure 13, and Alice Accuracy under the modified setting (with one mention of Alice's view), Figure 14. Overall, we find our results are not that sensitive to layer, though often layer 30 is a good choice for both standard and sycophantic templates. In the main paper we always use layer 30. In the default setting, Figure 13, we see overall k-means and PCA are better or the same as CCS. This is further evidence that the success of unsupervised learning on contrastive activations has little to do with the consitency structure of CCS. In modified

Figure 7: Discovering random words, T5 11B. Top: IMDB, Middle: BoolQ, Bottom: DBpedia.

setting, we see all layers suffer the same issue of predicting Alice's view, rather than the desired accuracy.

### Discovering an implicit opinion

In this appendix we display further results for Section 4.3 on discovering an implicit opinion. Figure 15 displays the results on the T5-11B (top) and T5-FLAN-XXL (bottom) models. For T5-11B we see CCS, under both default and modified prompts, performs at about 60% on non-company questions, and much better on company questions. The interpretation is that this probe has mostly

Figure 8: Discovering random words, T5-FLAN-XXL. Top: IMDB, Middle: BoolQ, Bottom: DBpedia.

learnt to classify whether a topic is company or not (but not to distinguish between the other thirteen categories). PCA and K-means are similar, though with less variation amongst seeds (showing less bimodal behaviour). PCA visualisation doesn't show any natural groupings.

For T5-FLAN-XXL the accuracies are high on both default and modified prompts for both company and non-company questions. We suspect that a similar trick as in the case of explicit opinion, repeating the opinion, may work here, but we leave investigation of this to future work. PCA visualisation shows some natural groups, with the top principal component showing a grouping based on whether choice 1 is true or false (blue/orange), but also that there is a second grouping based on company/non-company (dark/light). This suggests it is more luck that the most prominent direction here is choice 1 is true or false, but could easily have been company/non-company (dark/light).

### Prompt Template Sensitivity - Other Models

In Figure 16 we show results for the prompt sensitivity experiments on the truthfulQA dataset, for the other models T5-FLAN-XXL (top) and T5-11B (bottom). We see similar results as in the main text for Chinchilla70B. For T5 all of the accuracies are lower, mostly just performing at chance, and the PCA plots do not show natural groupings by true/false.

### Number of Prompt templates

In the main experiments for this paper we use a single prompt template for simplicity and to isolate the differences between the default and modified prompt template settings. We also investigated the effect of having multiple prompt templates, as in [9], see Figure 17. Overall we do not see a major effect. On BoolQ we see a single template is slightly worse for Chinchilla70B and T5, but the same for T5-FLAN-XXL. For IMDB on Chinchilla a single template is slightly better than multiple, with

Figure 9: Discovering an explicit opinion, Chinchilla, extra datasets. Top: BoolQ, Bottom: DBpedia.

less variation across seeds. For DBPedia on T5, a single template is slightly better. Other results are roughly the same.

### Agreement between unsupervised methods

Burns et al. [9] claim that knowledge has special structure that few other features in an LLM are likely to satisfy and use this to motivate CCS. CCS aims to take advantage of this consistency structure, while PCA ignores it entirely. Nevertheless, we find that CCS and PCA8 make similar predictions. We calculate the proportion of datapoints where both methods agree, shown in Figure 18 as a heatmap according to their agreement. There is higher agreement (top-line number) in all cases than what one would expect from independent methods (notated "Ind:") with the observed accuracies (shown in Figure 10).

Footnote 8: PCA and k-means performed similarly in all our experiments so we chose to only focus on PCA here

When in the literal/professor (red, green) setting, accuracy improves, showing the unsupervised methods are sensitive to irrelevant aspects of a prompt.

## 6 Conclusion

Figure 18: **CCS and PCA make similar predictions.** In all cases, CCS and PCA agree more than what one would expect of independent methods with the same accuracy. Annotations in each cell show the agreement, the expected agreement for independent methods, and the (CCS, PCA) accuracies, averaged across 10 CCS seeds.
