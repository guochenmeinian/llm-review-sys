###### Abstract

3D Gaussian Splitting has shown fast and high-quality rendering results in static scenes by leveraging dense 3D prior and explicit representations. Unfortunately, the benefits of the prior and representation do not involve novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Ironically, this is because the main barrier is the reliance on them, which requires increasing training and rendering times to account for dynamic motions. In this paper, we design Explicit 4D Gaussian Splatting (Ex4DGS). Our key idea is to firstly separate static and dynamic Gaussians during training, and to explicitly sample positions and rotations of the dynamic Gaussians at sparse timestamps. The sampled positions and rotations are then interpolated to represent both spatially and temporally continuous motions of objects in dynamic scenes as well as reducing computational cost. Additionally, we introduce a progressive training scheme and a point-backtracking technique that improves Ex4DGS's convergence. We initially train Ex4DGS using short timestamps and progressively extend timestamps, which makes it work well with a few point clouds. The point-backtracking is used to quantify the cumulative error of each Gaussian over time, enabling the detection and removal of erroneous Gaussians in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments on various scenes demonstrate the state-of-the-art rendering quality from our method, achieving fast rendering of 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU.

## 1 Introduction

The recent flood of video content has encouraged view synthesis techniques for highly engaging, visually rich content creation to maintain viewer interest. However, even short form videos require a huge time for both data pre-processing, computing frame-wise 3D point clouds, and training time in novel view synthesis for dynamic motions. Furthermore, these techniques must be considered for running on mobile devices which have a limited computing power and storage space. In this aspect, it is crucial to not only achieve photorealistic rendering results, but also reduce the computational cost related to storage, memory and rendering pipeline. To achieve this, the spatio-temporal representation should be explicit and efficient to handle the complexity of dynamic motions in videos.

Recent methods for dynamic view synthesis are typically based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [1], which uses implicit multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with a combination of 5-DoF spatial coordinates and the additional time axis [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The MLP-based methods have shown high-fidelity rendering quality. However, the inevitable cost of decoding the implicit representation makes rendering critically slow. Various methods try to reduce the cost by adapting explicit representation, such as voxel [9, 10] and matrix decomposition [11, 12]. Nevertheless, since NeRF-based approaches require per-pixel ray sampling and dense sampling for each ray, it is hard to achieve real-time and high-resolution renderings.

Meanwhile, a promising alternative, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) [13], has emerged, which achieves photo-realistic rendering results with significantly faster training and rendering speeds.

Unlike NeRF-based approaches, 3DGS exploits fully explicit point-based primitives of 3D and employs a rasterization-based rendering pipeline. Recent advances [14; 15] attempt to extend 3DGS to 4D domain, handling the motion over time by storing the additional transformation information of 3D coordinates or 4D bases. However, these methods can only be trained under a restricted condition with dense point clouds. Moreover, these approaches borrow implicit representations for implementation, which lose the inherent advantage of 3DGS and make real-world applications more difficult. To become a more scalable model for real-world situations, it is important to be trained under more in-the-wild conditions (i.e., sparse point cloud) with more concise representation.

In this paper, we present Explicit 4D Gaussian Splitting (Ex4DGS), a keyframe interpolation-based 4D Gaussian splatting method that works well in a fully explicit on-time domain. Our key idea is to apply interpolation techniques under temporal explicit representation to realize the scalable 3DGS model. Temporal interpolation is a widely used technique in computer graphics [16] that only stores keyframe information in video and determines smooth transitions for the rest of the frames. We select keyframes with sparse time intervals and save the additional temporal information at each keyframe which includes each Gaussian's position, rotation and opacity. This information is fully explicit; it is stored without any encoding process, and continuous motion is calculated to have smooth temporal transitions between adjacent keyframes. Here, we use a polynomial basis interpolator for position, a spherical interpolator for rotation, and a simplified Gaussian mixture model for opacity. Specifically, the polynomial basis of cubic Hermite spline (CHip) [17] is used to effectively avoid overfitting or over-smoothing problems by spanning low-degree polynomials. For rotation, we introduce Spherical Linear Interpolation (Slerp) [18] to do a linear transition over angles. Lastly, we introduce a simplified Gaussian mixture model, which allows temporal opacity to handle the appearance and disappearance of objects.

For further optimization, we reduce the computational cost by isolating dynamic points from static points, and only storing additional temporal information of dynamic points. Here, we aim for this separation to be possible without any additional inputs such as object masks [19]. To tackle this, we introduce motion-based triggers to distinguish static and dynamic points in a scene. We first initialize all Gaussian points in a scene to be static which are assumed to move linearly. During training, static points with large movements are automatically classified as dynamic points. Next, we adopt a progressive training scheme to train our model even under sparse point cloud conditions. The progressive training, starting with a short duration and scaling up, can prevent falling into local minima by reducing the sudden appearance of objects. Lastly, an additional point backtracking technique is introduced to enhance rendering quality. Detecting redundant points in a dynamic scene is challenging because we need to consider all visible timestamps. To measure accumulated errors over time, we apply the point-backtracking technique that can track and prune high-error Gaussians in dynamic scenes.

The effectiveness of our method is validated through experiments on two major real-world video datasets: Neural 3D Video dataset [7] and Technicolor dataset [20]. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves rendering results even with sparse 3D point clouds. Furthermore, benefiting from the proposed optimization scheme, our model only requires low storage and memory size without any auxiliary modules or tricks to encode lengthy temporal information. Finally, our model achieves 62 fps on a single 2080Ti GPU on 300-frame scenes with a \(1352\times 1014\) resolution.

### Novel View Synthesis

Photorealistic novel view synthesis can be achieved using a set of densely sampled images through image-based rendering [21; 22]. While the dense sampling of views is limited by memory constraints and results in aliased rendering, novel view synthesis has advanced with the development of neural networks. The ability of neural networks to process implicit information in images enables novel view synthesis with a sparse set of observations. Prior works on constructing multi-plane images (MPI)[23; 24; 25] use aggregated pixel information from correspondences in sparsely sampled views. MPI representation may fail with wide angles between the camera and depth planes. This can be mitigated using geometric proxies like depth information [26; 27], plane-sweep volumes [28; 29], and meshes [30; 31]. These methods risk unrealistic view synthesis with inaccurate proxy geometry.

Joint optimization of proxy geometry [32; 33; 34; 35] can help, but direct mesh optimization often gets stuck in local minima due to poor loss landscape conditioning.

In recent years, continuous 3D representation through neural networks has received widespread attention. NeRF [1] is the foundational work that started this trend. It implicitly learns the shape of an object as a density field, which makes optimization via gradient descent more tractable. The robustness of such geometric neural representations enables to reconstruct accurate geometry from a few given images [36; 37; 38; 39], large-scale geometry [40; 41; 42; 43; 44; 45], disentangled textures [46; 47; 48], and material properties [49; 50; 51; 52; 53]. However, one major issue on these neural representations is also slow rendering speeds coming from volume renderers. To resolve this issue, works in [54; 55] develop light field-inspired representations for single-pass pixel rendering. Both [56] and [57] introduce efficient voxel-based scene representations to improve the rendering speed. However, continuous representation inevitably combines with neural networks to implement its complex nature, and this limits rendering speed. As an alternative, 3DGS [13] is designed to construct an explicit radiance field through rasterization, not requiring MLP-based inference. This method leverages anisotropic 3D Gaussians as the scene representation and proposes a differentiable rasterizer to render them by splatting onto the image plane for static scenes.

### Dynamic Novel View Synthesis

The time domain in dynamic scenes is typically parameterized with Plenoptic function [58]. Classical image-based rendering [21; 22] and novel view synthesis methods using explicit geometry [30; 31] are restricted to a limited memory space [21] when they extend to the time dimension. This is because they require additional optimization procedures for frame-by-frame dynamic view synthesis and storage for the parameterized space. Fueled by implicit representations, works in [2; 3; 8; 59; 4; 7; 5] handle challenging tasks using neural volume rendering. They learn dynamic scenes by optimizing deformation and canonical fields for object motions [2; 3; 6], using human body priors [60; 59; 61; 62; 63; 64; 65; 66], and decoupling dynamic parts [4; 5; 67; 68; 69; 70; 71; 8; 72]. These methods introduce additional neural fields or learnable variables to represent the time domain, taking more memory usage and rendering time as well.

Temporally extended 3DGS has been considered as a feasible solution to dynamic novel view synthesis. A work in [73] assigns parameters to 3DGS at each timestamp and imposes rigidity through a regularization. Another work in [74] leverages Gaussian probability to model density changes over time to explicitly represent dynamic scenes. However, they require many primitives to capture complex temporal changes. Concurrently, works in [14; 75; 76; 77; 78; 79] utilize MLPs to represent the temporal changes. These methods inherit the drawbacks of dynamic neural representations, resulting in slower rendering speeds. The others in [15; 80] explicitly parameterize the motion of dynamic 3D Gaussians to preserve the rendering speed of 3DGS by predicting their trajectory function. However, they only handle the motion as a continuous trajectory, and require multiple Gaussians for motions that disappear and reappear due to self-occlusion, increasing memory burden.

In contrast, our key idea for dynamic 3D Gaussian uses keyframes to minimize primitives and to devise a progressive optimization to cope with scenarios where face disappearing/reappearing objects. Thanks to our schemes, we can improve rendering speed, memory efficiency, and achieve impressive performance for dynamic novel view synthesis.

## 3 Preliminary: 3D Gaussian Splatting

Our model starts from the point-based differentiable rasterization of 3DGS [13]. 3DGS uses three-dimensional Gaussian as geometry primitive, which is composed of position (mean) \(\mu\), covariation \(\bm{\Sigma}\), density \(\sigma\) and color \(\bm{c}\). The 3D Gaussian is referred to as follows:

\[\mathcal{G}(\bm{x})=e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\bm{x}-\mu)^{\top}\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}(\bm{x} -\mu)}.\] (1)

We need to project the 3D Gaussian onto a 2D plane to render an image. In this process, the approximated graphics pipeline is used to render 2D Gaussians. The covariance matrix \(\bm{\Sigma}^{\prime}\) in camera coordinate is given as follows:

\[\bm{\Sigma}^{\prime}=\bm{J}\,\bm{W}\,\,\bm{\Sigma}\,\bm{W}^{\top}\bm{J}^{\top},\] (2)

where \(\bm{J}\) is the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the perspective projection and \(\bm{W}\) is a viewing transformation. By skipping the third row and column of \(\bm{\Sigma}^{\prime}\), it is approximated to two-dimensional anisotropic Gaussian on the image plane.

The covariance is a positive semi-definite which can be decomposed into a scale \(\bm{S}\) and a rotation \(\bm{R}\) as:

\[\bm{\Sigma}=\bm{RSS}^{\top}\bm{R}^{\top}.\] (3)

Spherical harmonics coefficients are used to represent view-dependent color changes as proposed in [81]. A rendered color from the Gaussian uses point-based \(\alpha\) blending similar to NeRF's volume rendering. For the interval between points along ray \(\delta\) which can be obtained from \(\mathcal{G}(\bm{x})\), the color of ray is

\[C=\sum_{i=1}^{N}T_{i}(1-e^{-\sigma_{i}\delta_{i}})\bm{c}_{i},\;T_{i}=e^{-\sum_ {j=1}^{i-1}\sigma_{j}\delta_{j}},\] (4)

where \(N\) is the number of visible Gaussians along the ray, \(i\) and \(j\) denote the order of Gaussians by depth.

## 4 Methodology

To achieve both memory efficiency and rendering capacity, our scheme is two-fold: (1) Keyframe-based interpolation to span position and rotation of Gaussians over time; (2) Classification of static and dynamic Gaussian. These are described in Sections 4.1 and 4.2. After that, we introduce our progressive training scheme to handle a variety of running times in Section 4.3, and deal with details of the optimization process of our method in Section 4.4. The overview of our method is depicted in Figure 1.

### Static Gaussians

Static Gaussian \(\mathcal{G}_{s}\) is modeled as the same as the 3DGS model except for its position. \(\mathcal{G}_{s}\) changes the position linearly over time, which can be formulated with the position \(\mu\) at time \(t\) as below:

\[\mu(t)=\textbf{x}+t^{\prime}\textbf{d},t^{\prime}=\frac{t}{l}\in[0,1]\] (5)

where **x** is a pivot position of \(\mathcal{G}_{s}\) and **d** is a vector representing the translation, and \(l\) is the duration of a scene. We normalize \(t\) with \(l\) to prevent **d** from becoming too large.

### Dynamic Gaussians

The dynamic Gaussian model is based on interpolations of keyframes, as visualized in Figure 2. Specifically, the state of the dynamic Gaussian \(\mathcal{G}_{d}\) at an intermediate timestamp is synthesized from adjacent keyframes. In this work, we assume that the keyframe interval is uniform for simplicity. The keyframe is defined as \(\mathcal{K}=\{t\mid t=nI,n\in\mathbb{Z},t\in\mathcal{T}\}\) where \(I\) is its interval and \(\mathcal{T}\) is a set of timestamps. \(\mathcal{G}_{d}\) acquires position \(\mu\) and rotation in quaternion \(r\) from keyframe information. We use different interpolators with different properties for smooth and continuous motion: CHip using polynomial bases is applied for positions, and a Slerp is used for rotations. We further adapt the Gaussian mixture model for temporal opacity to handle changes in the visibility of objects over time.

#### 4.2.1 Cubic Hermite Interpolator for Temporal Position

CHip uses a third-degree polynomial. It is commonly used to model dynamic motions or shapes [17]. The interpolator function can be defined with third-degree polynomials and four variables: position and tangent vector of the start and end points. On the unit interval \([0,1]\), given a start point \(p_{0}\) at \(t=0\) and an end point \(p_{1}\) at \(t=1\) with start tangent \(m_{0}\) at \(t=0\) and an end tangent \(m_{1}\) at \(t=1\), CHip can be defined as:

Figure 1: Overview of our method. We first initialize 3D Gaussians as static, modeling their motion linearly. During optimization, dynamic and static objects are separated based on the amount of predicted motion, and the 3D Gaussians between the selected keyframes are interpolated and rendered.

\[\text{CHip}(\bm{p}_{0},\bm{m}_{0},\bm{p}_{1},\bm{m}_{1};t) =(2t^{3}-3t^{2}+1)\bm{p}_{0}+(t^{3}-2t^{2}+t)\bm{m}_{0}\] (6) \[\quad+(-2t^{3}+3t^{2})\bm{p}_{1}+(t^{3}-t^{2})\bm{m}_{1},\qquad \text{where}\ \ \ t\in[0,1].\]

Based on CHip, we compute the position \(\mu\) of \(\mathcal{G}_{d}\) at time \(t\) as follows:

\[\mu(t)=\text{CHip}(\bm{p}_{n},\bm{m}_{n},\bm{p}_{n+1},\bm{m}_{n+1};t^{\prime}),\] (7) \[\text{where}\ \ n=\left\lfloor\frac{t}{I}\right\rfloor,\ \ t^{\prime}=\frac{t-nI}{I},\ \ \bm{m}_{n}=\frac{\bm{p}_{n+1}-\bm{p}_{n-1}}{2I},\ \ \bm{m}_{n+1}=\frac{\bm{p}_{n+2}-\bm{p}_{n}}{2I},\]

where \(\bm{p}_{n}\) is a position of Gaussian at \(n-\mathrm{th}\) keyframe. We use tangent values that is calculated using the position of two neighbor keyframes. This design can reduce additional requirements for storing tangent values at each keyframe, while still keeping the representational power for complex motion.

Other interpolators such as linear interpolation or piecewise cubic Hermite interpolating polynomial can be alternative choices. In this work, the cubic Hermit interpolator is selected because we can approximate the complex movements of points without any additional computational cost or storage.

#### 4.2.2 Spherical Linear Interpolation for Temporal Rotation

Slerp is typically used for interpolating rotations [18] because linear interpolation causes a bias problem when it interpolates angular value. On the unit interval \([0,1]\), given the unit vector \(\bm{x}_{0}\) and \(\bm{x}_{1}\) which represent rotations at \(t=0\) and \(t=1\) each, Slerp is defined as follows:

\[\mathrm{Slerp}(\bm{x}_{0},\bm{x}_{1};t)=\frac{\sin[(1-t)\Omega]}{\sin\Omega} \bm{x}_{0}+\frac{\sin[(t)\Omega]}{\sin\Omega}\bm{x}_{1},\ \ \text{where}\ \ \ t\in[0,1]\ \ \text{and}\ \cos\Omega=\bm{x}_{0}\cdot\bm{x}_{1}.\] (8)

Slerp can be directly applied to quaternion rotations since it is independent of quaternions and dimensions. We thus have a rotation of intermediate frames in the quaternion of \(\mathcal{G}_{d}\) at time \(t\) without any modification as follows:

\[q(t)=\mathrm{Slerp}(\bm{r}_{n},\bm{r}_{n+1};t^{\prime})\ \ \text{where}\ \ \ n=\left\lfloor\frac{t}{I}\right\rfloor,\ \ t^{\prime}=\frac{t-nI}{I},\] (9)

where \(\bm{r}_{n}\) is the rotation of Gaussian at \(n-\mathrm{th}\) keyframe.

#### 4.2.3 Temporal Opacities

Modeling the temporal opacity is important because it is directly related to appearing/disappearing objects. A straightforward model for temporal opacity is to directly use a single Gaussian. However, there is a limitation to model diverse cases only using the single Gaussian, such as sudden emerging/slowly vanishing objects and objects disappearing in videos, as illustrated in Figure 3. We introduce the Gaussian mixture model to handle these situations. Since using too many Gaussians is impractical, we approximate the model with two Gaussians. We divide the temporal opacity into three cases: when an object appears, the object remains and the object disappears. One Gaussian handles the appearance of the object and the other manages disappearance. The interval between two Gaussians indicates the duration of the object when it is fully visible.

Let a Gaussian with a smaller mean value be \(g_{s}^{o}\) and the other is \(g_{f}^{o}\) where \(a_{s}^{o}<a_{f}^{o}\). And, \(a_{s}^{o}\), \(b_{s}^{o}\), \(a_{f}^{o}\) and \(b_{f}^{o}\) are the mean and variance of \(g_{s}^{o}\) and the mean and variance of \(g_{f}^{o}\) each. The temporal opacity

Figure 3: Comparison between the single Gaussian, Gaussian mixture, and our model for temporal opacity modeling.

Figure 2: Effectiveness of our keyframe interpolation.

\(\sigma_{t}\) at time \(t\) is defined as follows:

\[\sigma_{t}(t)=\begin{cases}e^{-\left(\frac{t-a_{s}^{o}}{\eta_{s}^{o}}\right)^{2}},&\text{for}\quad t<a_{s}^{o}\\ 1,&\text{for}\quad a_{s}^{o}\leq t\leq a_{f}^{o}\\ e^{-\left(\frac{t-a_{f}^{o}}{\eta_{f}^{o}}\right)^{2}},&\text{for}\quad t>a_{f} ^{o}\.\end{cases}\] (10)

Using a single Gaussian may require multiple points to represent an object over a long duration. In contrast, our model can handle both the short and long temporal opacity of an object using two Gaussians.

### Training Scheme

**Progressive training scheme** Our goal is to minimize both memory and computational costs of the entire pipeline, including preprocessing, not just reducing the representation of 3DGS model in a dynamic scene. To this end, we adopt a progressive training scheme that allows to learn over a long duration using only a small amount of point clouds obtained from the first frame, which is illustrated in Figure 4. To effectively handle objects moving or disappearing quickly, our model starts to learn a small part of an input video and gradually increases the video duration. The duration is incremented every specific step and made longer by the interval size.

Expanding time durationAs the time duration increases, the number of keyframes in the dynamic Gaussian obviously increases. We estimate the position and rotation of the Gaussian by linear regression using the last \(\rho\) frames when the number of keyframes increases so that the motion information of the previous frame can be shared with the next keyframe.

Extracting dynamic points from static pointsWe want to separate dynamic points from static points without auxiliary information or supervision, such as masks or scribbles [70]. The separation is done based on the motion of the static points which is modeled to be movable, so we select the dynamic points based on the distance they moved. In particular, to avoid biased selection of distant points, we measure the motion in image space, normalizing the translation by the distance between points and the camera at the last timestamp. Therefore, if the distance to a point from the camera at the last timestamp is \(\bm{\lambda}\), then the expression is \(\frac{\left\lVert\mathbf{d}\right\rVert}{\left\lVert\mathbf{\lambda}\right\rVert ^{2}}\). We sort points by the measured movement and convert the top-\(\eta\) percent of points (in this work, \(\eta=2\) is empirically set) into dynamic points. The position of the converted dynamic points is estimated at each keyframe using \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{d}\). The rotation is made to have the same value in all keyframes, and the opacity is initialized to be visible in all keyframes. We perform the extraction when we increase the duration or at specific iterations.

### Optimization

Point backtracking for pruningSince it is difficult to filter out unnecessary dynamic points in a temporal context, we introduce a way to track errors in the image as points. Unlike contemporary works [82] that track points, we let our model track the value on a single backward pass. We use two measures, L1 distance and SSIM, whose formula is as follows:

\[\mathcal{E}=\frac{\sum_{k}\left(\sigma_{i}\times\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1-\sigma_{ j})\times q_{k}\right)}{\sum_{k}\left(\sigma_{i}\times\prod_{j=1}^{i-1}(1- \sigma_{j})\right)},\] (11)

where \(q_{k}\) is the measured error in image space, \(k\) is a pixel index, and \(i\) and \(j\) are the order of Gaussian by depth which is visible at \(k-\mathrm{th}\) pixel. The accumulated error \(\mathcal{E}_{total}\) is as follows:

\[\mathcal{E}_{total}=\frac{\sum_{v\in\mathcal{D}}\mathcal{E}_{v}}{\sum_{v\in \mathcal{D}}\mathbf{1}},\] (12)

where \(\mathcal{D}\) is a set of training views. We prune the points over \(\mathcal{E}_{total}\) at every pre-defined step.

Regularizations and lossesWe use regularization for large motions on both static and dynamic points. The regularization minimizes \(\left\lVert\mathbf{d}\right\rVert\) for static points and \(\left\lVert\bm{p}_{n+1}-\bm{p}_{n}\right\rVert\) for dynamic points. The optimization process follows 3DGS, which uses differentiable rasterization based on gradient backpropagation. Both L1 loss and SSIM loss, which measure the error between a rendered image and its ground truth, are used.

Figure 4: Progressive learning of dynamic Gaussians.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

As shown in Table 1, our model outperforms most of the contemporary models while maintaining the low computational cost. The example is displayed in Figure 5, which shows that our model produces high-quality rendering results over the comparison methods.

Comparison on sparse conditionsWe also carry out an experiment to check if concurrent methods work well with sparse point cloud initialization, which uses only it for the first frame. We report the result in Table 1. Interestingly, all the concurrent methods yield unsatisfactory results because motions in videos are learned by relying on the point clouds, not temporal changes of objects in the training phase. This implies that they require well-reconstructed 3D point clouds for proper initialization, while our method is free from the initial condition.

### Technicolor Dataset

Technicolor light field dataset encompasses video recordings captured using a 4\(\times\)4 camera array, wherein each camera is synchronized temporally, and the spatial resolution is 2048\(\times\)1088. Adhering to the methodology introduced in HyperReel [86], we reserve the camera positioned at the intersection of the second row and second column for evaluation purposes. Evaluation is conducted on five distinct scenes (Birthday, Fabien, Painter, Theater, Trains) using their original full resolution. We retrain STG [15] using the COLMAP point cloud from the first frame, instead of the point cloud from every frame, for strictly fair comparison.

As shown in Table 2, Ex4DGS is comparable with the second-best model in the sparse COLMAP scenario. Although the Technicolor dataset contains various colorful objects, our model successfully synthesizes the novel view without dense prior or additional parameters. The reason why STG shows the impressive performance is that Technicolor dataset does not have rapid movements.

### Separation of Dynamic and Static Points

Ex4DGS has a capability to separate static and dynamic points during the learning process. To check how well they are separated, we render them individually. Figure 6 shows the separation result. The static and dynamic points are rendered on both the Neural 3D Video and Technicolor datasets. The results demonstrate that the dynamic points are successfully separated from the static points, even if they are trained in an unsupervised manner. As a result, view-dependent color-changing or reflective objects are also identified as dynamic parts. Furthermore, in Coffee Martini scene, Ex4DGS demonstrates the ability to detect dynamic fluid in the transparent glasses. It is also worth highlighting that the same object can have static and dynamic components, as shown in the dog's legs and head being classified as distinct points in the Flame Steak scene.

### Ablation Studies

We conduct an extensive ablation study to check the effectiveness of the proposed technical components in Table 3.

We first examine the effectiveness of our interpolation method by changing them into linear models. The results show that linear modeling of the position and rotation reduces the quality of rendering. Interestingly, using different types of interpolations further exacerbate the performance. If an equal level of polynomial bases are not assigned to both attributes, one of them falls short of the representational capacity, resulting in overfitting or over-smoothing.

We also show how our dynamic point extraction affects the rendering quality. As expected, complex motions can only be handled with dynamic point modeling. We then evaluate the efficacy of our temporal opacity modeling, and observe the performance degradation when no temporal opacity changes. Points can only disappear by minimizing the size and hiding back to other Gaussian points, making them act as flutters without being removed properly.

We then check the effectiveness of our progressive growing strategy. Without this strategy, the optimization gets stuck in local minima. This is due to our approach using only the point cloud from the first frame, which results in a misalignment with their corresponding objects of future frames.

We evaluate our regularization terms for the temporal dynamics of both static and dynamic points within a scene. As expected, incorporating the additional regularization term into the learning process makes the dynamic scene representations better. This benefit comes from the reduction of accumulated motion errors, preventing the points from moving excessively and locating them at correct positions.

Lastly, we examine the effectiveness of our point backtracking approach for pruning step. As expected, the correct removal of the misplaced points mitigates the errors and leads to the best result.

## 6 Conclusion

We have proposed a novel parameterization of dynamic 3DGS by explicitly modeling 3D Gaussians' motions. To achieve this, we initially set keyframes and predict their position and rotation changes. Primitive parameters of the 3D Gaussians between keyframes are then interpolated. Our strategy for learning dynamic motions enables us to decouple static and dynamic parts of scenes, opening up more intuitive and interpretable representation in 4D novel view synthesis.

LimitationsAlthough we achieve a memory-efficient explicit representation of dynamic scenes, two challenges remain. First, our reconstruction can get stuck in local minima for newly appeared objects that are not initialized with 3D points and have no relevant 3D Gaussians in neighboring frames. This issue could be mitigated by initializing new 3D points with an additional geometric prior such as depth information. Second, as 3DGS suffers from scale ambiguity, training on monocular videos is challenging. This is because every 3D Gaussians are treated as dynamic due to the lack of accurate geometric clues for objects at each timestamp. This challenge can be addressed by incorporating an additional semantic cue information like object mask and optical flow, which account for objects' motions more explicitly.

Overview

Within the appendix, we provide additional experiments in Appendix B, additional comparisons in Appendix C and per-scene breakdown of quantitative comparisons in Appendix D.

## Appendix B Additional Experiments

In this section, we conduct experiments to further illustrate the behavior of Ex4DGS. In Appendix B.1, we present an experiment where changes in color alone are not treated as dynamic points. In Appendix B.2, we demonstrate how Ex4DGS behaves when objects reappear. In Appendix B.3 and Appendix B.4, we present additional ablation studies on various keyframe interval selection and dynamic point conversion rates.

### Without Handling Color Components

We conduct experiments on the Coffee Martini scene from the Neural 3D Video dataset, focusing on scenarios where objects remain stationary but change color. We mask only the moving parts of the objects and train static Gaussians on the remaining regions using the original 3DGS model. The qualitative and quantitative results are presented in Figure 7 and Table 4. As shown in Figure 7, static points cannot handle changes such as shadows. However, Ex4DGS effectively manages these changes using dynamic points. In Table 4, "3DGS" denotes the unmodified 3DGS results. "3DGS + Our dynamic" denotes the results when the dynamic regions are replaced with Ex4DGS. Even when only color changes occur without any movement, significant performance loss occurs if these changes are not treated as dynamic points.

### Reappearing Objects

We visualize how Ex4DGS handles when objects disappear and reappear in Figure 8. Figure 8 illustrates the points associated with the decoration in the Birthday scene from the Technicolor dataset. It shows that the Gaussians corresponding to the part of the decoration that disappears at frame \(\#168\) and reappears at frame \(\#188\) have different distributions after the decoration flips that suggests that reappearing objects are regarded as new objects.

### Keyframe Interval Selections

In Table 5, we present results on the effects of keyframe intervals and motion magnitude on Cook Spinach scene from Neural 3D Video dataset. To simulate different motion speeds, we deliberately skip frames in the videos. As shown in Table 5, a keyframe interval of \(10\) generally yields good results under most conditions. Smaller keyframe intervals tend to perform poorly, especially when the motion speed is low (i.e., fewer frames are skipped). However, as the skipped frame size increases smaller keyframe intervals begin to show better performance. It also shows that the model size decreases as the keyframe interval increases.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

### Handling Newly Appearing Objects

We conduct an experiment to determine whether Ex4DGS can learn about newly appearing objects that require the splitting of dynamic components. We sample 120 frames (frame #50 to #169) from the Birthday scene in the Technicolor dataset, during which a person appears. All models use a point cloud prior from a frame where the person is not yet visible. The numerical results are presented in Table 8, and the rendered images are shown in Figure 10. In contrast With the assertion made in the conclusion, the result is indeed feasible because Gaussians from neighboring objects can be utilized to facilitate the splitting process, even in the case of newly appearing objects. This is due to the effectiveness of the proposed splitting pipeline for static and dynamic Gaussians, which can handle newly appearing objects even when no initial Gaussian is provided.

### Extremely Long Duration

We conduct an experiment using a longer sequence of frames (1,000 frames, 20,000 images in total) on the Flame Salmon scene from the Neural 3D Video dataset. The results are presented in Table 9, and the rendered images are shown in Figure 11. The results of this experiment demonstrate that our model is capable of effective learning with reasonable storage requirements, even for extremely long videos. While

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract concisely outlines the problem definition and proposed methodology. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations inherent to the proposed method in the conclusion section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not address theoretical results, thus it is unrelated to this question. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide implementation details for reproduction of results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the source code in the supplemental materials along with its instructions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide all training details, including the balancing values of loss terms. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We simply report and compare the evaluations without statistical analysis. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the information on the computer resources in the Implementation Details section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We follow the code of ethics mentioned in NeurIPS. We only use public datasets and we respect their licenses. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work has no potential positive or negative societal impacts. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not release pretrained models as our work focuses on per-scene optimization of primitives. Additionally, we only use publicly accessible datasets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use only publicly available datasets, mark their names, and cite the papers that presented them. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not introduce any new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing experiments nor human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing experiments nor human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
