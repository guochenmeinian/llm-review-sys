###### Abstract

Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in producing images based on textual prompts. Numerous methods have been proposed to ensure these models generate safe images. Early methods attempt to incorporate safety filters into models to mitigate the risk of generating harmful images but such external filters do not inherently detoxify the model and can be easily bypassed. Hence, model unlearning and data cleaning are the most essential methods for maintaining the safety of models, given their impact on model parameters. However, malicious fine-tuning can still make models prone to generating harmful or undesirable images even with these methods. Inspired by the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, we propose a training policy using contrastive learning to increase the latent space distance between clean and harmful data distribution, thereby protecting models from being fine-tuned to generate harmful images due to forgetting. The experimental results demonstrate that our methods not only maintain clean image generation capabilities before malicious fine-tuning but also effectively prevent DMs from producing harmful images after malicious fine-tuning. Our method can also be combined with other safety methods to maintain their safety against malicious fine-tuning further.

## 1 Introduction

The realm of text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen significant progress in recent years, primarily driven by diffusion models (DMs) trained on extensive and diverse datasets. Recently, many high-performance T2I DMs have been developed, including Stable Diffusion (SD) [38], Imagen [41], DALL-E 2 [35], VQ-Diffusion [13], among others. They have shown great power in generating high-quality images that closely match the textual prompt.

Yet, DMs can be misused by malicious individuals to create inappropriate content, such as images depicting nudity, violence, or illegal activities [42; 11; 36]. To address this issue, early-stage DMs were designed to reject the generation of inappropriate images through NSFW (Not Safe For Work) filters [36]. Nevertheless, this approach does not inherently prevent the model from producing harmful imagery and can be readily disabled, leading to security vulnerabilities [3; 38]. Subsequently, many methods such as filtering the training data 3 or employing model unlearning techniques [4]in the fine-tuning stage [38; 42; 8] have been put forward to build safer DMs. However, through fine-grained fine-tuning on harmful images, the model can still generate harmful images without affecting the generation quality [53].

Catastrophic forgetting [7; 34] is a common phenomenon in continual learning scenarios, such as fine-tuning, which refers to the phenomenon where a well-trained model experiences a significant performance drop on its original task after being trained on a new task. It has been widely studied as a negative factor in training [21; 19], with several works attempting to address it through various methods such as continual learning algorithms and data replay [21; 29; 30], while almost no work has positively utilized catastrophic forgetting as a beneficial tool. Recent works [40] show that DMs also exhibit the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting, which makes it possible to leverage the characteristic to prevent malicious fine-tuning by treating harmful data as a new task for the DMs.

Firstly, we can make generating clean images a new task for the model by maintaining its ability to generate clean images while gradually distancing its understanding of harmful image distributions. This way, the original model's generation of harmful images gradually becomes an outdated and forgotten task. Secondly, if the safety model's understanding of harmful data is significantly different from the actual harmful data distribution, malicious fine-tuning will become a new task for the safety model and it will be difficult to generate harmful images even after malicious fine-tuning. In safety-aligned fine-tuning, we strive to keep the distribution of clean data unchanged to maintain the quality of clean image generation. Since there is some overlap between the distributions of clean data and harmful data, we can use the distribution of clean data as a benchmark to increase the distance between clean data and harmful data understood by the safety model to replace the distance between harmful data and the harmful data understood by the safety model, which makes malicious fine-tuning a difficult task for the safety model. The key to inducing catastrophic forgetting lies in increasing the distance between the clean data distribution and the harmful data distribution. Generally, contrastive learning has been widely employed to encourage models to separate data distributions in the latent space [6]. Motivated by this, a feasible way to prevent malicious fine-tuning is by applying contrastive learning on clean data and harmful data.

In this paper, we propose a training policy based on contrastive learning to leverage catastrophic forgetting to develop a safe DM against malicious fine-tuning. Our method has two instantiations: latent transformation and noise guidance. Latent transformation refers to the operation of transforming the latent variable distribution of images. Noise guidance is adding different noises to clean and harmful images to induce different changes in the distribution of images. Both of these methods undergo contrastive learning fine-tuning and make models unable to generate harmful images after malicious fine-tuning. Our main contributions are:

* We consider the scenario of preventing T2I generation models from being fine-tuned on harmful data.
* We propose two viable methods to leverage catastrophic forgetting separately from the perspective of latent and noise.

Figure 1: Images generated by the baseline model SD v2.1 and models trained by our method. The top row contains harmful images, and the bottom row contains clean images. Harmful images generated by our methods before and after malicious fine-tuning both show quality degradation because the models are safely aligned before malicious fine-tuning and can also resist malicious fine-tuning. The generation quality of clean images is maintained in the safety alignment before malicious fine-tuning and slightly decreases after malicious fine-tuning in color and texture details. Orange boxes are added by the authors for publication.

* Experiments demonstrate that using our method to fine-tune the SD model significantly improves its safety and prevents it from being maliciously fine-tuned.

### Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Built-In Safety Methods

Researchers have developed various techniques to prevent T2I DMs from producing inappropriate or harmful content. These methods fall into two categories: black-box and white-box settings. Black-box setting methods do not require the internal knowledge of T2I DMs. Earlier work [36] uses a safety checker to detect generated images and then reject returning the images if deemed inappropriate. POSI [49] fine-tunes LLaMA [46] to be an optimizer that can revise prompts automatically to avoid inappropriate image generation. However, these types of black-box methods do not fundamentally make the model non-toxic and heavily rely on external components, making the pipeline very bloated. SLD [42] is proposed to reduce the inappropriate degeneration of DMs using safe guidance. Unfortunately, malicious humans will not use safe guidance when DMs are open-source. Hence, some white-box methods have been proposed [42; 8], which primarily unlearn harmful content by fine-tuning pre-trained DMs [9; 8; 23]. Forget-Me-Not [52] fine-tunes U-Net [39] in SD by applying attention resteering on all cross-attention layers of U-net. ESD [8] utilizes negative guidance to fine-tune the U-net to remove the given style or concept. Concept Ablation [23] makes the distribution defined by the given concept and the distribution defined by an anchor concept close. However, recent research [10] shows that models trained by these white-box methods can be easily fine-tuned to generate harmful images, making them unsafe.

### Catastrophic Forgetting

Catastrophic forgetting has been widely studied [12; 28; 19], with several works assessing its prevalence in modern settings [34; 27; 47]. It occurs in continual learning, particularly sequential learning and the pre-training & fine-tuning paradigm [22; 5; 17; 28]. Various attempts have been made to alleviate catastrophic forgetting through continual learning algorithms and data replay, such as imposing a penalty on the change of the parameter on the new task [1; 45; 37; 50], transferring knowledge from related new knowledge types back to the old types [51], incorporating the Hessian matrix into parameter regularization [21], etc. However, all these methods treat catastrophic forgetting as a negative factor to be eliminated, and almost no work has utilized it as a positive tool. Selective amnesia [14] utilizes a continual learning approach to forget unsafe concepts while not consider defending against malicious fine-tuning. Therefore, the focus of our work is to leverage this negative phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting as an effective means to defend against malicious fine-tuning.

## 3 Method

In this section, we give the details of our proposed approach that leverages catastrophic forgetting to develop safe DMs resilient to malicious fine-tuning. We first outline the problem formulation in Sec. 3.1. To achieve our goal, we introduce contrastive learning for safety alignment in DMs. At the same time, we propose two different instantiations to change the distribution of harmful data: **latent transformation** (LT, Sec. 3.2) and **noise guidance** (NG, Sec. 3.3). Finally, we give the way to maintain the quality of clean images generated by our safe model.

### Problem Formulation

The core idea behind leveraging catastrophic forgetting to prevent malicious fine-tuning on models is increasing the distance between the distributions of clean and harmful data. The model will forget harmful data as harmful image distribution is separated when maintaining the ability to generate clean images. When the distance between the distributions of clean and harmful data is large enough, it is difficult for the safety model to generate harmful images even after malicious fine-tuning because it becomes a new task for the safety model. In addition, for the safety model, it is important to maintain the ability to generate clean images. We combine these two goals together, which are maximizing the distribution distance between clean and harmful data in latent space while maintaining the model's ability to generate clean images before malicious fine-tuning. Suppose the dataset \(D\) is composed of two types of data: clean data \(D_{c}\) and harmful data \(D_{f}\), where \(D_{c}=\{x_{c}^{i},c_{c}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{c}}\) and \(D_{f}=\{x_{f}^{i},c_{f}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{f}}\), our goal can be described as:

\[\max_{\theta}\;\log p(\theta|D_{c})+\lambda\mathcal{D}(p(D_{c}| \theta)\|p(D_{f}|\theta))\] (1)where \(\theta\) is the parameters of DMs, \(\mathcal{D}\) is a divergence measure between two distributions, and \(\lambda\) is a tunable hyper-parameter used to achieve a trade-off between the quality of clean image generation and promoting the separation from harmful images. The first term of Equation 1 is to maintain the quality of clean image generation and the second term is to separate harmful data from clean data.

By using Bayes' rule, we can get:

\[\log p(\theta|D)=\log p(D|\theta)+\log p(\theta)-\log p(D)\] (2)

Because \(D\) is composed of \(D_{c}\) and \(D_{f}\), Equation 2 can be rearranged as:

\[\log p(\theta|D)=\log p(D_{f}|\theta)+\log p(\theta|D_{c})-\log p(D_{f})\] (3)

Then,

\[\log p(\theta|D_{c})=-\log p(D_{f}|\theta)+\log p(\theta|D)+C\] (4)

To maximize \(\log p(\theta|D_{c})\), it can be achieved by lower \(\log p(D_{f}|\theta)\) and higher \(\log p(\theta|D)\). To lower \(\log p(D_{f}|\theta)\), we use two methods to change the prediction objective of harmful text conditions in Sec. 3.2 and 3.3. For the second term in Equation 4, the goal is to maintain the parameters of the original model and we replay clean data during the training process to achieve this.

Contrastive learning is an effective method to increase the distance between the distributions of different classes of data. The core concept is to ensure that samples from the same class are closely positioned, while samples from different classes are spaced further apart. In addition, to avoid affecting the quality of clean image generation, our method keeps the distribution of clean images unchanged, while only altering the distribution of harmful images predicted by our model to increase the distance between the clean and harmful image distributions. The training objective is:

\[\mathcal{L}_{c}=\sum_{\{x_{f},c_{f}\}\in D_{f}}\left(||f_{\theta}(c_{f})-\bar{ f}_{\theta}^{f}||_{2}-\lambda_{c}\max(0,||f_{\theta}(c_{f})-\bar{f}_{\theta}^{c} ||_{2}-l)\right)\] (5)

where \(f_{\theta}(c_{f})\) is the latent predicted by the DM based on condition \(c_{f}\), \(\bar{f}_{\theta}^{f}\) and \(\bar{f}_{\theta}^{c}\) are the centers of latent of harmful data and clean data.

By combining Equation 1 and Equation 4, we obtain the overall training objective:

\[\mathcal{L}=-\mathbb{E}_{\{x_{c},c_{c}\}\sim p_{c}(D_{c})}\log p(x_{c}|\theta,c_{c})+\mathbb{E}_{\{x_{f},c_{f}\}\sim p_{f}(D_{f})}\log p(x_{f}|\theta,c_{f })+\lambda\mathcal{L}_{c}\] (6)

where \(\lambda\) is the tunable hyper-parameter to balance the quality of clean image generation and promote the separation from harmful images, and the goal is to minimize \(\mathcal{L}\).

To minimize \(\log p(x_{f}|\theta,c_{f})\), we use LT and NG to change the prediction objective of harmful text conditions.

The method leverages catastrophic forgetting by widening the distribution between clean and harmful data. **Right**. The method uses contrastive learning to leverage catastrophic forgetting against malicious fine-tuning.

### Latent Tranformation

DM is a widely used model for text-to-image generation. Many text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion [38], employ DMs that include an Auto-encoder (VAE) [20]. The VAE effectively compresses images from the RGB space into the latent space. However, it also compresses the distances between different types of images in the latent space.

To make generating harmful images a new task for the safety model, we guide the harmful data to move away from the position of clean images in the latent space. This ensures that the model's prediction objective for harmful data is distant from the clean image distribution.

DM consists of two processes: the forward process and the denoise process. Suppose the origin data is \(x_{0}\) and the noisy data of timestep \(t\) is \(x_{t}\), the forward process can be represented as:

\[x_{t}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}x_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha_{t}}}\epsilon\] (7)

where the noise \(\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)\) and it is added to original data \(x_{0}\), which is controlled by \(\bar{\alpha_{t}}\) that is 1 when \(t=0\) and 0 when \(t=T\).

The denoise process is to train DMs to predict the added noise by minimizing the loss function:

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}_{x_{0}\sim p_{data},\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)}|| \epsilon_{\theta}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}x_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha_{t}}} \epsilon,t)-\epsilon||_{2}^{2}\] (8)

At timestep \(t\), we can estimate the original latents by 7.

\[\hat{x_{0}}=\frac{x_{t}-\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha_{t}}}\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t)}{ \sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}}\] (9)

The transformation is performed on the conditioned latents of harmful data. Define the predicted conditioned latents of harmful data as \(\hat{x}_{0,f}\), the transformation equation is 10.

\[\hat{x}_{0,f}\gets R\hat{x}_{0,f}+b\] (10)

Performing a spatial transformation on the latent space can effectively separate the distribution between different classes of data. Here \(R\) and \(b\) could be randomly chosen from 0. This method is by altering the latent corresponding to harmful semantics. Another effective approach is to process the noise added to harmful data during the forward process.

### Noise Guidance

The forward process of DMs is described by equation 7. The distribution of harmful data can be altered and forgetting of harmful data can be achieved by changing the noise added to the original harmful data during the forward process.

A unique shift of the normal distribution noise is added to the noise added to harmful data, making \(\epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(\mu_{f},1)\). \(\mu_{f}\) can be fixed or dynamically changing. We set \(\mu_{f}\) to be -1 or dynamically changing in our experiment. The optimization objective is changed to be:

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}_{\{x_{f},c_{f}\}\sim p_{f}(D_{f}),\epsilon\sim\mathcal{ N}(\mu_{f},I)}||\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{f},c_{f},t)-\epsilon||_{2}^{2}\] (11)

Latents of clean and harmful images can be separated by adding different noises to harmful images during the training process. Guiding the randomly generated noise and latent space transformation are both effective in the experiment.

### Preserving Clean Image Quality

The above sections introduce methods for forgetting harmful data. However, while forgetting harmful data, maintaining the generation quality of clean images is also crucial for providing a usable safe model.

The overall training objective 1 includes the term that maintains the ability to generate clean images: \(\mathbb{E}_{\{x_{c},c_{c}\}\sim p_{c}(D_{c})}\log p(x_{c}|\theta,c_{c})\). The objective is achieved by random training DM on clean data. During the training process, clean data is also provided to the model to maintain the ability to generate clean images. The training objective for clean data remains consistent with that of the original DM, which can be described as:

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathbb{E}_{\{x_{c},c_{c}\}\sim p_{c}(D_{c}),\epsilon\sim\mathcal{ N}(0,I)}||\epsilon_{\theta}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}x_{c}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha_{t}}} \epsilon,c_{c},t)-\epsilon||_{2}^{2}\] (12)By randomly training on clean data with a certain probability, DM avoids forgetting the generation of clean data.

In summary, our method addresses both forgetting harmful data and maintaining clean data by training on a dataset composed of clean and harmful data, aiming to achieve a trade-off between the model's safety in forgetting harmful images and its ability to maintain clean image generation. More importantly, the distribution of harmful and clean data predicted by our safe model is separated, which makes leveraging catastrophic forgetting against malicious fine-tuning possible.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of our methods, aiming to answer the following research questions: (RQ1) _Whether our method leveraging catastrophic forgetting can be used to achieve a safe model?_ (RQ2) _Whether the safe model reinforced by our method can prevent malicious fine-tuning?_

### Experimental Setup

**Datasets.** To provide a comprehensive evaluation of our method, we use prompts of LAION-5B [44] to generate clean images and harmful prompts generated by Mistral 7B [18] to create harmful images. Two kinds of data are used for fine-tuning. The details of the prompts are shown in Appendix D. In addition, we use DiffusionDB [48], COCO [26], I2P [42], and Unsafe [32] prompts to test the effectiveness of our model.

**Models.** Since Stable Diffusion (SD) [38] is the most widely used open-source T2I generation model and has achieved very high image generation quality. We mainly conduct experiments on SD v1.4 and SD v2.1. Due to the complexity of the SD XL [31] architecture, we only provide results from partial experiments conducted on the SD XL model, which are presented in Appendix A. ESD-Nudity-u1 and ESD-Violence-x1 [8] are unlearning models designed to be incapable of generating nudity-related and violence-related images. In the safety reinforcement experiment, we apply them as base models.

**Metrics.** We consider five evaluation metrics. For harmful image evaluation, we use NSFW Score, Inappropriate Rate and Hum. Eval. (i) **NSFW Score**[24] is used to evaluate the safety of models. It is calculated by a pre-trained detector; (ii) **Inappropriate Rate (IP)** is proposed by SLD [42] and is used to evaluate the safety of models. It is calculated by NudeNet [2] and Q16 [43]. These two harmful detectors are respectively focused on sexual detection and the detection of other harmful types. If either of the two detectors identifies the image as harmful, then the image will be considered inappropriate. The parameters for both detectors are set to default; and (iii) **Hum. Eval.** (Human evaluation) is a method for assessing model safety through human judgment. Evaluations are made by three individuals, and the results are the average of their judgments. This metric can reflect human evaluation of the quality of images generated by the model. For clean image evaluation, we use Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score. (i) **Aesthetic Score**[25] is a metric to evaluate the quality of generated images. It is calculated by LAION-Aesthetics-Detector V1, a linear estimator on top of CLIP [33] to predict the aesthetic quality of pictures; and (ii) **CLIP Score**[15] is another metric to evaluate the quality of generated images. It measures the correlation between the generated images and the prompts. Measurements of all metrics are averages of images generated from 100 prompts corresponding to each dataset.

**Configurations.** Malicious fine-tuning steps of models are set to 20. All of the models are trained for 200 gradient update steps with a learning rate 1e-5 and a batch size of 1. \(\lambda\), \(\lambda_{c}\), and \(l\) are set to 5e-5, 1, and 0 in the training process.

### Safety Alignment

In this subsection, we train safe aligned models using our method. Safety alignment refers to fine-tuning a pre-trained SD model to become a safe model that cannot generate harmful images in our main experiments. The model trained using our methods is not only safe but also can avoid being further maliciously fine-tuned.

Table 1 shows the result of safe alignment experiments. The NSFW score and IP of the model we trained are lower than the original model, while the aesthetic score remains at a similar level before malicious fine-tuning. This suggests that our approach can maintain the model's capability to generate clean images while training a safe model. Besides, the NSFW score and the IP of our model barely rise after the malicious fine-tuning, which shows that our model can resist malicious fine-tuning. Human evaluation has also confirmed it. For original SD v1.4 and SD v2.1, we find the NSFW Score nearly unchanged before and after malicious fine-tuning, which is because the original SD is already

toxic, it is still toxic after malicious fine-tuning. Table 5 compares the safety of our safe alignment model with other safe models and our model can achieve a similar level of performance as other models even before malicious fine-tuning.

### Safety Reinforcement

In the experiment of safety reinforcement, a pre-trained safe model is introduced, and our training method is applied to this already pre-trained safe model to reinforce it, preventing malicious fine-tuning. ESD-Nudity-u1 and ESD-Violence-x1 [8] unlearned models are used as base models. The base models are fine-tuned based on SD v1.4. We then further fine-tune the models using our methods. Table 2 shows the NSFW scores, IP,CLIP Score and Aesthetic scores of the models trained using different methods.

Compared with original safe models, our methods show better safety performance after being maliciously fine-tuned. The NSFW Score and IP of original safe models increase a lot after malicious fine-tuning. In contrast, the NSFW Score and IP of safe models after safe reinforcement by our methods even show a slight drop after malicious fine-tuning, which demonstrates that our model can resist malicious fine-tuning. Besides, the Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score of our safe reinforcement model do not change a lot, which shows that our model achieve a trade-off between safety and generation quality.

Table 3 shows the phenomenon of generation quality degradation before and after malicious fine-tuning. The experiment is conducted on sexual data. Compared to the results of clean fine-tuning, the model shows varying degrees of generation quality degradation after malicious fine-tuning, which is evidence that when fine-tuning on harmful data, clean image generation will also show degradation due to the effect of catastrophic forgetting on clean data because of fine-tuning using harmful data. It is the evidence that DMs will show catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on datasets for certain specific concepts.

### Ablations and Additional Experiments

Results in Sec. 4.2 demonstrate that our method can train a model that is secure and resistant to malicious fine-tuning while maintaining a high generation quality. Meanwhile, the experimental results in Sec. 4.3 demonstrate that our method can fortify an already trained secure model, leveraging the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting to enhance its resistance to malicious fine-tuning.

In this subsection, we analyze the effects of different experiment settings and prove the robustness and universality of our methods on different datasets and other types of images.

Table 1: Results of safety alignment experiment. The performance of our models is evaluated in harmful image generation and clean image generation. For harmful image generation, NSFW Score, IP and Hum. Eval. are evaluated. The data on the left of each panel is evaluated on original pre-trained models or contrastive learning fine-tuned models, while the data on the right is the result after the models have been maliciously fine-tuned. Our model shows better safety before and after malicious fine-tuning compared with original SD models for lower NSFW Score and IP. For clean image generation, Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score are evaluated on original pre-trained models or contrastive learning fine-tuned models. Our safety model maintains the quality of clean image generation for fluctuating Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score.

#### 4.4.1 Different Malicious Fine-tuning Steps

We test how the security of our model changes with the increase in malicious fine-tuning steps in the experiment. We set malicious fine-tuning steps from 1 to 100 to demonstrate the robustness of our method against malicious fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that as the number of malicious fine-tuning steps increased, the model exhibits a sudden increase in security performance and a decline in generation quality. This may be evidence of catastrophic forgetting in the model.

Figure 3 shows the results of different malicious fine-tuning steps. During the process of increasing fine-tuning steps from 0 to 100, the NSFW scores initially oscillate around 0.5, then abruptly drop to around 0.4 after 80 steps. The model demonstrates resilience to malicious fine-tuning across different step numbers, as the NSFW scores consistently remain lower than the baseline score for SD v2.1.

In addition, the phenomenon of abrupt change occurred during the adjustment of malicious fine-tuning steps. As the number of malicious fine-tuning steps increased, there was a sudden drop in NSFW scores, indicating a sudden forgetting of model knowledge. This could be considered as evidence of effective utilization of the catastrophic forgetting phenomenon. This phenomenon is counterintuitive and should be investigated further.

Furthermore, we conduct additional experiments to train a strongly safe aligned model by increasing the training steps to 2000 and enlarging the dataset. our strongly aligned safety model, which has forgotten most knowledge of sexual content, achieved results where the IP did not exceed 4% within 200 steps of malicious fine-tuning, and the results are shown in Appendix B.

We also use the UnlearnDiffAtk [53] algorithm to attack our safety model to test the robustness of our model. UnlearningDiffAtk algorithm is an adversarial prompt generation approach for DMs, which utilizes the intrinsic classification abilities of DMs to attack safety models to generate harmful images. The results are shown in the Appendix F.

#### 4.4.2 The Quality of Clean Image Generation

We test our model's ability to generate clean images. We use Frechet Inception Distance (FID) [16] as the metric to evaluate the quality of clean images and we use COCO-30K [26] dataset as the reference dataset for the FID benchmarks.

Table 2: Results of safety reinforcement experiment. The performance of our models is evaluated in harmful image generation and clean image generation. For harmful image generation, NSFW Score, IP are evaluated. The left and right data are evaluated before and after malicious fine-tuning. Compared with the original unlearned model, the safety of our methods retains after malicious fine-tuning for lower NSFW Score and IP. For clean image generation, Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score are evaluated on original pre-trained models or contrastive learning fine-tuned models before malicious fine-tuning. The generation quality of safe reinforcement models is not effected a lot for similar Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c|c c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Model} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Aesthetic Score\(\uparrow\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{CLIP Score\(\uparrow\)} \\ \hline Fine-tuning Type & Primary & Clean FT & \(\Delta_{tch}\) & Harmful FT & \(\Delta_{tch}\) & Primary & Clean FT & \(\Delta_{tch}\) & Harmful FT & \(\Delta_{tch}\) \\ \hline LT & 6.2831 & 6.3533 & +0.0702 & 6.1642 & -0.1189 & 0.4096 & 0.4066 & -0.0030 & 0.3883 & -0.0213 \\ NG & 6.4341 & 6.4689 & +0.0348 & 6.3628 & -0.0713 & 0.4232 & 0.4170 & -0.0062 & 0.4147 & -0.0085 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Table 3: The impact of clean fine-tuning and malicious fine-tuning on the securely reinforced model. \(\Delta_{cln}\) and \(\Delta_{hrm}\) represent the change in generation quality before and after ordinary fine-tuning. Clean FT and harmful FT mean fine-tuning with clean images and fine-tuning with harmful images. Compared with Clean FT, Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score show more decrease after harmful fine-tuning, which is evidence of the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting between clean and harmful data.

images. Besides, the changes in FID before and after malicious fine-tuning are the evidence that DMs will experience catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on datasets for certain specific concepts. The reason why FID drops more in our methods is probably that the distribution of clean data understand by the model is also changed in safe alignment and safe reinforcement training. We also evaluate FID on our strongly safe aligned model. With an IP of 0.70%, the FID obtained is 30.15, indicating that our method can still generate clean images at maximum safety before malicious fine-tuning.

#### 4.4.3 Ways to Guide the Added Noise

In Sec. 3.3, we propose two ways to guide the noise shift. The first method involves adding a fixed noise offset, while the second method involves dynamically adding dynamically changing noise based on the center of the image latents.

The experimental results of adding different noises are presented in Appendix C. Adding dynamically changing noise in the safety alignment experiment yields better security performance and generation quality. However, in the security reinforcement experiments, the opposite results are observed.

We guess that adding dynamically changing noise in the unlearn model may introduce randomness in parameter changes, which could potentially undermine the security capabilities trained into the unlearn model. This issue will be left for future research.

#### 4.4.4 Unlearning Combined Harmful Concepts Simultaneously

To prove the feasibility of our method to develop a universally safe model, we combine sexual and violence data together to get a combined harmful dataset and do experiments on it. The results are

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Method} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{FID-30k \(\downarrow\)} & \multirow{2}{*}{\(\Delta\downarrow\)} \\ \cline{2-2} \cline{4-4}  & Before FT & After FT & \\ \hline SD v1.4 & 14.44 & 15.21 & -0.77 \\ SD v1.4+ESD-Nudity-u1 & 17.65 & 18.32 & -0.67 \\ Ours (Safety Alignment) & 19.27 & 21.98 & -2.71 \\ Ours (Safety Reinforcement) & 19.39 & 23.09 & -3.70 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: FID Scores evaluated on COCO-30K of different models. The left is the FID scores of different models before malicious fine-tuning and the right is the FID scores of them after malicious fine-tuning. \(\Delta\) shows the decline of clean image generation quality, and \(\Delta\) of our method decreases more compared with base models. Both original SD v1.4 and our safety models show a decline of clean image generation quality, which is evidence that DMs will experience catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned on datasets for certain specific concepts. Our method refers to NG.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline \hline Model Name & IP \(\downarrow\) \\ \hline SD v1.4 & 0.35 \\ ESD-Nudity-u1 & 0.16 \\ ESD-Nudity-u3 & 0.12 \\ ESD-Nudity-u10 & 0.08 \\ ESD-Nudity-x3 & 0.23 \\ SLD-Medium & 0.14 \\ SLD-Max & 0.06 \\ Ours (Safe Alignment) & 0.21 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 3: Different malicious fine-tuning steps: perform fine-tuning with different numbers of malicious fine-tuning steps on the safe aligned model and test the NSFW Scores after malicious fine-tuning. The phenomenon of abrupt change occurred during this process. Left and right show the results of LT and NG, respectively. The red line represents the NSFW Score before the abrupt change, and the green line represents the score after the abrupt change. The NSFW Score shows a sudden decrease around 80 malicious fine-tuning steps.

shown in Table 6. This indicates that our model has the potential to remove various harmful concept types, which helps improve the model's safety and robustness. Besides, the quality of clean image generation is retained after safety alignment.

#### 4.4.5 Performance on Different Datasets

We use different prompt datasets to generate images to test the safety of our model before malicious fine-tuning. Results are shown in Table 7. The scores are calculated by averaging 100 images generated by safety alignment models using corresponding test prompt datasets. Mistral-7B means using Mistral-7B to generate prompts to generate harmful images, which imitate malicious human's behaviors. The results indicate that our model exhibits the characteristics of improving model security and maintaining generation quality across different datasets. For the tests on the I2P dataset, the NSFW score measured by our method shows only a slight decrease compared to the original model. This may be due to the presence of many illegal concepts in the I2P dataset, making it difficult for the NSFW evaluation to provide an accurate assessment.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we study a novel problem of utilizing catastrophic forgetting mechanisms to prevent models from being maliciously fine-tuned. We propose the concept of preventing malicious fine-tuning on safe models and give a novel framework that leverages catastrophic forgetting through contrastive learning. It effectively integrates contrastive learning with DMs through spatial and noise transformations. Experiments on both safe alignment and safe reinforcement demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Besides, additional experiments prove the robustness and universality of our method. Last, we address the limitations and ethical considerations in Appendix G and Appendix H, respectively.

Performance on SD XL Model

The results of safety alignment experiment based on Stable Diffusion XL are shown in 8, which show that our method of improving the safety of the model also works in the newer version of Stable Diffusion.

## Appendix B Performance after Different Malicious Fine-tuning Steps

Results of our strongly safe aligned model after different steps of malicious fine-tuning are presented in Table 9. We evaluate the models at 0, 20, 100, and 200 steps of malicious fine-tuning. The IP results indicate that our model maintains safety even after 200 steps of malicious fine-tuning. Images generated by our safe model after different steps of malicious fine-tuning are shown in Figure 4. From the figure, it can be seen that the model did not generate any content related to nudity. The prompts sample from I2P dataset which contains nudity content.

## Appendix C Incorporating Different Types of Noise in the NG Method

The results of incorporating different types of noise in the NG method are shown in 10. Adding dynamically changing noise in the safety alignment experiment yields better security performance and generation quality. However, in the security reinforcement experiments, the opposite results are observed.

For harmful image generation, NSFW Score, IP and Hum. Eval. are evaluated. The data on the left of each panel is evaluated on original pre-trained models or contrastive learning fine-tuned models, while the data on the right is the result after the models have been maliciously fine-tuned. Our model shows better safety before and after malicious fine-tuning compared with original SD XL model for lower NSFW Score and IP. For clean image generation, Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score are evaluated on original pre-trained models or contrastive learning fine-tuned models. Our safety model maintains the quality of the clean image generation for fluctuating Aesthetic Score and CLIP Score.

## Appendix E Generated images examples

### Images generated by harmful prompts

Figure 5 shows examples of generated harmful images. We find that the less safe the prompt, the less likely models trained by our methods are to generate harmful images.

### Images Generated by Clean Prompts

Figure 6 shows examples of generated clean images. Our methods maintain the ability of models to generate clean images.

Figure 5: The top images are harmful images successfully blocked, while the bottom images are harmful images that escaped safety alignment. Orange boxes are added by the authors for publication.

Figure 6: Clean images generated by our model. Photos on the left are portraits, while photos on the right are landscape images. Our model’s ability to generate clean images is not significantly affected.

Results of Attacking our Safe Model with UnlearnDiffAtk

Table 11 shows No Attack ASR and UnlearnDiffAtk ASR, which is a measure of the model's safety performance. Our model is more robust when attacked using UnlearnDiffAtk algorithm.

## Appendix G Limitation and Future Work

Although our method performs well in preventing malicious fine-tuning and enhancing the model's security capabilities, it has only proven effective on DMs. We believe that this method of leveraging catastrophic forgetting can be extended to other neural networks, such as CNNs. This remains for future research.

Additionally, the model cannot completely prevent the generation of harmful images; there are still some prompts that can produce harmful content. In Appendix E, we provide some examples of escaping security alignment. More robust methods for security alignment and preventing malicious fine-tuning need to be proposed.

It is also possible that the malicious entity applies a different fine-tuning that tries to bring the latent space between the clean and harmful data closer, then performs standard fine-tuning, which is a potential attack way for our safe model. The possible attack way needs more future research.

## Appendix H Ethical Consideration

The datasets of toxic prompts utilized in our papers contain certain offensive information; however, it is important to note that they are publicly accessible through either downloading directly or upon request4. Mistral-7B is used to generate harmful prompts just for training and testing models in our work. This paper is mainly designed to defend against harmful image generation. We implement strict access control and licensing agreements in data release, including user authentication and usage agreements outlining permissible uses to ensure that only authorized users can access our data.

Footnote 4: https://zenodo.org/records/8255664

## Appendix I Broader Impact

Our method ensures that the original unsafe T2I DMs cannot produce harmful images, and it also prevents the generation of harmful images even after malicious fine-tuning with harmful datasets. Hence, this method can be used as a universal tool to help DMs reduce the generation of harmful content. However, this method may also used to erase some clean information in DMs, potentially rendering them ineffective.

## Appendix J Compute Device

All experiments are conducted on NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPUs. For safe alignment experiments and safe reinforcement experiments, each fine-tuning process takes approximately 1 GPU hour.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline \hline Unlearned DMs & No Attack ASR (\%) \(\downarrow\) & UnlearnDiffAtk ASR (\%) \(\downarrow\) \\ \hline ESD & 20.42\% & 76.05\% \\ FMN & 88.03\% & 97.89\% \\ SLD & 33.10\% & 82.39\% \\ Ours (Safety Alignment) & 21.12\% & **38.03\%** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Abstract and Sec. 1 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix. G Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: Sec. 3 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Sec. 4 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Supplementary Material Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Sec. 4 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Sec. 4 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. ** It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix J Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have carefully checked the NeurIPS code of ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix I Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix. H Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We politely cited the existing assets and read their usage license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
