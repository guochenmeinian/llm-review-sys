###### Abstract

Stereotypes are generalised assumptions about societal groups, and even state-of-the-art LLMs using in-context learning struggle to identify them accurately. Due to the subjective nature of stereotypes, where what constitutes a stereotype can vary widely depending on cultural, social, and individual perspectives, robust explainability is crucial. Explainable models ensure that these nuanced judgments can be understood and validated by human users, promoting trust and accountability. We address these challenges by introducing HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), a framework that enhances model performance, minimises carbon footprint, and provides transparent, interpretable explanations. We establish the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD), comprising 57,201 labelled texts across six groups, including under-represented demographics like LGBTQ+ and regional stereotypes. Ablation studies confirm that BERT models fine-tuned on EMGSD outperform those trained on individual components. We then analyse a fine-tuned, carbon-efficient ALBERT-V2 model using SHAP to generate token-level importance values, ensuring alignment with human understanding, and calculate explainability confidence scores by comparing SHAP and LIME outputs. An analysis of examples from the EMGSD test data indicates that when the ALBERT-V2 model predicts correctly, it assigns the highest importance to labelled stereotypical tokens. These correct predictions are also associated with higher explanation confidence scores compared to incorrect predictions. Finally, we apply the HEARTS framework to assess stereotypical bias in the outputs of 12 LLMs, using neutral prompts generated from the EMGSD test data to elicit 1,050 responses per model. This reveals a gradual reduction in bias over time within model families, with models from the LLaMA family appearing to exhibit the highest rates of bias.23

## 1 Introduction

The need to improve machine learning methods for stereotype detection is driven by the limitations of current approaches, particularly in the context of Large Language Models (LLMs). Although LLMs demonstrate superior language understanding and generation capabilities across many tasks [1], recent studies have shown that their accuracy in stereotype detection remains around 65% [2]. This low performance underscores the potential value of fine-tuning smaller, specialised models for this domain. The subjectivity inherent in stereotypes, where definitions and perceptions can vary widely across different cultural, social, and individual contexts, further emphasises the importance ofrobust explainability in these models. Transparent and interpretable models are essential to ensure that stereotype detection aligns with human judgment and ethical standards.

To address these challenges, we introduce HEARTS (Holistic Framework for Explainable, Sustainable, and Robust Text Stereotype Detection), which focuses on expanding the coverage of under-represented demographics in open-source composite datasets and developing explainable stereotype classification models. This work builds upon previous research that has aimed to establish frameworks for text stereotype detection [3]. A significant application of HEARTS is the quantification of stereotypical bias in LLM outputs, a critical issue in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Numerous studies have identified statistically significant biases in LLM outputs [4], which can lead to harmful consequences when such models are used in decision-making processes, such as automated resume scanning in recruitment [5]. Our research makes the following novel contributions:

1. The introduction of EMGSD, an Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset, which includes labelled stereotypical and non-stereotypical statements covering gender, profession, nationality, race, religion, and LGBTQ+ stereotypes.
2. Development of a fine-tuned stereotype classification model based on ALBERT-V2, capable of achieving over 80% accuracy on EMGSD test data, while maintaining a minimal carbon footprint.
3. Implementation of an explainability system that produces rankings and confidence scores for token-level feature importance values, thereby enhancing the transparency and interpretability of stereotype classifiers.
4. Application of HEARTS to conduct a comparative analysis of stereotypical bias in LLM outputs, providing evidence of a gradual reduction in bias scores over time within individual model families.

**Social Impact Statement:** The tools developed through this research aim to improve the reliability and scalability of stereotypical bias detection, which, if deployed effectively, could mitigate risks associated with LLM usage. For example, by highlighting differences in the biases of models from different providers, users can make more informed decisions. This research contributes to the broader field of responsible AI by developing models that prioritise human well-being and align with societal values and ethical principles [6]. Furthermore, HEARTS emphasises sustainability by focusing on model parameter size and carbon footprint management in the fine-tuning process, ensuring that the development of stereotype classification models adheres to high environmental standards.

## 2 Background and Related Work

HEARTS uses the classifier-based metrics approach to bias detection [4], by training an auxiliary model to benchmark an element of bias (stereotypical bias), which can in turn be applied to classify language, such as human or LLM-generated text. This is a common approach to bias evaluation in the domain of toxicity detection, which instead refers to offensive language that directly attacks a demographic, with notable examples including Jigsaw's Perspective API tool. There are fewer examples of open-source solutions in the domain of stereotype detection, where developing accurate detection models is a more challenging task, highlighting the need for explainable solutions. Some models have emerged in the Hugging Face community, such as the distilroberta-bias binary classification model trained on the wikirev-bias dataset and the Sentence-Level-Stereotype-Detector multi-class classification model trained on the original Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (MGSD) [3]. These models are limited by either sub-optimal performance or lack of generalisability caused by training data that captures a relatively narrow set of stereotypes, which we seek to address by developing stereotype classification models on a more diverse dataset. In addition, previous research in the field of text stereotype detection has also placed little emphasis on model transparency, limited to anecdotal exploration of the use of explainability techniques such as SHAP [7] and LIME [8]. We enhance these methodologies by making explainability a core component of HEARTS, incorporating a replicable system that includes confidence scores for token-level explanations.

Pure prompt-based and Q&A datasets such as BOLD [9], HolisticBias [10], BBQ [11] and UNQOVER [12] are not ideally suited to the task of fine-tuning a stereotype classification model, which requires labelled text instances consisting of stereotypical and non-stereotypical statements. The MGSD is a suitable composite dataset for stereotype classifier training [3], consisting of 51,867 observations covering gender, nationality, profession, and religion stereotypes, combining data from the previously established StereoSet [13] and CrowS-Pairs [14] datasets. This dataset does not provide coverage to some demographics such as LGBTQ+ communities, in addition to under-representingracial and national minorities, so we seek to expand it by incorporating data from other open-source datasets. Many other labelled datasets focus on binary gender and profession bias, such as BUG [15] and WinoBias [16], meaning their incorporation into MGSD would not significantly improve demographic diversity. The RedditBias [17] and ToxiGen [18] datasets cover multiple axes of stereotypes but have informal or conversational text structures that contrast sharply with the more formal nature of MGSD. In addition, datasets such as SHADR [19] focus on intersectional stereotypes that could be used to train multi-label classifiers, beyond the scope of our research. Therefore, our focus turns to the WinoQueer [20] and SeeGULL datasets [21], which respectively capture diverse LGBT+ and nationality stereotypes, from which we extract and augment data to combine with the MGSD.

## 3 Methodology

Our approach aims to improve the practical methods for text stereotype detection, by introducing HEARTS, an explainability-oriented framework, and deploying it to perform a downstream task of assessing stereotype prevalence in LLM outputs.

### Dataset Creation

We create the Expanded Multi-Grain Stereotype Dataset (EMGSD) by incorporating additional data derived from the WinoQueer and SeeGULL datasets. Before merging data sourced from each of these datasets into MGSD, we perform a series of filtering and augmentation procedures by leveraging LLMs, as shown in **Figure 1** below, with additional details including the full prompts used in A.1. This process includes a manual review of the final dataset. Our approach results in the creation of the Augmented WinoQueer (AWinoQueer) and Augmented SeeGULL (ASeeGULL) datasets and intends to align the structure of data with the original MGSD, which is equally balanced between text instances marked as "stereotype", "neutral" and "unrelated". We retain original instances of stereotypical text from each source dataset, which have been previously crowd-sourced and validated by human annotators in their creation. The final EMGSD has a sample size of 57,201, representing an increase of 5,334 (10.3%) compared to the original MGSD, with a full set of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) shown in A.2. The dataset is structured to support binary and multi-class sentence level stereotype classification. In order to validate the composition of EMGSD, we develop a series of binary sentence-level stereotype classification models. For this purpose, we divide the dataset into training and testing sets using an 80%/20% split, with stratified sampling based on binary categories.

### Dataset Validation and Model Training

Our proposed model for performing explainability and LLM bias evaluation experiments is the ALBERT-V2 architecture, primarily chosen over other BERT variants due to its lower parameter size. Using the CodeCarbon package [22], we estimate that fine-tuning an ALBERT-V2 model on the EMGSD leads to close to 200x lower carbon emissions compared to fine-tuning the original BERT model. We train four separate ALBERT-V2 models through the Hugging Face Transformers Library, with one model fine-tuned on each of the three components of the EMGSD (MGSD, AWinoQueer, ASeeGULL) in addition to its full version, to ascertain whether combining the datasets leads to the development of more accurate stereotype classifiers. Full model details, including hyperparameter choices, are shown in A.3. We also benchmark EMGSD test set performance of the fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 model against a series of other models. First, we consider fine-tuned DistilBERT and BERT models of larger parameter size, using the same training process. We also compare performance of these models against a general bias detector, distilroberta-bias, but do not test on the data used to develop this detector given it focuses on framing bias as opposed to stereotypical bias. In addition, we train two simple logistic regression baselines, the first vectorising features using Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) scores and the second using the pre-trained en_core_web_lg embedding model from the SpaCy library. CNN or RNN baselines are not explored given the extensive resources required for hyperparameter tuning, and their tendency to underperform BERT models in language understanding tasks [23]. For each logistic regression model, we conduct hyperparemeter tuning by trialling a series of regularisation penalty types and strengths, with the hyperparameters achieving highest validation set macro F1 score shown in A.3. Finally, we compare performance to a set of state-of-the-art LLMs, focusing on the GPT series (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-Mini), using prompt templates that closely align with those used in the TrustLLM study [2], also shown in A.3. We do not explore fine-tuning of LLMs, given conventional XAI tools cannot be applied to them in a scalable manner.

### Token Level Explanations

To evaluate the predictions of our fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 classifier and calculate token-level importance values for test set model predictions, we apply established feature attribution methods, using SHAP to generate default feature importance values. We calculate a SHAP vector \(\phi_{i}\) for each text instance \(i\) to rank tokens in accordance with their influence on model predictions, where a higher SHAP value indicates greater influence on stereotype classifier prediction probability. Formally, for token \(j\) in instance \(i\):

\[\phi_{ij}=\sum_{S\subseteq N_{i}\setminus\{j\}}\frac{|S|!(|N_{i}|-|S|-1)!}{|N _{i}|!}[f_{i}(S\cup\{j\})-f_{i}(S)],\quad\phi_{i}=(\phi_{i1},\phi_{i2},\dots, \phi_{iN})\]

We next calculate a sentence-level explanation confidence score by generating a LIME vector \(\beta_{i}\) for the same text instance and comparing pairwise similarities between SHAP and LIME values assigned to each token, using a custom regex tokeniser for consistency. The LIME vector is given by:

Figure 1: Overview of the dataset filtering and augmentation process for the WinoQueer and SeeGULL datasets. The WinoQueer dataset (91,080 sentences) undergoes filtering by removing duplicates, counterfactual statements, and overtly negative sentences, resulting in a refined set of 1,088 sentences. The SeeGULL dataset (6,781 phrases) is filtered to remove non-offensive and non-stereotypical sentences, yielding 690 phrases. Sentence generation using Mistral Medium expands these phrases to 690 sentences. Both filtered datasets are then augmented using GPT-4 to generate three categories: neutral, stereotypical, and unrelated sentences, contributing a total of 5,334 additional observations to the MGSD.

\[\beta_{i}=\arg\min_{\beta}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\pi_{k}\left[f_{i}(x^{\prime}_{k})-\left( \beta_{0}+\sum_{j\in N_{i}}\beta_{j}\cdot x^{\prime}_{kj}\right)\right]^{2}, \quad\beta_{i}=(\beta_{i1},\beta_{i2},\ldots,\beta_{iN})\]

Similarity scores are measured using cosine similarity, Pearson correlation and Jensen-Shannon divergence, with full definitions as follows:

1. Cosine Similarity:

\[CS(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})=\frac{\phi_{i}\cdot\beta_{i}}{\|\phi_{i}\|\|\beta_{i}\|} =\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}\phi_{ij}\beta_{ij}}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}\phi_{ij} ^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}\beta_{ij}^{2}}}\]

2. Pearson Correlation:

\[PC(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})=\frac{Cov(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})}{\sigma_{\phi_{i}}\sigma_ {\beta_{i}}}=\frac{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}(\phi_{ij}-\bar{\phi_{i}})(\beta_{ij}- \bar{\beta_{i}})}{\sqrt{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}(\phi_{ij}-\bar{\phi_{i}})^{2}}\sqrt {\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}(\beta_{ij}-\bar{\beta_{i}})^{2}}}\]

3. Jensen-Shannon Divergence:

\[P_{j}=\frac{\phi_{ij}+|Min(\phi_{i})|}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}(\phi_{ij}+|Min(\phi_ {i})|)},\quad Q_{j}=\frac{\beta_{ij}+|Min(\beta_{i})|}{\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}( \beta_{ij}+|Min(\beta_{i})|)}\]

\[JSD(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}P_{j}\log\left( \frac{2P_{j}}{P_{j}+Q_{j}}\right)}+\frac{1}{2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{i}}Q_{j}\log \left(\frac{2Q_{j}}{P_{j}+Q_{j}}\right)\]

In the Results section, we show examples of model predictions with corresponding token importance values and explanation confidence scores. We also show mean and standard deviation similarity metrics for SHAP and LIME vectors across a test set sample of size 1,005 in A.6, to demonstrate statistically significant alignment in the predictions of each method for our dataset.

### LLM Stereotype Assessment

The final stage of our research applies HEARTS to a practical use case, to evaluate stereotypical biases in LLM outputs, by processing neutral prompts through LLMs and evaluating their text continuations for stereotypical bias, using our fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 model. To create neutral prompts, we first select a sample of 35 stereotypical statements from the EMGSD test set, drawing five text instances for each group and dataset combination, then stem each sentence to remove the tokens with stereotypical meaning. To verify the prompt creation process, we apply the fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 model to each prompt to confirm it generates a neutral prediction. The full set of prompts is shown in A.7. Testing a subset of 12 LLMs in total, we batch process the prompts through each model with 30 independent iterations, using the template _"Please augment each of the following phrases into short sentences of up to 10 words_". This yields a sample of 1,050 responses for each model, to ensure statistical significance of results. To evaluate bias creation for each model, we count the number of statements labelled as stereotypical by our stereotype classifier to arrive at an estimated proportion \(P_{M}\) of model stereotype prevalence, where \(P_{M}=\frac{\Gamma}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{1}(\hat{y_{i}}=1)\).

## 4 Results and Discussion

The full results of our ablation study are shown in **Table 1** below. Our intention in expanding the original MGSD is to improve its demographic coverage, without materially sacrificing performance of models trained on the dataset. The results appear to validate the composition of our dataset, with the dataset expansion generating performance improvements. The results show that the highest performing model for each dataset component, in terms of test set macro F1 score, is a BERT variant fine-tuned on the full EMGSD training data (DistilBERT for AWinoQueer and ASeeGULL, BERT for MGSD and EMGSD). The comparison of results across model architectures also indicates that the fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 model, which we select to perform explainability and bias evaluation experiments,shows similar performance to BERT variants of larger parameter size, whilst outperforming logistic regression and GPT baselines by a large margin. These outcomes indicate that the model is a reasonable choice for developing accurate stereotype classifiers with low carbon footprint. A further set of detailed results for the ALBERT-V2 model, decomposing performance by demographic, is displayed in A.4.

Table 1: Comparison of model macro F1 scores on each test set component of EMGSD. **Bold** indicates the highest, _bold italics_ the second-highest score in each column.

Figure 2: Evolution of test set F1 score by text length for ALBERT-V2 model trained on EMGSD. The results show an increase in F1 score variance as text length increases, with evidence of lower average F1 score for longer text lengths. Therefore, our model achieves more robust results when applied to short blocks of text, highlighting the need for new datasets featuring more complex text passages, to develop models capable of also achieving robust performance on longer text.

In **Table 2**, we show example output of HEARTS for a set of text instances from the EMGSD test set. Each of these examples, initially sourced from the StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs datasets, contains single tokens that were labelled as stereotypical (masked token that generates the stereotype) by human annotators when the datasets were initially created. For each example of correct ALBERT-V2 model predictions, the highest ranked token based on SHAP value aligns with the labelled stereotypical token, with the similarity metrics indicating a lower degree of confidence in model explanations for longer text instances and in cases where the model makes an incorrect prediction.

The full results from our comparative assessment of stereotypical bias in LLM outputs are shown in A.8. Of the models tested, Meta's LLaMA-3-70B-T has the highest bias score at 57.6%, whilst Anthropic's Claude-3.5-Sonnet has the lowest bias score at 37.0%. Focusing only on the most recent model iteration from each provider, Meta's LLaMA-3.1-405B-T also has the highest bias score at 50.7%, 8 percentage points higher than the next provider (42.5% for GPT-4o). In **Figure 5** below, we assess whether there is a discernible downward trend in prevalence of bias in LLM outputs over time, reflecting ongoing industry efforts to incorporate debias frameworks into LLM training processes. Considering general trends across the whole group of models, there appears to be limited evidence of a clear downward trend in bias scores, with recent releases such as LLaMA-3.1-405B-T exhibiting bias scores in excess of 50%. That said, within particular model families there is evidence of a gradual reduction in bias scores for later iterations, with the exception of the GPT family where bias scores are relatively constant, starting at a lower base level for the earliest iteration studied (GPT-3.5-Turbo).

## 5 Limitations and Future Work

A key limitation impacting the quality of our dataset and resultant stereotype classification models is the low availability of high-quality labelled stereotype source datasets, leading to sub-optimal linguistic structure and demographic composition of the EMGSD. For instance, despite extensive efforts to diversify the dataset, text instances referring to racial minorities account for approximately 1% of the sample. This issue leads to variation in performance of our fine-tuned ALBERT-V2 model across demographics. Ongoing efforts to produce diverse, crowd-sourced stereotype datasets are critical, which should also seek to capture intersectional stereotypes to allow the development of multi-label classifiers that can simultaneously identify multiple axes of stereotypes. In addition, our proposed token-level feature importance ranking framework relies on calculating explanation confidence levels based on a single pairwise comparison between SHAP and LIME vectors for a given text instance. To enhance the robustness of this approach, future research could incorporate additional feature importance tools, such as integrated gradients, to build more complex ensemble methods that could also be used to develop token-level classification frameworks.

Appendix / Supplemental Material

### EMGSD - Creation Process

We aim to convert the WinoQueer and SeeGULL datasets into a format that closely aligns with the composition of the original MGSD, and is suitable for training stereotype classification models. The first step involves filtering each dataset to only include observations that refer to stereotypical statements. In the case of SeeGULL, we perform an additional step to generate full sentences from each template phrase in such a way that preserves meaning of the base stereotype, for which we use the Mistral Medium LLM. We subsequently use a separate model, GPT-4, to augment WinoQueer and SeeGULL with neutral and unrelated sentences generated from the base stereotypical statements. This process leads to the generation of 5,334 new data samples suitable for combining with the MGSD. At each stage of the process, we conduct manual review of the results to evaluate their suitability.

For the WinoQueer dataset, the first filtering step performed is to remove counterfactual sentences, where the LGBTQ+ group term has been swapped with a non-LGBTQ+ term. Our rationale is that training a model to detect stereotypes on counterfactual datasets can lead the model to classify all text referring to a marginalised group as stereotypical, failing to identify sentences that are actually neutral or unrelated. Next, we remove duplicates from the sample; in addition to removing exact sentence replications, we also remove sentences where a base sentence has been repeated by simply changing a single term such as a person's name, for which there are several examples similar to those shown in **Table 3** below. Our rationale is that training a stereotype classifier on data with limited linguistic diversity could lead to overfitting and poor out of sample generalisation. Finally, we remove sentences that use overt negative sentiment towards a demographic that we believe constitute instances of target leakage (sentences effectively unveiling the label), such as 'I hate' and 'everyone hates'. Including such statements could also lead to the development of a stereotype classification models unable to identify implicit or subtle stereotypes. These filtering steps reduce the sample size of the extracted WinoQueer data from 91,080 to 1,088.

For the SeeGULL dataset, we take a different filtering approach. Each phrase in the open-source SeeGULL dataset contains a'mean offensive score' derived from annotators, so we first filter out all phrases that are deemed non-offensive, which we characterise as phrases with a mean offensive score of 0 or below. The SeeGULL data was originally constructed using annotators from both North America and the region applicable to the country referred to in each statement, so from the remaining phrases we only include observations where a majority of annotators in both cases agree that the phrase constitutes a stereotype. The removed observations contain instances where annotators from each side have disagreed with the label, as well as 'neutral' statements where both agree the phrase is not stereotypical despite using offensive language. Our rationale is that we have reservations about training a stereotype classification model on data that contains these types of statements, given the model could learn to identify offensive words as non-harmful. Therefore, we prefer to only retain the unanimously labelled stereotypical phrases and from these generate neutral and unrelated phrases, with language intended to be non-offensive towards any demographic. This structure aligns closely with the current MGSD. The filtering steps reduce the sample size of the extracted SeeGULL data from 6,781 to 690.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{142.3pt}|p{142.3pt}|} \hline
**Reason for Removal** & **Sentence** \\ \hline Counterfactual Sentence & Straight people are overly sexual. \\ \hline Counterfactual Sentence & Heterosexual people are mean. \\ \hline Duplicate & Robert is Bisexual and confused \\ \hline Duplicate & John is Bisexual and confused \\ \hline Overt Negative Statement & Everyone hates LGBTQ people because they are abnormal. \\ \hline Overt Negative Statement & I hate LGBTQ people because they are crazy. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: WinoQueer - examples of removed sentencesAs demonstrated in **Table 4**, the SeeGULL dataset is structured as phrases rather than full sentences. A stereotype classifier trained on full sentences is likely to perform stronger when applied out of sample to natural English text, which contains linguistic structures more complex than simple phrases, motivating our approach to generate full sentences from the initial phrases provided in the SeeGULL dataset. To achieve this goal, we use LLMs to generate the sentences in an efficient and scalable manner. The process of prompting LLMs to generate the full sentences is challenging, given many of the core phrases contain offensive wording from the original SeeGULL dataset, leading models such as GPT-4 to refuse to perform the task at all and some models to only provide output on rare occasions. The Mistral Medium model, however, usually performs the task as requested. After an experimental feedback process to obtain reasonable results from Mistral Medium that retain both the nationality and stereotype tokens from the original phrase, we use these as part of a few-shot learning prompting approach that provides template examples to the model when requesting a response. The full structure of our prompt is set out below, including ten examples the Mistral Medium model generated itself.

#### SeeGULL Sentence Generation Prompt

_Please augment the phrases below into short fictional sentences of approximately 5-7 words, making sure that all words in the phrases are included in the sentence. Below are ten examples of how I want you to do this._

1. _The Zimbabwe terrorist planned the attack._
2. _The Yemeni terrorist was arrested at the airport._
3. _The Welsh sheep f***_r_ _faced animal abuse charges._

9. _The Senegalese criminal was caught smuggling diamonds._
10. _The Salvadoran criminal was part of a gang._

_Here are the phrases to augment, make sure to process all of them:_

The final phase of pre-processing performed on the WinoQueer and SeeGULL datasets is to generate new instances of neutral and unrelated sentences from each stereotypical sentence, to ensure that the final dataset we use for model training is balanced between each type of statement in a way that mirrors the original MGSD structure. The output of our data filtering process contains only stereotypical sentences, insufficient to train a stereotype classifier, which requires both stereotypical and non-stereotypical statements in its training data. Therefore, we seek to use LLMs to generate neutral and unrelated sentences, by modifying stereotypical tokens without removing reference to the relevant demographic from the original sentence. To accomplish this task, we prompt GPT-4 to generate the neutral and unrelated sentences, given it shows capacity to accurately perform the prescribed task on a consistent basis. To obtain examples for a few-shot prompting approach, for the WinoQueer dataset we directly use examples from the original MGSD but for SeeGULL, instead allow the model to generate reasonable examples that are then included in the prompt, given GPT-4 experienced greater difficulty in performing the task on the SeeGULL dataset. The full prompts used for each dataset are shown below.

As demonstrated through the randomly drawn examples in **Table 5** below, in addition to a full manual review of the dataset, our approach appears to deliver a reasonable sample. Critically, our approach preserves the human-annotated labels of stereotypical statements from the original datasets, meaning the final datasets still capture the outputs of initially crowd-sourced materials, despite the usage of LLMs for augmentation purposes.

### EMGSD - Exploratory Data Analysis

The EMGSD has a sample size of 57,201, an increase of 5,334 (10.3%) from the original MGSD, following the incorporation of the AWinoQueer and ASeeGULL datasets. The format of the expanded dataset is shown in **Table 6** below, with a brief description of each field as follows.

* identifies demographic referenced in a given text instance, categorised by 'race', 'nationality', 'profession', 'gender','religion' and 'lightq+'.
* each text instance represents a passage drawn from a given dataset.
* identifies each text instance as'stereotype', 'neutral or 'unrelated'. To perform binary classification, these can be easily condensed into'stereotype' and 'non-stereotype' categories.
* specifies the source dataset for each text instance, categorised by'stereoest_intrastenence','stereoest_intersentence', 'crowspairs' (for the original MGSD), as well as 'winoqueer_augmented' (AWinoQueer) and'seegull_augmented' (ASeeGULL).
* provides more in-depth labels than the 'category' column, specifying a combination of category and stereotype_type, e.g.'stereotype_nationality'.

As demonstrated in **Figure 6** below, the target variable distribution of the EMGSD maintains a close balance between stereotypical, neutral and unrelated statements, which is a product of the methodology used in our data augmentation process.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|p{56.9pt}|} \hline
**Stereotype Type** & **Text** & **Category** & **Data Source** & **Label** \\ \hline profession & She is a Journalist for the newspaper. She gets all her information via internet research. & neutral & stereoset\_intersentence & neutral\_profession \\ \hline nationality & Tacos are Mexican staples. All of their cuisine causes gas. & stereotype & stereoset\_intersentence & stereotype\_nationality \\ \hline nationality & Chinese food is panda. & unrelated & stereoset\_intrasentence & unrelated \\ \hline profession & Most bartenders are disconnected to their customers. & neutral & stereoset\_intrasentence & neutral\_profession \\ \hline race & Of course, the black man said, my wife is nothing. & stereotype & crowspairs & stereotype\_race \\ \hline gender & Craig, his body guard, jumped me when he saw me. & neutral & crowspairs & neutral\_gender \\ \hline lgbtq+ & Gay people are hypersexual. & stereotype & winoqueer\_augmented & stereotype\_lightq+ \\ \hline lgbtq+ & Bisexual people are presenting salads. & unrelated & winoqueer\_augmented & unrelated \\ \hline nationality & The Malian criminal was a known arms dealer & stereotype & seegull\_augmented & stereotype\_nationality \\ \hline nationality & The Cameroonian was often busy & neutral & seegull\_augmented & neutral\_nationality \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Sample from EMGSDThe demographic distribution in **Figure 7** also shows that the EMGSD now provides coverage to LGBTQ+ groups, comprising 5.7% of the overall dataset. We note that some social dimensions, such as race, remain under-represented in the dataset. Whilst many sentences in the StereoSet dataset are labelled as 'race', the majority of these instead refer to nationality traits, and we draw a distinction between race and nationality when constructing the EMGSD (with former referring to ethnic traits, the latter citizenship). Whilst the overall proportion of nationality coverage in the dataset is relatively unchanged, the introduction of data from the ASeeGULL sample alters the composition of nationalities. **Figure 8** below, depicting the sample proportion for the most frequently drawn nations in the ASeeGULL sample, demonstrates the improved coverage of African nationality stereotypes in our dataset. **Figure 9**, depicting the full composition of group coverage in the AWinoQueer sample, shows that it covers a wide range of LGBTQ+ stereotypes, with no individual form of LGBTQ+ stereotype covering more than 20% of the sample.

Figure 6: EMGSD target variable distribution

Figure 7: EMGSD demographic distribution

To conduct text length analysis, we count the number of characters in a given sentence \(x_{i}\) in the dataset, then use Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to construct a smooth distribution of text length for each dataset, with density indicative of prevalence of a given text length \(L\). This estimated density is given as follows, where \(n\) is the total number of sentences in a dataset, \(h\) is the bandwidth parameter controlling smoothness and \(K\) is the chosen kernel function (Gaussian selected in this case).

\[\hat{f}(L)=\frac{1}{nh}\sum_{i=1}^{n}K(\frac{L-x_{i}}{h})\]

**Figure 10** below indicates that overall text length distribution in the EMGSD is closely preserved from the original dataset, with a similar profile observed despite the fact that the AWinoQueer and ASeeGULL datasets have denser frequencies around the average text length. This indicates that our data augmentation strategy has been successful in generating sentence structures similar to the original MGSD.

Figure 9: AWinoQueer LGBTQ+ group coverage

We also conduct sentiment and Regard analysis on the dataset to provide a more comprehensive insight of text structures for stereotypical and non-stereotypical sentences, with the precise methods discussed in depth below. Our approach also seeks to identify whether sentiment and Regard metrics appropriately classify stereotypes in the EMGSD, given these techniques are frequently used in prompt-based LLM bias benchmarking frameworks.

To assess sentiment of a given observation in the EMGSD, we use a pre-trained sentiment classifier available on Hugging Face, Twitter-roBERTa-base for Sentiment Analysis, which classifies observations as negative, neutral or positive. We select this model given it was trained by its creators on a dataset of 124million tweets, capturing a wide diversity of linguistic structures and contexts, making it more suitable for our dataset than domain-specific alternatives such as FinBERT. Formally, the sentiment class of a given sentence \(x_{i}\) in our dataset is given as follows.

\[SE_{i} =argmax_{k}P(s_{k}|x_{i})\] \[S=\{s_{0},s_{1},s_{2}\} =\{negative,neutral,positive\}\]

To assess Regard for a given observation in the EMGSD, which attempts to provide a metric that better correlates with human judgement of bias, we use a similar approach to sentiment, leveraging the Hugging Face BERT Regard classification model that was trained on researcher-annotated instances of sentences showing negative, neutral, positive or 'other' (unidentifiable) Regard. Formally, the Regard class of a given sentence \(x_{i}\) in our dataset is given as follows.

\[RE_{i} =argmax_{k}P(r_{k}|x_{i})\] \[R=\{r_{0},r_{1},r_{2},r_{3}\} =\{negative,neutral,positive,other\}\]

**Figure 11** and **Figure 12** below demonstrate that in the EMGSD, a higher proportion of stereotypical statements are classified as negative sentiment and Regard, compared to neutral and unrelated statements. Whilst this overall result is as expected, it is noteworthy that 21.6% of stereotypical sentences are classified as positive sentiment and 18.2% as positive Regard.

Figure 10: EMGSD text length distribution

A systematic analysis of the classification patterns by demographic, as visualised in **Figure 13** and **Figure 14** below, unveils a trend that stereotypes against specific groups appear to be disproportionately associated with positive sentiment and Regard. For instance, 31.5% of stereotypical statements related to gender and 31.1% related to profession are classed as positive sentiment, compared to close to zero for statements related to LGBTQ+ groups. In the case of Regard, a similar trend emerges, albeit with lower severity.

Figure 11: EMGSD sentiment classifications by target variable

Figure 12: EMGSD Regard classifications by target variable

The examples shown in **Table 7** demonstrate that these traditional bias metric approaches may fail to identify instances of stereotypes involving harmful language, such as language referring to female appearance. These results suggest that when used as bias metrics, sentiment and Regard classifiers may be themselves biased against the type of demographic, performing poorly at identifying gender and profession stereotypes.

### ALBERT-V2 Test Set Performance

The macro F1 score used to evaluate test set performance for each binary classification model is calculated by first computing the F1 score for each class \(i\) as \(F1_{i}=\frac{2\times\text{Precision}_{i}\times\text{Recall}_{i}}{\text{Precision}_{i }+\text{Recall}_{i}}\), and then averaging these scores across classes to obtain the macro F1 score, defined as Macro \(\text{F1}=\frac{1}{2}(F1_{0}+F1_{1})\).

**Figure 15** below shows that the performance of the ALBERT-V2 model is non-uniform across demographics. Notably, the model performs most strongly at identifying LGBTQ+ stereotypes, with 96.5% macro F1 score. Comparatively, performance in identifying gender or profession-related stereotypes is much weaker, with macro F1 scores of 65.4% and 72.8% respectively. When deploying the model out of sample, it is critical to note this discrepancy when evaluating the results for different demographics.

### Pairwise Token Similarity Metrics

We calculate the value of each of the three similarity metrics for a sample of 1,005 text instances in the EMGSD test set, then calculate arithmetic mean and sample standard deviation of the metrics, to provide an indication of whether similarity in model explanations from the SHAP and LIME approaches is statistically significant. We calculate a simple p-value to determine the hypothesis test threshold \(T_{M}\) for which the mean is statistically different to the relevant threshold of no similarity for each test (0 for cosine similarity and Pearson correlation, 1 for Jensen-Shannon divergence). The precise calculations are given as follows, with \(M\) denoting a particular metric, \(K\) denoting the number of sentences in the dataset, and \(Z\) denoting the normal distribution Cumulative Density Function (CDF).

\[\bar{M} =\frac{1}{K}\sum_{i=1}^{K}M(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})\] \[s_{M} =\sqrt{\frac{1}{K-1}\sum_{i=1}^{K}(M(\phi_{i},\beta_{i})-\bar{M}) ^{2}}\] \[z =\frac{\bar{M}-T_{M}}{\frac{s_{M}}{\sqrt{K}}}\] \[p =2\times P(Z>|z|)\]

The results shown in **Table 13** indicate statistically significant average similarity between SHAP and LIME vectors across the test sample, suggesting the ALBERT-V2 model generates predictions in a consistent manner by focusing attention on tokens with logical association to stereotypes. That said, the notable variation in results (standard deviation of approximately 0.3 for cosine similarity and Pearson correlation) demonstrates the necessity of using similarity metrics to capture confidence in token rankings generated by explainability methods, given the results indicate that using alternative methods can lead to notable differences in importance values and corresponding rankings.

### Comparative Assessment of LLM Stereotype Generation

**Figure 21** below demonstrates the results for overall stereotype prevalence across the set of LLMs evaluated, with each model generating biased outputs on approximately 37-58% of occasions.

A decomposition of the results by demographic across all models tested, shown in **Figure 22** below, indicates that degree of stereotype prevalence also depends on the demographic under consideration. The risk appears highest for stereotypes related to profession, with average bias score of 75.9%, and lowest for stereotypes related to gender and LGBTQ+ groups, with average bias scores of 32.6% and 13.4% respectively. A further breakdown of the results shows that the demographics each model exhibit most bias against varies by model. For instance, whilst Gemini models have above average bias scores for nationality, their corresponding scores for race are below average. Similarly, whilst also having below average bias scores for race, the Claude models show above average bias scores for LGBTQ+ stereotypes. These findings suggest that LLM usage risks are model specific, with each model showing propensity to generate its highest rates of bias against different demographics.
