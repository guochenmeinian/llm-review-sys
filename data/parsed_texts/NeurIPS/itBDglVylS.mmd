###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized benchmark, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our benchmark dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.

## 1 Introduction

### Motivation

Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions have evolved into a crucial tool for cybersecurity training since their inception at DEFCON in 1993[1, 4]. These competitions simulate real-world security scenarios, encompassing domains such as cryptography, forensics, binary exploitation, code reverse engineering, and web exploitation. Competitors are tasked with identifying vulnerabilities using state-of-the-art cybersecurity techniques. CTF challenges come in two main types: Jeopardy and Attack-Defense. Jeopardy-style challenges require competitors to uncover and print hidden flags, typically character strings, demonstrating successful challenge completion. Attack-Defense challenges involve participants defending their systems while simultaneously attacking others.

The use of machine learning (ML), particularly large language models (LLMs), in cybersecurity is an emerging area of interest, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for innovation. There is significant interest in understanding the offensive cybersecurity capabilities of LLM agents, ashighlighted by frameworks such as OpenAI's preparedness framework [33] and discussions from institutions like United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) [32] and United Kingdom's Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) [1].

Solving CTF tasks requires advanced, multi-step reasoning and the ability to competently take action in a digital environment, making them an excellent test of general LLM reasoning capabilities. These tasks necessitate procedural knowledge, offering a more robust evaluation of what a model can do compared to multiple-choice question evaluations like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [22; 49] or Graduate-Level Google-Proof Questions and Answers Benchmark (GPQA) [39]. Additionally, CTF tasks are easy to evaluate automatically by checking if the correct flag is obtained, a valuable property for benchmarks. This also presents opportunities for improving LLM reasoning capabilities through unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, where models can attempt challenges repeatedly, with success serving as a signal for model improvement.

To date, autonomous cyber-attacks have been largely symbolic [14; 42], employing tools like fuzzers, decompilers, disassemblers, and static code analysis to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities. The 2016 DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) highlighted the potential of automated systems in cybersecurity, showcasing machines autonomously detecting and patching software vulnerabilities in real-time [14]. Our research builds on this legacy by creating a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in solving CTF challenges. CTFs offer a controlled environment that mimics real-world cyber threats, providing an ideal playground for testing and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in addressing cybersecurity issues. The successful application of LLMs in software engineering tasks such as code generation [3; 65], bug detection and repair [36], and interpretability [16; 17] suggests their potential in solving cybersecurity challenges as well. Preliminary studies have shown promise in applying LLMs to solve CTFs [14; 53; 41], but they have been limited in scope, often involving human assistance. We aim to evaluate the ability of LLMs to solve CTFs autonomously, akin to the DARPA CGC. This complex task requires equipping LLMs with access to essential tools such as decompilers and disassemblers.

### Contribution

In this paper, we present _a large, high-quality, public benchmark dataset of CTF challenges and a framework to evaluate a wide array of LLMs on these challenges, integrated with access to eight critical cybersecurity tools_. Our benchmark, comprising 200 CTF challenges from popular competitions, is coupled with an automated framework designed to solve these challenges. This framework leverages LLMs to tackle CTF challenges by analyzing executables, source code, and challenge descriptions.

Our contributions are threefold: (1). An open benchmark dataset of 200 diverse CTF challenges, representing a broad spectrum of topics. (2). An automated framework that leverages both open-source and black-box LLMs to solve CTF challenges, showcasing the potential and limitations of current machine learning models in this domain. (3). A comprehensive toolkit that integrates six distinct tools and function calling capabilities to enhance LLM-based solutions. To foster collaboration and innovation in improving the LLMs' ability to solve CTF challenges, we made our challenge database and the automated solving framework public. This enables researchers to develop, test, and refine machine learning algorithms tailored to cybersecurity applications, driving advancements in AI-driven vulnerability detection and resolution.

### Related Work

Since the inception of CTF competitions, various platforms have been developed to cater to different objectives and environments [10; 11; 12; 37; 30]. These platforms are for human CTF competitions and cannot be used for LLM agents. We develop a framework that deploys the CTFs and provides an environment for LLM agents to solve the challenges. Several studies have assessed CTF platforms. For example, Kucek and Leitner [28] conducted a review to evaluate the functionality and game configuration of 12 open-source CTF environments. Similarly, Karagiannis et al. [26] evaluated four well-known open-source CTF platforms, emphasizing their utility in improving education. CTF competitions strengthen cybersecurity across a wide range of topics by providing vulnerable environments that enable participants to assess and enhance their programming skills. They are recognized as educational tools [8; 21; 25; 30; 31; 48], serve as guidelines for application design [7; 27], are used for assessment [44], and function as social networking platforms [25]. These studies have established the use of CTFs as playgrounds to train cybersecurity professionals in real-world cybersecurity tasks.

AI systems have been used to solve CTF challenges [52, 53, 15]. Tann et al. [45] manually analyzed the performance of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing on seven CTF challenges. Similarly, Yang et al. [53]'s InterCode-CTF manually examined effectiveness of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 on 100 problems from PicoCTF. PentestGPT [15] was designed for penetration testing using LLMs and was tested with 10 CTF challenges.

Our work presents an open database with 200 CTF challenges spanning cybersecurity domains and difficulty levels. Additionally, we provide a framework for automated CTF challenge solving using LLMs with cybersecurity tool integration. This framework has been tested on five LLMs (both open and closed-source). Table 1 highlights the unique aspects and innovations of our approach.

## 2 NYU CTF Bench

Our benchmark is based on the CTF competition of New York University's (NYU) annual Cybersecurity Awareness Week (CSAW), one of the most comprehensive cybersecurity events globally2. Over 3,000 students and professionals participate in the CSAW preliminary round, with the final competition bringing together 100-plus teams across five global academic centers. Our initial database comprised 568 CTF challenges sourced from the global CSAW CTF competitions [34]. These challenges were created manually and will continue to grow as we gather more challenges from upcoming CSAW CTF events. From this initial pool, we validated 200 challenges across six distinct categories. Table 2 shows the number of validated CTF challenges for each category.

Footnote 2: https://cyber.nyu.edu/csaw/

We validated each of the 200 CTF challenges in the database by manually verifying their setup and ensuring they remain solvable despite changes in software package versions. For challenges requiring server-side deployment, we performed manual verification to ensure that the server container can successfully connect from both external and internal devices within the same Docker network. This process simulates a real-world CTF environment. For challenges that do not require server deployment, we checked their configuration files and source code, ensuring that all necessary information about the challenge was present. This process helped us identify any missing files due to maintenance activities since the year they were used.

CTF challenges vary in difficulty level, with more difficult challenges awarded higher points, similar to an examination grading system. For NYU CTF Bench, the points range from 1 to 500. Figure1

shows the distribution of challenge difficulties in the qualifying and final rounds. The qualifying round problems tend to be of lower difficulty, while the final round problems are significantly harder. These points reflect a subjective assessment of problem difficulty, as determined by the experienced challenge creators who design CSAW's CTFs.

### Benchmark Structure

Given the extensive range of CSAW's CTF competition years represented, from 2011 to 2023, we faced the challenge of standardizing the benchmark for consistent use and future expansion. We observed that older CTF challenges often required distinct environments for deployment compared to more recent challenges. Earlier challenges had Dockerfiles that necessitated specific outdated package versions for proper deployment.

To address this, we validated each challenge in the database and ensured that Docker Hub images for each challenge could be loaded with Docker Compose, making necessary adjustments to ensure external connectivity. This deployment leverages Docker containers that can be loaded directly, eliminating the need to build them from scratch. The Docker images encapsulate all necessary environments, allowing each challenge to function seamlessly within a single container. We then integrated these images with their corresponding source code and metadata. For each challenge, our database includes a JSON file containing all essential information and the necessary configuration for deployment. Figure 2 shows the complete structure of the CTF database and its components. For NYU CTF, we organize the challenges in the directory structure: Year/Competition/Event/Category/Challenge Name. Each CTF challenge has two required components: (1) A JSON file, which contains metadata including the name of the challenge (name), initial description of the challenge (description), files needed to solve the challenge (files), and host and port information (box and internal_ports). This part of the information is visible to the model. The JSON file also includes the ground truth of the real CTF flag for the challenge, which is invisible to the model. (2) For challenges requiring a server connection, a docker-compose.yml file is included to pull all necessary images from Docker Hub to build the server container.

All source files for the challenges, including source code, configuration files, original Dockerfiles, and other multimedia files (such as images, slides, or raw text documents containing sensitive information), are included. However, only the files listed in the "files" field of the challenge.json are visible to the model, mimicking the real-world conditions of CSAW CTF competitions. Other files can be used as references by users of the benchmark.

### Benchmark Categories

Tables 3 provides example challenges for each category of CTF challenges in our NYU CTF Bench. These examples illustrate the variety and complexity of tasks that participants encounter. Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the Appendix has details of all 200 validated CTF challenges.

**Cryptography (crypto)** challenges involve a mix of encryption methods requiring knowledge of cryptanalysis, mathematical theories, programming, cryptographic protocols, and relevant tools. These challenges range from using antiquated ciphers like RSA to modern encryption techniques where the flag must be recovered by reversing encrypted messages. Challenges are typically arranged as either a local encrypted file or a challenge server hosted in a Docker container, accessible via the netcat command. For server-based challenges, solvers use decrypted messages from the server's output to communicate and send the correct decrypted payload. For local encrypted files, solvers employ current or hinted cryptographic algorithms to decrypt the encoded flag to plaintext. Proficiency in mathematics and familiarity with tools like SageMath[46] and command line execution is crucial.

**Forensics** challenges mimic cybercrime investigations, requiring participants to analyze digital data such as corrupted files and network captures. Essential skills include digital forensics, data recovery, memory and network analysis, reverse engineering, and the use of forensic tools and operating systems. These challenges involve recovering hidden data from various file formats, analyzing malware, and investigating network intrusions, relying on real-world digital data. Solvers must recover hidden messages to capture the flag. They require a diverse skill set and common sense, unlike more specialized categories like Cryptography. Tools used include image scanning and analysis, command line execution, and creating files to send payloads and communicate with servers.

**Binary analysis (pwn)** challenges focus on exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free to gain unauthorized access. Skills required include exploit writing, vulnerability analysis, and reverse engineering binaries using low-level programming, assembly language, and debuggers. The difficulty of pwn challenges varies based on mitigations such as executable stacks and address randomization, often checked with _checksec_. Easier challenges might allow buffer overflows to inject shellcode, while more secure setups may require heap exploitation. Each pwn challenge in our benchmark is implemented using Docker containers with an exposed port. Essential tools include ROP gadgets, assembly code, and debuggers to craft the necessary payload.

**Reverse engineering (rev)** challenges require understanding software systems to extract sensitive information or find exploitable vulnerabilities. This involves decompiling and disassembling binary executables to source code, deciphering custom file formats, and identifying weak algorithm implementations. Without source information like code comments or design diagrams, significant domain-specific knowledge and guesswork are needed. Some challenges are offline and involve analyzing files to reveal hidden information, validated locally by extracting the flag. Others require finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in binaries, validated by interacting with Docker containers to

trigger the vulnerability. Essential tools include Ghidra for decompilation, radare2 for static analysis, and angr for symbolic execution, along with proficiency in assembly and C code.

**Web** challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities such as injection flaws and cross-site scripting. Essential skills include network protocol exploitation, web app security testing, packet analysis, and both back-end and front-end development. Understanding client-server communication and network protocols is crucial. These challenges often require interacting with CTF challenge servers to access protected data or gain unauthorized capabilities, either through web interface interaction or terminal communication using command line tools. Web challenges in our benchmark are implemented as Docker containers with an exposed port. Solvers send payloads to the simulated website server to reveal the hidden flag. Tools include web code analysis and tools like curl to interact with the web interface.

**Miscellaneous (misc)** challenges encompass a broad range of security tasks, including data analysis, e-discovery, and social engineering. Solving these problems requires skills in data mining, traffic analysis, and scripting for data manipulation and automation. Occasionally, CSAW includes mobile _.apk_ reversing, requiring specific tools and decompilers. These challenges often target emerging vulnerabilities and newer technologies, making them unique compared to other categories. Validation involves applying general CTF principles of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, often using Docker containers with exposed ports for server connection or interacting with provided source files. Solvers must research the domain and apply standard exploits. For example, for Android-related challenges, agents need a JDK development environment and the ability to interact with _.dex_ files.

## 3 Automatic CTF Evaluation Framework with LLMs

The framework in Figure 3 includes underlying logic, steps, and the prompt structures used. We discuss input specifications for the models and the methodologies for validating outputs. Critical to maintaining the integrity and robustness of our system, we discuss error handling. This will enable peers to replicate our work and build up on foundational effort. The framework has five modules:

1. Backend Modulefacilitates communication between the local framework and the remote server hosting LLM services. As of the release date, we support three backend configurations: (1). LLM Services from OpenAI: We support the following models: gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-4-0125-preview, and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. (2). LLM Services from Anthropic: We support three models: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-sonnet-20240229, and claude-3-opus-20240229. OpenAI and Anthropic

Figure 3: Architecture of the automated CTF solution framework.

backends operate using an API key, which functions as an authorization key. It is loaded from secret files at the start of the challenge-solving process. The rate limit--the maximum number of tokens that can be sent and received--is determined by the API key. (3). Open-Source models deployed through TGI[23] and VLLMs[29]: They provide a URL for the backend to receive responses from the model. Open-source backend supports five models: mistatalai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, deepseck-ai/deepsek-coder-33b-instruct, llama3:70b-instruct-fp16, wizardlm2:8x22b-q8_0, and eta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct. Users of our framework can connect to these models by obtaining the URL through these methods or by deploying them on local servers.

2. Data LoaderOur framework uses two methods to load challenges: Docker containers as challenge servers or loading from local challenge files. For challenges using a Docker container on the server side, Docker Compose is employed with the configuration YML file to pull the image from Docker Hub. At the start of the challenge setup, the framework scans the challenge information to determine if a Docker container exists, then loads it from the docker-compose.yml file, pulls the image, and starts it running. With the details provided in the challenge.json metadata, the framework connects to challenge containers using the designated host and port. For reverse engineering challenges requiring local file access, the source code is loaded. Challenge files are transferred to a temporary folder, then mounted in our player container. This setup allows the player container to access these files, either as clues for solving the challenge or for reversing the binary. We implemented a garbage collector to manage resources efficiently. Once the framework solves a CTF challenge, it stops all Docker containers and removes the loaded Docker images from the environment. For challenges loaded via source code, the source code files are mounted in temporary folders, which are cleaned up after use.

3. External ToolsEnhancing LLMs with the capability to utilize external tools can significantly improve their task-solving abilities[40]. Models like ChatGPT and Gemini feature built-in functions such as conducting web searches, performing mathematical calculations, and executing Python code. External tools are integrated through code APIs [2], which are used in our framework. Newer LLMs offer native function-calling support, such as StarfleetAI'spolaris-small[43] and Trelis[47]. Our research explores the benefits of providing models with access to domain-specific tools to augment their capabilities in solving CTF challenges: **run_command**: Enables the LLM to execute commands within an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container equipped with essential tools (e.g., compilers, debuggers, Python, pwntools a comprehensive list is available in Appendix B). **createfile** generates a file inside the Docker container, with the option to decode escape sequences for files with binary content. **disassemble and decompile**: Uses Ghidra[19] to disassemble and decompile a specified function in a binary. If no function name is given, it defaults to disassembling the main function or the executable's entry point (_start) if debug symbols are absent. **check_flag**: Allows the LLM to verify the correctness of a discovered flag in a CTF challenge. **give_up**: Allows the LLM to stop its efforts on a challenge, reducing unnecessary work after recognizing that the model can no longer progress effectively. These tools are tailored to the challenge category; all are included for the 'pwn' and'rev' categories, but tools like disassemble and decompile are excluded for others, such as web challenges, to avoid distractions like attempting to decompile a Python script. Most LLMs cannot execute specific tasks or functions within their responses, known as function calling. This involves converting a natural language request into a structured format that enables built-in functions within the toolkit to be invoked and executed locally. Models from OpenAI natively support function calling,

Figure 4: Example of Default Prompt Format Used in the Framework.

and Anthropic models offer partial support. Open-source models such as LLaMA 3 and Mixtral lack this feature. To enable function calling, the formatting module transforms prompt information into a format suitable for function calling (XML and YAML). The formatted information is sent to external tools, allowing LLMs without native function calling to invoke them.

4. Logging SystemOur logging system uses rich text Markdown formats to structure logs categorized into four types: system prompts, user prompts, model outputs, and debugging information. Each solution process begins with a system message that introduces the CTF and specifics of the task. This is followed by a user message describing the challenge sourced from the challenge's JSON, along with commands such as instructions for the LLM to install packages or connect to the container server. The assistant message is a formatted version of the model's response, tailored to the user message, allowing the model to receive feedback from the user input or its own responses. We include debug messages and outputs from external tools. These messages are invaluable for analysis after the solving process is completed, as they can be reviewed by humans for insights into the performance and decision-making process of the framework. Logging occurs in two stages: during the solving process, real-time output is available through system and user prompts, as well as the model's responses and debugging messages. Once the solution process is completed, all logs are saved as JSON files in a designated log folder which can be converted to human-readable html format. The archive includes metadata such as network info, challenge details, model data, and results.

5. Prompt ModuleFigure 4 illustrates how our system arranges the prompts to solve the CTF challenges. The process, from the challenge.json file to the finished solution, is divided into multiple sections. There is a challenge prompt that includes challenge name, category, host, port, description, and files, stored in a JSON file. A prompt template extracts data from the challenge. The system prompt informs the model of the objective and the flag format for the CTF. A user prompt has an initial message with challenge name, category, description, and files (see Initial Message in Figure4). Finally, the model prompt helps the model understand the challenge's content and interpret results obtained from executing its commands. By following these suggestions, we reach the solution for the challenge, which is marked as'solved' in the figure.

## 4 Initial Experiments in Solving CTFs with LLMs

We configured our framework on a local server that hosts the source code, benchmark database, and Docker images for challenges requiring server-side containers. To ensure seamless operation, we installed all necessary packages and securely stored essential keys and URLs, including API keys for models hosted by OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as URLs for open-source models deployed on our inference server. This setup allows our framework to interact with black-box models linked to our OpenAI and Anthropic accounts and open-source models deployed on inference servers, ensuring smooth and accurate execution of experiments. We utilized GPT and Claude models from OpenAI and Anthropic's inference APIs, ensuring our accounts had sufficient credits. For open-source models, we deployed them on our inference server equipped with Nvidia A100 GPUs using the VLLM and TGI frameworks. This setup provided our framework with inference URLs, enabling experiments based on the server environment's capabilities and performance.

We conducted experiments on all validated challenges from Section 2, repeating the solving process five times for each challenge to reduce randomness in model responses. A successful solution required the model to solve the challenge at least once in these five attempts. Instances where the model gave up, executed incorrect commands, or generated incorrect code were considered unsuccessful. Failures also included cases where the model exhausted all attempts without producing the correct flag or failed to use the check flag tool correctly. Our experiments simulated a real-world CTF competition using the benchmark from Section 2. Each LLM had a 48-hour limit to solve the challenges, mirroring the conditions of the CTF competitions from which our database was sourced.

### Baseline Performance and Comparison with Human CTF Players

Table 4 summarizes the results of our evaluation of five LLMs across six categories of CTF challenges, revealing distinct differences in their abilities. GPT-4 performed the best overall, though its success was limited. Claude showed strong performance in some categories, while GPT-3.5

demonstrated reasonable competence in certain tasks. Mixtral and LLaMA did not solve any challenges, highlighting the difficulties faced by open-source models.

The failures of the LLMs were categorized into five types: failure to connect to the challenge, giving up or returning no answer, exceeding the maximum number of rounds without finding the correct solution, exceeding the model's token length limit, and providing an incorrect answer. The percentage of each failure type is also shown in Table 4. GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 have high "Give up" rates, suggesting these models abandon tasks when faced with difficulties. Mixtral and LLaMA show no successes across all categories, with a 100% of failures as "Wrong answer", indicating a limitation in handling specific questions or scenarios. GPT-4 and Claude 3 with larger context length show a drastic reduction in "Token exceeded" failures compared to GPT-3.5 with smaller context length. This analysis reveals the evolution of these models and their strengths and limitations.

To compare the success of LLMs in automatically solving CTFs against human performance, Table 4 summarizes the performance statistics of human participants in CSAW 2022 and 2023. Among the LLMs, GPT-4 performed best in the 2023 qualifiers with a score of 300, but it did not score in the 2022 events or the 2023 finals. GPT-3.5 did not score in the 2023 events but achieved scores of 500 and 1000 in the 2022 qualifiers and finals, respectively. Claude 3 did not score in the 2023 events but _outperformed the median human score in the 2022 finals with a score of 1500_. Claude 3 also scored 500 in the 2022 qualifiers. These results highlight that GPT-4 showed some success in the 2023 qualifiers. GPT-3.5 demonstrated reasonable performance in the 2022 events but struggled in the 2023 events. Claude 3 showed strong performance in the 2022 finals, indicating its potential to exceed average human performance sometimes. From our analysis, the varying scores of different LLMs across events and years is attributed to three factors: (1) the high task complexity leads to different approaches, (2) challenges has varying difficulties and Finals are tougher than Quals, (3) each evaluation uses the default temperature, which adds randomness.

### Ethics Concerning LLMs in Offensive Security

While CTF challenges can be used for benchmarking task planning and automation, they remain rooted in cyber-attack scenarios, making ethics a critical consideration when employing them. The rapid advancement of LLMs has sparked a range of ethical, security, and privacy concerns, underscoring the need for careful deployment strategies. While LLMs have improved their ability to provide accurate and appropriate responses while reducing the likelihood of responding to illegal requests, misuse risks remain. These include exploitation for social engineering or malware creation, revealing the dual nature of AI as both a tool and a potential threat[50]. The legal framework is struggling to keep pace with developments in AI[38]. Researchers advocate for explainable AI to foster transparency in LLM decisions, stressing the importance of robust policy frameworks to prevent AI abuse[5, 18]. In the context of CTFs, integrating LLMs introduces significant ethical considerations. Education tailored to AI ethics is crucial, given the disconnect between current cybersecurity training and rapid advances in AI tools[24]. Furthermore, the misuse of LLMs to launch sophisticated attacks

raises concerns around malicious use[51]. However, the benefit of CTFs in cybersecurity education is well-accepted[30, 31]. In our experiments, we observe no instance where the LLM refuses to solve a challenge due to ethical conflicts, which indicates that current LLMs understand the educational context of CTFs. While this behavior can be misused, further research can help improve LLM alignment and safety.

## 5 Conclusion and Future Work

We developed a scalable, open-source benchmark dataset comprising 200 CTF challenges from seven years of NYU CTF competitions, featuring six categories. This comprehensive dataset is the foundation of our framework for automating CTF-solving using LLMs. By evaluating three black-box models and two open-source models, we demonstrated that LLMs show potential in tackling large-scale CTF challenges within time constraints. However, our analysis also revealed several limitations. First, while the initial database contained 567 challenges, not all are included in the current NYU CTF Bench as we have not finished validating them. Consequently, certain categories, such as Incident Response (IR)--which simulates real-world cybersecurity incidents and is more challenging to validate--are not included in our NYU CTF Bench. Additionally, there is an imbalance in the number of challenges across categories. Some categories, like "rev," "crypto," "pwn," and "misc," contain more challenges, while others, such as "forensics," and "web," are underrepresented. Future iterations of this research aim to: (1) Address Dataset Imbalance and Diversity: A balanced distribution of challenges across all categories will enhance the validity of results and allow for fair comparison between different challenge types. Our current database is sourced from a single CTF series, NYU's CSAW. By incorporating challenges from more competitions, we can increase the diversity of challenges. (2) Enhance Tool/Platform Support: Models sometimes use inappropriate tools, such as C/C++ reverse engineering tools on Python code. Expanding tool and platform support will mitigate such issues. (3) Update model support according to the community roadmaps, ensuring that the framework remains current.

## Appendix A Some LLM Solutions on CTF Examples

[Assistant] Use tools: decompile_function, disassemble_function Decompiled test.out function main: undefined8 main(void)... Dissassembled test.out function main: ; undefined main() ; Parameters:... [Assistant] From the decompiled and disassembled output, it's clear that this challenge involves understanding how input is processed and what conditions must be met to output the correct flag. Here's a breakdown of what happens in the program:

1 The program prompts the user to "Enter the String:" and reads input into local_408.

2 It then checks if the length of the input string is exactly 12 characters (0xc). If not, it prints "that isn't correct, im sorry!".

3 If the input does meet the length requirement:

\(\bullet\) It prints "that's correct!"

\(\bullet\) Initializes an EV_MD_CTX object for digest computation using MD5.

\(\bullet\) Digests a hard-coded value (pointed to by DAT_0010202a, length 2) - unfortunately, the actual data being digested isn't clear from the provided output.

\(\bullet\) Converts the MD5 digest (16 bytes) into a hexadecimal string.

\(\bullet\) Prints the hexadecimal string enclosed in the flag format, "csawctf[%s]".

Given this logic, the flag isn't directly related to the input but depends on the MD5 digest of a hard-coded value. Since the value and its associated data aren't explicitly shown in the decompile or disassemble outputs, we'll need a different approach to determine the exact value being digested or potentially understand how we could manipulate the input to meet the condition and reveal the flag.

However, the flag's generation seems only indirectly related to the user's input, relying instead on the MD5 digest of some data. We know the length of the input must be exactly 12 characters to proceed in the flow that ends up printing the flag, but without knowing what DAT_0010202a points to, we may need to inspect the binary more deeply, potentially with a dynamic analysis tool (like running the binary while monitoring its behavior) to understand what value is being used for the MD5 digest.

To move forward without that specific piece of data, assuming the challenge's setup or description doesn't include any further details to guide the exploit or flag discovery process, let's execute the binary to observe its behavior and verify if there's an immediate need for user input that we can satisfy or manipulate.

Let's run the binary first and input 12 characters to see if there's more insight we can glean from its operational behavior.

[Assistant] $ sudo chmod +x \(\sim\)/ctf_files/test.out && echo '123456789012' | \(\sim\)/ctf_files/test.out ==> stdout: Enter the String: that's correct!

## Appendix C Case study for web challenge

For the 2023 CSAW Quals web challenge, _Smug Dino_, we analyzed 31 LLM agent conversations powered by either the GPT 3.5 or GPT 4 model. This challenge centered around CVE-2019-20372 and exposed a "hint" HTML page to point to that exploit. Players able to supply some recon of the underlying (and exploitable) NGINX server powering the challenge were provided the year of the CVE along with the nature of the exploit. Of the five available public solutions for this challenge

Figure 7: LLM Solved a Reverse Engineering Challenge in Table 3 by Analyzing Disassembly and Decompilation Outputs.

hosted on _github.com_, four documented the contents of the "hint" page and three identified the CVE. None of the LLM agents referred to these public solutions in their conversation transcripts.

In examining the transcripts we were particularly interested in how the agent analyzed and interacted with the "hint" page. As 97% of the conversations indicated the agent was unable to actually retrieve the "hint" we evaluated how successful the solvers were in challenge recon, and in the case where the flag was found, how they handled setbacks.

In 76% of the GPT 4 transcripts the LLM agent was aware that providing recon to the "Hint" HTML page could return something useful to solving the challenge.

The above excerpt shows a strategy nearly universally applied by the LLM agent after deciding to pivot from the hint page: to attempt common web exploits on the challenge. In conversations where the flag was successfully retrieved the agent examined headers and link redirections to intuit some sort of smuggling attack. However, often after moving on from failed recon the agents just employed common web CTF solving strategies, such as using _nikto_ to scan the webserver; _sqlmap_ and _xss_ to attempt to leverage the recon entry form for explotation; _dirb_ to enumerate endpoints; and _gobuster_ to perform brute force attacks.

Each transcript demonstrated a range in the sophistication of tactics; from performing common web exploit techniques such as those listed above; to examining headers and even making inferences on the challenge name to craft CURL payloads capable for performing the required smuggling attack.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This work's contribution and scope is clearly stated in the abstract and introduction including the entire benchmark, automation framework and purpose of this work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitations are described in Section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work focuses on application of LLMs to cybersecurity tasks in the form of CTF challenges. It does not include theoretical results, hence there is no need for assumptions or proofs. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe our experimental setup in Section 4. The LLM model versions used for our experiments are mentioned, and we use default parameter settings. Both the automation framework and benchmark are open sourced with links present in the abstract. These can be used to reproduce our results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: As stated in abstract and introduction, both benchmark and automation framework are open sourced on GitHub. The benchmark can also be accessed via its DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13930622. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use pre-trained LLMs with the default hyper-parameters from Anthropic, OpenAI, and open-source models. The entire dataset of 200 challenges is aimed at evaluation and benchmarking hence no data split is suggested in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We do not perform statistical experiments in the paper due to the high computational cost of running LLMs. Guidelines: ** The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Section 4 states that Anthropic and OpenAI models are run via their APIs, and open source models are deployed locally on a server with 4 Nvidia A100 GPUs. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Section 4.2 describes the ethical implications of our work and is written following the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes]Justification: The potential positive and negative societal impacts of our work are mentioned throughout the paper, and specifically discussed in Section 4.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The high risk for misuse is discussed in Section 4.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Each CTF challenge metadata includes the name and GitHub ID of the authors to ensure clear attribution of authorship. References to the GitHub repositories where the challenges were sourced from are cited in the revised manuscript. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Both of the Benchmark Dataset and automation framework are well documented on GitHub README and the website of the whole project https://nyu-llm-ctf.github.io/ with DOI for benchmark at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13930622. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA]Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
