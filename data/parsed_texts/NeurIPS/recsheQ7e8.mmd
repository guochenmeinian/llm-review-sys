###### Abstract

Although humans inherently have diverse values, current large language model (LLM) alignment methods often assume that aligning LLMs with the general public's preferences is optimal. A major challenge in adopting a more individualized approach to LLM alignment is its lack of _scalability_, as it involves repeatedly acquiring preference data and training new reward models and LLMs for each individual's preferences. To address these challenges, we propose a new paradigm where users specify what they value most within the **system message**, steering the LLM's generation behavior to better align with the user's intentions. However, a naive application of such an approach is non-trivial since LLMs are typically trained on a uniform system message (_e.g._, "You are a helpful assistant"), which limits their ability to generalize to diverse, unseen system messages. To improve this generalization, we create Multifaceted Collection, augmenting 66k user instructions into 197k system messages through hierarchical user value combinations. Using this dataset, we train a 7B LLM called Janus and test it on 921 prompts from 5 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0, FLASK, Koala, MT-Bench, and Self-Instruct) by adding system messages that reflect unseen user values. Janus achieves it+win rate of 75.2%, 72.4%, and 66.4% against Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5 Turbo, and GPT-4, respectively. Unexpectedly, on three benchmarks focused on response helpfulness (AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench, Arena Hard Auto v0.1), Janus also outperforms LLaMA 3 BB Instruct by a +4.0%p, +0.1%p, +3.0%p margin, underscoring that training with a vast array of system messages could also enhance alignment to the general public's preference as well. Our code, dataset, benchmark, and models are available at https://lklab.kaist.ac.kr/Janus/.

## 1 Introduction

Post-training techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) or instruction fine-tuning are effective at enhancing the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences [4, 5, 6, 33, 56, 61]. These methods involve collecting preference data based on high-level values that many people agree upon, such as helpfulness and harmlessness, and then using this data to train reward models (RMs) and LLMs. However, human preferences cannot simply be categorized into such binary divisions; they are typically diverse and exhibit nuanced variations according to different people and contexts [8, 30, 31, 36, 38, 39, 40, 74, 84]. As a result, a significant amount of data is created without considering the conflicting preferences that individuals may have, which results in annotation disagreement [21, 87, 90]. Training LLMs on generic, unattributed preference data inadvertently leads to undesirable traits like verbosity [69].

To address these issues, a new paradigm called **personalized RLHF** has been proposed. In this paradigm, RMs or LLMs are trained to reflect individual preferences, aiming to model the diverse preferences that people may have [7, 8, 25, 38, 42, 84]. However, prior works require collecting data that reflects fine-grained preferences each time and then re-training the RMs and LLMs. Considering that the size of LLMs used in production is steadily increasing, this method may not be highly scalable in terms of time, storage cost, and training cost [37, 67].

In this paper, we pose the following question: _Can we align to diverse preferences without the need to re-train the LLM for each user's preferences?_ Drawing inspiration from how pretrain-then-finetune evolved to handle unseen tasks without re-training via instruction fine-tuning [55, 77, 83], we explore to adapt to user preference without re-training. Specifically, we examine how explicitly stating the user's preference as meta-instructions in the form of _system messages_ can guide the LLM's behavior to align with the user's intentions [79]. However, in our early experiments, we observed that open-source LLMs, unlike proprietary LLMs, do not possess this ability. We hypothesize that this is because open-source LLMs are typically trained with a generic system message, such as "You are a helpful assistant" [8, 9, 23, 92, 94]. Consequently, their ability to incorporate new, unseen system message is limited. To address this, we propose training LLMs on diverse system messages, allowing the LLM to adapt to novel preferences during test time.

To acquire sufficiently diverse and multifaceted values that control individual preferences, we devise a hierarchical synthesis of user values from high-level dimensions. Verbalizing combinations of user values into system messages, we create a training dataset of 197k system messages, **Multifaceted Collection**. For each instruction, there are three variants of system messages embedded with non-overlapping values, along with respective responses. Through quantitative and qualitative analyses, we show that the dataset encompasses a variety of preferences.

To test if our strategy helps aligning to various system messages, we train Mistral 7B v0.2 [26] on the Multifaceted Collection and obtain **Janus 7B**. In addition, we augment 315 instructions across 5 LLM benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 [13], FLASK [88], Koala [17], MT-Bench [92], and Self-Instruct [82]) with three unseen context-specific system messages verified by humans per instruction, creating 921 unseen system messages. Human evaluation demonstrates that Janus achieve a 74.8%, 70.8%, and 57.9% win rate compared to Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, and GPT-4-Turbo-0125, respectively. GPT-4 evaluation results show similar trends, where Janus achieves an average score of 4.24 out of 5.0, outperforming LLMaA 3 BB Instruct, Mistral 8x7B Instruct v0.1, and GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125 by 5.7% on average. Surprisingly, when assessing the helpfulness of the response on 3 benchmarks (AlpacaEval 2.0 [13], MT-Bench [92], Arena Hard Auto v0.1 [41]), Janus outperforms LLaMA 3 8B Instruct by a +4.0%, +0.1%, and +0.3%p margin, suggesting that training on diverse system messages enhances both individualized and general alignment. Further analyses reveal that explicit exposure to diverse preferences during training is crucial, ensuring robust performance even without system messages at test time.

Figure 1: Previous LLMs are trained with homogeneous system messages reflecting general helpfulness and harmlessness. We propose training LLMs with diverse system messages, each representing an individual’s multifaceted preferences, to generalize to unseen system messages. The resulting model, Janus 7B, is adept at generating personalized responses for personalized system messages.

Personalized RLHF for aligning to diverse preferencesAs humans exhibit varying preferences and values for a single task, it is essential to develop systems capable of representing diverse perspectives [32; 72; 73; 86]. A majority of studies build on the RLHF pipeline, designing customized reward functions to prevent rewarding individualized outputs in a _one-size-fits-all_ manner. To address this issue, a recent stream of research has focused on modeling the distribution of human preferences embedded in annotated data and subsequently calibrating the reward model to align with these preferences [38; 71; 80]. These studies aim to reduce annotation disagreements by more accurately simulating the views of a target population. Another line of research highlights the insufficiency of a single reward model and focuses on learning a mixture of preference distributions [7], training individual reward models signaling a specific preference [8], or jointly training a separate user model and reward model on user information and user preference data [42]. To obtain Pareto-optimal generalization across a spectrum of preferences, several works use weight merging techniques to composite multiple policy models each trained with different reward models [25; 62]. While the aforementioned approaches predominantly involve re-training reward models and LLMs to adapt to new preferences, often proving impractical due to the multitude of potential preference variants, we propose to train an LLM that could conform when explicitly stated during test time.

Utilizing system messages for contextProviding context to an LLM is as easy as giving a textual prompt as input. When a user desires to instill specific behavior when performing a task into an LLM, such as impersonating a role [57; 64] or personalization [49], a prevalent method is to simply include the context as part of the user instruction. The component of the model input specialized for such purpose, coined as _system message_[79], is introduced with ChatGPT2[55]. For closed-source models accessible by API services, system messages can be set by developers in the API request (e.g., Mistral3, Claude4, Command R5). This feature facilitates analysis of the behaviors of top-performing LLMs by diversifying social roles and personalities in system messages [29; 93]. Open-source models report to have trained with specific system messages in an input template include Orca [51] and LaMA 2 [77], with the purpose of invoking step-by-step explanation or maintaining consistency of responses, respectively. While these works corroborate that diversifying system messages instead of default system messages improves performance, the content of system messages studied in previous works is limited in number and domain, making it insufficient to observe the entire space of human preferences. Similar to scaling instruction to improve LLM's capability to solve unseen tasks [47], we scale system messages into multifaceted variants, allowing the model to steer generations to be aligned with user's preferences for the same instruction.

Instruction tuningTraditional instruction tuning approaches [20; 46; 47; 65; 82; 83] focus on improving model performance across diverse tasks by training on varied instructions. Our work extends this concept by leveraging system messages to encode user preferences, providing a novel approach to individualized alignment. While instruction tuning typically embeds task-specific instructions within user prompts, we utilize system messages to separate preference specifications from task instructions. Concretely, we view system messages as _meta-instructions_ that guide a model how to respond to subsequent instructions, which allows for more nuanced control over model behavior in specific training settings [79]. Our approach curates meta-instructions to specifically simulate user values instead of presenting irrelevant challenges or hinting solutions with respect to the instruction. To the best of our knowledge, there is no work that shares a similar motivation with us or has publicly released a training dataset containing meta-instructions.

## 3 Multifaceted Collection for scalable individualized alignment

### Mapping a preference to multidimensional values

Existing alignment datasets often vaguely reflect general preferences such as helpfulness and harmlessness. Our aim is to develop a dataset that captures more _fine-grained_ preferences. Specifically,we posit that even for the same instruction, the choice of which response to select or reject (i.e., preference) may differ among individuals due to their unique set of _values_. For example, given a coding problem, one response focused on code and another centered on explaining concepts might each be chosen as preferable over the other, depending on what the user values as informative. We identify two requirements for a model to effectively reflect such diversity of human preferences:

* **Multifacetedness**: Multiple facets can dictate an individual's preference, not just one. A sufficiently large space of potential facets should be captured in order to model preferences of countless individuals.
* **Explicitness**: Preferences only latently exist in a pair of chosen and rejected responses [70]. To facilitate learning to discriminate the nuances in between a chosen response and a rejected response, the rationale of the decision should be made explicit to the model.

Taking the requirements into account, we develop a novel dataset construction approach as illustrated in Figure 2. To address **R1**, we devise a hierarchical value augmentation strategy: starting from the \(n\) most general dimensions, \(m\) specific subdimensions are branched, and \(l\) values are created under each subdimension. Assuming \(n\ll m\ll l\), this structure ensures that a variety of facets are defined. Ultimately combining values from different dimensions, which we define as a _preference set_, can effectively represent the complex interplay of values to determine a preference. To satisfy **R2**, we conceptualize a value as a detailed textual description of a quality that a desirable response should possess. Verbalization helps the model become more aware of preference patterns [50] and provides interpretable signals to induce better decisions [68]. The verbalized preference set is contextualized in the model input along with the original instruction given by the user. Precisely, it serves as a _meta-instruction_ which sets a specific direction for the instruction to be executed and hence the additional context is included in the _system message_ prepended to the instruction.

### Instruction data construction

Instruction fine-tuning can achieve strong generalization on unseen tasks given a sufficiently large training set of tasks and instructions [30, 46, 65]. To provide a ground for unseen system message generalization and therefore scalable individualized alignment, we implement a LLM-driven data synthesis pipeline to scale the number of multifaceted system messages.

Instruction samplingWe first select 66k instructions from a pool of existing four high-quality preference datasets: Chatbot Arena Conversations [92], Domain-Specific Preference dataset [8], UltraFeedback-binarized-clean [9], Nectar [94], and OpenHermesPreferences [23]. These datasets curate or rank responses with variants of helpfulness or harmlessness criteria, signifying that the input

Figure 2: Multifaceted Collection construction process. For each instruction, value descriptions are augmented from general to specific, allowing for multiple facets to branch out. We combine values from various dimensions into a system message to materialize preferences into model input. Following the system message and instruction, a proprietary LLM generates a gold response for training.

Janus consistently surpasses other models when judged by an LLM.Table 2 shows LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation results on Multifaceted Bench. Janus 7B scores higher than its base model, Mistral 7B v0.2 (+33%), and its instruction-tuned counterpart, Mistral 7B Instruct v0 (+4.6%). It also competes well with larger models like LLaMA 2 Chat 70B (+9%) and Mistral 8x7B Instruct v0.1 (+3.8%), only slightly trailing behind LLaMA 3 Instruct 70B. Janus remain competitive against proprietary models like GPT-3.5-Turbo (+7.6%) and GPT-4 (+3.6%). Incorporating preference optimization methods like DPO with Multifaceted Collection further enhances performance by 0.4%, marking the highest achievement within the Janus suite.

Reward modeling on Multifaceted Collection can effectively distinguish between different values in responses.We study how well our reward model, Janus-RM 7B, can additionally improve generation of Janus models through Best-of-64 sampling. As seen in Table 3, applying Best-of-64 sampling to Janus* 7B increases the average score from 4.14 to 4.28. When used with Janus+DPO 7B, the score further improves from 4.24 to 4.31, marking the highest performance within the Janus suite. The improvements suggests that a single reward model trained on diverse values can enhance multifaceted response generation without the need of multiple reward models.

Overall, Janus adeptly adjusts to a wide array of preferences by training on system messages tailored to multifaceted responses. This adaptability, combined with its compatibility with standard preference optimization techniques, highlights Janus's practical utility to align to unseen values of individuals.

### General helpfulness

Janus outperforms similarly-sized or even larger models in general benchmarks.Table 4 reports strong performance of Janus across _all_ general helpfulness benchmarks. In AlpacaEval 2.0, Janus 7B shows higher length-controlled (LC) win rates than similarly sized models, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 (+9.8%p), Gemma 7B Instruct (+16.5%p), and LLaMA 3 8B Instruct (+4%p). It also surpasses larger models like Vicuna 33B v1.3 (+10.3%p), Mistral 8x7B Instruct v0.1 (+3.2%p,),

Although larger and proprietary models outperform Janus 7B, its results are commendable given its scale. Performance focused on multi-turn scenarios is reported in Appendix A. Additionally in Arena Hard Auto v0.1, Janus 7B scores 20.9, outdoing both smaller LLMs and larger models, including GPT-3.5-Turbo-0125, Vicuna 33B v1.3, and Tulu 2+DPO 70B.

Despite being trained specifically to generate personalized responses when provided preference context through system messages, Janus does not falter, but rather improve in general helpfulness. It is suggested that system message generalization not only supports the creation of personalized LLMs but also improves alignment with what humans generally perceives as helpful.

### Diversity and harmlessness

Janus simultaneously achieves low toxicity and high diversity.Table 5 shows RealToxicityPrompts [16] results of decoding-time algorithms and instruction-tuned models. Janus 7B shows a significantly lower average maximum toxicity and toxicity probability than other instruction-tuned models. Moreover, unlike traditional methods such as [48] where reducing toxicity could compromise performance, Janus 7B manages to maintain lower toxicity while still achieving high fluency and diversity scores. We also observe moderate performance in social bias benchmarks in Appendix B.

responses, 3) no system message with multifaceted responses, and 4) multifaceted system message with multifaceted responses from Multifaceted Collection. Details of default system messages and response collection are in Appendix F. Table 7 shows results using Multifaceted Bench and MT-Bench, with representative baselines for comparison. Training with multifaceted system messages improves both multifacetedness and helpfulness metrics, while default system messages only enhance helpfulness at the cost of reduced multifacetedness. While generating multifaceted responses without system messages shows some improvement, it underperforms compared to models with explicit system messages. This suggests that generating personalized responses without supervision of verbalized preferences is challenging. Overall, exposing user values in the system message and learning to generate personalized responses based on it is an effective strategy for learning the nuances of human preferences.

We also analyze that Janus captures diverse opinions of the human population, and further conduct ablation studies centered on the effect of our hierarchical data generation strategy and data/model scaling. Additional analyses including qualitative analyses are detailed in Appendix C. Comparison of model responses are in Appendix N.

## 7 Discussion

We have introduced an approach that utilizes a unique system message protocol to guide language models to generate responses tailored to nuanced user preferences. Multifaceted Collection, an instruction dataset enriched with a variety of system messages, is designed to encompass diverse user values determining preferences. We demonstrate our trained Janus models' adaptability to unseen multifaceted preferences as well as excellence in general helpfulness and harmlessness. Through analyses, we establish the effectiveness of system message generalization, contributing to developing systems that respect both majority and individual user preferences without requiring per-user fine-tuning.

Broader impact of generalizing system messages instead of user messagesWe identify significant potential in utilizing meta-instructions in system messages rather than in user messages to reach many alignment targets. While some meta-instructions are dependent on specific user messages, it can also be more general. For example, the system message illustrated in Figure 2 is applicable to any kind of coding problems. In practical applications, preferences can be programmatically set as meta-instructions when relevant user queries are submitted, offering two key advantages: 1) automatic reflection of common user needs across various instructions, and 2) reduced user burden of specifying a meta-instruction every time. Applications like ChatGPT already offers features like custom instructions8 and memory controls9: a user can specify their preferences in the custom instruction by oneself (e.g., _When I ask you for math problems, please incorporate visual aids._) or ChatGPT will memorize the details itself from the conversations. We believe that including implicit user preferences in the system message without user specification is an important milestone for seamless chat experience, and a model trained for system message generalization will be necessary.

Limitations and future workOur work is focused on representing user values that constitute a preference in the form of meta-instructions and training models to follow meta-instructions in the form of system messages. While our approach shows promise, several limitations warrant consideration. The reliance on synthetic training data presents inherent challenges, as direct human evaluation of the entire Multifaceted Collection dataset remains unfeasible. Although the performance of Janus suggests generally high data quality and demonstrates lower toxicity levels compared to baseline benchmarks, the flexibility in preference specification may increase vulnerability to malicious attacks such as jailbreaking. To address these concerns, we incorporate safety considerations by including a harmlessness dimension in every system message and implement safeguards in our data generation process. However, the challenge of capturing implicit preferences from previous conversations to form system messages appropriately and managing system message controls remains application-dependent and beyond our current scope. Future work should explore these challenges through dialogue summarization techniques [91; 95], along with enhancing safety through increased safety-related training data and integration with moderation techniques such as LLaMA-Guard [24].

Janus is consistently performant in multi-turn scenarios.To evaluate whether Janus effectively adheres to diverse preferences in multi-turn scenarios, we focus on the multi-turn questions from the MT-Bench, excluding single-turn questions. Table 8 show what Janus consistently outperforms the baselines, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 and LLaMA-3 8B Instruct, with scores of 6.8 compared to 6 and 6.6, respectively. This aligns with the trends observed in Section 5.2, indicating that Janus remains highly competitive in multi-turn settings.

## Appendix B Additional results on harmlessness

Janus does not show critical issues of social bias.According to the results in Table 9, Janus 7B shows a degree of bias similar to that of LLaMA 3 8B Instruct across several tasks, and is better than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 except in BBQ. Figure 6 shows a consistent trend of across models and Janus shows competitive performance. We suggest that there is no striking issues of bias in Janus compared to other models.

## Appendix C Additional analyses

### Representativeness of the human population

We analyze if Janus's distribution over answers is well-calibrated to the human population. We adopt Sorensen et al. [73]'s experiments to test if Janus exhibits less similarity to human populations compared to its base pre-trained model (Mistral 7B v0.2) and its post-aligned counterpart (Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2). Following Sorensen et al. [73], models are evaluated on multiple choice datasets of GlobalOpinionQA [14] and Machine Personality Inventory (MPI) [28], and then we calculate the Jensen-Shannon distance between the human (US and Japan) and model distributions in answer choices, averaged over 5 runs per prompt.

Figure 7 shows the distance between human and model distributions. Echoing the results of [73], aligned models including Janus become more distant to the human population after fine-tuning.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline Model & Score \\ \hline Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 & 6.0 \\ LLaMA 3 8B Instruct & 6.6 \\ Janus 7B & 6.8 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Multi-turn scenarios results in MT-Bench.

Figure 6: Winogender accuracy comparison across models. The ‘gotcha’ scenarios refer to a subset of the dataset where the gender of the pronoun referring to an occupation does not match U.S. statistics on that occupation’s majority gender, i.e., they challenge the model’s reliance on stereotypes more.

Still, Janus exhibits a 2x smaller drop in similarity compared to Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2. We also measure the entropy in Figure 8. This visualizes that Janus is significantly closer to pre-trained and human distributions than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 does. These experiments further suggest that our training method can facilitate calibration to diverse individuals.

### Additional ablation studies

Effectiveness of hierarchical data generation strategyWe prompt GPT-4-Turbo-0125 to generate preferences freely (a preference set of four values or a single detailed preference description) and qualitatively compare them to our original hierarchically generated ones. On ten samples, we observe that free-form preference generation can create more topic-specific preferences, but oftentimes they deviate from what we expect preferences to be. Specifically, some generations include preferences irrelevant to the goal of the user instruction (e.g., a preference for nutritional benefits in a _math_ problem illustrated with apples) or attempt to resolve the user request and hint solutions (e.g., explicitly instructing correct implementations for a coding problem).

Figure 8: Distribution of entropy scores across datasets for each model. The process of computing the probability distribution is explained in Figure 1. Models are either _pre_-aligned or _post_-aligned in the same model family; Mistral 7B v0.2 is denoted as ‘Pre’, Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 as ‘Post’, and Janus 7B as ‘Post-Ours’. Janus is closer to the human and pre-trained distribution while Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 significantly diverges.

Figure 7: Jensen-Shannon distance between the human (US and Japan) and model distributions in GlobalOpinionQA and MPI answer choices. The probability of the model’s next token prediction (logit) for each answer choice selection is calculated, and the probabilities are averaged over 5 runs of the same 3-shot prompt but with randomized answer choices in the few-shot examples. Janus diverges less from the pre-trained distribution than Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2 does.

These problems arise because the model needs to understand and elicit preferences from the human user side, not the assistant side. Our hierarchical data generation strategy allows sufficient control over synthesizing what users would expect in the response. We have decided that preferences for any response would differ under the style, background knowledge, informativeness, and harmlessness dimensions based on various existing literature detailed in Section 3.2. Our method of providing the dimensions in context, coupled with manually crafted seed examples, is instrumental in obtaining high-quality, individualized preferences.

Effect of data scalingWe explore how the size of Multifaceted Collection affects performance. Janus 7B is trained on a dataset containing 197k instances, where each user prompt is paired with three different systems and their responses. To evaluate the impact of scaling, we reduce the number of systems and responses per user prompt to two and one, resulting in datasets with 132k and 66k instances, respectively, and train separate models for each. The results across five benchmarks in Table 10 show that the scaling effect is evident: increasing the training data volume leads to improved scores.

Effect of model scalingWe investigate how variations in the type and size of the base model affect performance. Initially, we use Mistral 7B v0.2, but we also experiment with LLaMA models. Table 11 results show that LLaMA 2 7B performs similarly to or slightly worse than Mistral 7B v0.2. However, increasing the model size from 7B to 13B (LLaMA 2 7B vs. 13B) leads to a noticeable performance improvement. Notably, the latest model, LLaMA-3 8B, outperforms the larger LLaMA 2 13B in benchmark scores (LLaMA 3 8B vs. LLaMA 2 13B). These findings indicate that both model size and the capabilities of the base pre-trained model significantly influence performance when applying our method.

### Response quality

Janus 7B generates qualitatively superior responses compared to other models. For example, as shown in Table 16, when given system message that require a _straightforward, logic-based approach_, Janus 7B accurately follows this directive and constructs logical responses. In contrast, while the responses from GPT-4 are not entirely incorrect, they still fail to adhere closely to the user's preferences. These results demonstrate that Janus not only performs well on benchmarks but also effectively reflects individual human preferences in the quality of its generated responses. For more examples, please see Appendix N.

## Appendix D Details of Multifaceted Collection construction

Instruction sampling and filteringWe select Chatbot Arena Conversations [92], Domain-Specific Preference dataset (DSP) [8], UltraFeedback-binarized-clean [9], Nectar [94], and OpenHermesPreferences [23] as the source of our train data. Starting from 1.27M instructions in total, we remove exact duplicates, and then sample 12k, the size of the smallest dataset (DSP), from other 4 datasets equally, resulting in 62k instructions. We further add instructions from OpenHermesPreferences as it is the training data of the highest-performing open source model at the time, reaching exactly

100k instructions. Additionally, we notice that a significant amount of instructions contain system messages in the instruction that specify a preference, such as "You must generate a detailed and long answer." or "Think like you are answering to a five year old.". Since preexisting system messages might bias preference set generation towards a single context and we desire to replace them with comparatively detailed preference-specific system messages, we use a simple regular expression pattern to detect and remove them: r"{?:(?!.).}*b(you are|you're|imagine|take w*(?: w+)* role)b". The final filtered data consists of 65,653 unique instructions (Table 12).

Seed value creationWe hand-crafted 4 dimensions, 18 sub-dimensions, and 107 value descriptions. The full list keywords of our seed data are in Table 13.

\end{table}
Table 12: Source of instructions in Multifaceted Collectiondescriptions assigned to each instruction. Given that there are three preference sets per instruction and four dimensions defined in each preference set, we computed the metric along the four dimensions, i.e., \(\binom{3}{2}\times 4=12\) scores are obtained per instruction. As depicted in Figure 9, the average ROUGE-L score across all dimensions is approximately 0.21, with the maximum score reaching 0.25. Compared to results from previous studies creating synthetic datasets [20; 81], there is significant diversity among the preferences. It is observed they do not overlap substantially and are well-distributed within Multifaceted Collection. Example subdimensions and keywords of preference descriptions are displayed in Table 14.

Quality of system messagesWe develop two criteria that a proper system message should adhere to: 1) relevance and specificity and 2) coherence and naturalness. We create a score rubric indicating a scale of 1 to 5 for each criterion. Inspired by recent works that use LLM-as-a-Judge to assess the process of training data synthesis [85; 89], we use LLaMA 3.1 8B Instruct [45] to score a random 20k subset of system message-user instruction pairs. Results show an average of 3.74 on relevance and specificity and 4.01 on coherence and naturalness, with 68.8% and 85.6% instances at or above score 4, respectively. This demonstrates the quality of verbalized preferences, potentially revealing why our model is effectively steerable for pluralistic alignment.

SafetyTo check the presence of unsafe content in our synthetic dataset, we evaluate the dataset's system messages, user prompts, and gold responses using a content safety classifier, Llama Guard 3 8B [45]. 99.2% of the 196,998 instances are classified as safe.

## Appendix F Ablation data: default system messages and generally helpful responses

We refer to system messages set as default in popular LLMs as default system messages. Table 15 shows a list of default system messages that contain no model-specific instructions and are sourced from FastChat11.

Footnote 11: github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/conversation.py

To generate generally helpful responses used for training in Table 7, we use same instructions in Multifaceted Collection but with every three multifaceted system messages per instruction replaced with three default system messages randomly sampled from Table 7. Then, GPT-4-Turbo-0125 generate gold responses for the pair of default system message and instruction similar to the Multifaceted Collection construction process.

## Appendix G Details of Multifaceted Bench construction

Instruction samplingWe sample instructions from five benchmarks and exclude instructions that are either used in Multifaceted Collection or overlapped across the benchmarks, and then sample from the remaining messages to collect 315 unique instructions.

Preference set, system message, gold response generationWe use GPT-4 Turbo-0125 to generate synthetic multifaceted system messages and their aligned reference answers, similar to how we curate the Multifaceted Collection. For each instruction, we generate three system messages and one

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 15: List of system messages used by default in other LLMsreference answer, resulting in a total of 945 sets. In this process, we generate system messages with unseen preferences that are not included in the Multifaceted Collection, thereby reducing the possibility of data contamination.

Score rubric generationIn line with previous works [30, 31, 36, 92] indicating that using a score rubric helps in conducting consistent evaluations, we also develop a score rubric to assess the reference answers. The score rubric evaluates how well the model's response adheres to each of the four preference dimensions that comprise the system message. We create one rubric per dimension, resulting in four rubrics for each response. Each rubric includes an explanation of the dimension and criteria for scoring from 1 to 5 based on how well the model follows it. The generation prompt for score rubrics is in Appendix M.

Instance quality annotation and filteringWe employ nine human annotators to assess the quality of the test dataset. See Appendix K for annotator details. We initially divide the 315 unique user instructions into 9 groups of 35 each. For each user instruction, we match three different system messages with three corresponding reference answers and three evaluation rubrics. Annotators are tasked to respond to two questions. The first question asks to determine if the reference answer adequately responds to both the user instruction and system message, with response options being "yes", "no", or "maybe". The second question requires to assess whether the provided score rubric adequately addresses the system message, with options of "yes" or "no". Thus, two questions are assigned for each set of three (system message, reference answer, score rubric) triples, resulting in six questions per user instruction. Ultimately, each evaluator is assigned 35 user instructions, totaling 210 questions to be assessed. The annotation interface is displayed in Figure 13.

Figure 10 shows annotation results. Initially, annotators found 70% of reference answers to be of high quality, 23.7% to be compliant with user instructions but not system messages, and 6.3% to be of poor quality. Regarding the scoring rubric, 77.2% is considered well-constructed, but 22.8% did not meet the evaluative criteria. This indicates that while Multifaceted Bench exhibits some inconsistencies, it generally maintains good quality, akin to other synthetic datasets. To enhance its utility as a reliable test set, we excluded 24 "bad" samples from a total of 945, leaving 921 samples in the final Multifaceted Bench.

## Appendix H Analysis of Multifaceted Bench

Train-test similarityTo verify whether Multifaceted Bench indeed contains unseen preferences not present in Multifaceted Collection, we measure the overlap between the system prompts of the two datasets by calculating their Rouge-L scores. As shown in Figure 11, the average ROUGE-L score is average 0.17 and maximum 0.28 among three system messages per instruction, indicating a sufficiently low overlap. Additionally, this score is lower than the similarities among training data as depicted in figure 9. This low level of train-test similarity, compared to previous studies [30, 81], confirms that Multifaceted Bench successfully represents unseen tasks.

Difficulty of instancesFigure 12 shows the difficulty of Multifaceted Bench instances in 3 levels measured by human annotators. See Appendix K and Appendix L.1 for the detailed procedure.

## Appendix I Computing resources

To train Janus 7B, we utilize four NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs, and for inference, four NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPUs are employed. Additionally, we use an AMD EPYC 7763 64-Core Processor for the CPU, which features 64 cores, a CPU speed of 1497.674 MHz, and a cache size of 512KB. Instruction tuning, DPO, and ORPO all took approximately 1 day in terms of GPU time, while inference for 1,000 instances took about 10 minutes. Evaluation using the API took approximately \(\bar{4}0\) minutes.

## Appendix J Training and inference details

### Instruction tuning and preference tuning

Data compositionInitially, Janus 7B is trained using the entirety of Multifaceted Collection. In contrast, Janus* 7B utilizes only one-third of this data. The rationale for this approach is to reserve the remaining data for training through DPO. Additionally, to train Janus+ORPO 7B, we utilize the full extent of Multifaceted Collection. We structure the preference data specifically for the application of DPO and ORPO. For each instruction, we select one system message and designate the aligned response as 'chosen', while the responses to the remaining two non-aligned system messages are labeled as'rejected'. This preference dataset is then used for preference optimization.

Hyperparameters and implementationTo train Janus 7B, we utilize the axolotl library12. For instruction tuning, the configuration includes a maximum sequence length of 8192, gradient accumulation steps of 4, a micro batch size of 2, and four epochs. We use the adamw_bnb_8bit optimizer, with a cosine learning rate scheduler and a learning rate of 5e-6. Additionally, we employ gradient checkpointing, FlashAttention-2 [10], and mixed precision for efficient training. Warm-up steps are set at 10 and weight decay at 0, with checkpoints saved after each epoch. When applying Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to Janus 7B, the maximum sequence length is adjusted to 2048, micro batch size to 1, epochs to 2, and learning rate to 5e-7, while the rest of the settings remain the same as for instruction tuning. For using ORPO, the alpha is set at 0.1, maximum sequence length at 4096, and epochs at 1, with other settings consistent with those during instruction tuning.

Footnote 12: github.com/axolotl-ai-cloud/axolotl

### Reward modeling

Model selectionWe initialize the reward model from Janus 7B trained on the full Multifaceted Collection for 1 epoch, following prior studies [56, 61, 77, 78]. Initializing from the SFT checkpoint ensures that the reward model knows the concept of multifacetedness the pre-trained model learned from a single pass on the entirety of Multifaceted Collection. The classificationhead for next-token prediction in the pre-trained language model is replaced with a regression head that outputs a scalar reward.

Data compositionWe train the reward model in two stages with multifaceted data and helpfulness data, respectively. In the first stage, we use the same pairwise preference data used for training ORPO as the train dataset. In the second stage, we utilize a mix of representative general helpfulness data inspired by [77] and [8], with 72% of HH-RLHF [5], 14% of OASST1 dataset preprocessed for reward modeling [33], and 14% of WebGPT Comparisons [52]. Through extensive experimentations on proximal policy optimization [66] using our trained reward model checkpoints, we empirically observe that continually training on general helpfulness data prevents reward hacking where the model rewards a response directly paraphrasing the given system message.

Hyperparameters and implementationWe use the OpenRLHF [22] library for training. The following training configurations and objective are applied to both reward modeling stages. For each instruction in the training dataset, we concatenate the pair of chosen \(y_{c}\) and rejected \(y_{r}\) responses prepended with the instruction \(x\) as input. The model is trained on each dataset with the reward modeling objective function in Equation 1. The configuration includes maximum sequence length of 2048, micro batch size of 8, batch size of 128. We use the AdamW optimizer with betas of 0.9 and 0.95, learning rate of 9e-6, and weight decay at 0, along with a cosine learning rate scheduler with warmup steps set to 3% of the maximum number of steps. As in Appendix J.1, we utilize gradient checkpointing, FlashAttention 2, and mixed precision. DeepSpeed Zero-3 is used for distributed training.

### Inference

Hyperparameters and implementationFor inference on test datasets, we use the VLLM library [35]. The maximum number of tokens is set to 4096, with a temperature of 1.0 and a top-p value of 0.9. Additionally, a repetition penalty of 1.03 is specified.

## Appendix K Human annotators information

Human annotators are employed in order to assess the quality and difficulty of Multifaceted Bench (Stage 1) and to compare responses generated by models in a pairwise manner (Stage 2).

We employ 14 English-proficient Korean undergraduate students aged 20-24 from various majors, consisting of 6 males and 8 females. 6 participated only in Stage 1, another 5 participated solely in Stage 2, and 3 took part in both stages. Each task is assigned to nine human workers.

Each stage lasted two hours. We pay W40,000 per person for completing a single annotation stage.

The annotation interface and instructions for Stage 1 is in Figure 13 and the interface for Stage 2 is in Figure 14.

## Appendix L Evaluation details

### Multifaceteds evaluation

When performing inference of a model on Multifaceted Bench, we include both a multifaceted system message and a user instruction in the model. If a model does not have a system message component in its chat template, we simply attach the multifaceted system message before the instruction, separated by a newline character.

Human evaluationWe measure win rate of model responses to Multifaceted Bench by employing eight human evaluators. See Appendix K for worker details. A total of three pairs of model comparisons are conducted: Janus vs. Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2, Janus vs. GPT-3.5-Turbo, and Janus vs. GPT-4. Each question consists of two sub-questions. The first sub-question asks judges to assess the overall difficulty of the problem, considering both the instruction and the system message, with options being easy, intermediate, or hard. The second sub-question involves evaluatingtwo model responses based on the score rubric, instruction, system message, and the reference answer, and deciding which response is better, if both are good, or if both are poor. The annotation interface is in Figure 14. Initially, we randomly sample one out of three possible system message-reference answer-score rubric sets matched to each unique instruction within Multifaceted Bench, creating 315 sets. These sets are then divided into 3 groups, with each group receiving 105 sets. We assign the aforementioned pairs of responses to each set within the groups, resulting in a total of 315 sets per group. Consequently, the total number of problems to be evaluated by human judges is 945, and we distribute these among nine evaluators, with each evaluator responding to 105 problems.

LLM-as-a-JudgeWe additionally utilize a proprietary LLM to measure the performance of our model. To evaluate performance within Multifaceted Bench, we provide the evaluator LLM with an instruction, model response, score rubric, and reference answer, and ask it to rate each response on a scale from 1 to 5. We have developed a score rubric for each of the four preference dimensions reflected in the system prompt to assess how well the model adheres to these dimensions. During the evaluation, we input each of the four score rubrics sequentially into the evaluator to perform four assessments for a single model response. Subsequently, the scores generated by the evaluator LLM are averaged to determine the final score for that problem, and the average score across all 921 items is calculated to establish the model's overall performance score. Furthermore, to ensure the reliability of our LLM-as-a-Judge scoring method, the final scores presented in the tables are averaged from three evaluations per model. The evaluator LLM used in this study is GPT-4-Turbo-0125 with a temperature setting of 1.0. For the evaluation prompts used, please refer to Appendix M.

### Helpfulness evaluation

AlpacaEval 2.0The Win Rate is measured, specifically how often each model's generated responses outperform those from the official baseline model, GPT-4-Turbo. A key metric here is the Length Controlled Win Rates (LC Win Rate), which adjusts for length bias. The baseline model in AlpacaEval 2.0 is consistently GPT-4-Turbo.

MT-BenchEvaluator LLMs rate each model's generated responses on an absolute scale from 0 to 10, using the GPT-4-Turbo model as the evaluator.

Arena Hard Auto v0.1Model performance is measured by comparing the win rate against responses generated by GPT-4-Turbo, scoring between 0 and 100 based on this comparison.

### Harmlessness evaluation

RealToxicityPromptsThe model performance is evaluated in three aspects: toxicity, fluency, and diversity employing the Perspective API. For toxicity, we measure two metrics: average maximum toxicity and toxicity probability. To do this, the large language model (LLM) generates 25 responses for each sample from the 10,000-sample test set of RealToxicityPrompts. The highest toxicity among these 25 responses is considered the maximum toxicity for that sample. We then calculate the average of these maximum values to determine the average maximum toxicity. If at least one of the 25 responses is toxic, that sample is counted as toxic, and we calculate the proportion of such cases to determine toxicity probability. Fluency is assessed using the output perplexity of the GPT-2 XL model. Lastly, diversity is measured by the number of unique n-grams, normalized by the text length.

For the three social bias benchmarks below, we run all of them in zero-shot using a specific branch of the Language Model Evaluation Harness [15]13. We include Gemma 2 9B IT [76] as a baseline as it is a state-of-the-art similar-sized model reported to have been extensively tested on bias benchmarks.

Footnote 13: github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/winogender

WinogenderWe calculate the accuracy of pronoun prediction for a particular gender, namely male, female, and neutral. We also examine accuracy in 'gotcha' scenarios in the dataset. These refer to a subset of the dataset where the gender of the pronoun referring to an occupation does not match U.S. statistics on that occupation's majority gender, i.e., they challenge the model's reliance on stereotypes more.

CrowS-PairsThe metrics are: (i) the average absolute difference in log-likelihoods between stereotypical and non-stereotypical sentence pairs and (ii) the rate of how often the model considers stereotypical sentences more likely than non-stereotypical ones.

BbQModel bias is assessed in two scenarios: (i) whether a model falls back on stereotypes when given limited context ("Ambiguous") and (ii) whether the model's biases override a correct choice even when provided with clear context ("Disambiguated"). The _bias score_ quantifies the degree to which a model's responses align with societal stereotypes or biases, ranging from -100% (completely against the bias) to 100% (fully aligned with the bias), with 0% indicating no measured bias.

You serve as an insightful physics tutor, adept at breaking down complex phenomena into clear cause-and-effect narratives. With a particular flair for elucidating basic physics concepts, your explanations seamlessly connect everyday actions, such as the simple act of opening curtains, to their outcomes, like a room bathed in sunlight, using physics principles. This role demands not only a deep understanding of how light propagates but also a careful avoidance of making assumptions about the user's living conditions. Through detailed explorations that resonate with those having a moderate grasp of physics, your guidance is crafted to be inclusive, avoiding any presumptions about individual access to natural conditions or living spaces. Your goal is to enrich users' understanding by deeply diving into the physics behind observable events, providing them with a comprehensive perspective that is sensitive to their varied backgrounds.

**Janus Response 2:**

To explore the relationship between these two events--sunlight filling the room and the curtains being opened--we delve into the principles of light propagation and the interaction between light and various materials, specifically focusing on how the act of opening curtains leads to the illumination of a room.

Event 1: Sunlight filled the room.

The phenomenon where sunlight fills a room can be traced back to several fundamental physics principles, notably involving the propagation of light and its interaction with surfaces. Light is a form of energy that travels in waves or particles, known as photons, and it is emitted from the Sun. When the sun rises and light begins to travel through the atmosphere to reach Earth, it has already traversed vast distances, losing some of its energy but still retaining the ability to illuminate the surroundings.

Event 2: The curtains were opened.

This event concerns the action of moving curtains from a closed position to an open one. When curtains are drawn shut, they effectively act as barriers or opaque surfaces that prevent light from entering the room. They can be made from materials ranging from synthetic fabrics to natural materials like cotton or silk, all of which, depending on their color and material properties, can absorb, reflect, or transmit light to varying degrees. However, when curtains are opened, they are no longer in a position to block the path of light that enters the room.

The Cause-and-Effect Relationship:

The cause of the room being filled with sunlight is the event where the curtains were opened. This action directly influences the amount of light entering the room because, by removing the curtains from the window frame and allowing them to hang freely, they no longer obstruct the path of incoming light. Sunlight, having been emitted by the Sun and traveled through the atmosphere to the outside of the room's window, now encounters a significantly reduced barrier to entry. Consequently, it passes through the window and into the room, filling it with sunlight.

This effect relies on basic principles of light propagation and the interaction of light with various materials. Opening the curtains increases the surface area and visibility through which sunlight can enter, leading directly to the illumination of the room. Without the opening of the curtains, light would either be completely blocked from entering the room, depending on the color and density of the curtains, or it would enter in a highly constrained manner, resulting in less direct sunlight. Thus, the effect of the room being filled with sunlight follows directly from the action of opening the curtains.

**Janus Response:** \\ It’s heartening to see you seeking thoughts on such a significant decision, especially concerning an organization within your school community. The existence of clubs, including those that are single-gender, can offer unique opportunities for members to connect, learn, and grow. Allgirls clubs can provide a safe space for young women to explore their identities, interests, and capabilities in an environment that may feel particularly supportive and understanding. \\ Reflecting on the broader societal impact and the values we aim to uphold, it’s important to consider the importance of spaces where individuals, especially young people, can feel a sense of belonging and empowerment. These clubs can often become a refuge where members can openly discuss their experiences, challenges, and dreams without fear of judgment. \\ While it might seem like a straightforward decision from one perspective, the closure of an all-girls club might have unforeseen implications. It could affect the morale, self-esteem, and sense of community among the students involved. Additionally, it may limit opportunities for these young women to benefit from the unique dynamics of gender-specific group settings, which can foster leadership, teamwork, and confidence. \\ It would be beneficial to explore alternative solutions that could meet the school’s goals without necessarily shutting down the club. For instance, could there be ways to integrate elements of the club’s activities into a more inclusive setting or create a mixed-gender counterpart that retains the essence and benefits of the current all-girls club? \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

If the decision to shut down the club is driven by concerns about inclusivity or other factors, engaging in a dialogue with the club members and possibly the wider community could offer insights into how these concerns can be addressed while still valuing the club's positive aspects. Such discussions could lead to innovative solutions that benefit everyone involved, ensuring the school maintains a culture that supports all students while respecting individual needs and interests.

Considering the complexities and potential impacts of such a decision, it might be worthwhile to seek input from students, faculty, and even community leaders who share your commitment to fostering a positive and inclusive school environment. In this way, we can ensure that any action taken aligns with promoting the well-being and growth of every student, reflecting our collective values and fostering a community that supports and empowers all its members.

**GPT-4-0613 Response:**

It sounds like you have a significant decision to make. It's important to remember that any action we take has a potential impact on those around us. Shutting down a club, especially one that may be providing a safe and supportive space for students, could have far-reaching implications. I encourage you to consider the purpose of this all-girls club. Is it a space that fosters a sense of belonging, promotes empowerment, or provides resources that are not readily available elsewhere?

If there are reasons that you believe it's necessary to shut down this club, maybe you could look for a compromise instead? Perhaps facilitating a dialogue with club members to address the issues could be beneficial. It's also worth considering if there are alternative spaces or resources that can be provided for these students if the club is indeed closed.

Remember, every action we take has the potential to affect our community, and it's essential to consider these impacts when making decisions. It's also crucial to ensure we are fostering environments that promote inclusivity, respect, and understanding.

Machine learning libraries are essentially collections of pre-written code that help developers and researchers implement machine learning models. They're like toolboxes that contain a variety of tools (algorithms) that can be used to solve specific problems or to handle particular types of data. These libraries offer a focused approach to machine learning, allowing users to plug their data into these tools and get results without necessarily having to build everything from scratch.

Key Characteristics:

- Algorithms Focus: Libraries often focus on specific algorithms or a range of algorithms within a particular category (e.g., classification, regression).

- Ease of Use: Usually designed to be easy to use, allowing for quick implementation and experimentation.

- Community Support: Many libraries are open source, which means they benefit from extensive community support, including documentation, tutorials, and example projects.

Real-World Example: Consider a scenario where a startup wants to predict customer churn based on usage patterns. Using a machine learning library like'scikit-learn', they can quickly prototype models such as logistic regression or decision trees without needing to reinvent the wheel.

### AI Frameworks

AI frameworks, on the other hand, are more comprehensive in scope. They are designed to facilitate the entire process of developing and deploying AI applications, including not just the machine learning algorithms but also data management, model training, deployment, and sometimes even user interfaces. Think of them as full-service platforms that provide a structured path from data input to model output.

Key Characteristics:

- End-to-End Capability: AI frameworks offer a pipeline that can handle data processing, model training, optimization, and sometimes even deployment.

- Customization and Scalability: They provide the flexibility to customize the workflow, integrating with other tools and libraries, and are often designed to scale up for larger, more complex applications.

- Support for Diverse AI Types: Beyond machine learning, some frameworks also support deep learning, natural language processing (NLP), computer vision, and more.

Real-World Example: Imagine a large tech company wanting to develop an AI-powered feature in their product that recognizes and translates spoken languages. Using an AI framework like TensorFlow, they can handle the data collection, model training (including deep learning models), and integration into their product seamlessly, ensuring that the entire process is managed from a single, integrated platform.

### Comparison Overview

- Purpose and Focus: Machine learning libraries are about providing algorithms; AI frameworks are about managing the entire AI lifecycle.

- Complexity and Scope: Libraries are more focused and might be easier to start with for beginners, while frameworks require a deeper understanding of AI development for full utilization but offer a more integrated, scalable solution.

- Application Scenarios: Libraries are ideal for quick prototyping and when specific algorithms are needed, while frameworks are more suited for complex projects or when integrating multiple components of AI development into a coherent system.

### Choosing Between Them

- If you're looking to experiment with machine learning models or need to quickly prototype a simple project, a library might be the more suitable choice.

**GPT-4-0613 Response:**

Sure, let's start with basic definitions. Machine learning libraries are sets of pre-built functions and tools designed to assist in building machine learning models. They offer functionalities to handle tasks like data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and fine-tuning, thereby streamlining the process and reducing the need to code from scratch. An AI framework, on the other hand, is a broader term that includes machine learning libraries and goes beyond them. It's a comprehensive platform that facilitates the design, training, and deployment of a wide array of artificial intelligence models, including but not limited to machine learning. It generally provides a programming interface and a computational backend. Let's make these concepts more tangible with an analogy. Consider building a house. Machine learning libraries are like specialized toolsets - for example, a carpenter's kit with hammers, saws, and other woodworking tools. An AI framework is akin to a construction site, which includes not only the tools but also the architectural plans, building materials, and a place to assemble everything. A practical example in the realm of AI could be Python's Scikit-learn and TensorFlow. Scikit-learn is a machine learning library that provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms. It's an excellent tool for data mining and data analysis, and a great starting point for beginners. TensorFlow, developed by Google, is an open-source AI framework. It has strong support for machine learning and deep learning, but it's flexible enough to conduct other complex mathematical computations. It's a robust platform that caters to researchers and developers, permitting the creation of intricate models and large-scale AI applications. The choice between a machine learning library and an AI framework typically depends on the complexity of your project. If you're focusing solely on machine learning tasks, a library like Scikit-learn may suffice. However, if your project involves a wider range of AI functionalities or necessitates more complex models like deep neural networks, you might prefer an AI framework like TensorFlow.

However, if your project involves a wider range of AI functionalities or necessitates more complex models like deep neural networks, you might prefer an AI framework like TensorFlow.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to 'Abstract' section and Section 1 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach is only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We fully provide the code and data for reproducing our results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We fully provide the code and data. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes], Justification: Please refer to Section 4, Appendix J and Appendix L Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We applied the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology, conducting three evaluations for each application (Appendix L.1) and reporting the averaged results in the table. However, we were unable to explicitly report error bars. Due to financial constraints and the limitations of our computing resources, for models that were unfeasible to run with our resources, we reported values from existing studies. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix I. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We confirm that this work is done following NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 5.3 and Section 7 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In our study, we explicitly cited the original sources of the code, data, and models used, ensuring that all are properly acknowledged. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 3 Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent is obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix K. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work involved human evaluators to assess data quality, not as study participants in traditional human subject research. The evaluators performed specific tasks that did not involve any invasive procedures or pose risks that would typically require IRB review. The role of the evaluators is solely to provide assessments of data quality, without engaging in any form of experimentation or exposure to risk. Thus, IRB approval was not applicable. Our procedures ensured the confidentiality and ethical treatment of all human evaluators involved, adhering to general ethical standards. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
