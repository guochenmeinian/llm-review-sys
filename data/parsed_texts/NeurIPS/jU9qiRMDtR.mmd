###### Abstract

Open-world survival games pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to their multi-tasking, deep exploration, and goal prioritization requirements. Despite reinforcement learning (RL) being popular for solving games, its high sample complexity limits its effectiveness in complex open-world games like Craster or Minecraft. We propose a novel approach, SPRING, to read Craster's original academic paper and use the knowledge learned to reason and play the game through a large language model (LLM). Prompted with the LaTeX source as game context and a description of the agent's current observation, our SPRING framework employs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with game-related questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. We identify the optimal action to take in the environment by traversing the DAG and calculating LLM responses for each node in topological order, with the LLM's answer to final node directly translating to environment actions. In our experiments, we study the quality of in-context "reasoning" induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Craster environment. Our experiments suggest that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, have great potential in completing sophisticated high-level trajectories. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training. Finally, we show the potential of Craster as a test bed for LLMs. Code at github.com/holmeswww/SPRING

## 1 Introduction

Open-world survival games like Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022) and Craster (Hafner, 2021) pose significant challenges for AI algorithms due to a combination of factors: procedural generation requires strong generalization; diverse action space requires multi-task capabilities; technology tree requires long-term planning and deep exploration; diverse and conflicting objectives requires goal prioritization. In particular, Craster is designed for efficient simulation and fast iteration. Similar to Minecraft, Craster features key challenges such as multi-tasking, exploration with a deep and wide tech-tree, requiring the agent to craft multiple tools and interact with multiple objects to survive in the game.

Reinforcement learning (RL) has been the go-to approach for game-based problems, with numerous successes in games like Go (Silver et al., 2017), robotics (Fu et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023) and various video games (Vinyals et al., 2019; Schrittwieser et al., 2020; Badia et al., 2020; Hafner et al., 2023). While RL demonstrated impressive performance, it still suffers from certain limitations, such as high sample complexity and difficulty in incorporating prior knowledge. Such drawbacks make it exceptionally challenging to apply RL to diverse and complex open-world benchmarks like Craster (Hafner, 2021) or Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022). Addressing the benefits and drawbacks of RL is therefore crucial for achieving a sample-efficient solution.

On the other hand, large language models (LLMs) (Brown et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022) have shown remarkable success when prompted for various tasks, including embodied planning and acting (Ahn et al., 2022; Du et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Shinn et al., 2023), QA or dialogue (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023), and general problem-solving (Brown et al., 2020; Bubeck et al., 2023). Their unique planning (Ahn et al., 2022), reasoning (Shinn et al., 2023), and problem-solving (Bubeck et al., 2023; Madaan et al., 2023) ability makes them a promising candidate for incorporating prior knowledge and in-context reasoning for game-based problems, particularly when it comes to addressing the aforementioned limitations of RL.

Hence, in this work, we study the possibility and reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning with human knowledge, in the setting of games. We consider a two staged approach SPRING (Figure 1): (1) **studying the paper**: the first stage reads the LaTeX of the paper of (Hafner, 2021) and (2) **reasoning**: the second stage involves reasoning about that knowledge through a QA framework to take an environment action. Note that the Crafter environment was released after the data collection date of GPT-3.5 and GPT 4 (OpenAI, 2023) models2, the environment is unseen to them. We first use LLM to extract prior knowledge from the LaTeX source code of the original paper by Hafner (2021). We then use a similar QA summarization framework as Wu et al. (2023) which produces QA dialogue on game mechanics. SPRING handles significantly more diverse contextual information than (Wu et al., 2023), making use of all 17 action/interaction types and even information about desirable behaviors documented in the paper.

Footnote 2: GPT-3.5/4 training data ends in September 2021 according to OpenAI API

We focus on reading the relevant academic paper in the first stage of SPRING, by first deciding the paragraphs that are relevant for playing the game. Then we extract key information through a series of questions such as "_Write all information helpful for the game in a numbered list._". In the second stage,we promote and regulate in-context chain-of-thought reasoning in LLMs to solve complex games. The reasoning module is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), with questions as nodes and dependencies as edges. For example, the question "_For each action, are the requirements met?_" depends on the question "_What are the top 5 actions?_", creating an edge from the latter to the former. For each environment step, we traverse the DAG computing LLM answers for each node in the topological order of the graph. The final node of the DAG is a question about the best action to take and the LLM answer for the question is directly translated to environment action.

Qualitatively, our experiments show that LLMs, when prompted with consistent chain-of-thought, can execute sophisticated trajectories independently in Crafter (Hafner, 2021). Quantitatively, SPRING's zero-shot performance with GPT-4 surpassing all state-of-the-art RL algorithmstrained for 1M steps (Table 2).

Our contributions are as follows:

* SPRING is the first to tackle a competitive RL benchmark by explicitly extracting multiple interactions and tech-tree dependencies directly from an academic paper.

Figure 1: Overview of SPRING. The context string, shown in the middle column, is obtained by parsing the LaTeX source code of Hafner (2021). The LLM-based agent then takes input from a visual game descriptor and the context string. The agent uses questions composed into a DAG for chain-of-thought reasoning, and the last node of the DAG is parsed into action.

* We are the first to show SOTA performance in a challenging open world game with a zero-shot LLM-based (GPT-4) policy
* We study the quality of in-context reasoning induced by different prompts and propose a controlled chain-of-thought prompting through a DAG of questions for decision making.

## 2 Method

This section is structured as follows. We first describe how we generate the context from the LaTeX source code of Hafner (2021) in Section 2.1. Then we describe our SPRING framework and how we compute the action in Section 2.2.

Problem SettingOur goal is to show that LLMs can plan and act reasonably well in an environment where control tasks are less required. In the setting of Crafter, we define the states, \(s\), as samples from state distribution \(S\). We are interested in creating a goal-conditioned policy \(\pi\) which maps state \(s\) to action \(a\in A\), \(\pi:S\to A\). Due to the use of LLM, we further break the policy down into two parts: a descriptor \(\mathcal{D}\) which describes key aspects the visual observation in plain text (\(d=\mathcal{D}(s)\)). And an LLM-based actor which takes state description \(d\) and outputs action \(a\).

In addition, we define \(\mathcal{S}^{j}_{\text{para}}\) to be the \(j^{\text{th}}\) paragraph in the LaTeX source of the environment paper (Hafner, 2021), and \(\mathcal{M}_{LLM}\) to be the LLM which takes a context string and a question string as input and outputs an answer to the question.

### Studying the paper: Context from LaTeX source

Similar to Wu et al. (2023), we compose gameplay specific questions and then compute LLM answer to the questions for each subsection in the latex files. Since a considerable amount of the paper is irrelevant to the gameplay, we use a set of 2 questions \(Q_{\text{real}}\)=["Would this paragraph help me succeed in this game"]. "Does this paragraph contain information on the game mechanics, or game strategies?") to identify relevance, and a set of 4 questions \(Q_{\text{semi}}\)=["Write all information helpful for the game in a numbered list.", "In plain text. List all objects I need to interact/avoid to survive in the game. Use "I would like to X object Y" in each step. Replace Y by the actual object, X by the actual interaction.", "Write all game objectives numbered list. For each objective, list its requirements.", "Write all actions as a numbered list. For each action, list its requirements.") to summarize gameplay and action space relevant information. We add the prompt "do NOT answer in LaTeX." to all of \(Q_{\text{game}}\) to prevent the LLM from outputting the list in LaTeX format.

For a specific gameplay specific question \(q\in Q_{\text{game}}\), our goal is to compute \(C_{q}\), the answer to \(q\) conditioned on the paper. However, since the length of the paper exceeds input length constraints for most LLMs, we have to break the paper down into paragraphs individual \(\mathcal{S}^{j}_{\text{para}}\). We provide an illustration of the process in Figure 2.

First, we filter the paragraphs for relevance and keep only paragraphs identified as relevant by at least one question from \(Q_{\text{rel}}\). We set \(P^{\text{rel}}_{q}\) to be the set of relevant paragraphs.

\[P^{\text{rel}}_{q}=\left\{\mathcal{S}^{j}_{\text{para}}|\exists q_{r}\in Q_{ \text{rel}}\ s.t.\ \mathcal{M}_{LLM}\left(\mathcal{S}^{j}_{\text{para}},q_{r}\right)=\text{`` Yes''}\right\}\] (1)

Figure 2: **Paper Studying Module. The 3-step approach for computing \(C_{q}\) from the LaTeXsource code of Hafner (2021). First, as shown in the left column, for each paragraph we compute LLM answer for all relevancy questions in \(Q_{\text{rel}}\), and keep only the relevant paragraphs. Second, as shown in the middle column, we compute paragraph-level LLM answer to \(q\). Third, we summarize the answer into \(C_{q}\) with a summary prompt; we concatenate \(C_{q}\) across \(q\in Q_{game}\) and obtain \(C\).**

Second, we compute the set, \(A_{q}\), of answers to \(q\) for each relevant paragraph from \(P_{q}^{\text{rel}}\), from the LaTeX source code.

\[A_{q}=\left\{\mathcal{M}_{LLM}\left(\mathcal{S}_{\text{para}},q\right):\mathcal{ S}_{\text{para}}\in P_{q}^{\text{rel}}\right\}\] (2)

Third, to obtain the answer string \(C_{q}\) from the set \(A_{q}\), we query an LLM with a summarization prompt \(q_{\text{summarize}}=\) "Remove duplicate items."

\[C_{q}=\mathcal{M}_{LLM}\left(\mathtt{concat}(A_{q}),q_{\text{summarize}}\right)\] (3)

Finally, we concatenate (with the linebreak character) all question-context pairs to form the context string \(C\) for SPRING.

\[C=\mathtt{concat}\left(\{\text{``Question: }q\text{ Answer: }C_{q}\text{"}|\forall q\in Q_{\text{game}}\}\right)\] (4)

### Reasoning: QA-DAG for SPRING

For LLMs to be able to understand the gameplay, we first follow Du et al. (2023); Wang et al. (2023) to define an visual descriptor \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{desc}}\) which converts state \(s\in S\) to textual description \(d\) (Figure 3 a).

To achieve consistent chain-of-thought reasoning (Wei et al., 2021) throughout hundreds of steps within one round of gameplay, we compose a fixed set of questions \(Q_{\text{act}}=\{q_{1},\dots,q_{a}\}\) to query

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c l} \hline \hline Node & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Question} \\ \hline \(q_{1}\) & List objects in the current observation. For each object, briefly answer what resource it provides \\  & and its requirement. \\ \hline \(q_{2}\) & What was the last action taken by the player? \\ \hline \(q_{3}\) & For each object in the list, are the requirements met for the interaction? \\ \hline \(q_{4}\) & Did the last player action succeed? If not, why? \\ \hline \(q_{5}\) & List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5. \\ \hline \(q_{6}\) & What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first? \\ \hline \(q_{7}\) & List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from \\  & the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5. \\ \hline \(q_{8}\) & For each action in the list, are the requirements met? \\ \hline \(q_{a}\) & Choose the best executable action from above. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: List of all 9 questions in \(Q_{\text{act}}\). The questions are designed to promote consistent chain-of-thought. Experimentally, we find the LLM robust to different phrasing of the questions.

Figure 3: **Reasoning.****(a)** The visual descriptor takes the last two gameplay screens as input, and outputs their descriptions in language (\(d^{t},d^{t-1}\)). **(b)** SPRING traverses a DAG of questions from Table 1 in topological order. Answer to the final question \(q_{a}\) is mapped to environment action using sub-string matching. **(c)** The LLM answer for each question (node) is conditioned on the previous 2 steps of observation, the context \(C\), and answers to the immediate parents of the current node.

the LLM at every step of the game, with question-question dependencies as \(D=\{(q_{u},q_{v})|q_{u},q_{v}\in Q_{\text{act}}\text{ and answering }q_{v}\text{ requires the answer of }q_{u}\}\). Note that the above specification forms a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with nodes \(Q_{\text{act}}\) edges \(D\) (Figure 3 b).

For any question (node) \(q_{v}\in Q_{\text{act}}\), we compute the answer \(A^{t}_{q_{v}}\) for time step \(t\), conditioned on the gameplay context \(C\), most recent 2 steps of game description \(d^{t-1},d^{t}\), and answers to its dependencies (Figure 3 c).

\[A^{t}_{q_{v}}=\mathcal{M}_{LLM}\left(\texttt{concat}\left(C,d^{t-1},d^{t}, \left\{A^{t}_{q_{u}}|(q_{u},q_{v})\in D\right\}\right),q_{v}\right)\] (5)

Experimentally, we find that prompting the LLM with only the direct parents of a question greatly reduces the context length, and helps LLM to focus on the most relevant contextual information.

We traverse the DAG using a modified topological sort algorithm to compute LLM answer for each question based on its topological order. Finally, we map the answer to the last question in the node \(q_{a}\) directly to one of the 17 named actions in the environment with sub-string matching (\(a=A^{t}_{a}\)). We take the default action "Do" on sub-string matching failure.3

## 3 Experiments and Results

We present our experiments as follows. First, we explain our experimental setup and baselines for our experiments. Then, we compare SPRING to popular RL methods on the Crafter benchmark. Finally, we conduct experiments and analysis on different pieces of our architecture to study the influence of each part over the in-context "reasoning" capabilities of the LLM.

### Experimental Details

The Crafter environment (Hafner, 2021) is a procedurally generated open-world survival game for benchmarking RL algorithms with 22 achievements in a tech tree of depth 7. The environment is a grid-world features top-down observation and discrete action space of size 17. The observation also shows the current inventory state of the player, including its health points, food, water, rest levels, and inventory. The game is inspired by Minecraft and features a similar get-to-diamond challenge. In comparison, Crafter captures many key research challenges of Minecraft in a simpler and faster environment, thus speeding up experiments and result collection.

Environment DescriptorThe gameplay screen (top left of Fig 3.) consists of a 9 \(\times\) 9 grid (\(\{(i,j)\mid 1\leq i,j\leq 9\}\)). The top 7 rows consist of the local view of the world; each cell \((i,j)\) is associated with a pre-defined background (e.g., "grass", "water", "none") and possibly with an object "asset" (e.g., "tree", "health", "player"). The bottom 2 rows represent agent status (e.g., "health") and item inventories, which include images of assets (e.g., "stone sword"), and the number of each ascent in the inventory.

Our environment descriptor accepts as input the gameplay screen and outputs a text description of the screen. We first create combinations of background and object (appearance) assets. Then we add number assets to recognize the quantity of inventory/ status. We match these combinations with the gameplay screen, using cv2.filters with a matching _threshold_ of \(0.9\). We disable the detector during nights when observations are unreliable. Finally, for each \((i,j)\), we filter the matched combinations, and select the one with the highest matching score. From this information, we can measure the distance and direction of each object relative to the player; simultaneously, we can count the agent status and inventory item.

The environment descriptor then obtains the set of objects in observation \(\mathcal{O}=\{(obj,dist,direction)\}\), the set of inventory items \(\mathcal{I}=\{(object,count)\}\), and the agent status \(\mathcal{H}=\{(attribute,value,max)\}\). Including only the closest object of each kind, we compose the observation description \(d\) as: "You see : - <obj> <dist> steps to your <direction>. Your status: <attribute>: <value>/ <max>. Your inventory: - <object>: <count>". We describe direction of objects using "north","south","east","west".

Evaluation MetricsAgents in Crafter are evaluated primarily based on two metrics: reward and score. The game assigns a sparse \(+1\) reward each time the agent unlocks a new achievement in an episode, and assigns reward of \(-0.1/0.1\) when the agent loses/gains one health point. The score metric (Hafner, 2021) is computed by aggregating the success rates for each achievement:

\[S=\exp\left(\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\ln\left(1+s_{i}\right)\right)-1,\]

where \(s_{i}\) is the agent's success rate on achievement \(i\) and \(N=22\) is the number of achievements. Note that RL agents only train on the reward, and SPRING does not require any training.

RL BaselinesWe include results from popular actor-critic methods like PPO (Schulman et al., 2017); DQN variants like Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018); intrinsically motivated methods like RND (Burda et al., 2018), Plan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020), EDE (Jiang et al., 2022); LLM assisted solutions like ELLM Du et al. (2023); model-based methods like DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2020); DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023), which currently holds the state-of-the-art.

LLMs.For LLM access, we use GPT-3.5-turbo (OpenAI, OpenAI) and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023) from OpenAI's API.

### Overall Results

We compare the performance of RL baselines to SPRING with GPT-4 conditioned on the environment paper (Hafner, 2021) in Table 2.

SPRING out-performs the previous SOTA, including previous attempts at using LLMs for Crafter by large margins, achieving an \(88\%\) relative improvement on game score and a \(5\%\) improvement in reward on the best performing RL method (Hafner et al., 2023). Since the model obtains knowledge from reading the paper, SPRING requires \(0\) training steps, while RL methods generally require millions of training steps4.

Footnote 4: We base our comparison on the hard 1M cap set by Hafner (2021).

We include a plot of unlock rate by task, comparing our method to popular RL baselines in Figure 4. SPRING assisted by prior knowledge out-performs RL methods by more than 10x on achievements like "Make Stone Pickaxe", "Make Stone Sword", and "Collect Iron", which are up to depth 5 down in the tech tree and significantly harder to reach through random exploration. For achievements "Eat Cow" and "Collect Drink", SPRING achieves perfect performance, whereas model-based RL framework like Dreamer-V3 has more than 5x lower unlock rate for "eat cow" since cows are moving and harder to reach through random exploration. Finally, we note that SPRING did not take the action "Place Stone", which can be reached easily by random exploration, since placing a stone was not discussed as beneficial for the agent in the paper (Hafner, 2021).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Method & Score & Reward & Training Steps\({}^{4}\) \\ \hline Human Experts & \(50.5\pm 6.8\%\) & \(14.3\pm 2.3\) & N/A \\ \hline SPRING + paper (Ours) & \(\mathbf{27.3\pm 1.2\%}\) & \(\mathbf{12.3\pm 0.7}\) & **0** \\ DreamerV3 (Hafner et al., 2023) & \(14.5\pm 1.6\%\) & \(\mathbf{11.7\pm 1.9}\) & 1M \\ ELLM (Du et al., 2023) & N/A & \(6.0\pm 0.4\) & 5M \\ EDE (Jiang et al., 2022) & \(11.7\pm 1.0\%\) & N/A & 1M \\ DreamerV2 (Hafner et al., 2020) & \(10.0\pm 1.2\%\) & \(9.0\pm 1.7\) & 1M \\ PPO (Schulman et al., 2017) & \(4.6\pm 0.3\%\) & \(4.2\pm 1.2\) & 1M \\ Rainbow (Hessel et al., 2018) & \(4.3\pm 0.2\%\) & \(5.0\pm 1.3\) & 1M \\ Plan2Explore (Sekar et al., 2020) & \(2.1\pm 0.1\%\) & \(2.1\pm 1.5\) & 1M \\ RND (Burda et al., 2018) & \(2.0\pm 0.1\%\) & \(0.7\pm 1.3\) & 1M \\ Random & \(1.6\pm 0.0\%\) & \(2.1\pm 1.3\) & 0 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Table comparing SPRING and popular RL algorithms in terms of game score, reward, and training steps. Results for SPRING is summarized over 5 independent trials. SPRING out-performs the previous SOTA in terms of all metrics. In addition, since SPRING gathers knowledge from reading the paper, it requires no training.

### Component Analysis

We study how the different aspects of the framework contribute to the behavior of the agent through a series of ablations as shown in Table 3.

Studying the LaTeX PaperIn the first 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of game-play context from the LaTeX paper toward performance of the agent. We report the performance of SPRING with no contextual information (w/o \(C\)) (row 4); SPRING conditioned on only the action descriptions and dependencies from (Hafner, 2021) Table F.1 (only question 4 from \(Q_{\text{game}}\)) (row 3); SPRING conditioned on the context manually modified to exclude the "crafting table" dependency for wooden_pickase by removing two corresponding lines from the context \(C\) (row 2); SPRING conditioned on the full context from the paper (row 1).

As expected, since Crafter environment is unseen for GPT, the agent achieves performance similar to random agent without any game context. When provided with only action descriptions and action dependencies, using only question 4 from \(Q_{\text{game}}\) in section 2.1, SPRING achieves strong \(67\%\) performance comparable to DreamerV2 (Silver et al., 2017).

For the next piece of the experiment, we manually remove "near crafting table" dependency for wooden_pickase from it's context, which is required for 11 later achievements. SPRING with GPT-4 incurs a \(24\%\) performance drop. Interestingly, we find that the LLM has some ability to recover

Figure 4: Ability spectrum showing the unlocking percentages for all 22 achievements. Rainbow manages to drink water and forage for food. DreamerV3 collects coal, iron, stone, and forges more advanced tools and weapons. Since SPRING starts off with knowledge about the game, it achieves more than 10x higher unlock rate on previously hard-to-reach tasks like “Eat Plant”, “Make Stone Pickaxe”, “Make Stone Sword”, and “Collect Iron”.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Method & Achievement Depth & Reward & Questions per Step \\ \hline SPRING + Full Paper & 6 & \(\mathbf{12.3\pm 0.7}\) & 9 \\ SPRING + Paper w/ modified \(C\) & 4 & \(9.4\pm 1.8\) & 9 \\ SPRING + Action Description & 4 & \(8.2\pm 0.2\) & 9 \\ SPRING + w/o \(C\) & 1 & \(0.5\pm 0.2\) & 9 \\ \hline SPRING + Full Paper & 6 & \(\mathbf{12.3\pm 0.7}\) & 9 \\ Step-by-step prompt + Full Paper & 5 & \(7.3\pm 4.4\) & 2 \\ QA w/o DAG + Full Paper & 4 & \(4.3\pm 3.9\) & 9 \\ w/o QA + Full Paper & 2 & \(2.4\pm 1.3\) & 1 \\ \hline SPRING + Full Paper & 6 & \(\mathbf{12.3\pm 0.7}\) & 9 \\ SPRING + Full Paper w/ GPT-3.5 & 2 & \(3.3\pm 2.9\) & 9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Analysis on how different parts of SPRING contribute to its performance, comparing the max achievement depth in the tech tree, the reward, and the number of human-written questions in the prompt. Results are summarized over 5 independent trials. The first 4 rows study the necessity of prior knowledge from the context string \(C\). The middle 4 rows study different chain-of-thought prompting techniques. The last 2 rows study the role of LLMs. All three aspects are important for SPRING to achieve best reported performance.

from the inaccurate context information. We observe that after failing to craft the wooden_pickaxe without a table, the agent instead tries to craft a wooden_sword first to maintain survival. Eventually, the agent was able to identify the missing requirement through guessing and trying after some unsuccessful trials, and craft the wooden_pickaxe. However, the confusion delayed the agent's progress and therefore causes the performance gap with the agent conditioned on the full context (row 5).

ReasoningIn the middle 4 rows of Table 3, we investigate the contribution of different prompting methods toward performance of the model. Conditioned on the full context from the LaTeX paper, we report the performance of GPT-4 directly prompted to output the action using the last question \(q_{a}\) only (row 8); GPT-4 prompted with all questions from \(Q_{\text{act}}\) but in a list without the DAG dependencies \(D\) (row 7); GPT-4 prompted "Let's think step-by-step" (Kojima et al., 2022) about the next action, and prompted to choose a permissible action \(q_{a}\) with let's think step-by-step followed by \(q_{a}\) again (row 6); GPT-4 with SPRING (row 5).

Relative to our method, we observe that directly prompting the LLM for the action leads to a \(80\%\) performance drop, and therefore does not result in a meaningful agent. The popular chain-of-thought reasoning prompt "Let's think step-by-step" (Kojima et al., 2022) achieves reasonable reward with a \(40\%\) drop, but with a high \(60.27\%\) standard deviation. Qualitatively, we observe that the LLM produces inconsistent outputs across time steps, due to the fact that the model's chain-of-thought is not directed or controlled through the prompt. Therefore, LLMs prompted with "Let's think step-by-step" alone cannot reliably follow a good policy. Controlling the chain-of-thought with 9 questions from \(Q_{\text{act}}\) (section 2.2) successfully controls the consistency of LLM outputs across time qualitatively. However, we observe that the LLM often ignores earlier questions at later stages of QA when all previous questions are presented in a list, leading to random disagreements in answers. For example, the LLM may correctly identify that it needs "wooden pickaxe" to mine the stone ahead in the first few questions, but forgets about the requirement later when it's prompted for actions. Quantitatively, the model performs \(65\%\) worse with \(90\%\) variance without the DAG. The introduction of DAG eliminates this problem by reducing the QA context length to only a question's immediate parents.

Overall, SPRING achieves the best performance and a small \(6\%\) performance standard deviation, due to more consistent reasoning over time steps with better focus and fewer distractions.

LlmIn the last two rows of Table 3, we show that the same architecture does not work well with GPT-3.5-turbo. We believe the observed \(73\%\) performance gap mainly comes from GPT-3.5-turbo's worse performance at following fine-grained instructions in each of the questions, which are required for chain-of-thought reasoning with SPRING.

### Cost for running SPRING

The number of queries per step is 9 (same as the number of questions). Each game could take around 300 steps, but can go up to 500 steps in the worst case. Therefore, the maximum number of queries per game can go up to 4500. According to the public price of GPT-4 API, each query costs around 0.065. The total cost should be less than 270 (USD) per game with GPT-4. Given the progress in chip-set development, we are hopeful that the inference costs will lower, making LLMs more accessible for the public.

### Potential for Benchmarking LLMs

In Table 4, we compare popular publicly available LLMs including GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023), GPT-3.5 (text-davinci-003) (OpenAI, OpenAI), Bard (Manyika, Manyika), Claude (Anthropic, Anthropic), Alpaca-30b (Taori et al., 2023) under the same setting on Crafter, following the same step-by-step prompt as Section 3.3 and Table 3. We observe a clear separation in performance under our setting.

## 4 Related Work

RL v.s. LLMsComparing LLM-based agents against RL agents brings forth a intriguing discussion. RL algorithms do not require prior knowledge such as instruction manuals, and could continually improve given enough trials. However, RL algorithms are typically trained with reward functions deliberately engineered to cover all in-game achievements (Hafner, 2021; Hafner et al., 2023). Such reward functions often require a lot of expert knowledge and careful formulation.

On the other hand, LLM agents like SPRING does not need the reward (we report reward for comparison purpose, SPRING does not use the reward during inference), but instead uses external knowledge from the EIEX source code. In addition, current LLM agents lack the capabilities of improving from interactions.

We hope future works would be able to leverage the benefits of both paradigms in order to achieve efficient planning with fine-grained control.

Policy Informed by Natural Language InstructionsIn the instruction following setting, step-by-step instructions have been used to generate auxiliary rewards, when environment rewards are sparse. Goyal et al. (2019); Wang et al. (2019) use auxiliary reward-learning modules trained offline to predict whether trajectory segments correspond to natural language annotations of expert trajectories.

There has been many attempts to go beyond instruction following to learning from unstructured natural language (Branavan et al., 2012; Goldwasser and Roth, 2014; Zhong et al., 2021; Wang and Narasimhan, 2021). Zhong et al. (2021); Wang and Narasimhan (2021) make use of special architectures to learn reasoning on grid worlds with template-generated instructions. However, the model requires 200 million training samples from templates identical to the test environments. Such a training requirement limiting the generalization of the model and causes performance loss even on slightly bigger grid worlds with identical mechanics.

Wu et al. (2023) proposes a summary (Read) and reasoning (Reward) through a QA prompting framework with an open-source QA LLM (Tafjord and Clark, 2021). The framework demonstrates the possibility of an using real-world human-written manuals to improve RL performance on popular games, despite limiting the interaction types to only "hit". Our framework handles all 17 kinds of interactions available in the game. Moreover, our framework makes use of information on tech-tree dependencies, and suggestions on desired policies extracted from the academic paper.

LLMs for PlanningLLMs have shown promising results at high-level planning in indoor embodied manipulation environments. Huang et al. (2022); Ahn et al. (2022) primarily explores generating plans for embodied tasks, with limited actions space and trajectory length. Song et al. (2022); Wu et al. (2022) enhances Ahn et al. (2022) with greater action diversity and real-time re-planning. However, a lot of the high-level plans lack executability and has to be post-processed to meet specific task requirements, thus limiting the generalization to complex open world tasks. In addition, all prior works along this line operates on few-shot human/expert generated demonstrations containing up to 17 trajectories to provide context for LLMs, which requires more manual labor, and may limit the generalization to unseen scenarios. In comparison, our SPRING framework requires no demonstration.

LLMs for Open World GamesCompared to popular indoor manipulation tasks, planning in open-world game environments poses the following additional challenges. 1) **Long horizon.** Due to the nature how in-game achievement/technology progresses, a successful gameplay can easily go beyond 200 steps (Hafner, 2021). 2) **Parallel objectives.** Open-world environments contain objectives that can be pursued in parallel and often require prioritization (Wang et al., 2023). Therefore, open world games are significantly more challenging than current indoor embodied manipulation environments.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Method & Achievement Depth & Reward & Questions per Step \\ \hline Step-by-step prompt + GPT-4 & 5 & \(\mathbf{7.3\pm 4.4}\) & 2 \\ Step-by-step prompt + text-davinci-003 & 4 & \(4.5\pm 2.1\) & 2 \\ Step-by-step prompt + Bard & 0 & \(-0.9\pm 0\) & 2 \\ Step-by-step prompt + Claude & 1 & \(0.1\pm 0.1\) & 2 \\ Step-by-step prompt + Alpaca-30b & 1 & \(0.1\pm 0.1\) & 2 \\ Random & 1 & \(2.1\pm 1.3\) & 0 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Comparison of different LLMs under the same setting using the context \(C\) generated with text-davinci-003 following the same step-by-step prompt as Section 3.3 and Table 3.

Du et al. (2023) applies LLMs as high-level planners to assist RL exploration in Crafter. Wang et al. (2023); Yuan et al. (2023) use LLMs as high-level planner and goal selector to control a low level-policy in Minecraft. Tsai et al. (2023) studies the capabilities of ChatGPT on text games. Notably, all prior works require expert or human generated example trajectories as context for the LLMs. Since the example trajectories do not cover all scenarios, all prior works may encounter unseen situation during evaluation, leading to an overall performance inferior to state-of-the-art RL algorithms (Hessel et al., 2018; Guss et al., 2021; Hafner et al., 2023), trained without the use of LLMs. To our knowledge, we are the first to show an LLM (GPT-4) achieving performance surpassing the state-of-the-art RL algorithms in a challenging open world game.

## 5 Limitations and Future Work

A primary limitation in using an LLM to support interaction with the environment is the need for object recognition and grounding. However, these limitations do not exist in environments that offer accurate object information, such as contemporary games (Fan et al., 2022) and virtual reality worlds (Kolve et al., 2017). While pre-trained visual backbones (He et al., 2017) perform poorly on games, they have shown reasonable performance for environments closer to the real-world (Shridhar et al., 2020). In addition, with recent progress on visual-language models (Bubeck et al., 2023; Driess et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), we believe there will be reliable and generalizable solutions to visual-language understanding in the foreseeable future. Future works could focus on address the requirement for a separate visual descriptor with large visual-language models.

## 6 Conclusions

In this work, we explore solving the Crafter (Hafner, 2021) RL benchmark using the latest LLMs by reading the LaTeX source code of an academic paper about the benchmark. We study the quality of in-context "reasoning" and "planning" induced by different forms of prompts under the setting of the Crafter open-world environment. To enforce consistent planning and execution over hundreds of environment steps, we introduce SPRING, an innovative prompting framework for LLMs designed to enable in-context chain-of-thought planning and reasoning. Quantitatively, SPRING with GPT-4 outperforms all state-of-the-art RL baselines, trained for 1M steps, without any training.

Our work demonstrates the reliability of LLMs for understanding and reasoning with human knowledge. We hope that our work points to a new way of integrating human prior knowledge into RL training through intrinsic rewards (Wu et al., 2023), hierarchical RL (Shu et al., 2017), or sub-goal planning (Wang et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023).

## Broader Impacts

Our research on LLM holds potential for both positive and negative impacts. The benefits include better understanding of the powers of LLM and enhanced integration of prior knowledge, which could lead to advancement in various AI topics. However, the risks may involve reliance on computationally demanding models, game cheating or exploitation, and reliance on prior knowledge.

You see: -tree:S steps to your north-east - cow 6 steps to your north-west

You face grass at your front (south).

Your status: - health:9/9 - food:9/9 - drink:9/9 - energy:9/9

You have nothing in your inventory.

``` -------------Qation:Action - maneuver: Move North - Question:List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its requirement. Answer:
1. Tree:Provides would which is used to craft tools and structures like the table. Requirement: An axes or hands to chop down - the tree.
2. Cow:Provides food when killed, restoring your health points. Requirement: A weapon like a sword to kill the cow or hands to punch it.
3. Grass:Generally provides no resources, but it can occasionally drop seeds for planting. No requirements to interact with - grass.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player? Answer: The last action taken by the player was "make_vood_sward." Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction? Answer:
1. Tree:Yes, the requirements are met as you can use your hands to chop down the tree, even though it will be slower than - using an axe.
2. Cow:Yes, the requirements are met as you have crafted a wood word to kill the cow, which is more efficient than using your hands.
3. Grass:Yes, there are no specific requirements to interact with grass, and you can simply walk on it or punch it with - your hands if necessary. Question: list top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5. Answer:
1. Chop down the tree to collect wood (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools and structures, as well as potentially making a shelter.
2. Kill the cow for food (Priority: 4/5) - Ensuring a sufficient food supply is crucial for maintaining health and being able to accomplish other tasks.
3. Explore the environment (Priority: 3/5) - It is essential to gain more information about available resources and - potential dangers in the surrounding area so that you can plan effectively. Priority level is indicated out of 5, where 5 is the highest priority and 1 is the lowest priority. Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first? Answer: Requirements for the top sub-task (Chop down the tree to collect wood):
1. Approach the tree: Navigate to the tree located S steps to your north-east.
2. What the player should do first:
3. Move North-East: Move in the direction of the tree to eventually reach it and then prepare to chop it down. Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose OMLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5. Answer:
4. Priority 1: Move North - Requirement: Flst ground above the agent. Priority 2: Move East - Requirement: Flst ground right to the agent. Priority 3: Move East - Requirement: Flst ground right to the agent. Priority 4: Chop down the tree - Requirement: Fating the tree; have necessary tool (woodem word can be used, but a - wooden piccaze would be preferred). Priority 5: Collect Wood - Requirement: Successfully chopped the tree, and wood is available to pick up. Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met? Answer:
5. Priority 1: Move North - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is above the agent. Priority 2: Move East - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is available to the right of the agent. Priority 3: Move East - Yes, the requirement is met as flat ground is available to the right of the agent. Priority 4: Chop down the tree - The requirement is partially met; you are facing the tree and have a wooden sword, but - a wooden piccaze is preferred for chopping down trees. Priority 5: Collect Wood - No, the requirement is not met yet, as you have not successfully chopped down the tree or - accessed the wood. Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why? Answer:I cannot determine if the last player action succeeded or not because there is no information provided about the result of the action "false, wood,word". Normally, if the action was successful, the player would have a wood word in their inventory or an updated game state would include the new item.

Answer:
1. Craft a wood pickcase (Priority: 5): To be able to collect stone, coal, and improve your tools, you need to have a wood

pickingcase. And since you have enough wood in your inventory and are close to a table, crafting one should be a top

priority.

2. Collect coal (Priority; 4): Once you have a wood pickcase, collecting coal is important, as it will be required to melt iron in the furnace, which is necessary for crafting more advanced tools like iron pickcase and iron award.
3. Collect stone (Priority; 3): After crafting a wood pickcase, collecting stone resources is necessary as it can be utilized for crafting a stone pickcase, stone award, and creating a furnace. Stone can also be used to build structures, such as bridges or walls, to improve your gameplay experience.

1. Mine Stone: Use the wood_pickcase to mine nearby stones. The player sees stone 2 steps to their south-east.

2. Access a Tablic. There is a table 2 steps to the player's south. They need to be close to the table to craft a stone_pickcase.

The player should first move towards the stone (south-east) and mine it using their wood_pickcase to collect enough stones resources for crafting a stone_pickcase.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

3. Priority 3 - Howe South: Flat ground is required. Since the table is 2 steps to the player's south, moving south will bring the player closer to the table, which is needed for crafting.
4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickkcze: The requirements are that there must be a nearby table and that the player has wood and stone in their inventory. After collecting the stone in the previous steps, the player can now craft a stone_pickkkc while being close to the table.
5. Priority 5 - Drink: To restore the drink aster before it drops too low, the player needs to find a drinkable water source. This action requires a drink source like a lake or river within reach.

3. Priority 3 - Howe South: Yes, the requirement of flat ground is met. The table being two steps to the player's south indicates that it is reachable.
4. Priority 4 - Make Stone Pickkcze: Not yet, as the player has not collected the stone yet. Once the player moves to the stone and collects it using the wood_pickkc, the requirements of a nearby table and having wood and stone in the inventory will be met.
5. Priority 5 - Drink: No, the current observation does not provide information about a drinkable water source. The player needs to find a lake or river within reach before this requirement will be met.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player?

Answer:

The last action taken by the player was "move_south."

Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?

Answer:

1. Grass: Yes, the requirements are met, as you can interact with grass using your hands or tools you have available, such as a wood_pickaxe.

2. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met, as you have a stone_pickaxe in your inventory which can be used to collect stone.
3. Path: Yes, the requirements are met, as there are no requirements to interact with the path. You can simply walk on it.
4. Tree: So, the requirements are met met. as you do not have an area in your inventory to chop down the tree. You would need to craft an axe for this interaction.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:

1. Priority 5: Craft an axe for cutting trees by first crafting a table and then using the available materials (wood, stone) to create an axe. This will allow you to collect more wood for crafting and building purposes.
2. Priority 4: Collect more stone using your strong_pickaxe to have enough resources for future crafting and building projects, such as making stronger weapons and shelter.
3. Priority 3: Replenish your drink and food levels by finding a water source (e.g., lake) to drink from, and search for food sources (such as fruits, vegetables or hunt animals) to ensure that you maintain sufficient energy and health.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?

Lower:

For the top sub-task of crafting an axes, the requirements are:

1. Having a table placed to craft on.

2. Having sufficient word or at some (depending on the type of axes being crafted) in the inventory.

3. Accessing the table to create the axes.

Since the player already has a table in front of them, they should perform the following steps:

1. Approach the table.

2. Use the resources in the inventory (wood and/or stone) to craft an axe.

But first, the player must approach the table by interacting with it, which can be done by standing next to it and facing it.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose QILY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:

From the list of all actions, these are the top 5 actions the player should prioritize:

1. Priority 1: Make Stone Raz (Requirement: Nearby table; wood and stone in inventory)

2. Priority 2: Collect more Road (Requirement: Have Stone Raz or Wood Axe)

3. Priority 3: Make Wood Soror or Stone Sorod (Requirement: Nearby table; wood and/or stone in inventory)

4. Priority 4: Collect more Stone (Requirement: Make Stone Pickrace)

5. Priority 5: Collect Iron (Requirement: Make Stone Pickrace)

These priorities ensure that the player crafts the necessary tools, gathers resources, and enhances their defensive capabilities in the game.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?

Answer:

From the most recent player observation and the provided inventory, let's evaluate each action's requirements:

1. Make Stone Age

Requirement: Nearby table; wood and stone in inventory

Status: Hot met (player lacks wood and a stone axe is not listed in the actions)

2. Collect more Wood

Requirement: Make Stone Axe or Wood Axe

Status: Hot met (player lacks wood to make an axe, and the list of actions does not contain axe crafting)

3. Make Wood Sorod or Stone Sorod

Requirement: Nearby table; wood and/or stone in inventory

Status: Hot for Stone Sorod (player has a table nearby and stone in inventory)

4. Collect more Stone

Requirement: Make Stone Pickrace

Status: Hot (player has a stone pickrace in inventory)

5. Collect Iron

Requirement: Make Stone Pickrace

Status: Hot (player has a stone pickrace in inventory)

Among the listed actions, actions 3, 4, and 5 have their requirements met. However, it is important to note that the original list of actions needs to be updated to include axe crafting and resource collection.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

Answer:

It is ambiguous whether the last player action succeeded or not, as the observations at step 160 and step 162 are identical.

We cannot confirm if the move_south action had any effect on the player's position in the game or if they reached their desired location.

1. Have a furnace placed (already accomplished).
2. Have coal in your inventory (already accomplished with 2 coal).
3. Have iron in your inventory (already accomplished with 1 iron).

As all the requirements are already met, the player should first approach the placed furnace and then use it to melt the iron using the cool they have in their inventory. This will create an iron input, which can then be used to craft better items such as an iron sward or an iron pickcase.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Gather more wood (Priority: 4/5): Wood is essential for crafting tools and items in the game. You currently do not have wood in your inventory, making it a high priority to gather more wood for future use.
2. Drink water (Priority: 5/5): Your third level is at 5/9, which means it is important to find a water source and drink from it to restore your thirst and avoid negative effecte due to dehydration. This is the highest priority task.
3. Find food (Priority: 3/5): Your food level is currently 6/9, and it is important to maintain a good food supply to avoid starvation. Although you can see a cow in your surroundings, prioritize finding and hunting animals or harvesting plants for food to keep your levels up.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?

Answer:

The top sub-task is to gather more wood. The requirements for this task are:

1. Find a tree: Trees are the source of wood in the game. Currently, the player can see a tree 4 steps to their north-west.

What the player should do first:

1. Move towards the tree: The player needs to go 4 steps north-west to reach the tree. They can accomplish this by going west and north alternately or continuously going in one direction, followed by the other until they are in front of the tree.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose OMLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Move towards the tree that is 4 steps to the north-west.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Continue moving towards the tree, which is to the north-west.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Keep moving towards the tree if it still is not directly in front of the player.
4. Priority 4: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Continue moving towards the tree until it is directly in front of the player.
5. Priority 5: Do (Requirement: Facing creature or material; have necessary tool) - Use the wood_pichcase to gather wood from the tree once the player is facing it.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements met?

Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the player is currently facing grass to the west, which indicates flat ground.
2. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met as the player was able to move north in the previous window if issues, indicating flat ground.
3. Priority 3: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - Yes, the requirement is met since the player is facing grass to the west, indicating flat ground.

* 4. Priority 4: Move Sort (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) -Yes, the requirement is met as the player previously moved north without any issues, indicating flat ground.
* This requirement can only be determined once the player is in front of the tree. If the tree is directly in front of the player, and they have a wood_pickaxs in their inventory (which they do), then the requirement is met.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

Inser:

Yes, the last player action succeeded. The action "move_north" doesn't have any specific requirements other than having a flat ground above the agent, and nothing in the observation suggests any obstacle preventing the player from moving north. Therefore, the action was successful.

Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Inser:

The best executable action from the list above is Priority 1: Move West. The requirement of flat ground left to the agent is met since the player is facing grass to the west, which indicates flat ground. This action brings the player closer to the tree, which is 4 steps to the north-west.

2. Priority 2 - Move North: Requirement: Flat ground above of the agent. (Exploring north could increase the chances of finding a water source, fulfilling the drink objective.)

3. Priority 3 - Move East: Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent. (By exploring east, the player may come across a water source or other needed resources.)

4. Priority 4 - Move South: Requirement: Flat ground below the agent. (Going south would further the exploration and could yield a water source or other valuable assets.)

5. Priority 5 - Do (Drink Water): Requirement: Facing a water source like a lake or river at the agent's front. (This action would be taken once the player has found a water source and faced it. Drinking water would restore the player's thirst levels.) Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements net? Answer: 1. Move West: Yes, the requixmants is met. The player is currently facing grass (west) which indicates flat ground left to the agent.

2. Move North: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what's directly north, so it's unclear if there is flat ground above the agent. However, there is a path 2 steps to the north-east and a tree 4 steps to the north-west, which may indicate that moving north could be possible.

3. Move East: Yes, the requixmants is met. There is a path 2 steps to the agent's north-east and flat ground is right to the agent.

4. Move South: Based on the player observation, there is no information about what's directly south, so it's unclear if there is flat ground below the agent.

 Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

 Answer:
1. Collect more wood (Priority: 5/5) - Wood is essential for crafting more tools, and you only have one piece of wood in your inventory. Collecting more wood would allow you to build more advanced tools like a sword for defense or am axe for faster wood collection.

 2. Restors drink level (Priority: 4/5) - Your drink level is lost at 4/9. Find a clean water source like a lake or river and drink from it to restore your thirat level.

 3. Defeat the cow for food (Priority: 3/5) - Your food level is at 5/9, which is not critical yet, but defeating the cow would provide you with a food resource to restore your health later when needed. Use one of your pickaxes as a weapon until you can craft a sword for more efficient combat.

Question: Action

Answer:

Make Stone Sword

Question: List objects in the current observation. For each object, breifly answer what resource it provides and its

requirement.

Answer:

1. Stene: The stone provides material for crafting tools, weapons, and furnaces. The requirement to collect stone is to have

a wood pickhex.

2. Path: The path is not a resource provider, but it serves as a safe passage to navigate the game world without facing

resistance from the terrain.

3. Tree: The tree provides wood, which is needed for crafting tools, weapons, and furniture. No specific requirements are

needed to collect wood, but having an axe can speed up the process.

4. Cow: The cow provides food (meat) to restore the player's food level. The requirement to collect food from the cow is to

have a weapon, like a wood or stone sword, to defeat it.

5. Grass: Grass does not provide any resources directly but can be a flat surface to move on or place items. No requirements

are needed to interact with grass.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player?

Answer:

The last action taken by the player was move_west.

Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements met for interaction?

Answer:1. Stone: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction, as the player has a wood_pickase in their inventory.
2. Path: As there are no requirements for interacting with the path, this can be considered as met.
3. Tree: Yes, the requirements are met for interaction. While there's no specific requirement for collecting wood, having an axa can speed up the process. However, even without an axa, the player can still collect wood.
4. Cow: The player does not have a word (wood or stone) in their inventory, so the requirements for interaction with the cow (to collect food) are not met.
5. Grass: As there are no requirements for interacting with grass, this can be considered as met.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Craft a weapon (Priority: 5/5): Grafting either a wood word or a stone word should be the player's top priority as they need a weapon to defend themselves and defeat cows to collect food.
2. Collect food (Priority: 4/5): The player has a low food level (5/9), so defeating a cow is crucial for obtaining food and replenishing their food meter. This task will become possible once the player has crafted a weapon.
3. Collect drink (Priority: 3/5): The player's drink level is at 4/9, so finding a water source, like a lake or river, will help replenish their thirst. This task can be performed while focusing on crafting a weapon and collecting food.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?

Answer:
1. Crafting a Wood Sword: - Requires a nearby placed table - Wood in inventory (which the player already has: I wood)
2. Crafting a Stone Sword: - Requires a nearby placed table - Wood and stone in inventory (which the player already has: I wood and 4 stone)

The player already placed a table in Step 266, and they have the necessary materials in their inventory. Therefore, the player should craft a weapon (either a wood or stone word) first using the placed table. Crafting a stone word would be more effective, as it is stronger weapon compared to the wood word.

2. Move North (Priority 4): This action requires a flat ground above of the agent. The player wants to get closer to the cow, which is 4 steps to their north-east. Moving north will bring the player one step closer to the cow.
3. Move Best (Priority 3): This action requires a flat ground to the right of the agent. After moving north, moving east will bring the player even closer to the cow, which is their primary target for obtaining food.
4. Do (Priority 2): This action requires the player to face a crvature (in this case, the cow) and have the necessary tool ( the wood sword they crafted). Once the player is close enough to the cow and facing it, they can perform the "Do" action to kill the cow and collect food.
5. Sleep (Priority 1): This action requires the player's energy level to be below maximum. After obtaining food from the cow, the player may choose to sleep (when necessary) to restore energy and allow time for other resources (like trees, fruits, etc.) to spawn.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Priority 4/5: Drink water to restore thirst - With a thirst level of 3/9, the player should prioritize finding a water source and drinking from it to stay hydrated.
2. Priority 4/5: Collect food and eat - The player's food level is 4/9, which indicates that they should focus on finding a stable food source. The cow nearby can be killed to provide seat for immediate consumption, and the sapling can be planted to grow more trees, which could eventually provide fruits.
3. Priority 3/5: Collect more resources - As the player has only 1 wood, 2 coal, and 1 iron in their inventory, they should continue collecting resources such as iron, stone, and wood for crafting items and expanding the shelter. Chopping down trees and mining iron are potential sub-tasks to achieve this goal.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?

Inver:

Top sub-task: Drink water to restore thirst.

Requirements:

1. Find a water source, such as a lake, river, or well.
2. Approach the water source (move towards it using now_north, now_south, now_east, or now_west based on its relative location).
3. Drink water when standing next to the water source.

What should the player do first:

The player should first count for water source nearby. If no water source is immediately visible, they should explore the surrounding areas by moving in different directions until they locate one. (Once a water source is found, the player should approach and drink from it to restore their thirst level.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:1. Priority 1: Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west) - Requirement: Flat ground in the respective direction. This action is a priority as it would help the player explore the environment and locate resources, such as water sources or tress.
2. Priority 2: Drink - Requirement: Standing next to a water source. Drinking is a priority as it will restore the player's third level, which is currently low (3/9).
3. Priority 3: Do (chop down a tree) - Requirement: Facing a tree; have the necessary tool (wood_pickaze, which the player has in their inventory). This action will help the player gather wood, an essential resource for crafting and building shelter.
4. Priority 4: Sleep - Requirement: Energy level is below maximum. Sleeping will restore the player's energy, although the energy level is still high (8/9) so it could be done later.
5. Priority 5: Make Robot Speed - Requirement: Shortly tabled; wood in inventory. Crafting a wood saved is important for self-defense against potential threats like zambies and skeletons, but it's a slightly lower priority than finding water and collecting wood as the player's health level is currently full (9/9).

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements net?

1. Move (move_north, move_south, move_east, or move_west): Yes, the requirements are met. The player can choose a direction with list ground (such as move_north towards the grass) to explore the environment.
2. Drink: Ko, the requirements are not met. The player needs to be standing next to a water source to drink, which is not the case in the current observation.
3. Do (chop down a tree): Yes, the requirements are met. The player is facing a tree in the west direction and has a wood_pickaze in their inventory.
4. Sleep: Ko, the requirement is not met. Although the player's energy level is below maximum, it is still quite high (8/9), so sleeping would not provide much benefit at this time.
5. Make Wood Sword: Yes, the requirements are met. The player has wood in their inventory, but they will need to place a table first (using wood from the inventory) before making the wood saved.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

Answer:

Yes, the last player action (move_east) succeeded. It succeeded because there was flat ground (grause) to the east of the player, allowing them to move in that direction.

Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Answer:

The best executable action from the list above is chopping down a tree. To do this, the player should take the "Do" action, which has met requirements: The player is facing a tree and has a wood_pickaze in their inventory. This action will help gather more wood, an essential resource for crafting and building shelter.

2. Collect food (Priority 4/5); Your food level is at 3/9, so you need to find sources like fruits, vegetables, or animals to increase your food supply and avoid starvation.
3. Goelt iron (Priority 3/5); With coal and iron in your inventory and a furnace nearby, melting iron ore into iron ingots will help you create better tools and weapons, improving your ability to survive in the game.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first? answer: Top sub-task: Collect water

Requirements:
1. Find a water source (such as a lake or river).
2. Have an empty container (such as a bottle or bucket) to collect the water. If you don't have a container, you'll need to craft one.

What the player should do first: Since the player's current drink level is low, finding a water source should be the immediate priority. It is important to explore the environment, moving either east or west to locate a water source such as a lake, river, or small pond. Once the water source is found, the player can drink directly from it until they find or craft a suitable container for portability.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

1. Priority 1 - Move Best or Move West: Requirement: Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player should explore their surroundings to find a water source (lake or river) to quench their thirst.
2. Priority 2 - Drink: Requirement: Be adjacent to a water source. Once the player finds the water source, they should drink from it to replenish their drink level.
3. Priority 3 - Move North or Move South: Requirement: Flat ground in the chosen direction. The player should explore further to find more resources and possibly locate a place to set up shelter.
4. Priority 4 - Place Formace: Requirement: Stone in inventory. The player should plsec the furnace to be able to melt iron, which will allow crafting of better tools and weapons.
5. Priority 5 - Make Iron Pickares or Make Iron Sverd: Requirement: Nearby table, furnace, wood, coal, and iron in inventory. Credit an iron pickare or an iron word to improve aiming and conduct capabilities. Make Iron Sverd might be prioritized since the player has only 1 iron in the inventory, and crafting an iron word will help in defeating more dangerous creatures.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements net? answer:
1. Priority 1 - Move East or Move West: Yes, the requirements are net. The player faces a path in both directions (east and west), and needs to explore their surroundings to find a water source.
2. Priority 2 - Drink: Currently, the requirements are not met. The player needs to find a water source (lake or river) first by exploring the environment.
3. Priority 3 - Move North or Move South: Yes, the requirements are met. There is a stone to the north, and moving south has no obstacles mentioned in the recent observation, indicating the player can choose either direction to explore further.
4. Priority 4 - Place Formace: Yes, the requirements are net. The player has stone in their inventory, so they can place the furnace to melt iron.
5. Priority 5 - Make Iron Pickare or Make Iron Sverd: No, the requirements are not set yet. The player should first place the furnace to be able to melt iron, which requires action 4 to be executed. Moreover, the player currently has only 1 iron, which is not enough for crafting both an iron pickax and iron sword. They should prioritize crafting an iron sword first.

Question: What was the last action taken by the player? Answer:

The last action taken by the player was "move_east."

Question: For each object in the list, are the requirements net for interaction? Answer:

1. Gras: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.

2. Stoney: You have a wood_pickare and a stone_pickare in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting stone are met.
3. Path: No requirements for interaction, so yes, the requirements are met.
4. Tree: You have a wood_pickare in your inventory, so yes, the requirements for collecting wood are met.
5. Table: You already have a table in your vicinity, so yes, the requirements for crafting with the table are met.
6. Zondie: You don't have a award in your inventory, so no, the requirements for defeating the zambia are not met. You need to craft either a wood, stone, or iron word to interact with the zambia effectively.

Question: List top 3 sub-tasks the player should follow. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Craft a sword to defend against the zambia (Priority: 5/5). Since there's a zambia nearby, crafting a sword should be the highest priority for self-defense.
2. Collect wood from the tree to have enough resources for crafting and building (Priority: 4/5). Wood is essential for various crafting recipes and building structures, so it's important to gather more.
3. Increase drink level by finding a water source (Priority: 4/5). Your drink level is 1/9, which is quite low. Finding a water source to restore your thirst level is crucial for survival.
4. Find food and increase your food level (Priority: 3/5). Your food level is also quite low (3/9), although not as critical as your drink level. Finding and consuming food should be done after addressing the more pressing priorities.

Question: What are the requirements for the top sub-task? What should the player do first?

Answer:

The top sub-task is to craft a sword to defend against the zambia. The requirements for crafting a sword (either wood, stone, or iron) are to follow:

1. Be near the crafting table (there's a table 3 steps to your south-sent).
2. Have the necessary resources in your inventory.

The wood sword requires wood in your inventory. The stones sword requires wood and stone in your inventory. The iron sword requires wood, coal, and iron in your inventory.

Since you already have wood (1), coal (2), and iron (1) in your inventory, you can make an iron sword for better defense.

First, move 3 steps south-east to reach the crafting table. Then, craft the iron sword using the wood, coal, and iron that you already have in your inventory.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose OWL from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer:
1. Priority 1: Move South-East (3 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (south-east).

 Reason: Moving towards the crafting table to create a sword.

2. Priority 2: Make Iron Sword - Requirements: Nearby table, furnace; wood, coal, and iron in inventory.

 Reason: To be able to defend against the zambia.

3. Priority 3: Move North (2 steps) - Requirement: Flat ground in the desired direction (north).

 Reason: Ingauge with the zambia once the iron sword is crafted.

4. Priority 4: Default Zondie - Requirements: No specific requirement.

 Reason: To eliminate the zambia that envive the encounter.

5. Priority 5: Drink water - Requirement: Access to a water source (lake, river, or any other water source).

 Reason: To replenish the player's thirst, which is currently at 1/9.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements net?

Answer:

1. Move South-East (3 steps): Yes, the requirements are net. The ground in the southeast direction is not explicitly mentioned, but considering the path and the table, it should be flat ground.

2. Make Iron Sword: No, the requirements are not met. Although the player has iron and a nearby table, they also need to be near a furnace. The furnace's location is not given in the recent observations.

3. Move North (2 steps): Yes, the requirements are met. Moving north twice brings the player closer to the zambia and will be a valid action.

4. Defeat Zondie: No, the requirements are not met yet. While there are no specific inventory requirements for this action, it is recommended to have a sword first (ideally the iron sword) to successfully defeat the zambia. Since the player hasn't crafted an iron sword yet, it would be better to wait until they do.

5. Drink water: No, the requirements are not met. Currently, there is no mention of a water source in the recent observations. The player needs to find a water source (lake, river, etc.) to drink from it.

Question: Did the last player action succeed? Why?

Answer:

Yes, the last player action "two_east" succeeded. The player was able to move to the east because there was a path (flat ground) in that direction, allowing the player to move without any obstacles.

Question: Choose the best executable action from above.

Answer:

The best executable action from above is to "Move South-East (3 steps)" considering that it meets the requirements of flat ground in the desired direction, and it brings the player closer to the crafting table.

Question: List top 5 actions the player should take and the requirement for each action. Choose ONLY from the list of all actions. Indicate their priority out of 5.

Answer: 1. Priority 1: Move West (Requirement: Flat ground left to the agent) - As the player faces grass at their front, moving west brings them closer to the grass, which can help them find a nearby water source.

 15. Priority 2: Move North (Requirement: Flat ground above the agent) - Moving north will help the player avoid the zombia and possibly cong across water or other resources.

 16. Priority 3: Move East (Requirement: Flat ground right to the agent) - If moving west or north deem't provide any water source or if the player wants to explore further in search of water, moving east is the next option.

 17. Priority 4: Move South (Requirement: Flat ground below the agent) - Moving south might provide the player with more exploration options; however, it will bring them closer to the zombia, which increases the risk.

- While searching for a water source, the player can interact with materials or creatures they come across, such as mining stone, cutting wood, or fighting nomesters. But only if they have the necessary tool and health/energy to perform the action.

Question: For each action in the list, are the requirements net? Ansour:

5. Priority 5: Do: This action requires more context, as it depends on the material or creature the player is facing and the necessary tool they possess. Currently, the player has a wood,Pickare and a stone,pickare in their inventory. If the action involves mining stone or cutting wood, the player meets the requirements. However, if the action involves combat with the zombie, the player does not have a sword and may need to craft one first.
