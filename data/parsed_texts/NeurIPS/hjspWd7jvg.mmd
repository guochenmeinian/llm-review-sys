###### Abstract

Single-cell genomics has significantly advanced our understanding of cellular behavior, catalyzing innovations in treatments and precision medicine. However, single-cell sequencing technologies are inherently destructive and can only measure a limited array of data modalities simultaneously. This limitation underscores the need for new methods capable of realigning cells. Optimal transport (OT) has emerged as a potent solution, but traditional discrete solvers are hampered by scalability, privacy, and out-of-sample estimation issues. These challenges have spurred the development of neural network-based solvers, known as neural OT solvers, that parameterize OT maps. Yet, these models often lack the flexibility needed for broader life science applications. To address these deficiencies, our approach learns stochastic maps (i.e. transport plans), allows for any cost function, relaxes mass conservation constraints and integrates quadratic solvers to tackle the complex challenges posed by the (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem. Utilizing flow matching as a backbone, our method offers a flexible and effective framework. We demonstrate its versatility and robustness through applications in cell development studies, cellular drug response modeling, and cross-modality cell translation, illustrating significant potential for enhancing therapeutic strategies.

## 1 Introduction

**Discrete Optimal Transport in Single-Cell Genomics.** Due to the destructive nature of single-cell sequencing technologies, it is fundamental to realign distributions of sequenced cells. Discrete optimal transport (OT) has proven useful in this task. For example, it is standard practice to leverage the framework of OT to reconstruct cellular trajectories across developmental time points [72] and to study the response of cells to external perturbations like drugs or gene knockouts [18]. In these settings, both distributions, i.e. earlier and later time point and before perturbation and after perturbation, respectively, live in the same space, a setting which we refer to as _linear_ OT. In contrast, most applications of OT in single-cell genomics require maps across (partially) incomparable spaces, the setting which we refer to as _quadratic_ OT. For example, analysis of spatial transcriptomics datasets requires the quadratic formulation of OT as the coordinate systems of two different slices are warped and rotated, thus not living in the same coordinate space [60]. Similarly, adding spatial information as a prior has been shown to improve the performance of modeling the trajectory of cells in the discrete setting [39]. Analogously, adding information from lineage tracing readouts [89]recovers the evolution of cells more faithfully [42]. Another prevalent task in single-cell genomics which is commonly approached with quadratic OT solvers is the alignment of cells across modalities [17]. Most single-cell technologies capture only one modality, which is insufficient to obtain a comprehensive representation of the cellular state. As single-cell datasets grow larger [65], traditional OT solvers become less applicable to tasks in single-cell genomics due to their high computational complexity. Thanks to recent advancements in low-rank OT [69; 70; 71], the aforementioned OT-based algorithms are more accessible to single-cell biologists [39]. Yet, the non-parametric nature of discrete OT solvers entails issues with respect to data privacy and prevents their application to large scale single-cell atlases capturing millions of cells [65]. Moreover, out-of-samples estimation is limited to very specific scenarios [63].

**Current Limitations of Neural Optimal Transport in Single-Cell Genomics.** To overcome these limitations, neural OT solvers have been leveraged to study cellular perturbations [7; 8; 86] and to model cellular trajectories [21; 83]. Yet, these methods estimate Monge maps, i.e., deterministic maps, contradicting the assumption that cells evolve stochastically [19]. Stochastic formulations are also favorable as they can produce a conditional distribution that can be used to quantify uncertainty [25]. In the discrete setting, stochastic maps can be obtained from entropy-regularized OT (EOT) [13]. Recently, a number of works have addressed learning EOT plans [29; 41; 76; 84; 85] in the neural setting. Yet, all of these methods are limited in the choice of the cost function, with most of them being restricted to the squared Euclidean cost. Single-cell genomics data is known to be non-Euclidean [57] and thus requires a flexible choice of the cost function in OT applications as demonstrated in the discrete OT setting in Demcetci et al. [17], Huguet et al. [35], Klein et al. [39]. The third requirement for applying OT to single-cell genomics is the option to lift the mass conservation constraint, allowing for _unbalanced_ optimal transport [11; 24; 74]. Unbalanced OT is crucial to model cellular growth and death as well as for automatically discarding outliers, which are prevalent in highly noisy measurements in single-cell genomics. Eyring et al. [20], Lubeck et al. [50], Yang and Uhler [94] proposed ways to incorporate unbalancedness into deterministic linear OT maps, while unbalanced formulations for entropic neural OT have barely been explored. The most severe shortcoming of the existing plethora of neural OT estimators is their limitation to the linear OT scenario, i.e., to learning maps within spaces. Yet, most applications in single-cell genomics require the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) [54] or the fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) [88] formulation. To the best of our knowledge, the only neural formulation for GW proposed thus far learns deterministic, balanced maps for the inner product costs, using a min-max-min optimization procedure, severely limiting its applications [58]. Hence, we arrive at four necessities that need to be fulfilled _and_ have to be flexibly combinable to make neural OT generally applicable to problems in single-cell genomics:

* **N1**: modeling the evolution of cells stochastically as opposed to deterministically,
* **N2**: flexibly choosing cost functions due to non-Euclidean geometry of single-cell genomics data,
* **N3**: allowing for unbalanced OT to model cellular growth and death or accounting for outliers,
* **N4**: mapping across _completely_ or _partially_ incomparable spaces.

**Contributions.** Hence, we propose GENOT (Generative Entropic Neural Optimal Transport), a powerful and flexible neural OT framework that satisfies all of the above requirements:

* GENOT is the first method that parameterizes linear and quadratic EOT couplings for _any_ cost by modeling their conditional distributions, using flow matching [45] as a backbone.
* We extend GENOT to the unbalanced setting, resulting in U-GENOT, to flexibly allow for mass variations in both the linear and the quadratic setting.
* We extend (U-)GENOT to address the fused problem and this way propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first neural OT solver for the FGW problem.
* We showcase GENOT's ability to handle common challenges in single-cell biology: we (i) quantify lineage branching events in the developing mouse pancreas, (ii) predict cellular responses to drug perturbations, along with a well-calibrated uncertainty estimation, and (iii) translate ATAC-seq to RNA-seq with GW and introduce a novel method to perform this translation task with FGW.

## 2 Background

**Notations.** Let \(\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^{p}\), \(\mathcal{Y}\subset\mathbb{R}^{q}\) compact sets, referred to as the source and the target domain, respectively. In general, \(p\neq q\). The set of positive (resp. probability) measures on \(\mathcal{X}\) is denoted by \(\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\) (resp. \(\mathcal{M}^{+}_{1}(\mathcal{X})\)). For \(\pi\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\), \(\pi_{1}:=p_{1}\sharp\pi\) and \(\pi_{2}:=p_{2}\sharp\pi\) denote its marginals.

Then, for \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}),\nu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{Y})\), \(\Pi(\mu,\nu)=\{\pi:\,\pi_{1}=\mu,\,\pi_{2}=\nu\}\). \(\frac{\mathrm{d}\mu}{\mathrm{d}\nu}\) denotes the relative density of \(\mu\) w.r.t. \(\nu\), s.t. \(\mu=\frac{\mathrm{d}\mu}{\mathrm{d}\nu}\cdot\nu\). For \(\rho,\gamma\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\), \(\mathrm{KL}(\rho|\gamma)=\int_{\mathcal{X}}\log(\frac{\mathrm{d}\rho}{ \mathrm{d}\gamma})\,\mathrm{d}\rho-\int_{\mathcal{X}}\mathrm{d}\gamma+\int_{ \mathcal{X}}\mathrm{d}\rho\).

**Linear Entropic OT.** Let \(c:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\to\mathbb{R}\) be a continuous cost function, \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}_{1}(\mathcal{X}),\nu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}_{1}(\mathcal{Y})\) and \(\varepsilon\geq 0\). The linear entropy-regularized OT problem reads

\[\min_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}c\,\mathrm{d}\pi+ \varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\,.\] (LEOT)

A solution \(\pi^{*}_{\varepsilon}\) of (LEOT) always exists and is unique when \(\varepsilon>0\). (LEOT) is also known as the static Schrodinger bridge (SB) problem [52]. With \(\varepsilon=0\), we recover the Kantorovich [38] problem. For discrete \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), we can solve (LEOT) with the Sinkhorn algorithm [13], whose complexity for \(n\) points is \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\) in time, and \(\mathcal{O}(n)\) or \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\) in memory, depending on \(c\).

**Quadratic Entropic OT.** As opposed to considering an _inter-domain_ cost defined on \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\), quadratic entropic OT is concerned with seeking couplings that minimize the distortion of the geometries induced by _intra-domain_ cost functions \(c_{\mathcal{X}}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}\) and \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}:\mathcal{Y}\times\mathcal{Y}\to\mathbb{R}\):

\[\min_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})^{2}}D_{c_{ \mathcal{X}},c_{\mathcal{Y}}}\,\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)+\varepsilon\, \mathrm{KL}(\pi\|\mu\otimes\nu),\] (QEOT)

where \(D_{c_{\mathcal{X}},c_{\mathcal{Y}}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime}):=|c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{ \mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})|^{2}\) quantifies the pointwise cost distortion. A solution \(\pi^{*}_{\varepsilon}\) to Prob.(QEOT) always exists (see B.1). With \(\varepsilon=0\), we recover the Gromov-Wasserstein [54] problem, which is the standard OT formulation for transporting measures supported on _incomparable_ spaces. In addition to statistical benefits [95], using \(\varepsilon>0\) also offers computational benefits, since for discrete \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), we can solve (QEOT) with a mirror descent scheme iterating the Sinkhorn algorithm [62]. For measures on \(n\) points, its time complexity is \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\) or \(\mathcal{O}(n^{3})\), depending on \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\)[70, Alg. 1&22], while its memory complexity is always \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2})\).

**Unbalanced Extensions.** The EOT formulations presented above can only handle measures with the same total mass. Unbalanced optimal transport (UOT) [11, 44] lifts this constraint by penalizing the deviation of \(p_{1}\sharp\pi\) to \(\mu\) and \(p_{2}\sharp\pi\) to \(\nu\) with a divergence. Using the \(\mathrm{KL}\) and introducing weightings \(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}>0\) the unbalanced extension of (LEOT) reads

\[\min_{\pi\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})}\int_{\mathcal{X} \times\mathcal{Y}}c\,\mathrm{d}\pi+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)+ \lambda_{1}\mathrm{KL}(\pi_{1}|\mu)+\lambda_{2}\mathrm{KL}(\pi_{2}|\nu).\] (ULEOT)

This problem can be solved efficiently in the discrete setting using a variant of the Sinkhorn algorithm [24, 80]. Analogously, quadratic OT also admits an unbalanced generalization, which reads

\[\min_{\pi\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})}\int_{(\mathcal{X} \times\mathcal{Y})^{2}}D_{c_{\mathcal{X}},c_{\mathcal{Y}}}\,\mathrm{d}(\pi \otimes\pi)\,+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)+\lambda_{ 1}\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{1}|\mu)+\lambda_{2}\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{2}| \nu),\] (UQEOT)

where \(\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\rho|\gamma)=\mathrm{KL}(\rho\otimes\rho|\gamma\otimes\gamma)\). A solution \(\pi^{*}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) to Prob.(UQEOT) always exists (see B.1). In the discrete setting, Prob. (UQEOT) can be solved using an extension of Peyre et al. [62]'s scheme introduced by Sejourne et al. [81]. Each solver has the same time and memory complexity as its balanced counterpart. For both (ULEOT) and (UQEOT), instead of selecting \(\lambda_{i}\), we introduce \(\tau_{i}=\frac{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda_{i}+\varepsilon}\) s.t. we recover the marginal constraint for \(\tau_{i}=1\), when \(\lambda_{i}\to+\infty\). We write \(\tau=(\tau_{1},\tau_{2})\).

**Flow Matching (FM).** Given a prior \(\rho_{0}\in\mathcal{M}^{+}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\) and a time-dependent vector field \((v_{t})_{t\in[0,1]}\), one can define a probability path \(p_{t}\) starting from \(\rho_{0}\) using the flow \(\phi_{t}\) solving

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\phi_{t}(\mathbf{z})=v_{t}(\phi_{t}(\mathbf{z})), \quad\phi_{0}(\mathbf{z})=\mathbf{z},\] (1)

by setting \(p_{t}=\phi_{t}\sharp\rho_{0}\). We then say that \(v_{t}\) generates the path \(p_{t}\). Continuous Normalizing Flows [9] (CNFs) model \(v_{t,\theta}\) with a neural network, which is trained to match a terminal condition \(p_{1}=\rho_{1}\in\mathcal{M}^{+}_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\). FM [45] is a simulation-free technique to train CNFs by constructing individual paths between samples, and minimizing

\[\mathbb{E}_{t,Z_{0}\sim\rho_{0},Z_{1}\sim\rho_{1}}[\|v_{t,\theta}\left([Z_{0},Z_{1 }]_{\epsilon}\right)-(Z_{1}-Z_{0})\|_{2}^{2}],\] (2)

where \([Z_{0},Z_{1}]_{t}:=(1-t)Z_{0}+tZ_{1}\) with \(t\sim\mathcal{U}([0,1])\). If this loss is 0, the flow maps \(\rho_{0}\) to \(\rho_{1}\), i.e., \(\phi_{1}\sharp\rho_{0}=\rho_{1}\). This property is often referred to as FM preserving the marginal distribution.

## 3 Generative Entropic Neural OT

We introduce GENOT, a method to learn EOT couplings (thus satisyfing **N1**) with any cost (**N2**) by learning their conditional distributions. In SS 3.1, we focus on balanced OT, and show that GENOT approximates linear or quadratic EOT couplings (**N4**), solutions to (LEOT) or (QEOT) respectively. Then, in SS 3.2, we extend GENOT to the unbalanced setting by loosening the conservation of mass constraint (**N3**). We define U-GENOT, which approximates solutions to (ULEOT) and (UQEOT). In SS 3.3, we highlight that GENOT also adresses a fused problem, combining (LEOT) and (QEOT) (**N4**). Finally, we demonstrate in SS 3.4 the GENOT algorithm, that allows to flexibly adapt to different OT formulations, which is key for easy usability for single-cell genomics analysts.

### Learning Entropic Couplings with GENOT

Let \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{1}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\), \(\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{1}^{+}(\mathcal{Y})\) and \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}\) be an EOT coupling between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), which can be a solution of problem (LEOT) or (QEOT). By the measure disintegration theorem, we get

\[\mathrm{d}\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\mathrm{d}\mu( \mathbf{x})\,\mathrm{d}\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})\,.\]

Knowing \(\mu\), we can hence fully describe \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}\) via the conditional distributions \(\langle\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\rangle_{\mathbf{x}\in \mathcal{X}}\). The latter are of great practical interest, as they provide a way to transport a point \(\mathbf{x}\) sampled from \(\mu\) to the target domain \(\mathcal{Y}\); either _stochastically_ by sampling \(\mathbf{y}_{1},...,\mathbf{y}_{n}\) from \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\), or _deterministically_ by averaging over conditional samples: \(T_{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{x}):=\mathbb{E}_{Y\sim\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot |\mathbf{x})}[Y]\). Moreover, we can assess the uncertainty of these predictions using any statistic of \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\), which is crucial in single-cell genomics.

**Learning the Conditional Distributions.** Let \(\rho=\mathcal{N}(0,I_{q})\) the standard Gaussian on the target space \(\mathbb{R}^{q}\supset\mathcal{Y}\). From the noise outsourcing lemma [37], there exists a collection of conditional generators \(\{T^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\}_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}}\) s.t. \(T^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^{q}\to\mathbb{R}^{q}\) and for each \(\mathbf{x}\) in the support of \(\mu\), \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})=T^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\sharp\rho\). This means that if \(Z\sim\rho\), then \(Y=T^{\star}(Z|\mathbf{x})\sim\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). Here, we seek to learn a neural collection \(\{T_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\}_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}}\) of such conditional generators, fitting the constraint \(T_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\sharp\rho=\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot| \mathbf{x})\), for any \(\mathbf{x}\) in the support of \(\mu\). We employ the FM framework (see SS 2) and parameterize each \(T_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) implicitly, as the flow induced by a neural vector field \(v_{t,\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^{q}\to\mathbb{R}^{q}\). Namely, \(T_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})=\phi_{1}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^{q}\to \mathbb{R}^{q}\) where \(\phi_{t}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) solves

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}\phi_{t}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})=v_{t,\theta}( \phi_{t}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})|\mathbf{x}),\quad\phi_{0}(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{ x})=\mathbf{z}.\] (3)

Figure 1: **Left: What do we do?** One task we consider is generating RNA cell profiles from ATAC measurements and an additional cell feature. This is explained in § 5.2, and demonstrated in Fig. 4. As the cells live on manifolds in two (partially) incomparable spaces, we rely on the Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) formulation, as described in § 3.3. Here, the incomparable structural information is contained in the ATAC and the RNA measurements, while the comparable information are the cell features. **Right: How do we do it?** For each \((\mathbf{x},\mathtt{u})\) in the support of the source \(\mu\), we learn a flow \(\phi_{1}(\cdot|\mathbf{x},\mathtt{u})\) from the noise \(\rho\) to the conditional \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x},\mathtt{u})\), whose support lies in that of the target \(\nu\). The flow is multi-modal: It allows sampling structural informations \(\mathbf{y}\), as well as features \(\mathtt{v}\) simultaneously. We highlight this procedure for a specific pair (\(\mathbf{x}_{1}\), \(\mathtt{u}_{1}\)), with \(\bm{p}=2\) and \(\bm{q}=3\).

We stress that while \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\), the flow \(\phi_{1}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) from \(\rho\) to \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) is defined on the target space \(\mathbb{R}^{q}\supset\mathcal{Y}\). Hence, we can map samples _within_ the same space when \(p=q\), but also _across_ incomparable spaces when \(p\neq q\). In particular, this allows us to consider the quadratic OT problem (QEOT). Thus, for each \(\mathbf{x}\), we optimize \(v_{t,\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) by minimizing the FM loss (2) to map \(\rho\) to \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\), i.e.

\[\mathbb{E}_{t,Z\sim\rho,Y\sim\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})}[ \|v_{t,\theta}\left([Z,Y]_{t}|\mathbf{x}\right)-(Y-Z)\|_{2}^{2}]\,,\] (4)

where \([Z,Y]_{t}=(1-t)Z+tY\) interpolates between noise and conditional vectors. Averaging for all \(\mathbf{x}\) in the support of \(\mu\) and using Fubini's Theorem, we derive the GENOT loss:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GENOT}}(\theta):=\mathbb{E}_{t,Z\sim\rho,(X,Y)\sim\pi^{ \star}_{\varepsilon}}[\|v_{t,\theta}\left([Y,Z]_{t}|X\right)-(Y-Z)\|_{2}^{2}]\,.\] (5)

In practice, we optimize a _sample-based_ GENOT loss by estimating \(\pi^{n}_{\varepsilon}=\sum_{i,j}\mathbf{P}^{ij}_{\varepsilon}\delta_{(X_{i}, Y_{j})}\), from \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\sim\mu\) and \(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\sim\nu\), with a _discrete_ EOT solver, see Alg. 1.

**GENOT Captures the Signal from the Mini-Batch Couplings.** Standard FM only preserves straight couplings [47], while bridge matching (its stochastic counterpart) only preserves the linear EOT coupling for \(c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_{2}^{2}\)[5]. In contrast, GENOT is a conditional FM model, learning the conditional distributions of the coupling independently of each other: For each \(\mathbf{x}\), we leverage FM to learn a conditional flow \(\phi_{1}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) that maps \(\rho\) to \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). Therefore, as FM preserves the marginal distributions (see 2), GENOT preserves all couplings. Thus, it always captures the signal carried out by the mini-batch couplings, in both linear and quadratic settings, and for any cost. We highlight this property in Fig. 5, comparing GENOT to other OT-based FM approaches [64; 84; 85].

**GENOT Handles Any Cost.** We can use GENOT to approximate linear or quadratic EOT couplings. In both cases, we make no assumptions on the cost functions: We only need to evaluate them on samples to estimate \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}\) using a discrete solver, see GENOT Alg. 1, line 5. In particular, we can use implicitly defined costs, whose evaluation requires a non-differentiable sub-routine. For instance, we can use the geodesic distance on the data manifold, which can be approximated from the shortest path distance on the \(k\)-nn graph induced by the Euclidean distance [12; 77]. This approach has demonstrated its effectiveness in a range of single-cell genomics tasks relying on discrete OT [17; 35; 39]. We use it with GENOT for both linear (see SS 5.1) and quadratic OT (see SS 5.2).

**GENOT Approximates Conditional Densities.** For each \(\mathbf{x}\), we build a CNF \(p_{t}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})=\phi_{t}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\sharp\rho\) between \(p_{0}=\rho\) and \(p_{1}=\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). From the instantaneous change of variables formula [9], we can then approximate the conditional density \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})\) at an arbitrary point \(\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}\), proving useful to evaluate the likelihood of one-to-one matches between cells, see Fig.23.

### U-GENOT: Extension to the Unbalanced Setting

**Re-Balancing the UOT Problems.** In its standard form, GENOT respects marginal constraints, so it cannot directly handle unbalanced formulations (ULEOT) or (UQEOT). We show that unbalanced EOT problems can be _re-balanced_. Eyring et al. [20], Lubeck et al. [50], Yang and Uhler [93] introduced previously these ideas in the Monge map estimation setting, namely, in a static and deterministic setup. Our method stems from the fact that, for both linear and quadratic OT, the unbalanced EOT coupling \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) between \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\), \(\nu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{Y})\) solves a balanced EOT problem between its marginals, which are re-weighted versions \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) of \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), that have the same mass.

**Proposition 3.1** (Re-Balancing the unbalanced problems.).: _Let \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) be an unbalanced EOT coupling, solution of (ULEOT) or (UQEOT) between \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\) and \(\nu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{Y})\). We note \(\tilde{\mu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=p_{2}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\), its marginals. Then, in both cases, \(\tilde{\mu}\) (resp. \(\tilde{\nu}\)) has a density w.r.t. \(\mu\) (resp. \(\nu\)). That is, there exist two re-weighting functions, one on each space, \(\eta:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}\) and \(\xi:\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}\) s.t. \(\tilde{\mu}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=\xi\cdot\nu\). Furthermore, \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) have the same total mass and_

1. _(Linear)_ \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) _solves the balanced problem (_LEOT_) between_ \(\tilde{\mu}\) _and_ \(\tilde{\nu}\) _with the same_ \(\varepsilon\)_._
2. _(Quadratic) Provided that_ \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\)_,_ \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\) _(or_ \(-c_{\mathcal{X}}\)_,_ \(-c_{\mathcal{Y}}\)_) are CPD kernels (see Def._ B.2_)._ \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) _solves the balanced problem (_QEOT_) between_ \(\tilde{\mu}\) _and_ \(\tilde{\nu}\) _with_ \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})\,\varepsilon\)_, where_ \(m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})=\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}(\mathcal{X} \times\mathcal{Y})\)_._

**Learning the Coupling and the Re-Weightings Simultaneously.** Thanks to Prop. 3.1, we aim to [i] learn a balanced EOT coupling between \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) along with [ii] the re-weighting functions \(\eta,\xi\). Learning them is desirable since they model the creation and destruction of mass. We do both simultaneously by adapting the GENOT procedure. Formally, we seek to optimize:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{U-GENOT}}(\theta) =\,\mathbb{E}_{t,Z\sim\rho,(X,Y)\sim\pi^{*}_{\varepsilon,\tau}}[\|v_ {t,\theta}\,([Z,Y]_{t}|X)-(Y-Z)\|_{2}^{2}]\text{ [i]}\] \[+\mathbb{E}_{X\sim\mu}[(\eta-\eta_{\theta})(X)^{2}]+\mathbb{E}_{Y \sim\nu}[(\xi-\xi_{\theta})(Y)^{2}],\] [ii]

where \(\eta_{\theta},\xi_{\theta}\) are (non-negative) neural re-weighting functions. Crucially, similar to (balanced) GENOT, we only need to estimate a discrete unbalanced EOT coupling \(\pi^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) using samples \(X_{1},\dots,X_{n}\sim\mu\) and \(Y_{1},\dots,Y_{n}\sim\nu\) to compute the two components, [i] and [ii], of the U-GENOT loss. We build upon theoretical insights on the linear OT case and extend them to the quadratic OT case in practice.

**Proposition 3.2** (Pointwise estimation of re-weighting functions.).: _Let \(\pi^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\sum_{i,j}\mathbf{P}^{i,j}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\delta _{(X_{i},Y_{j})}\), solution to (ULEOT) between empirical counterparts of \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). Let \(\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{P}^{\top}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\) and \(\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{P}^{\top}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\) its marginals weights. Then, almost surely, \(n\,a_{i}\to\eta(X_{i})\) and \(n\,b_{i}\to\xi(Y_{i})\)._

Using Prop. 3.1, \(\hat{\pi}^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) is a balanced EOT coupling between its marginals, which are empirical approximations of \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\). Hence, we estimate the first term [i] of the loss as we do in the balanced case by sampling from the discrete coupling. Furthermore, Prop.3.2 highlights that the estimation of \(\hat{\pi}^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) also provides a consistent estimate of the re-weighting function evaluations at each \(X_{i}\) and \(Y_{i}\). This enables estimating the second term [ii]. Therefore, switching from GENOT to U-GENOT simply involves using an unbalanced solver instead of a balanced one, and regressing the neural re-weighting functions on the marginal weights of the estimated discrete coupling. We detail our procedure in Alg. 1, showing the additional steps w.r.t. GENOT in teal.

### Combining Linear and Quadratic OT

We show in SS 3.1 and SS 3.2 how to use GENOT to solve OT problems within the same space or across incomparable spaces. On the other hand, numerous real-world problems pose the challenge of the source and target domains being only _partially_ incomparable [88]. Therefore, suppose that the source and target space can be decomposed as \(\mathcal{X}=\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(\mathcal{Y}=\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}\), respectively. Intuitively, a sample \((\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x})\in\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}}\) can be interpreted as a structural information \(\mathbf{x}\) equipped with a feature \(\mathbf{u}\). Assume we are given a cost \(c:\Omega\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}\) to compare features, along with the intra-domain costs \(c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}\). The entropic Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) problem reads

\[\min_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{((\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}})\times(\Omega \times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}))^{2}}D^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{ \mathcal{Y}}}}\,\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu \otimes\nu)\,,\] (EFGW)

where \(D^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}}\left((\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x}),(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}),\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime} \right):=(1-\alpha)\,c(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})+\alpha\,|c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}} (\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y} ^{\prime})|^{2}\) and \(\alpha\in[0,1]\). This loss combines the pointwise structural distortion and the feature information. We refer to the additional cost on the feature information as the _fused term_. The weighting \(\alpha\) allows us to interpolate between purely linear OT on the feature (\(\alpha=0\)), and purely quadratic OT (\(\alpha=1\)) on the structural information. Problem (EFGW) also admits an unbalanced extension, derived similarly as (UQEOT) with the quadratic \(\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}\)[82]. An (un)balanced fused EOT coupling always exists (see B.1), it minimizes distortion along the structural information and displacement cost along the features.

**(U-)GENOT for the Fused Setting.** Whether in the balanced or unbalanced setting, we can use our method to learn a specific coupling as soon as it can be estimated from samples. We stress that the discrete solvers introduced by Peyre et al. [62] and Sejourne et al. [81] we use for (QEOT) and (UQEOT), respectively, are still applicable in the fused setting. As a result, we can approximate solutions of (EFGW) and its unbalanced counterpart with (U-)GENOT. To illustrate the learning outcome, take a solution \(\pi^{*}_{\alpha}\) of (EFGW). Learning \(\pi^{*}_{\alpha}\) with our method amounts to training vector fields that are conditioned on pairs of modalities from the source domain \(v_{t,\theta}(\cdot,|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x})\), to sample pairs of modalities from the target domain via the flow: \(Z\sim\rho\), \(\phi_{1}(Z|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x})=(V,Y)\sim\pi^{*}_{\alpha}(\cdot|\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x})\). The sampled modalities \((V,Y)\) (i) minimize transport cost quantified by \(c\) along the feature (ii) while minimizing the distortion along the structural information quantified by \(c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}}\) and \(c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}\). In SS 5.2, we use fused couplings to enhance the translation between different modalities of cells.

**Why Does Adding a Fused Term Provide Benefits?** Generally, unlike the linear EOT problem (LEOT), the solution \(\pi^{*}_{\varepsilon}\) to the quadratic EOT problem (QEOT) is not unique. This is where adding a fused term helps, as it introduces more constraints. Intuitively, the fused term on additional features \(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\) allows us to'select' an optimal GW coupling: we trade some GW optimalityby choosing a coupling that not only minimizes the distortion of the structural information \(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\), but also reduces the displacement cost, quantified by \(c\), along the features \(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}\). Empirically, this significantly mitigates the issue of non-uniqueness in (pure) GW couplings. In SS 5.2, we demonstrate that it enhances the stability of our procedure, particularly for single-cell data, as illustrated in Fig. 4 and Fig. 18. On a related note, but independently of the addition of the fused term, we investigate in App. E.2 other strategies to mitigate the non-uniqueness of the GW coupling. Notably, we show that using the geodesic distance on the data manifold as costs, instead of the squared Euclidean distance, helps address this issue on single-cell data. As an alternative, we also introduce an initialization scheme to bias the discrete GW solver to a specific solution based on the neural coupling obtained in the previous iteration (App. E.2). Yet, this approach renders GENOT non-simulation free.

**Algorithm 1**\(\mathrm{U}\)-GENOT. Skip teal steps for GENOT.

Single-cell genomics data is inherently noisy, due to biases incurred by sequencing protocols and the high sparsity of the measurements [34]. Thus, it is indispensable to flexibly switch between configurations of the problem setup. For example, it is often not clear whether the mass conservation constraint should be actually loosened (for example whether to allow for modeling cell death), or whether incorporating prior information for trajectory inference via the quadratic term (e.g. with spatial information [39] or lineage barcoding [42]) is beneficial. Similarly, trying different costs is crucial in single-cell genomics ([17; 35; 39]). The GENOT formulation offers this flexibility by introducing only minor changes into the algorithm. We detail our procedure in Alg. 1, showing the additional steps to switch from GENOT to \(\mathrm{U}\)-GENOT in teal. Limitations are discussed in SS A.

## 4 Related work and Discussions

**Static Neural EOT.** While GENOT is the first model to consider the quadratic (and fused) EOT setting, various methods have been proposed in the linear EOT scenario. The first class of methods solves (LEOT)'s dual. While some of them [27; 73] do not allow direct sampling from to \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\), Daniels et al. [15] and Mokrov et al. [55] model \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). However, these methods might be costly and unstable, as they rely on Langevin sampling during training or inference.

**Dynamic Neural EOT.** The second class of linear EOT solvers builds upon the link between (LEOT) and the SB problem [16; 29; 87; 10]. Although they operate primarily in the balanced setting, Gazdieva et al. [26] recently considered the unbalanced one. As simulations are costly in this setting, recent works consider simulation-free training via bridge matching [41; 46; 61; 76; 84; 85; 96]. While Tong et al. [84; 85] use mini-batch OT, our method is fundamentally different, as we do not build upon the link between EOT and SB. We only use flow matching as a powerful black box to learn a flow from the noise \(\rho\) to each conditional \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). Therefore, our approach allows for more flexibility. First (i), the abovementioned methods assume that \(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\), since they learn a velocity field (or a drift) by directly bridging \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X},\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}\). Then, they map \(\mu\) to \(\nu\) with the induced (stochastic) flow. On the other hand, conditionally to each \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\), we learn a velocity field \(v_{t,\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}):\mathbb{R}^{q}\to\mathbb{R}^{q}\) in the _target space_, by building paths between noise \(\mathbf{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{q}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}\subset\mathbb{R}^{q}\). Then, we map \(\rho\) to each \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) with the flows \(\phi_{1}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\), and recover \(\nu=\phi_{1}(\cdot|\cdot)\sharp(\rho\otimes\mu)\). Second (ii), they can only approximate the SB for \(c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_{2}^{2}\). This results from [5, Prop. 2]. In contrast, our method handles any cost, as shown in Fig 5. Third (iii), as they learn a single flow directly transporting \(\mu\) to \(\nu\), they do not approximate the conditional densities \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})\). Similarly to Tong et al. [85], Pooladian et al. [64] couple samples from \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), but they only model deterministic maps and assume \(\mu=\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d})\). Finally, Bortoli et al. [5] recently proposed an augmented bridge matching procedure that preserves couplings. However, it still requires \(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}\) and does not approximate conditional densities, limiting its applicability in single-cell genomics tasks.

**Mini-batches and Biases** Quantifying non-asymptotically the bias resulting from minimizing a sample-based GENOT loss, and _not_ its population value, is challenging. The OT curse of dimensionality [91] has been discussed in generative models relying on mini-batch couplings [22; 27; 84; 85]. Yet, our goal is _not_ to model _non-regularized_ OT, such as a deterministic Monge map, or a Benamou-Brenier vector field. We explicitly target the _entropy-regularized_ OT coupling. Thus, using \(\varepsilon\gg 0\) helps to mitigate the curse of dimensionality because of two qualitative factors:

1. **Statistical.** For both linear and quadratic OT, all statistical recovery rates that relate to entropic costs [28; 95], maps [63; 66], or couplings [90], have a far more favorable regime, with a parametric rate in \(\varepsilon>0\) thatodes the curse of dimensionality.
2. **Computational.** While the benefits of employing a large enough \(\varepsilon\) in Sinkhorn's algorithm are widely known, Rioux et al. [67] have recently shown that as \(\varepsilon\) increases, the quadratic OT problem (QEOT) becomes convex, making discrete solvers faster and more reliable.

To demonstrate this aspect, we empirically study the influence of the batch size on GENOT, using a recent benchmark [30], with known true linear EOT coupling \(\pi_{\varepsilon}^{*}\), see Fig. 6.

## 5 Experiments

While there is no evidence that cells exactly evolve according to an entropic OT plan, leveraging OT is an established way to realign cells. We also evaluate the performance on simulated data in settings which closed-form solutions of the EOT coupling are available for. Metrics and datasets are discussed in App. C and App. D, respectively. Further experimental details or results are reported in App. E. Setups for baselines are listed in App. F. Implementation details can be found in App. G. We denote by **GENOT-L** the GENOT model for solving the linear problem (LEOT), **GENOT-Q** for the quadratic (QEOT) and **GENOT-F** for the fused (EFGW) one. When considering the **unbalanced** counterparts, we add the **prefix U**. Moreover, when using the **conditional mean** of a GENOT model, we add the **suffix CM**. We denote our learned neural couplings by \(\pi_{\theta}\).

### GENOT-L for modeling cell trajectories

**GENOT-L on simulated data** We show that GENOT accurately computes EOT couplings using a recent benchmark [30]. Tab. 1 shows that GENOT-L outperforms all baselines considered. These results are of particular significance since most of the baselines are tailored towards the specific task of solving (i) the linear EOT problem (LEOT), (ii) in the balanced setting (iii) with the \(\ell_{2}^{2}\) cost. In contrast, the contributions of GENOT go _beyond_ this setting, see **N2**, **N3**, and **N4**. Going beyond the balanced problem (**N3**), we show that U-GENOT learns meaningful unbalanced EOT couplings between Gaussians [36] (11), which we visualize in Fig. 10.

**GENOT-L learns the evolution of cells.** Trajectory inference is a prominent task in single-cell biology. It is key to understand the development of cells from less mature to more mature cell

Figure 2: **Left:** Source cell from the early time points (top left) and samples of the conditional distributions of the EOT coupling learned with GENOT for the geodesic cost \(d_{\mathcal{M}}\) (middle) and the \(\ell_{2}^{2}\) cost (right) projected onto a UMAP [53], along with biological assessment of the learnt dynamics (TSI score, CT error § C.2, Fig. 9). **Right:** UMAP colored according to the uncertainty score \(\mathrm{cos}\text{-var}(\pi_{\theta}^{d_{\mathcal{M}}}(\cdot|X))\) of each source cell \(\mathbf{x}\). Target cells are colored in gray.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

entropic OT plans between Gaussian distributions, which the closed form EOT plan is known for [43]. Fig.19 and Fig.20 show that GENOT-Q is able to meaningfully learn (un-)balanced entropic EOT plans for lower dimensions, but its performance decreases with increasing dimensionality.

**GENOT-Q translates modalities of single cells.** We use GENOT-Q to translate ATAC measurements (source) to gene expression space (target) on a bone marrow dataset [51]. As both modalities were measured in the same cell, the true match of each cell is known for this specific dataset. We compare GENOT-Q with discrete OT extended out-of-sample with linear regression (GW-LR, see F.2). We assess the performance using (i) the FOSCTTM ("Fractions of Samples Closer to the True Match", see C.2) that measures the optimality of the learned coupling, and (ii) the Sinkhorn divergence [23] between the predicted target and the target to assess distributional fitting. As in SS 5.1, we leverage GENOT's flexibility and use as intra-domains costs the geodesic distances on the source and target domain, namely \(c_{\mathcal{X}}=d_{\mathcal{X}}\), \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}=d_{\mathcal{Y}}\) (**N2**). We also estimate the EOT coupling for the \(\ell_{2}^{2}\) cost for comparison. Results are shown in Fig. 3. Regarding the FOSCTTM score, we see that (i) using geodesic costs is crucial in high dimensions and (ii) GW-LR is competitive in low dimensions but not for higher ones. Regarding distributional fitting, GENOT models outperform by orders of magnitude.

**GENOT-F improves modality translation.** To enhance the performances attained by purely quadratic OT-based models, we introduce a novel method for translating between ATAC and RNA. We extend the idea of translating between cell modalities proposed by Demetci et al. [17] to the fused setting: We approximate RNA data from ATAC measurements using gene activity [79], and we further process the data using a conditional VAE [48] to reduce batch effects. This way, we construct a joint space \(\Omega\). Following the notations in SS 3.3, RNA (source \(\mathbf{x}\in\tilde{\mathcal{X}}\)) and ATAC (target \(\mathbf{y}\in\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}\)) carry the structural information, while features \(\mathbf{u}\in\Omega\) and \(\mathbf{v}\in\Omega\) are obtained from the VAE embedding. Fig. 21 shows that the additional linear penalty on the feature term helps to obtain a better alignment compared to GENOT-Q. Fig. 4 visualizes the learned fused coupling compared to GENOT trained with batch-wise independent couplings. When aligning multiple cell modalities, the proportions of cell types in the two modalities often differ (**N3**). We simulate this setting by removing cells belonging to certain cell types Tab. 4 shows that U-GENOT-F preserves high accuracy while learning meaningful rescaling functions.

**Conclusion.** Motivated by applications in single-cell genomics, we introduce GENOT, a versatile neural OT framework to learn cost-efficient stochastic maps, within the same space or across incomparable spaces. GENOT can be used for learning EOT couplings with any cost function, and allows for loosening mass constraints if desired.

Figure 4: **Left**: Benchmark of GENOT-Q models against discrete GW (GW-LR, App. F) on translating cells between ATAC space of dim. \(d_{1}\) and RNA space of dim. \(d_{2}\), with performance measured with FOSCTTM score (App. C.2) and Sinkhorn divergence between target and predicted target distribution. (left) intra-domain costs \(c_{\mathcal{X}}=c_{\mathcal{Y}}=\ell_{2}^{2}\), (right) geodesic distances \(c_{\mathcal{X}}=d_{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}=d_{\mathcal{Y}}\). We show mean and std across 3 runs. **Right:** Top: UMAP of transported cells with GENOT-F (colored by cell type) and cells in the target distribution (gray). Cells of the same cell type generate cells which cluster together in RNA space. Bottom: UMAP of transported cells with a GENOT model trained on batch-wise independent couplings, thus not using OT, generating cells which are randomly mixed.

## Appendix A Limitations

While our study opens up the use of neural optimal transport to a wide range of tasks in single-cell genomics, there are limitations of our work:

* The solution to the entropic (Fused) Gromov-Wasserstein problem is not necessarily unique. As GENOT-Q and GENOT-F leverage discrete solvers in each iteration, the orientation of the solution across iterations is not maintained. To prevent learning a mixture of solutions, we propose to use a fused term whenever possible, make use of different cost functions if helpful, or using GENOT with our proposed initialisation scheme (SS E.2). While the latter can always be applied, its major drawback is the costly training as a neural ODE has to be solved at every iteration.
* When learning unbalanced EOT plans, choosing a value for the hyperparameters \((\tau_{a},\tau_{b})\) is not evident. As discussed in Sejourne et al. [75], the choice of these parameters is mostly empirical.
* While GENOT is motivated by the extensive use of optimal transport in single-cell genomics, there is no evidence that cells evolve exactly according to an entropic OT plan.
* Evaluations of learnt transport plans for tasks in single-cell genomics experiments are task-specific, and do not necessarily reflect to what extent the learnt coupling is an entropic OT coupling. In effect, we rely on prior biological knowledge (CT error, Fig. 2) or on common downstream trajectory inference methods in single-cell genomics to evaluate the learnt velocity field (TSI score, Fig. 2) when computing EOT plans for trajectory inference. Similarly, we can only assess learnt EOT plan on a cluster level, and not a single data point level when studying cellular perturbations (3). For the task of modality translation (Fig. 4), we know the ground-truth coupling. Yet, the ground-truth coupling is deterministic and one-to-one, and hence is not a valid solution of an entropy-regularized Gromov-Wasserstein OT plan with \(\varepsilon>0\).

## Appendix B Propositions and Proofs

### Existence of EOT couplings

In this section, we point out that a solution to the entropic fused GW problem (EFGW), and its unbalanced counterpart, always exists. Note that for \(\alpha=0\), we recover the existence for the pure entropic GW (EFGW) and its unbalanced counterpart (UQEOT) problems. The arguments are adapted from [88, Prop. 2]

**Balanced setting:** We first recall the fused Gromov-Wasserstein problem below.

\[\min_{\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{((\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}})\times(\Omega \times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}))^{2}}Q^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{ \mathcal{Y}}}}\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\] (6)

where \(Q^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}}\left((\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x}),(\mathbf{v},\mathbf{y}),\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime} \right):=(1-\alpha)c(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v})+\alpha|c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y} ^{\prime})|^{2}\). We first need to show that a solution \(\pi_{\epsilon}^{*}\) to this problem always exists. We assume that the intra-domain \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\), \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\) costs, and the inter-domain cost \(c\) are l.s.c, an assumption that matches all our experimental settings. From [88, Lemma 3], this implies that the functional:

\[\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)\mapsto\int_{((\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}})\times(\Omega \times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}))^{2}}Q^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{ \mathcal{Y}}}}\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)\] (7)

is weakly l.s.c, i.e. l.s.c for the convergence in law. Moreover, from [23, Prop. 8], \(\pi\mapsto\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\) is also weakly l.s.c. Therefore, the objective function of the fused Gromov-Wasserstein problem:

\[\mathcal{F}:\pi\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)\mapsto\int_{((\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{X}}) \times(\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}))^{2}}Q^{c}_{c_{\tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{ \tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}}\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu \otimes\nu)\] (8)

is weakly l.s.c, as a sum of weakly l.s.c functionals. Then, since we assume that \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(\mathcal{Y}\) are compact, they are polish spaces, so from [68, Theorem 1.7], \(\Pi(\mu,\nu)\) is weakly compact. Therefore, from Weierstrass Theorem, \(\mathcal{F}\) attains its minimum on \(\Pi(\mu,\nu)\), i.e. it exists \(\pi_{\epsilon}^{*}\) solution to this problem.

**Unbalanced setting:** The proof is very similar. We first recall the unbalanced fused Gromov-Wasserstein problem.

\[\min_{\pi\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})}\int_{((\Omega\times \tilde{\mathcal{X}})\times(\Omega\times\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}))^{2}}Q^{c}_{c_{ \tilde{\mathcal{X}}},c_{\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}}}\mathrm{d}(\pi\otimes\pi)+\varepsilon \mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)+\lambda_{1}\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{1}|\mu)+ \lambda_{2}\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{2}|\mu)\] (9)

where \(\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\alpha|\beta)=\mathrm{KL}(\alpha\otimes\alpha|\beta \otimes\beta)\). From [81, Prop. 8], \(\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}\) is weakly l.s.c, so is \(\pi\mapsto\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{1}|\mu)\) and \(\pi\mapsto\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{2}|\nu)\). Therefore, the objective function of the unbalanced fused Gromov-Wasserstein problem is also weakly l.s.c. as a sum of weakly l.s.c. functions. Moreover, since \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(\mathcal{Y}\) are assumed to be compact, \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\) is also compact and the Banach-Alaoglu provides the compactness of \(\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\). Then, from Weierstrass Theorem, similarly to the balanced setting, we get the existence of a solution \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) to this problem.

### Proofs of SS 3.2

**Proposition B.1** (Re-Balancing the unbalanced problems.).: _Let \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) be an unbalanced EOT coupling, solution of (ULEOT) or (UQEGOT) between \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X})\) and \(\nu\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{Y})\). We note \(\tilde{\mu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) its marginals. Then, in both cases, \(\tilde{\mu}\) (resp. \(\tilde{\nu}\)) has a density w.r.t. \(\mu\) (resp. \(\nu\)). That is, there exist two re-weighting functions, one on each space, \(\eta:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) and \(\xi:\mathcal{Y}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) s.t. \(\tilde{\mu}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=\xi\cdot\nu\). Furthermore, \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) have the same total mass and_

1. _(Linear)_ \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) _solves the balanced problem (_LEOT_) between_ \(\tilde{\mu}\) _and_ \(\tilde{\nu}\) _with the same_ \(\varepsilon\)_._
2. _(Quadratic) Provided that_ \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\)_,_ \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\) _(or_ \(-c_{\mathcal{X}}\)_,_ \(-c_{\mathcal{Y}}\)_) are CPD kernels (see Def._ B.2_),_ \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) _solves the balanced problem (_QEGT_) between_ \(\tilde{\mu}\) _and_ \(\tilde{\nu}\) _with_ \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=m(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*})\,\varepsilon\)_, where_ \(m(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*})=\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}(\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y})\)_._

We first remind the definition of a conditionally positive kernel, which is involved in point 2. of Prop. 3.1.

**Definition B.2**.: A kernel \(k:\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}\) is conditionally positive if it is symmetric and for any \(\mathbf{x}_{1},...,\mathbf{x}_{n}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) and \(\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) s.t. \(\mathbf{a}^{\top}\mathbf{1}_{n}=0\), one has

\[\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}a_{i}a_{j}\,k(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{x}_{j})\geq 0\]

Conditionally positive kernels include all positive kernels, such \(k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\langle\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle\) or \(k_{\gamma}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\exp(-\frac{1}{\gamma}\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{ y}\|_{2}^{2})\), but also the negative squared Euclidean distance \(k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=-\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_{2}^{2}\).

Proof of 3.1.: **Step 1: Re-weightings.** We first show that for \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) solution of (LEOT) or (QEGT), it exists \(\eta,\xi:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) s.t. \(\tilde{\mu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}=\xi\cdot\nu\).

We start with the linear case and consider \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}\) solution of (LEOT). The result follows from duality. Indeed, from [80, Prop. 2], one has the existence of the so-called entropic potentials \(f^{*}\in\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{X})\) and \(g^{*}\in C(\mathcal{Y})\) s.t.

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*}}{\mathrm{d}(\mu\otimes\nu)}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\exp\left(\frac{f^{*}(\mathbf{x})+g^{*}(\mathbf{y})-c( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\] (10)

Therefore, \(\tilde{\mu}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=\xi\cdot\nu\) where \(\eta:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) and \(\xi:\mathcal{Y}\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) are defined by:

\[\eta(\mathbf{x}) =\int_{\mathcal{Y}}\exp\left(\frac{f^{*}(\mathbf{x})+g^{*}( \mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\mathrm{d}\nu( \mathbf{y})\] (11) \[\text{and}\quad\xi(\mathbf{y}) =\int_{\mathcal{X}}\exp\left(\frac{f^{*}(\mathbf{x})+g^{*}( \mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\mathrm{d}\mu( \mathbf{x})\,.\]

We now handle the quadratic case and consider \(\pi_{\varepsilon,\tau}^{*For \(\pi\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\), the quadratic relative entropy \(\mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi|\mu\otimes\mu)=\mathrm{KL}(\pi\otimes\pi|(\mu\otimes \nu)\otimes(\mu\otimes\nu))\) is finite i.f.f. \(\pi\otimes\pi\) has a density w.r.t. \((\mu\otimes\nu)\otimes(\mu\otimes\nu)\), which implies that \(\pi\) has a density w.r.t. \(\mu\otimes\nu\). Therefore, one can reformulate (UQEOT) as:

\[\min_{h\in L_{1}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})}\int_{( \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})^{2}} (c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x})-c_{\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{ y},\mathbf{y}))^{2}\,h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})h(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{ \prime})\,\mathrm{d}\mu(\mathbf{x})\,\mathrm{d}\mu(\mathbf{x}^{\prime})\, \mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\] (12) \[+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(h|\mu\otimes\nu)+\tau_{1}\mathrm{KL}(h_{1 }|\mu)+\tau_{2}\mathrm{KL}(h_{2}|\nu)\]

where we extend the KL divergence for densities: \(\mathrm{KL}(r|\gamma)=\int(r\log(r)+r-1)\,\mathrm{d}\gamma\), and define the marginal densities \(h_{1}:\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}\mapsto\int_{\mathcal{Y}}h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{ y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})\) and \(h_{2}:\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{Y}\mapsto\int_{\mathcal{X}}h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{ y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})\). As a result, it exists \(h^{\star}\in L_{1}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\) s.t. \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=h^{\star}\cdot\mu\otimes\nu\). It follows that \(\tilde{\mu}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=\xi\cdot\nu\) with \(\eta=h^{\star}_{1}\) and \(\xi=h^{\star}_{2}\).

_Remark B.3_.: Note that in both cases, since \(\mathrm{d}\tilde{\mu}(\mathbf{x})=\eta(\mathbf{x})\,\mathrm{d}\mu(\mathbf{x})\) and \(\mathrm{d}\tilde{\nu}(\mathbf{y})=\xi(\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})\), the equality of mass of \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) yields \(\mathrm{E}_{X\sim\mu}[\eta(X)]=\mathrm{E}_{Y\sim\nu}[\xi(Y)]\,.\)

**Step 2: Optimality in the balanced problem for the linear case.** We now prove **point 1**, stating that if \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) solves problem ULEOT between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), then it solves problem (LEOT) between \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) for the same entropic regularization strength \(\varepsilon\). It also follows from duality. We remind that that thanks to [80, Prop. 2]

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}}{\mathrm{d}(\mu\otimes\nu)}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+g^{\star}( \mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\] (13)

with \(f^{\star}\in\mathcal{C}(\mathcal{X})\) and \(g^{\star}\in C(\mathcal{Y})\). Moreover, by [59, Theorem 4.2], such a decomposition is equivalent to the optimality in problem (LEOT). Therefore, \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) is solves problem LEOT between its marginals \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\), i.e.

\[\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\pi\in\Pi(\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})}\int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\, \mathrm{d}\pi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes \nu)\,.\] (14)

**Step 3: Optimality in the balanced problem for the quadratic case.** We now prove **point 2**, stating that, provided that the costs \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\) are conditionally positive (or conditionally negative), if \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) solves problem (UQEOT) between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), then it actually solves problem (QEOT) between \(\tilde{\mu}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}\) for the entropic regularization strength \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})\,\varepsilon\). We first define the functional:

\[F:(\gamma,\pi)\in\mathcal{M}^{+}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})^{2} \mapsto\int_{(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})^{2}}|c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})|^{2}\, \mathrm{d}\pi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\gamma(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{y}^{\prime})\] (15) \[+\varepsilon\mathrm{KL}(\pi\otimes\gamma|(\mu\otimes\nu)^{2})+ \lambda_{1}\mathrm{KL}(\pi_{1}\otimes\gamma_{1}|\mu\times\mu)+\lambda_{2} \mathrm{KL}^{\otimes}(\pi_{2}\otimes\gamma_{2}|\nu\times\nu),\]

s.t. \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\pi\in\mathcal{M}( \mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})}F(\pi,\pi)\). Then, if we define the linearized cost

\[c^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}:(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in\mathcal{X}\times \mathcal{Y}\mapsto\int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}|c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{ x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})|^{2}\, \mathrm{d}\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{ \prime})\,,\] (16)

we get from [80, Proposition 9], that \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) solves:

\[\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\pi\in \mathcal{M}(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})} \int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}c^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\pi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+\varepsilon m(\pi^{\star}_{ \varepsilon,\tau})\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\] (17) \[+\lambda_{1}m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})\mathrm{KL}(\pi_{1}| \mu)+\lambda_{2}m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})\mathrm{KL}(\pi_{2}|\nu)\,.\]

Therefore, \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) solves problem ULEOT between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) for a new cost \(c^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\), and the regularization strength \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=\varepsilon m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})\). We seek to apply point 1, to get that \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) solves problem LEOT between \(\tilde{\mu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=p_{2}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) for the same entropic regularization strength \(\varepsilon^{\prime}\). To that end, we first verify that \(c^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) is continuous. Since \(c_{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(c_{\mathcal{Y}}\) are continuous on \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\) and \(\mathcal{Y}\times\mathcal{Y}\), the function:

\[(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y},\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\in(\mathcal{X} \times\mathcal{Y})^{2}\mapsto|c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_ {\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})|^{2}\]

is continuous. Therefore, it is bounded since \((\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})^{2}\) is compact as a product of compact sets. Then, since \(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\) has finite mass, Lebesgue's dominated convergence yields the continuity of \(c^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\). We then to apply point 1 and get:

\[\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\pi\in\Pi(\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})}\int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}c^{\star}_{\varepsilon, \tau}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\pi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})+\varepsilon^{ \prime}\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\] (18)Since the costs are conditionally positive (or conditionally negative) kernels, (18) finally yields the desired result by applying [81, Theorem 3]:

\[\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\pi\in\Pi(\tilde{\mu}, \tilde{\nu})}\int_{\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}}|c_{\mathcal{X}}(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{x}^{\prime})-c_{\mathcal{Y}}(\mathbf{y},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})|\,\mathrm{ d}\pi(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\,\mathrm{d}\pi(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})+\varepsilon^{\prime}\mathrm{KL}(\pi|\mu\otimes\nu)\] (19)

_Remark B.4_.: In various experimental settings, \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) have mass 1, and we impose one of the two hard marginal constraints, for instance, on \(\mu\), by setting \(\tau_{1}=1\). Then \(\tilde{\nu}\) has also mass 1 and \(m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})=1\), so \(\varepsilon^{\prime}=m(\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau})=\varepsilon\) and we keep the same regularization strength \(\varepsilon\) by re-balancing (UQEDT).

**Proposition B.5** (Pointwise estimation of re-weighting functions.).: _Let \(\pi^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\sum_{i,j}\mathbf{P}^{i,j}_{\varepsilon,\tau} \delta_{(X_{i},Y_{j})}\), solution to (ULEOT) between empirical counterparts of \(\mu\) and \(\nu\). Let \(\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{P}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\) and \(\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{P}^{\top}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\) its marginals weights. Then, almost surely, \(n\,a_{i}\to\eta(X_{i})\) and \(n\,b_{i}\to\xi(Y_{i})\)._

Proof.: As we saw in the proof of Prop.3.1, using Sejourne et al. [80, Prop. 2], one has the existence of \(f^{\star}\in C(\mathcal{X})\) and \(g^{\star}\in C(\mathcal{Y})\) s.t.

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}}{\mathrm{d}(\mu\otimes\nu)}( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+g^{\star}( \mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right):=h(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\]

and the relative densities \(\eta\) and \(\xi\) s.t. \(\tilde{\mu}=p_{1}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\eta\cdot\mu\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=p_{2}\sharp\pi^{\star}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\xi\cdot\nu\) are given by

\[\eta:\mathbf{x}\mapsto\int_{\mathcal{Y}}h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d} \nu(\mathbf{y})\quad\text{and}\quad\xi:\mathbf{y}\mapsto\int_{\mathcal{X}}h( \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\mu(\mathbf{x})\] (20)

Now, let consider \(\tilde{\pi}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\sum_{i,j}\mathbf{P}^{i,j}_{\varepsilon,\tau} \delta_{(X_{i},Y_{j})}\) the solution of problem LEOT between \(\hat{\mu}_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{X_{i}}\) and \(\hat{\nu}_{n}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{Y_{i}}\). Similarly, using Sejourne et al. [80, Prop. 2], one has the existence of \(f^{\star}_{n}\in C(\mathcal{X})\) and \(g^{\star}_{n}\in C(\mathcal{Y})\) s.t.

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\hat{\pi}_{\varepsilon,\tau}}{\mathrm{d}(\hat{\mu}_{n} \otimes\hat{\nu}_{n})}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}_{n}( \mathbf{x})+g^{\star}_{n}(\mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon} \right):=h_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\] (21)

and the relative densities \(\eta_{n}\) and \(\xi_{n}\) s.t. \(\tilde{\mu}_{n}=p_{1}\sharp\hat{\pi}^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\eta_{n}\cdot \hat{\mu}_{n}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}_{n}=p_{2}\sharp\hat{\pi}^{n}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\xi_{n}\cdot\hat{ \nu}_{n}\) are given by

\[\eta_{n}:\mathbf{x}\mapsto\tfrac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}h_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{ y}_{j})\quad\text{and}\quad\xi_{n}:\mathbf{y}\mapsto\tfrac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}h_{n}( \mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{y})\] (22)

From Eq. (21), we get that \(\mathbf{P}^{ij}_{\varepsilon,\tau}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}h(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{ y}_{j})\), so reminding that \(\mathbf{a}=\mathbf{P}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\) and \(\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{P}^{\top}_{\varepsilon,\tau}\mathbf{1}_{n}\), one has \(n\,a_{i}=\eta_{n}(X_{i})\) and \(n\,b_{i}=\xi_{n}(Y_{i})\). We now show that almost surely, \(\eta_{n}\to\eta\) and \(\xi_{n}\to\xi\) pointwise, which implies the desired result that, almost surely, \(n\,a_{i}\to\eta(X_{i})\) and \(n\,b_{i}\to\xi(Y_{i})\).

Almost surely, \(\hat{\mu}_{n}\rightharpoonup\mu\) and \(\hat{\nu}_{n}\rightharpoonup\nu\), so using [74, Proposition 10], \(f^{\star}_{n}\to f^{\star}\) and \(g^{\star}_{n}\to g^{\star}\) in sup-norm. Since \(f^{\star}_{n}\to f^{\star}\) on \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(g^{\star}_{n}\to g^{\star}\) on \(\mathcal{Y}\) in sup-norm, we can show that \(h_{n}\to h\) in sup-norm on \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\). Indeed, for \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y})\), one has:

\[\begin{split}&|h_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})-h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})| \\ =&\left|\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}_{n}(\mathbf{x})+g^{ \star}_{n}(\mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp \left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+g^{\star}(\mathbf{y})-c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y} )}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ =&\exp\left(\frac{c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{ \varepsilon}\right)\left|\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}_{n}(\mathbf{x})+g^{\star}_{n }(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+g^{ \star}(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ \leq& M_{c,\varepsilon}\left|\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}_{n}( \mathbf{x})+g^{\star}_{n}(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left(\frac{f^{ \star}(\mathbf{x})+g^{\star}(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\end{split}\] (23)with \(M_{c,\varepsilon}=\sup_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\in\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}} \exp\left(\frac{c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)<+\infty\), since\((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\mapsto\exp\left(\frac{c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\) is continuous on the compact \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\), as \(c\) is continuous. Afterwards,

\[\begin{split}&\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+g_{n}^{ \star}(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})+ g^{\star}(\mathbf{y})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ \leq&\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x}) }{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon} \right)-\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp \left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ +&\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{ \varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right) -\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g^ {\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\end{split}\] (24)

For the first term, one has:

\[\begin{split}&\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{ \varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon} \right)-\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp \left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ &=\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right) \left|\exp\left(\frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp \left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\\ &\leq\exp\left(\frac{\|f_{n}^{\star}\|_{\infty}}{\varepsilon} \right)\left|\exp\left(\frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)- \exp\left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\end{split}\] (25)

First, we can bound uniformly \(\exp\left(\|f_{n}^{\star}\|_{\infty}/\varepsilon\right)\) since \(f_{n}\) converges in sup-norm, so \((\|f_{n}^{\star}\|_{\infty})_{n\geq 0}\) is bounded. Then, since \(g_{n}^{\star}\) convergences in sup-norm, it is uniformly bounded, and since \(g^{\star}\) is continuous on the compact \(\mathcal{X}\), it is bounded. Therefore, we can find a compact \(K\subset\mathbb{R}\) s.t. \(g^{\star}(\mathcal{X})\subset K\) and for each \(n\), \(g_{n}^{\star}(\mathcal{X})\subset K\). Then, applying the mean value theorem to the \(C_{1}\) function \(\mathbf{x}\mapsto\exp(\mathbf{x}/\varepsilon)\) on \(K\), we can bound:

\[\left|\exp\left(\frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left( \frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\right|\leq\sup_{\mathbf{z} \in K}\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\exp(\tfrac{1}{\varepsilon}\mathbf{z})\left|g_{n}^ {\star}(\mathbf{x})-g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})\right|\] (26)

This yields the existence of a constant \(M_{1}>0\) s.t.

\[\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left( \frac{g_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{ \star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{ \varepsilon}\right)\right|\leq M_{1}\|g_{n}^{\star}-g^{\star}\|_{\infty}\] (27)

Using the same strategy, we get the existence of a constant \(M_{2}>0\) s.t.

\[\left|\exp\left(\frac{f_{n}^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left( \frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)-\exp\left(\frac{f^{\star}( \mathbf{x})}{\varepsilon}\right)\exp\left(\frac{g^{\star}(\mathbf{x})}{ \varepsilon}\right)\right|\leq M_{2}\|f_{n}^{\star}-f^{\star}\|_{\infty}\] (28)

Combining (27) and (28) with (23), we get that:

\[|h_{n}(\mathbf{x})-h(\mathbf{x})|\leq M_{c,\varepsilon}\left(M_{1}\|g_{n}^{ \star}-g^{\star}\|_{\infty}+M_{2}\|f_{n}^{\star}-f^{\star}\|_{\infty}\right)\] (29)

from which we deduce that \(h_{n}\to h\) in sup-norm, from the convergence of \(f_{n}\to f\) and \(g_{n}\to g\) in sup-norm.

Now, we can show the pointwise convergence of \(\hat{\eta}_{n}\). For any \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{X}\), one has:

\[\begin{split}&|\hat{\eta}_{n}(\mathbf{x})-\eta(\mathbf{x})|\\ =&|\int h_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\hat{ \nu}_{n}(\mathbf{y})-\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})| \\ \leq&|\int h_{n}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d} \hat{\nu}_{n}(\mathbf{y})-\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{ n}(\mathbf{y})|+|\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{n}(\mathbf{y})- \int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})|\\ \leq&\int\|h_{n}-h\|_{\infty}\,\mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{ n}(\mathbf{y})+|\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{n}(\mathbf{y})- \int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d}\nu(\mathbf{y})|\\ =&\|h_{n}-h\|_{\infty}+|\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\, \mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{n}(\mathbf{y})-\int h(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\,\mathrm{d} \nu(\mathbf{y})|\end{split}\] (30)

Therefore, it almost surely holds that \(\hat{\eta}_{n}(\mathbf{x})\to\eta(\mathbf{x})\). Indeed, \(\|h_{n}-h\|_{\infty}\to 0\) since we have shown that \(h_{n}\to h\) in sup-norm. Then, \(h\) is continuous on the compact \(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\), so it is bounded, so since \(\mu_{n}\rightharpoonup\mu\), we get \(\int h\,\mathrm{d}\hat{\nu}_{n}\to\int h\,\mathrm{d}\nu\). Next, we show similarly that, almost surely, \(\xi_{n}\to\xi\) pointwise.

Metrics

We start with introducing general metrics in SS C.1, some of which will be used in the metrics introduced in the context of experiments on single-cell data in SS C.2.

### General metrics

In the following, we discuss a way how to classify predictions in a generative model. We start with the setting where each mapped sample is to be assigned to a category based on labelled data in the target distribution. We then continue with the case where there are also labels for samples in the source distribution, and this way define a classifier \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) mapping from the source distribution to labels in the target distribution with the possibility to compute accuracy. Building upon this, we assign the classifier \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) an uncertainty score for each prediction. Finally, we define a calibration score assessing the quality of a given uncertainty score.

Turning a generative model into a classifierIn the following, consider a finite set of samples in the target domain \(\mathbf{y}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{y}_{M}\in\mathcal{Y}\). Assume \(\{\mathbf{y}_{m}\}_{m=1}^{M}\) allows for a partition \(\{\mathbf{y}_{m}\}_{m=1}^{M}=\sqcup_{k\in K}\mathcal{T}_{k}\). Hence, each sample belongs to exactly one class, which we interchangeably refer to as the sample being labelled. Let \(T:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\) be a map (deterministic or stochastic), and let \(f_{\text{1-NN}}:\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) be the 1-nearest neighbor classifier. We obtain a map \(g\) from \(\mathcal{X}\) to \(\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) by the concatenation of \(f_{\text{1-NN}}\) and \(T\). This map \(g\) proves useful in settings when mapped cells are to be categorized, e.g. to assign mapped cells to a cell type.

A metric to assess the accuracy of a generative modelIn the following, assume that the set of samples in the source domain \(\mathbf{x}_{1},\ldots\mathbf{x}_{N}\) allows for a partition \(\{\mathbf{x}_{n}\}_{n=1}^{N}=\sqcup_{k\in K}\mathcal{S}_{k}\). We want to construct a classifier \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) assigning each category in the source distribution \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) probabilistically to a category in the target distribution \(\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). Define \(f_{\mathrm{class}}:\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\rightarrow\mathbb{N}^{K}\) via \((f_{\mathrm{class}}(\mathcal{S}_{k}))_{j}=\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{n}\in\mathcal{S}_{ k}}1_{\{g(\mathbf{x}_{n})=\mathcal{T}_{j}\}}\) where \(g:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) was defined above.

Assume that there exists a known one-to-one (injective would be sufficient) match between elements in \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) and elements in \(\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). Then we can define a confusion matrix \(\mathcal{A}\) with entries \(\mathcal{A}_{ij}:=\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{n}\in\mathcal{T}_{i}}1_{\{g(\mathbf{x}_{n })=\mathcal{S}_{j}\}}\). In the context of entropic OT the confusion matrix is element-wise defined as

\[\mathcal{A}_{ij}:=\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{n}\in\mathcal{T}_{i}}1_{\{f_{\mathrm{i-NN }}(T(\mathbf{x}_{n}))=\mathcal{S}_{j}\}}\] (31)

This way we obtain an accuracy score of the classifier \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) mapping a partition of one set of samples to a partition of another set of samples.

Calibration scoreTo assess the meaningfulness of an uncertainty score, we introduce the following calibration score. Assume we have a classifier which yields predictions along with uncertainty estimations. Let \(\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{R}^{K}\) be a vector containing an uncertainty estimation for each element in \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). Moreover, let \(\mathbf{a}\in\mathbb{R}^{K}\) be a vector containing the accuracy for each element in \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). We then define our calibration score to be the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between \(u\) and \(\mathbf{1}_{K}-a\), where \(\mathbf{1}_{K}\) denotes the \(K-\)dimensional vector containing \(1\) in every entry. In effect, the calibration score is close to \(1\) if the model assigns high uncertainty to wrong predictions and low uncertainty to true predictions, while the calibration score is close to \(-1\) if the model assigns high uncertainty to correct predictions and low uncertainty to wrong predictions.

In the following, we consider a stochastic map \(T\). Let \(\mathbf{y}_{1},...,\mathbf{y}_{L}\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) obtained from \(T\). To obtain a calibration score for \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) we estimate a statistic \(V(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}))\) from the samples \(\mathbf{y}_{1},...,\mathbf{y}_{L}\), reflecting an estimation of uncertainty. Then, we let the uncertainty of the prediction of \(f_{\mathrm{class}}\) for category \(\mathcal{S}_{i}\) be the mean uncertainty statistic, i.e. \(\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{S}_{i}}\frac{V(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}))}{| \mathcal{S}_{i}|}\). In effect, for each prediction \(f_{\mathrm{class}}(\mathcal{S}_{i})\) we get the uncertainty score

\[u_{i}=\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{S}_{i}}\frac{V(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x} ))}{|\mathcal{S}_{i}|}.\] (32)Assessing the uncertainty with the _cos-var_ metricGayoso et al. [2019] introduce a statistic to assess the uncertainty of deep generative RNA velocity methods from samples of the posterior distribution, which we adapt to the OT paradigm to obtain

\[\text{cos-var}(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}))=\mathrm{Var}_{Y\sim\pi_{\theta}( \cdot|\mathbf{x})}[\mathrm{cos-sim}(Y,\mathbb{E}_{Y\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot| \mathbf{x})}[Y])],\] (33)

where \(\mathrm{cos-sim}\) denotes the cosine similarity. We refer to this metric as \(\mathrm{cos-var}\), as it computes the variance of the cosine similarity of samples following the conditional distribution and the conditional mean. We use 30 samples from the conditional distribution to compute this metric.

### Single-cell specific metrics

TSI score for developmental systemsIn the following, we describe TSI metric used in Fig. 2. The terminal state identification score (TSI) was introduced in Weiler et al. [2017] and assesses to what extent the learnt vector field of a developmental system points towards the correct directions. In effect, we assume that terminal states of the biological developmental process are known. CellRank [199] identifies macrostates using a Schur decomposition based on the transition matrix computed from the learnt vector field (using CellRank's _VelocityKernel_). From these macrostates, CellRank infers a set of putative terminal states, loosely speaking by looking for sinks in the transition matrix. To define the TSI score, we consider a system containing \(m\) terminal states and the function \(f\) that assigns each number of macrostates \(n\) the corresponding number of identified terminal states. In the case of a strategy that identifies terminal states optimally, \(f_{\text{opt}}\) describes the step function

\[f_{\text{opt}}(n)=\begin{cases}n,&n<m\\ m,&n\geq m.\end{cases}\]

The TSI score of the learnt vector field \(\theta\) is the area under the curve \(f_{\theta}\) relative to the area under the curve \(f_{\text{opt}}\), _i.e._,

\[TSI(\theta)=\frac{\sum_{n=1}^{N_{\text{max}}}f_{\theta}(n)}{\sum_{n=1}^{N_{ \text{max}}}f_{\text{opt}}}=\frac{2}{m(1+N_{\text{max}}-m)}\sum_{n=1}^{N_{ \text{max}}}f_{\theta}(n).\]

Thus, the TSI score lies between \(0\) and \(1\), with \(1\) being optimal. We compute the LSI score with https://cellrank.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/_autosummary/estimators/cellrank.estimators.GPCCA.html#cellrank.estimators.GPCCA.tsi

In the specific dataset considered here, the terminal cell states are Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Epsilon cells [2]. Hence, the TSI score measures to what extent the underlying vector field captures the dynamics such that cells develop into either of these cell states, while these cell states being a sink. In the CellRank API, we set n_macrostates to 15, i.e., the algorithm looks for 15 macrostates.

Cell type scores/errorsAs in most single-cell tasks there is no ground truth of matches between cells, we rely on labels of clusters of the data, i.e. on cell types. We then assess the accuracy of a generative model by considering the accuracy of the corresponding classifier \(f_{\text{class}}\) as described above. The correct matches between classes have to be considered task-specifically.

In the developmental pancreas example considered in Figures 2 and 9, we have \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}=\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}=\{\text{Alpha, Beta, Delta, Epsilon, Fev+ Alpha, Fev+ Beta, Fev+ Delta, Fev+ Pysr, Ngn3 High late, Ngn3 High early, Ngn3 low EP}. Here, we do not look for a one-to-one match, as from a developmental biology perspective, it is reasonable (and even expected) that e.g. a Fev+ Alpha cell evolves into an Alpha cell. To measure to what extent the dynamics follow the manifold, we measure how many cells in one of the terminal cell states Alpha, Beta, Delta, Epsilon are derived directly from Ngn3 low EP cells. These transitions are biologically unlikely, as cells are known to evolve via the Ngn3 high cluster and either of Fev+ Alpha, Fev+ Beta, Fev+ Delta or Fev+ Epsilon. Hence, the direct transition from Ngn3 low EP cells to one of the terminal cell states is very unlikely. Thus, we denote this fraction as the cell transition error (_CT error_).

In the following, we discuss the choice of the labels \(\{\mathcal{S}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) and \(\{\mathcal{T}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) for perturbation prediction in Fig.3, Fig.12. Each drug was applied to cells belonging to three different cell types/cell lines, namely A549, K562, and MCF7. Hence, we can define \(\{A549,K562,MCF7\}\) as for each perturbed cell we know the cell type at the time of injecting the drug.

FOSCTTM scoreIn the following, we consider a setting where the true match between _samples_ is known. The FOSCTTM score ("Fraction of Samples Closer than True Match") measures the fraction of cells which are closer to the true match than the predicted cell. Hence, a random match has a FOSCTTM score of \(0.5\), while a perfect match has a FOSCTTM score of \(0.0\). In the following we only consider discrete distributions. To define the FOSCTTM score for a map \(T:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\), let \(\mathbf{x}_{1},\ldots\mathbf{x}_{K}\in\mathcal{X}\) be samples from the source distribution and \(\mathbf{y}_{1},\ldots\mathbf{y}_{K}\in\mathcal{Y}\) be samples from the target distribution, such that \(\mathbf{x}_{k}\) and \(\mathbf{y}_{k}\) form a true match. Moreover, let \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{k}=T(\mathbf{x}_{k})\). Let

\[p_{j}=\frac{\sum_{k\in K}\mathbf{1}_{\|\mathbf{y}_{k}-\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{j}\|_ {2}^{2}}\leq\|\mathbf{y}_{j}-\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{j}\|_{2}^{2}}{|K|}\] (34)

and

\[q_{j}=\frac{\sum_{k\in K}\mathbf{1}_{\|\mathbf{y}_{j}-\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{k}\|_ {2}^{2}}\leq\|\mathbf{y}_{j}-\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{k}\|_{2}^{2}}{|K|}\] (35)

Then, the FOSCTTM score between the predicted target \(\{\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{k}\}_{k\in K}\) and the target \(\{\mathbf{y}_{k}\}_{k\in K}\) is obtained as

\[\text{FOSCTMM}(\{\hat{\mathbf{y}}_{k}\}_{k\in K},\{\mathbf{y}_{k}\}_{k\in K}) =\sum_{k\in K}\frac{p_{j}+q_{j}}{2}.\] (36)

## Appendix D Datasets

### Gushchin et al. [30]'s benchmark datasets

We follow the notebook in https://github.com/ngushchin/EntropicOTBenchmark/blob/main/notebooks/mixtures_benchmark_visualization_eot.ipynb, which allows to download the data when instantiating the samplers by setting download=True in the function get_guassian_mixture_benchmark_sampler().

### Pancreas single-cell dataset

The dataset of the developing mouse pancreas was published in Bastidas-Ponce et al. [2] and can be downloaded following the guidelines on https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE132188. The full dataset contains measurements of embryonic days 12.5, 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5, while we only consider time points 14.5 and 15.5.

We filter the dataset such that we only keep cells belonging to the cell types of the endocrine branch to ensure that learnt transitions are biologically plausible. Moreover, cells annotated as _Ngn3 high cycling_ were removed due to its unknown stage in the developmental process [2]. The removal is justified by the small number of cells belonging to this cell type and its outlying position in gene expression space. Experiments were performed on 30-dimensional PCA space of log-transformed gene expression counts.

### Drug perturbation single-cell dataset

The dataset was published in [78]. We download the dataset following the instructions detailed on https://github.com/bunnech/cellot/tree/main.

For all analyses we computed PCA embeddings (50 dimensions) on the filtered dataset including the control cells and the corresponding drug only. This ensures the capturing of relevant distributional shifts and hence prevents the model from near-constant predictions as the effect of numerous drugs is weak.

The drugs in figure 3 were chosen as in Hetzel et al. [33].

### Human bone marrow single-cell dataset for modality translation

This dataset contains paired measurements of single-cell RNA-seq readouts and single-nucleus ATAC-seq measurements [51]. This means that we have a ground truth one-to-one matching for each cell. We use the processed data provided in moscot [39], which can be downloaded following the instructions on https://moscot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/genapi/moscot.datasets.bone_marrow.html#moscot.datasets.bone_marrow. This version of the dataset additionally contains a shared embedding for both the RNA and the ATAC data, which we use in the fused term. This embedding was created using a variational autoencoder (scVI [49]) by integrating the RNA counts of the gene expression dataset and gene activity [79] derived from the ATAC data, a commonly used approximation for gene expression estimation from ATAC data [34].

In RNA space we use the PCA embedding (the dimension of which is detailed in the corresponding experiments), while the embedding used in ATAC space is the given LSI (latent semantic indexing) embedding, followed by a feature-wise L2-normalization as proposed in Demetci et al. [17]. The legend for the cell type labels is given in Fig. 25.

## Appendix E Additional information and results for experiments

If not stated otherwise, the GENOT model configuration follows the setup described in appendix G.

### (U)-Genot-L

Entropic OT benchmark by Gushchin et al. [30]We assess the performance of GENOT-L following the benchmark in Gushchin et al. [30]. While the results reported in Gushchin et al. [30] are the best ones across different configurations of hyperparameters for certain models, we choose _a single hyperparameter configuration_ across all dimensions and entropy regularisation parameters. In particular, GENOT is trained for 100,000 iterations and the learning rate is set to \(10^{-5}\). The dimension of the layers in the vector field is set to 1024, and the entropy regularization parameter is set according to the task (i.e. \(0.1\), \(1.0\) or \(10.0\).). The batch size is set to 2048, and its influence is further studied in figure 6. The number of layers per block is set to 3, and the embedding dimension of the time, condition, and noise is set to 1,024. All remaining parameters are chosen as described in appendix G.

Following Gushchin et al. [30], Tab. 2 reports the Bures-Wasserstein Unexplained Variance Percentage (\(\mathds{W}^{2}_{2}\text{-}\mathrm{UVP}\)) between the marginal distributions \(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta}\) and \(\nu\) defined as

\[\mathds{W}^{2}_{2}\text{-}\mathrm{UVP}\left(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta},\nu \right)=\frac{100\%}{\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Var}\left(\nu\right)}\,\mathds{ W}^{2}_{2}\left(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta},\nu\right)\] (37)

Figure 5: Fitting the EOT coupling between two Gaussian mixtures for the Coulomb cost [4]\(c(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=1/\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\|_{2}\), and \(\varepsilon=0.01\), using GENOT and OT-CFM [85]. For both methods, we hence use mini-batch couplings computed with this cost. We connect paired samples with a line. The EOT coupling pairs source samples and target samples diagonally (left). GENOT (middle) generates samples correctly, while OT-CFM (right) fails to preserve the signal from mini-batch couplings. The data-setting is inspired by Bortoli et al. [5, Fig. 1]

where \(\mathrm{B}\mathbb{W}_{2}^{2}\left(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta},\pi_{\varepsilon}^{2}\right)\) is the Bures-Wasserstein metric between the Gaussian approximations of the distributions \(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta}\) and \(\nu\):

\[\mathrm{B}\mathbb{W}_{2}^{2}\left(p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta},\nu\right)=W_{2}^{2} \left(\mathcal{N}\left(\mathrm{m}_{\nu},\Sigma_{\nu}\right),\mathcal{N}\left( \mathrm{m}_{p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta}},\Sigma_{p_{2}\sharp\pi_{\theta}}\right) \right).\] (38)

Here, \(W_{2}^{2}\) denotes the Wasserstein-2 distance, and for any measure \(\gamma\), \(\mathrm{m}_{\gamma}\) denotes its mean and \(\Sigma_{\gamma}\) its covariance.Tab. 3 displays the conditional Bures-Wasserstein Unexplained Variance Percentage (cBW-UVP), which is the integration of the Bures-Wasserstein distances of the estimated and the true conditional distributions:

\[\mathrm{c}\mathrm{B}\mathbb{W}_{2}^{2}\mathrm{-UVP}\left(\pi_{\theta},\pi_{ \varepsilon}^{\star}\right)=\frac{100\%}{\frac{1}{2}\operatorname{Var} \left(\nu\right)}\int_{\mathcal{X}}\mathrm{B}\mathbb{W}_{2}^{2}\left(\pi_{ \theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x}),\pi_{\varepsilon}^{\star}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\right) \mathrm{d}\mu(\mathbf{x}).\] (39)

To make the results of the benchmark more interpretable, we rank the methods for each experimental setup. If multiple methods yield the same result, we assign the methods the mean of the ranks. Tab. 1 reports the average rank across the twelve different experimental setups.

Ablation study of GENOTA natural way to extend the GENOT algorithm is to sample \(k>1\) instances from the conditional distribution. Alg. 2 describes this procedure in lines 8 to 11, resulting only in an additional sum in the loss in line 12. As for each condition \(X_{i}\) we then have multiple samples \(\{Z_{i_{l}}\}_{l=1}^{k}\) and \(\{Y_{i_{l}}\}_{l=1}^{k}\)(in the unbalanced case \(k\) depends on \(i\)), we can then couple the noise samples with the samples from the conditional distribution using a discrete Sinkhorn solver (note that the noise and the conditional distribution always live in the same space). This corresponds to using the approach introduced in Pooladian et al. [64], Tong et al. [85] for each single conditional generator \(T_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\). We study this natural extension of the GENOT model in Fig 7. While in a few cases this extensions helps, in the majority of experiments using \(k>1\) decreases the performance.

GENOT-L for trajectory inferenceDiscrete optimal transport is an established method for trajectory inference in single-cell genomics [72]. Due to the ever increasing size of these datasets[31], neural OT solvers are of particular interest and deterministic Monge map estimators have been successfully applied to millions of cells [32].

Obtaining samples from the conditional distribution allows for an assessment of the uncertainty of the trajectory of a cell. We use the metric \(\mathrm{Var}_{Y\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathcal{R})}[\mathrm{cos}\mathrm{-} \mathrm{sim}(Y,\mathbb{E}_{Y\sim\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathcal{R})}[Y])]\) suggested in Gayoso et al. [25] for generative RNA velocity models (appendix C.1). Therefore, we use 30 samples from the conditional distribution.

Fig. 8 visualizes the pancreatic endocrinogenesis dataset (D.2) according to source (embryonic day 14.5) and target distribution (15.5) as well as according to cell type. To quantitatively confirm the visual results from Fig. 2, we aggregate the uncertainty to cell type level. Indeed, we observe a higher uncertainty in cells which have not committed to a certain lineage (Ngn3 low, Ngn3 High early, Ngn3 High late), while more mature cell types indicate lower variances.

A cell is expected to have an uncertain trajectory when it can still develop into different cell lineages. In contrast, cells are expected to have a less uncertain trajectory when their descending population is homogeneous or they belong to a terminal cell state, and hence have committed to a certain lineage.

GENOT-L produces meaningful uncertainty assessments as can be seen from Fig. 2 and Fig. 8. Indeed, the Ngn3 low EP population and the Ngn3 high EP populations have a higher uncertainty than later cell types. The uncertainty is particularly high for Ngn3 high EP late cells, a state where cells commit to a fate towards alpha, beta, delta, or epsilon cells [2].

We now focus on the conditional distributions of cells from the Ngn3 low population, i.e. the least mature cell population in the dataset. Fig. 9 shows more examples of selecting one Ngn3 low cell and generating 30 samples from its conditional distribution as displayed in Fig 2. It is important to

Figure 7: Evaluation of the influence of the number of data points sampled from the conditional distribution in each step, and optimally coupling noise and samples from the target distribution, see Alg. 2. \(k=1\) corresponds to the model performances reported in table 3.

note that the UMAP has to be recomputed to include the generated samples and hence the UMAPs change slightly. The three instances in Fig.9 support the hypothesis that the conditional distribution follows the data manifold when using the geodesic cost (here we assume that the UMAP represents the manifold well). In contrast, choosing the squared Euclidean distance results in samples of the conditional distribution being either very close on the UMAP or very far away, while the intermediate stage (i.e. Ngn3 High late) is skipped. Biologically, this result is not plausible as all cells are known to evolve from Ngn3 Low EP cells to Ngn3 High EP cells, before they finally commit to a lineage (towards alpha, beta, delta, or epsilon cells). It is important to note that both GENOT-L models are trained with the same entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon=0.01\).

Based on the examples, we hence hypothesize that when using the squared Euclidean cost, generated cells in the terminal cell states (alpha, beta, delta, epsilon) are much more likely to be derived from Ngn3 low EP cells than Ngn3 High EP cells (in the following we focus on Ngn3 High Late cells and neglect Ngn3 High EP early cells as their number is very low, see Fig.8). As outlined above, this is biologically not plausible. The impression conveyed by the UMAP plots are confirmed numerically on the right hand side of Fig. 9. For each generated cell, we compute its nearest neighbor in the target distribution, and this way assign it a label (cell type), see App. C.2. We then obtain a cell type to cell type transition matrix, which we column-normalise (with columns containing the cell types of the generated cells), such that for each cell type, we obtain the distribution of ancestor cell types. Figure 9 shows that for the Euclidean cost, around \(30\%\) of all delta cells are derived from Ngn3 Low EP cells, while only \(5\%\) are derived from Ngn3 High EP cells. In contrast, the proportion of progenitors in Ngn3 low EP cells and Ngn3 high EP cells when using the geodesic cost is much more comparable. Similar results can be observed for alpha, beta, and epsilon cells.

1d simulated dataFigure 10 visualizes the influence of \(\tau\) on a simple setting between mixtures of Gaussians. While \(\tau=1.0\) corresponds to the fully balanced case, setting \(\tau=0.97\) results in a complete discordant of one mode in the target distribution. The ground truth is computed with a discrete entropy-regularized OT solver [14], with kernel density estimation to create the plot. This figure is meant to visualize the task, while in the following, we assess the results quantitatively.

Benchmark of U-GENOT-L between Gaussian distributionsTherefore, we leverage the closed-form solutions of the unbalanced EOT coupling between Gaussian distributions for the squared Euclidean cost [36]. We follow the data generation process described by Janati et al. [36], and evaluate the results for different entropy-regularisation parameters \(\varepsilon\) and different unbalancedness parameters \(\lambda=\frac{\varepsilon\tau}{1-\tau}\), and across different dimensions.

Figure 9: **Left**: Samples from the Ngn3 Low EP population in the leftmost column, and next to it 30 samples from their conditional distribution samples from GENOT with the geodesic cost (middle) and the squared Euclidean cost (right). **Right**: Proportions of alpha, beta, delta, and epsilon cells derived from the Ngn3 Low population (top) and the Ngn3 High population (bottom). Mean and standard deviation across three different runs are reported.

Yang and Uhler [93] propose a method (scalable unbalanced optimal transport, SUOT) to learn unbalanced EOT plans, but their implementation only supports unbalanced deterministic Monge maps. We visualize the results in Fig.11. Besides the simple switch to learning unbalanced EOT plans, U-GENOT-L was run with the same setup as in the balanced linear EOT benchmark.

Figure 11: Benchmark of U-GENOT-L on the task of learning an unbalanced entropic OT plan between Gaussian distributions across different dimensions, entropy regularisation parameters \(\varepsilon\), and unbalancedness parameters \(\lambda\), following Janati et al. [36]. The dotted line represents the outer coupling, while SUOT denotes the method proposed in Yang and Uhler [93].

Perturbation modeling with GENOT-L and U-GENOT-LFor each drug, we project the single-cell RNA-seq readout of the unperturbed and perturbed cells to a 50-dimensional PCA embedding. Subsequently, we split the data randomly to obtain a train and test set with a ratio of 60%/40%. This preprocessing step holds for both the calibration score experiments and the experiments conducted with U-GENOT-L to assess the influence of unbalancedness to the accuracy score.

The uncertainty score for the calibration study is computed based on 30 samples from the conditional distribution, see appendix C.2.

In Figure 13 and Figure 14, we visualize the influence of unbalancedness for perturbation modeling with Dacinostat and Tanespimycin, respectively. These experiments were conducted on the full dataset for visualization reasons. While the fitting property seems to be little affected by incorporating unbalancedness (top rows), the cell type clusters are better separated for U-GENOT-L transport plans than for GENOT-L transport plans.

In the center column, we plot a UMAP embedding of target and predicted target distribution. The top plot colors cells according to whether a cell belongs to the target distribution or the predicted target distribution. The bottom plot is colored by cell type. The cell type of the predicted target distribution is the cell type of the pre-image of the predicted cell. The right column visualizes the same results, but this time obtained from U-GENOT-L with unbalancedness parameters \(\tau=\tau_{1}=\tau_{2}=0.8\).

### (U)-Genot-Q & (U)-Genot-F

GENOT-Q for mapping a Swiss role to a spiralFig. 15 visualizes the dependence of the conditional distribution on the entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon\) with the same setup as in Figure 3. In particular, we display what happens when we consider the outer coupling. Fig. 16 visualizes the density in the target space, evolving from a 2-dimensional Gaussian distribution at \(t=0\) to conditional distributions at \(t=1\). Analogously to Fig.15, we visualize the influence of the entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon\).

How to handle non-uniqueness of quadratic EOT couplingsIn the following, we show how to empirically overcome the non-uniqueness of solutions to (QEGT). The left hand side of Fig. 17 visualizes the solutions to an entropic GW coupling between two Gaussian distributions learnt by GENOT-Q without any modification. It becomes evident that the learned solution is not close to a valid solution, but rather resembles a mixture of solutions.

Figure 14: Visual assessment of the influence of unbalancedness in modeling cellular predictions to the cancer drug Tanespimycin. In the left column, the source and target distribution are jointly plotted with cells colored by whether they belong to the source (unperturbed) or the target (perturbed) distribution (top), and which cell type they belong to (bottom). In the center column, we plot a UMAP embedding of target and predicted target distribution. The top plot colors cells according to whether a cell belongs to the target distribution or the predicted target distribution. The bottom plot is colored by cell type. The cell type of the predicted target distribution is the cell type of the pre-image of the predicted cell. The right column visualizes the same results, but this time obtained from U-GENOT-L with unbalancedness parameters \(\tau=\tau_{1}=\tau_{2}=0.9\).

Figure 15: Samples from conditional distributions \(\pi_{\theta}(\cdot|\mathbf{x})\) for GENOT-Q models trained with different entropy regularization parameters \(\varepsilon\). The setup is the same as in Figure 3, in effect we transport a three-dimensional Swiss roll to a two-dimensional spiral, which is colored in blue (with high transparency). The right plot shows the result when choosing the outer coupling as opposed to an EOT coupling. The source distribution as well as the data points which are conditioned on are visualized in Figure 3.

We discuss three ways to overcome the limitations of non-uniqueness of quadratic OT couplings:

* Incorporation of a fused term: Whenever the data allows, using a fused term empirically helps to stabilize the solution.
* Changing the cost function: The set of solutions to (QEOT) depends on the cost function. Thus, finding a cost with a small set of solutions overcomes the limitation to a certain extent. Empirically, the geodesic cost helps to do so for single-cell data.
* Initialisation of the discrete solver: We initialize the discrete GW solver at iteration \(i+1\) using the solution to the linear EOT problem between \(p_{2}\hat{\pi}^{i}_{\theta}\) and \(\nu\), with \(\hat{\pi}^{i}_{\theta}\) denoting the learnt coupling at step \(i\).

Visually, the initialisation scheme helps for learning the GW-EOT coupling between Gaussian distributions (17).

We now quantify to what extent we can reduce the diversity of the solutions by considering the variance of the conditional distribution of a single data point. Therefore, we consider two datasets:

1. 30 dimensional Gaussian distributions (20 dimensions in the quadratic term and 10 dimensions in the additional fused term): For both the source (\(\mu\)) and the target (\(\nu\)) distribution we

Figure 16: Evolution of the density from \(t=0\) corresponding to the latent distribution (i.e. multivariate standard Gaussian distribution) to \(t=1\) corresponding to the density of the conditional distribution \(\pi_{\theta}(\mathbf{y}|X_{i})\). The setup is the same as in Figure 3, in effect we transport a three-dimensional Swiss roll to a two- dimensional spiral The left panel displays the densities of _one_ conditional distribution, while the right panel visualizes a mixture of densities over time. The top part of the figure corresponds to GENOT-Q models with entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon=0.005\), while the middle ones corresponds to \(\varepsilon=0.005\). The bottom ones correspond to the outer coupling. The markers on the 3-dimensional plot on the very top correspond to data points in the source distribution.

sample mean vectors from \(\mathcal{U}([-1,1])\) and construct the covariance matrices by sampling each entry of their square roots from \(\mathcal{U}([0,3])\)
2. 30 dimensional single-cell data (as in 4): 20-dimensional PCA of the normalized ATAC data, 20-dimensional PCA projection of the gene expression data, and 10-dimensional PCA of the VAE embedding (shared space).

To assess the stability of the solution of discrete EOT, we fix one sample from the source distribution, and compute the variance of \(\hat{\pi}(\cdot|X_{0}[10:])\), i.e. of the incomparable space only, which is obtained from a discrete EOT solver with different samples in source and target. We do this for \(\varepsilon=0.01\) and \(\varepsilon=0.001\) with the squared Euclidean cost.

We consider the following couplings:

1. outer coupling, supposed to serve as a baseline.
2. Gromov-Wasserstein (GW): We use \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}\), i.e., we use the last 20 dimensions of both the source and the target distribution.
3. Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW): We use \(\Omega\times\tilde{X}\) and \(\Omega\times\tilde{Y}\) with \(\alpha=\frac{1}{11}\).
4. Gromov-Wasserstein with geodesic cost (Geodesic): We use \(\tilde{\mathcal{X}}\) and \(\tilde{\mathcal{Y}}\) with the geodesic cost.
5. Gromov-Wasserstein with initialization as described above.

Fig.18 shows that both the fused term and the initialization scheme empirically help to preserve the variance of the conditional distributions. Moreover, the geodesic cost helps for small \(\varepsilon\) to reduce the conditional variance, suggesting a less diverse set of solutions to (QEOT).

GENOT-Q und U-GENOT-Q for learning EOT plans between GaussiansTo quantitatively assess the performance of GENOT-Q, we evaluate its performance by learning quadratic EOT couplings between Gaussian distributions [43]. We follow the authors' data generation process and computations for the closed-form solution and the computation of the discrete GW solver. Note that we can only evaluate the cost of the learnt transport plan as the solution of the EOT plan is not unique. Thus, we use the initialisation scheme suggested above. The discrete solution calculated based on the discrete coupling (1000 samples), while we report results from GENOT-GW on both training data (30k samples) and test data (5k samples). GENOT-GW is trained with batch size 1024 and for 5k iterations, with the same network architecture as used for the benchmark for balanced, linear EOT for the squared Euclidean cost (SS F.1). As a baseline, we report the cost induced by the outer coupling. To keep the results on a similar scale across different dimensions, we report the L1-distance between the predicted cost and the true cost, divided by the true cost.

We continue with the evaluation in the unbalanced setting in Fig. 20. Here, we compare only the costs induced by the distortion, i.e. not the one induced by the KL penalisation, as for the latter one requires access to the densities. As demonstrated, GENOT can estimate the densities, but it comes at the cost of an estimation error. As the purpose of this benchmark is to show the accuracy of the learnt

couplings (and not the estimation of the density), we compare based on the distortion cost. As done by the authors in Le et al. [43], we set the total mass of both distributions to 1.0.

Modality translation with GENOT-QFor all experiments, we perform a random 60/40 split for training and test data. All results are reported on the test dataset. The cost matrices of all models

Error bars denote standard error across dimensions of the 20-dimensional space.) (bottom)

were scaled by its mean and the entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon\) was set to \(0.0001\). Moreover, the models were trained for 5,000 iterations.

Modality translation with GENOT-FFor all experiments, we perform a random 60-40 split for training and test data. All results are reported on the test dataset. The cost matrices of all models were scaled by its mean and the entropy regularization parameter \(\varepsilon\) was set to \(0.001\). Moreover, the models were trained for 20,000 iterations.

Figure 21 reports results of the GENOT-F model with interpolation parameters \(\alpha=0.3\) (left) and \(\alpha=0.7\) (right). While the Sinkhorn divergences are not comparable with results of the GENOT-Q model due to the respective target distributions living in different spaces, we can compare GENOT-Q with GENOT-F with respect to the FOSCTTM score. Figure 21 shows that GENOT-F strikingly outperforms GENOT-Q, hence the incorporation of the fused term is crucial for a good performance. At the same time, it is important to mention that the GW terms add valuable information to the problem setting, which can be derived from the results for GENOT-F with \(\alpha=0.3\). Here, the higher influence of the fused term causes the model to perform overall worse.

Moreover, we can visualize the optimality and fitting term in a UMAP embedding [53]. To demonstrate the robustness of our model, we train a GENOT-F model with \(\varepsilon=0.01\), \(\alpha=0.5\) and the Euclidean distance on 60% of the dataset (38 dimensions for the ATAC LSI embedding, 50 dimensions for the RNA PCA embedding, and 28 dimensions for the VAE embedding in the fused term) and evaluate the learnt transport plan visually. Figure 22 shows joint UMAP embeddings of predicted target and target distributions, the full legend of cell types can be found in Figure 25. Qualitatively, a good mix between data points of the predicted target and the target distribution suggests a good fitting term. Optimality of the mapping can be visually assessed by considering to what extent cell types are mixed (low optimality) or separated from other cluster (high optimality).

We observed that taking the conditional mean improves results on the FOSCTTM score, but can impair the fitting property. Indeed, the mixing rate between data points belonging to the target and data points belonging to the predicted target seems to be slightly worse when considered in the joint embedding as well as when considering only the fused space and only considering the quadratic space (22).

Modality translation with U-GENOT-FTo simulate a setting where there is not a match for certain cells in the target space (RNA), we remove the cells labelled as Proerythroblasts, Erythroblasts,

Figure 20: Learning unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein entropic optimal transport couplings between Gaussian distributions where the ground truth plan is known for [43]. The quality of the learnt coupling is assessed with the induced cost.

and Normoblasts as these cells form a lineage, developing into mature Reticulocytes (not present in the dataset). Thus, they are similar in their cellular profile while being clearly distinguishable from the remaining cells. Note that this simulates an extreme setting of class imbalances, as these cells make up for more than \(20\%\) of the dataset.

While we keep the right marginals constant, as we have a true match for each cell in the target distribution, we introduce unbalancedness in the source marginals. It is important to note that the influence of the unbalancedness parameters are affected by the number of samples, as well as the entropy regularization parameter \(\epsilon\). To demonstrate the robustness of GENOT-F with respect to hyperparameters, we still choose \(\alpha=0.7\), but this time set \(\varepsilon=5\cdot 10^{-3}\). We use 50-dimensional PCA-space for the Gromov term in the RNA space, 38-dimensional LSI-space for the Gromov term in the ATAC space, and a 30-dimensional VAE-embedding for the shared space.

Figure 21: Mean and 95% confidence interval (across three runs) of the FOSCTTM score (top) and the Sinkhorn divergence (bottom) of GENOT-F and discrete FGW with linear regression for out-of-sample estimation. Experiments are categorized by the numbers \(d_{1}/d_{2}/d_{3}\), where \(d_{1}\) is the dimension of the space corresponding to the GW of the source distribution, \(d_{2}\) is the dimension of the space corresponding to the GW of the target distribution, and \(d_{3}\) is the dimension of the shared space. Results are reported for the interpolation parameter \(\alpha=0.3\) (left half) and \(\alpha=0.7\) (right half).

Figure 22: UMAP embedding of target and predicted target based on subspaces of the target domain. Top left: full target space. Top right: incomparable space only. Bottom left: full target space (with predicted target computed by the mean of the conditional distributions). Bottom right: share space only. Cells are colored based on whether they belong to the target distribution or the predicted target distribution in the left plot of each subplot. Cells are colored based on their cell type in the right plot of each subplot. For cells which belong to the predicted target distribution, the cell type is defined as the cell type of the preimage. Shown are results on the test data set, corresponding to 40% of the full dataset.

The computation of the growth rates for the discrete setting is described in appendix F.2. We perform a random 60-40 split to divide the data into training and test set. The FOSCTTM score only considers those cells which have a true match, i.e. cells in the source distribution belonging to the Normoblast, Erythroblast, and Proerythroblast cell types are not taken into account as their true match was removed from the target distribution.

We assess the performance w.r.t. the FOSCTTM score to ensure that the model still learns meaningful results, and consider the average reweighting function \(\hat{\eta}\) per cell type (appendix E.2). We consider two values (\(\tau_{1}=0.8\) and \(\tau_{1}=0.3\)) of the left unbalancedness parameter, while \(\tau_{2}=1.0\) as for every cell in the target distribution there exists the true match in the source distribution. Tab. 4 shows that U-GENOT-F learns more meaningful reweighting functions than discrete UFGW as the average rescaling function on the left-out cell types is closer to \(0\), while the mean value of the rescaling function on all remaining cell types ("other") is closer to \(1\). At the same time, U-GENOT-F yields lower FOSCTMM scores and hence learns more optimal couplings.

Tab. 5 shows the variance across three runs, demonstrating the stability of both the learnt rescaling function as well as the performance with respect to the FOSCTTM score.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l} model (\(\tau_{1}\)) & Normoblast & Erythroblast & Proerythroblast & other & FOSCTTM \\ \hline Discrete UFGW (0.8) & 0.788 & 0.820 & **0.842** & **0.945** & 0.258 \\ U-GENOT-F (0.8) & **0.622** & **0.733** & 0.894 & 1.077 & **0.131** \\ \hline Discrete UFGW (0.3) & 0.591 & 0.586 & 0.734 & 0.761 & 0.311 \\ U-GENOT-F (0.3) & **0.295** & **0.430** & **0.554** & **1.186** & **0.162** \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Mean value of the rescaling function per cluster for U-GENOT-F and discrete unbalanced FGW together with the FOSCTTM scores across three runs. Tab. 5 reports the variances for the GENOT-Q models.

Bottom: Target distribution colored by cell type (left) and colored by the conditional density (conditioned on the highlighted cell above) evaluated on all cells in the target distribution. All cells with a relatively high density belong to the Erythroblast cluster, hence the mapping learnt by GENOT-F is meaningful.

Competing methods

### EOT benchmark in the balanced, linear case

As results for competing methods were taken from Gushchin et al. [30], we refer to the original publication for details on the competing methods. For SB-CFM we follow the setup in the authors' tutorial in https://github.com/atong01/conditional-flow-matching/blob/main/examples/single_cell/single-cell_example.ipynb.For DSBM, we follow the setup in https://github.com/yuyang-shi/dsbm-pytorch/blob/main/DSBM-Gaussian.py, but increase the number of inner iterations from 10 to 50, the number of outer iterations from 40 to 80, and the batch size from 128 to 2048 to account for higher dimensionality.

### Regression for out-of-sample data points

Out-of-sample prediction for GW has been considered in [1]. Yet, their methods rely on an orthogonal projection, which only works if both the sample size and the feature dimensions are the same in both spaces. Hence, we rely on a barycentric projection for in-sample data points. For out-of-sample data points we project a data point onto the training set and apply the barycentric projection to the linear combination of points in the in-sample distribution. Let \(\textbf{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\) be the matrix containing \(n\) in-sample data points.

Then, for a data point in the source distribution \(\textbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), let

\[\hat{\beta}_{\textbf{x}}=\arg\min_{\beta\in\mathbb{R}^{n}}\|\hat{\textbf{x}}- \textbf{X}^{T}\beta\|_{2}^{2}\] (40)

where the sum is taken over the \(n\) in-sample data points. Moreover, let \(p_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\Pi_{ij}\). Then, the barycentric projection of a point in the source distribution is given as

\[\hat{\textbf{y}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\hat{\beta}_{i}}{p_{i}}\sum_{j=1}^{m}\Pi _{ij}\textbf{y}_{j}\in\mathcal{Y}.\] (41)

Similarly, we can apply this procedure to estimate rescaling factors in the unbalanced setting. To ensure non-negativity of the rescaling function, we perform regression with non-negative weights:

\[\hat{\alpha}=\arg\min_{\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^{n}_{\geq 0}}\|\hat{\textbf{x}}- \textbf{X}^{T}\alpha\|_{2}^{2}\] (42)

To estimate the rescaling function for a data point \(\hat{x}\), the estimated left rescaling function is given as

\[\hat{\eta}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\hat{\alpha}_{i}\eta_{i}\in\mathbb{R}\] (43)

where \(\{\eta_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) is the set of reweighting function evaluations of in-sample data points.

Implementation

The GENOT framework is implemented in JAX[6]. We use the discrete OT solvers provided by OTT-JAX[14].

### Parameterization of the vector field

The vector field is parameterized with a feed-forward neural network which takes as input the time (which is cyclically encoded with frequency 128), the condition (i.e. the samples from the source distribution) and the latent noise. Each of these input vectors are independently embedded by one block of layers before the embeddings are concatenated and applied to another block of layers, followed by one output layer. If not stated otherwise, one block of layers consists of 8 layers of width 256 with _silu_ activation functions.

### Parameterization of the rescaling functions

Rescaling functions are parameterized as feed-forward neural networks with 5 layers of width 128, followed by a final _softplus_ activation function to ensure non-negativity.

### Training details

We report default values for the different parameters of the GENOT Alg.1. If not stated otherwise in the corresponding experiments section, we use these parameters. As in Alg.1, parameters related to U-GENOT are provided in teal.

* **Batch size**: \(n=1024\).
* **Entropic regularization strength**: \(\varepsilon=10^{-2}\). By default, we do not scale the cost matrices passed to discrete OT solvers.
* **Unbalancedness parameter**: \(\tau=(1,1)\). This means that by default, we impose the hard marginal constraints.
* **Number of training iterations**: \(T_{\text{iter}}=10,000\).
* **Optimizer**: AdamW with **learning rate**lr \(=10^{-4}\), and **weight decay**\(\lambda=10^{-10}\). This is used for both, the vector field \(v_{t,\theta}\), and the re-weighting functions \(\eta_{\theta},\xi_{\theta}\).

When using the graph distance, we construct a k-nearest neighbor graph with \(batch\_size\) number of edges. Then we apply a negative exponential kernel to obtain connectivties from the distances in the knn-graph. For the approximation of the heat kernel, we use the default parameters provided by the implementation in OTT-JAX[14].

### Code availability

The GENOT model along with the code to reproduce the experiments can be found at https://github.com/MUCDK/genot, while a more modular implementation can be found in OTT-JAX[14]. Additionally, we implement applications in moscot[39].

## Appendix H Impact statement

This work introduces novel approaches in neural optimal transport and presents applications in single-cell biology. Leveraging single-cell genomics data holds promise for advancing personalized medicine but requires cautious handling due to its potential inclusion of sensitive information. Moreover, as neural optimal transport techniques find applicability across diverse domains, the societal ramifications of this research extend beyond single-cell genomics. Our intention is to provide access to the GENOT code, enabling its utilization by both general machine learning practitioners and, in a subsequent release, ensuring its accessibility to advance and accelerate research specifically tailored for single-cell biologists.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Everything we claim we do in the abstract and introduction we actually do in the following. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss limitations in SS A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We provide proofs in SS B, which we refer to from the main paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe the model trainings in SS G and E, and the dataset curation in SS D and SS E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide links to multiple implementations of GENOT in SS G Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report training details and dataset curation details in SS D, SS E, and SS G. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report results across multiple runs for all experiments in the main text. For experiments in the appendix we only report results on one run due to limitations in computational resources. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We only perform single-GPU training, thus we assume there is no limitation to reproduce single experiments / there is no environmental/societal effect due to a single experimental run. The computational burden lies in the large number of different experiments/configurations conducted for this study. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We are aware of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, and to the best of our knowledge-adhere to it. Moreover, we include an impact statement in SS H. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include an impact statement in SS H. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We don't release a pretrained model, nor a dataset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [No] Justification: We cite the papers publishing the original data, and provide links to datasets. We don't mention the licenses explicitly, as they are provided by the original publications. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We don't release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects other than the bone marrow dataset [51]. The data is anonymized, and the original publication discusses questions related to research with human individuals. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Only the bone marrow dataset [51] stems from human individuals, but the data is anonymized, and the original publication discusses these aspects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
