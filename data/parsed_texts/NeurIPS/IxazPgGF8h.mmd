Witnessing the strides made by large language models in perceiving and interacting with the 3D world, this study explores their capability to control cameras with human language guidance. We introduce _ChatCam_, a system that navigates camera movements through conversations with users, mimicking a professional cinematographer's workflow. To achieve this, we propose _CineGPT_, a GPT-based autoregressive model for text-conditioned camera trajectory generation. We also develop an _Anchor Determinator_ to ensure precise camera trajectory placement. _ChatCam_ understands user requests and employs our proposed tools to generate trajectories, which can be used to render high-quality video footage on radiance field representations. Our experiments, including comparisons to state-of-the-art approaches and user studies, demonstrate our approach's ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera operation, showing promising applications in real-world production settings. We will release the codebase upon paper acceptance.

## 1 Introduction

Cinematographers skillfully capture the essence of the 3D world by maneuvering their cameras, creating an array of compelling visual narratives [8]. Achieving aesthetically pleasing results requires not only a deep understanding of scene elements and their interplay but also meticulous execution of techniques.

Recent progress of large language models (LLMs) [1] has marked a significant milestone in AI development, demonstrating their capability to understand and act within the 3D world [29, 30, 87]. Witnessing this evolution, our work explores the feasibility of empowering camera control through conversational AI, thus enhancing the video production process across diverse domains such as documentary filmmaking, live event broadcasting, and virtual reality experiences.

Although the community has devoted considerable effort to controlling the trajectories of objects and cameras in video generation approaches for practical usage [4, 82, 75, 28], or predicting similar sequences through autoregressive decoding processes [35, 64], generating camera trajectories has yet to be explored. This task involves multiple elements such as language, images, 3D assets, and, beyond mere accuracy, necessitates visually pleasing rendered videos as the ultimate goal.

We propose _ChatCam_, a system that allows users to control camera operations through natural language interaction. As illustrated in Figure 1, leveraging an LLM agent to orchestrate camera operations, our method assists users in generating desired camera trajectories, which can be used to render videos on radiance field representations such as NeRF [52] or 3DGS [36].

At the core of our approach, we introduce _CineGPT_, a GPT-based autoregressive model that integrates language understanding with camera trajectory generation. We train this model using a paired text-trajectory dataset to equip it with the ability for text-conditioned trajectory generation. We alsopropose an _Anchor Determinator_, a module that identifies relevant objects within the 3D scene to serve as anchors, ensuring correct trajectory placement based on user specifications. Our LLM agent parses compositional natural language queries into semantic concepts. With these parsed sub-queries as inputs, the agent then calls our proposed _CineGPT_ and _Anchor Determinator_. It composes the final trajectory with the outputs from these tools, which can ultimately be used to render a video that fulfills the user's request.

With comprehensive evaluations and comparisons to other state-of-the-art methods, our method exhibits a pronounced ability to interpret and execute complex instructions for camera operation. Our user studies further demonstrate its promising application prospects in actual production settings. In summary, this paper's contributions are as follows:

* We introduce _ChatCam_, a system that, for the first time, enables users to operate cameras through natural language interactions. It simplifies sophisticated camera movements and reduces technical hurdles for creators.
* We develop _CineGPT_ for text-conditioned camera trajectory generation and an _Anchor Determinator_ for precise camera trajectory placement. Our LLM agent understands users' requests and leverages our proposed tools to complete the task.
* Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, showing how AI can effectively collaborate with humans on complex tasks involving multiple elements such as language, images, 3D assets, and camera trajectories.

## 2 Related Work

**Multimodal Language Models.** Large-scale language models (LLMs) [9; 19; 17; 1; 70] enabled by extensive datasets and model size, have demonstrated surprising emerging abilities. The emergence of multimodal models [43; 42; 33] is captivating as they can process text alongside other modalities such as images [25], audio [27], and videos [78]. Some unified models can perceive inputs and generate outputs in various combinations of text, images, videos, and audio [51; 68; 77; 86]. LLMs hold the potential to act as agents [76; 80; 62], allowing them to be driven by goals, reason about their objectives, devise plans, utilize tools, and interact with and gather feedback from the environment. Our proposed method involves multiple modalities including language, images, 3D fields, and camera trajectories, and utilizes LLMs as agents to assist users in operating cameras.

**Radiance Field Representations.** Utilizing continuous 3D fields modeled by MLPs and volumetric rendering, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) [52] achieved breakthrough for novel view synthesis.

Figure 1: **Empowering camera control through conversational AI. Our proposed _ChatCam_ assists users in generating desired camera trajectories through natural language interactions. The generated trajectories can be used to render videos on radiance field representations such as NeRF [52] or 3DGS [36].**

Subsequent research has emerged to improve NeRFs and broaden their applications [69], including enhancing rendering quality [5, 6, 79, 47], modeling dynamic scenes [84, 55, 58, 71, 74, 10, 22, 27], improving computational efficiency [83, 23], and facilitating 3D scene editing [45, 84, 73, 34, 46, 40]. Replacing the deep MLPs with a feature voxel grid network has demonstrated enhancement in both training and inference speed [13, 66, 24, 54]. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting [36] has further advanced visual quality and rendering efficiency. Compared to traditional 3D representations, radiance field representations offer superior photorealistic rendering quality, therefore, this study focuses on camera manipulation upon mainstream radiance field representations such as NeRF or 3DGS.

**3D Scene Understanding.** Early methods for 3D semantic understanding [32, 67, 79, 15] primarily focused on the closed-set segmentation of point clouds or voxels. NeRF's capability to integrate information from multiple viewpoints has spurted its application in 3D semantic segmentation [88, 20, 46, 53, 65, 26, 60, 31, 48, 49, 21]. Among these, [40, 37, 12] combine image embeddings from effective 2D image feature extractors [41, 11, 59, 39] to achieve language-guided object localization, segmentation, and editing. [21] proposes semantic anisotropic Gaussians to simultaneously estimate geometry, appearance, and semantics in a single feed-forward pass. Another line of research integrates 3D with language models for tasks such as 3D question answering [3], localization [14, 57, 81], and captioning [16]. Additionally, [29, 30, 87] propose 3D foundation models to handle various perception, reasoning, and action tasks in 3D environments. However, the AI-assisted operation of cameras within 3D scenes remains an unexplored area.

**Trajectory Control and Prediction.** Controlling the trajectories of objects and cameras is crucial to advance current video generation approaches for practical usage. TC4D [4] incorporates trajectory control for 4D scene generation with multiple dynamic objects. Direct-a-Video [82], MotionCtrl [75],

Given a camera operation instruction, ChatCam reasons the user’s request and devises a plan to generate a trajectory using our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator.

and CameraCtrl [28] manage camera pose during video generation; however, they are either limited to basic types or necessitate fine-tuning of the video diffusion model. Moreover, these approaches require user-provided trajectories, whereas we, for the first time, generate camera trajectories conditioned on text.

## 3 Method

Figure 2 provides an overview of our method's pipeline. ChatCam analyzes the user's camera operation instruction and devises a plan to generate a trajectory using our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator. Finally, an AI agent utilizes the outputs from these tools to compose the complete trajectory.

### Text-Conditioned Trajectory Generation

To enable text-conditioned trajectory generation, we collect a text-trajectory dataset and introduce CineGPT, a GPT-based autoregressive model integrating language and camera trajectories. Illustrated in Figure 3 (a), our method quantizes camera trajectories into a sequence of trajectory tokens using a trajectory tokenizer. Subsequently, a multi-modal transformer decoder is employed to convert input tokens into output tokens. Upon training, our model adeptly generates token sequences based on user-provided text prompts. These sequences are then de-quantized to reconstruct the camera trajectory.

**Camera Trajectory Parameterization.** For each single frame, our camera parameters include rotation \(\mathbf{R}\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}\), translation \(\mathbf{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\), and intrinsic parameters \(\mathbf{K}\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}\). We further convert the rotation matrix \(\mathbf{R}\) into the \(\mathbb{S}^{2}\times\mathbb{S}^{2}\) space [89] to facilitate computational efficiency and simplify the optimization process. The total \(M\)-frame camera trajectory is formulated as:

\[c_{1:M}=\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{M}=\{(\mathbf{R}_{i},\mathbf{t}_{i},\mathbf{K}_{i})\}_ {i=1}^{M}.\] (1)

To additionally model the velocity of camera movement, we introduce a global parameter \(t\) representing the total duration. Consequently, the instantaneous velocity of each frame can be approximated by the relative translation and rotation to the previous frame over unit time.

**Text-Trajectory Dataset.** Given the scarcity of readily available data on camera operations, we manually constructed approximately \(1000\) camera trajectories using Blender [18]. These trajectories encompass a diverse range of movements, including various combinations of translations, rotations,

Figure 3: **(a) CineGPT. We quantize camera trajectories to sequences of tokens and adopt a GPT-based architecture to generate the tokens autoregressively. Learning trajectory and language jointly, CineGPT is capable of text-conditioned trajectory generation. (b) Anchor Determination.

focal lengths, and velocities. Each trajectory is accompanied by a human language description detailing the corresponding movements. This dataset spans various scenarios, capturing both simple pan-tilt-zoom motions and more complex trajectories mimicking real-world scenarios.

**Trajectory Tokenizer.** We leverage a trajectory tokenizer based on the Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (VQ-VAE) architecture [72] to represent camera trajectories as discrete tokens. Our trajectory tokenizer consists of an encoder \(\mathcal{E}\) and a decoder \(\mathcal{D}\). Given an \(M\)-frame camera trajectory \(c_{1:M}=\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{M}\), the encoder \(\mathcal{E}\) encodes it into \(L\) trajectory tokens \(z_{1:L}=\{z_{i}\}_{i=1}^{L}\), where \(L=M/l\) and \(l\) is the temporal downsampling rate. The decoder \(\mathcal{D}\) then decodes \(z_{1:L}\) back into the trajectory \(\hat{c}_{1:M}=\{\hat{c}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{M}\). Specifically, the encoder \(\mathcal{E}\) first encodes frame-wise camera parameters \(c_{1:M}\) into a latent vector \(\hat{z}_{1:L}=\mathcal{E}(c_{1:M})\), by performing 1D convolutions along the time dimension. We then transform \(\hat{z}_{1:L}\) into a collection of codebook entries \(z\) through discrete quantization. The learnable codebook \(Z=\{z_{i}\}_{i=1}^{K}\) consists of \(K\) latent embedding vectors, each with dimension \(d\). The quantization process \(Q(\cdot)\) replaces each row vector with its nearest codebook entry, as follows:

\[z_{i}=Q(\hat{z}_{i})=\arg\min_{z_{k}\in\mathcal{Z}}||\hat{z}_{i}-z_{k}||_{2}^{2},\] (2)

where \(||\cdot||_{2}\) denotes the Euclidean distance. After quantization, the decoder projects \(z_{1:L}\) back to the trajectory space as the reconstructed trajectory \(\hat{c}_{1:M}=\mathcal{D}(z_{1:L})\). In addition to the reconstruction loss, we adopt embedding loss and commitment loss similar to those proposed in [85] to train our trajectory tokenizer. With a trained trajectory tokenizer, a camera trajectory \(c_{1:M}\) can be mapped to a sequence of trajectory tokens \(z_{1:L}\), facilitating the joint representation of camera trajectory and natural language for text-conditioned trajectory generation.

**Cross-Modal Transformer.** We utilize a cross-modal transformer decoder to generate output tokens from input tokens, which may consist of text tokens, trajectory tokens, or a combination of both. These output tokens are subsequently converted into the target space. To train our decoder-only transformer, we denote our source tokens as \(X_{s}=\{x_{s}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{s}}\) and target tokens as \(X_{t}=\{x_{t}^{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{t}}\). We feed source tokens into it to predict the probability distribution of the next potential token at each step \(p_{\theta}(x_{t}|x_{s})=\prod_{i}p_{\theta}(x_{t}^{i}|x_{t}^{<i},x_{s})\). The objective function is formulated as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{LM}}=-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{t}}\log p_{\theta}(x_{t}^{i}|x_{t}^{< i},x_{s}).\] (3)

By optimizing this objective, we aim to equip CineGPT with the ability to capture intricate patterns and relationships within the data distribution. We then fine-tune CineGPT on supervised trajectory-language translation leveraging our paired text-trajectory dataset, where the input for this stage can either be a camera trajectory or a text description, while the target is the opposite modality. During inference, CineGPT can generate camera trajectories solely from textual descriptions as inputs.

### Object-Centric Trajectory Placement with Anchors

While CineGPT enables text-conditioned trajectory generation, its generation process solely focuses on determining the camera's movements, without contextual connection to specific scenes. Consequently, CineGPT alone cannot effectively handle user prompts that involve object-centric descriptions, such as directives like "directly above the Sydney Opera House". In this light, we bridge trajectory generation with each underlying scene with "anchors" serving as reference points within the scene to achieve more accurate placement of trajectories, as illustrated in Figure 3 (b).

Our anchor determination procedure takes natural language descriptions of an image as input. This procedure identifies a set of camera parameters that can render an image that best matches the given description. Current 3D visual grounding approaches [57; 81] typically entail learning a 3D feature field [40; 37] and localizing objects within the scene, which often results in high computational costs. In contrast, our anchor determinator adopts a different strategy. Initially, it selects the input image that best matches the given text description as an initial anchor. Subsequently, an anchor refinement process is employed to iteratively improve upon this initial anchor, ultimately yielding the final anchor. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to traditional methods, reducing computational overhead while still achieving accurate scene anchoring.

**Initial Anchor Selector.** Since our method leverages radiance field representations to render videos, we naturally have access to the input images for training the 3D scene representations. We utilize an initial anchor selector based on CLIP [59] to choose the image from these input images that best matches the text prompt. To be specific, for \(i\)-th input image \(I_{i}\), we extract their CLIP image features and convert the text prompt \(T\) into a CLIP text feature. Next, we compute the cosine similarity between the CLIP text feature vector and each of the CLIP image feature vectors. We select the best matching image with the highest cosine similarity score as the initial anchor. This can be formulated as:

\[i_{\text{anchor}}=\arg\max_{i}\frac{f_{\text{image}}(I_{i})\cdot f_{\text{ text}}(T)}{\|f_{\text{image}}(I_{i})\|\|f_{\text{text}}(T)\|},\] (4)

where \(f_{\text{image}}(\cdot)\) and \(f_{\text{text}}(\cdot)\) represent the image and text feature extractor, respectively.

**Anchor Refinement.** Using the camera parameters \(c_{\text{anchor}}\) associated with the selected image as initialization, we further minimize the following objective to obtain the final anchor camera parameters:

\[\min_{c}\mathcal{L}_{\text{anchor}}(c)=-\frac{f_{\text{image}}(R(c))\cdot f_{ \text{text}}(T)}{\|f_{\text{image}}(R(c))\|\|f_{\text{text}}(T)\|},\] (5)

where \(R(\cdot)\) is the rendering function and \(c\) is initialized with \(c_{\text{anchor}}\). The optimization of \(c\) is performed using gradient descent, with the update rule given by:

\[c_{t+1}=c_{t}-\eta\nabla_{c}\mathcal{L}_{\text{anchor}}(c_{t}),\] (6)

where \(\eta\) is the learning rate. The optimization typically achieves convergence within 100 to 1000 steps. This refinement process ensures that the camera parameters are adjusted to better match the text prompts, handling cases where the initial input images do not align well with the prompts.

### Trajectory Generation through User-Friendly Interaction

With our proposed CineGPT and anchor determination, a large language model acts as an agent to interpret the user's requests, generates a plan to use various tools, and composes a final camera trajectory. We adopt GPT-4 [1] to interpret users' natural language inputs and subsequently produce trajectory prompts. Specifically, we use a carefully designed prompt to instruct the LLM agent to reason about the user's requirements and devise a plan consisting of the following steps: 1) Break down the complex text query into sub-tasks that CineGPT and the Anchor Determinator can effectively handle. 2) Use these tools to generate atomic trajectories and determine anchor points. 3) Compose the final trajectory by concatenating atomic trajectories and ensuring they pass through the anchors.

**Observing, Reasoning, and Planning.** Research indicates that LLMs can be prompted to decompose complex goals into sub-tasks, essentially thinking step-by-step [76]. As illustrated in Figure 2, we begin by instructing the agent to describe its observations, providing a summary of the current situation. The agent then uses this summary to reason and develop a mental scratchpad for high-level planning. Finally, it outlines specific steps to achieve the overarching goal of generating the user-required camera trajectory.

**Utilization of Proposed Tools.** We inform our agent of the expected input and output format, i.e., the APIs, of our proposed CineGPT and Anchor Determinator, and instruct the agent to interact with them following the given format. In its outlined specific steps to generate the user-required camera trajectory, it first calls CineGPT and Anchor Determinator to obtain atomic trajectories and anchor points, respectively. Note that both tools can be called multiple times, and multiple atomic trajectories can later be concatenated into final trajectories that pass through all anchor points correctly.

**Final Trajectory Composition.** Here we explain how to combine atomic trajectories from CineGPT with anchor points to form the final trajectory. The agent first decides the role of the anchors in the ultimate trajectory, either as a starting point or an ending point of some atomic trajectory. Then affine transformations are applied to the respective atomic trajectories to ensure that their starting or ending points align with the anchor points. For the remaining atomic trajectories not controlled by anchor points, affine transformations are applied to make the endpoint of the previous trajectory align with the starting point of the subsequent trajectory.

## 4 Experiments

We assess the performance of our proposed ChatCam for human language-guided camera operation across a series of challenging scenarios. Through ablation studies, we provide empirical evidence of the effectiveness of its fundamental components. We kindly refer the reader to our supplementary material for additional experimental results, including rendered **videos**.

### Experimental Setup

**Implementation Details.** We implement our approach using PyTorch [56] and conduct all the training and inference on a single NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU with 24 GB RAM. The trajectory tokenizer has a codebook with \(K=256\) latent embedding vectors, each with dimension \(d=256\). The temporal downsampling rate of the trajectory encoder is \(l=4\). Our cross-modal transformer decoder consists of \(24\) layers, with attention mechanisms employing an inner dimensionality of \(64\).

Figure 4: **Qualitative results on indoor and outdoor scenes. Visualizations of our generated trajectories from input text descriptions and the frames in the final rendered video. Our method is capable of understanding and executing instructions and providing correct translations, rotations, and camera focal lengths. Additionally, our method can comprehend more specialized terms such as “dolly zoom”.**

_Swep across the boy in black, the keyboard, and the boy in white, then zoom out to frame the boys and the white guitar together._

The remaining sub-layers and embeddings have a dimensionality of \(256\). We train CineGPT using the Adam optimizer [38] with an initial learning rate of \(0.0001\). It takes approximately 30 hours to converge. Our anchor determination utilizes CLIP [59] with a ViT-B/32 Transformer architecture. The learning rate of anchor refinement is \(0.002\). By default, we use GPT-4 [1] as our LLM agent, and its prompt will be released with our codebase. We render final videos using 3DGS [36] as the 3D representation.

**Tested Scenes.** We tested our method on scenes from a series of datasets suitable for 3D reconstruction with radiance field representations, including: (i) _mip-NeRF 360_[6], a real dataset with indoor and outdoor scenes. (ii) _OMMO_[50], a real dataset with large-scale outdoor scenes. (iii) _Hypersim_[61], a synthetic dataset for indoor scenes. (iv) _MannequinChallenge_[44], a real dataset for human-centric scenes. If camera poses associated with images were not provided, we used COLMAP [63] for camera pose estimation. For each scene, we reconstructed using all available images without train-test splitting.

**Baselines.** As the first method to enable human language-guided camera operation, there is no established direct baseline for comparison. Therefore, we adopt 3D understanding approaches based on radiance field representations to let the LLM agent attempt to select a series of images corresponding to the input text from input images and interpolate their camera poses to construct camera trajectories. These methods include LERF [37], utilizing CLIP embeddings, and SA3D [12], utilizing SAM embeddings.

**Evaluation Metrics.** To evaluate the accuracy of the generated trajectories, we manually construct ground truth trajectories and compute the mean squared errors (MSEs) of translations and rotations relative to them. Additionally, we conduct a user study to evaluate the rendered videos using generated camera trajectories, where users are asked to select the video with the best **visual quality** and best **alignment** with the input text.

Figure 5: **Qualitative results on human-centric scenes.** Visualizations of our generated trajectories from input text descriptions and the frames in the final rendered video. Our method performs effectively in scenes with multiple humans.

### Results

As shown in Figure 4, our method demonstrates the ability to understand and execute camera operation instructions on a range of complex indoor and outdoor scenes, giving appropriate translation, rotation, and focal length. Our method also understands more technical terms such as dolly zoom, which creates a special visual effect by zooming the camera out while adjusting the focus. In Figure 5 we further showcase the qualitative results of our method in human-centric scenes. Our method can correctly handle user instructions about specific people and create correct and vivid visual effects.

**Comparisons.** In Figure 6 we qualitatively compare our method with LLM agents utilizing SA3D or LERF to locate target objects. The baselines do simple interpolation of keyframes because they have no knowledge about camera trajectories and tend to move the camera to unreasonable spots (such as entering an object). Therefore, the video rendered by baselines contains artifacts and is not correctly consistent with the input text. However, our method achieves better visual quality and alignment with input texts. Quantitative comparisons in Table 1 further prove that our method has better performance and is preferred by users.

**Ablation Study.** We present our ablation study in Table 1. We evaluate the performance of our method using different LLMs as agents. Our approach achieved the best accuracy using GPT-4 [1] as the agent, better than GPT-3 [9] and LLaMA-2 [70].Without our proposed anchor determination, our method cannot correctly place trajectories within 3D scenes, thereby being less accurate than our full model.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper presents ChatCam, a system designed for camera operation through natural language interactions. By introducing CineGPT, we bridge the gap between human language guidance and camera control, achieving text-conditioned trajectory generation. Our proposed anchor determination procedure further ensures precise camera trajectory placement. Our LLM agent comprehends users' requests and effectively utilizes our proposed tools to compose the final trajectory. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of ChatCam, showcasing its ability to collaborate with humans on complex tasks involving language, images, 3D assets, and camera trajectories. ChatCam has the potential to simplify camera movements and reduce technical barriers for creators.

## Appendix B Additional Results

We present additional qualitative results in Figure A and Figure B.

## Appendix C Limitations

As the first AI-assisted system for language-guided camera operation, our method relies on LLMs as agents, and therefore its efficiency depends on LLMs. With the rapid development of the community, this limitation may be alleviated.

Figure B: **Additional qualitative results. (2)**Our current results are limited to static scenes due to the limited availability of high-quality 4D Dynamic NeRF/3DGS data. Extending our approach to a dynamic scene would be straightforward by introducing a timestamp in the Anchor Determinator. We leave this as one of our future work.

## Appendix D Societal Impacts

Our approach has great potential to help creators in industries such as television, movies, games, etc. reduce their burden by simplifying the learning costs of utilizing 3D assets like radiance field reconstructions. This allows content creators to focus on their creations. We must also admit that as existing 3D assets become more and more abundant, it is inevitable that there will be harmful content in them, and our method may contribute to the creation of harmful content. We encourage the community to play wisely with ChatCam.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: **The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.** The checklist should follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:

* You should answer [Yes], [No], or [NA].
* [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
* Please provide a short (1-2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

**The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.** They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "[Yes]" is generally preferable to "[No]", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No]" provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "[No]" or "[NA]" is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

* **Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading "NeurIPS paper checklist"**,
* **Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.**
* **Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers**.

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction state the contributions made in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations in appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
* The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
* The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
* The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
* The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We fully describe our proposed pipeline and core building components. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We will release the data and code upon acceptance. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). ** Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include implementation details for our experiments, to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe in detail how we obtain quantitative metrics in our experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We indicate the type and number of GPUs. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed in appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
* **Licenses for existing assets*
* Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We credit all such assets by appropriate citations and statements. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes]Justification: Our paper includes details about its user study. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

## 15 Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not pose such risks.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
