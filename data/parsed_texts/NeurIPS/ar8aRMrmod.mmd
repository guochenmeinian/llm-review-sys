###### Abstract

Language models (LMs) derive their capabilities from extensive training on diverse data, including potentially copyrighted material. These models can memorize and generate content similar to their training data, posing potential concerns. Therefore, model creators are motivated to develop mitigation methods that prevent generating protected content. We term this procedure as _copyright takedowns_ for LMs, noting the conceptual similarity to (but legal distinction from) the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) takedown This paper introduces the first evaluation of the feasibility and side effects of copyright takedowns for LMs. We propose CoTaEval, an evaluation framework to assess the effectiveness of copyright takedown methods, the impact on the model's ability to retain uncopyrightable factual knowledge from the training data whose recitation is embargoed, and how well the model maintains its general utility and efficiency. We examine several strategies, including adding system prompts, decoding-time filtering interventions, and unlearning approaches. Our findings indicate that no tested method excels across all metrics, showing significant room for research in this unique problem setting and indicating potential unresolved challenges for live policy proposals.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive amounts of data, largely drawn from across the web (Bommasani et al., 2021). In most countries, explicit policies regarding training on copyrighted material have been lagging behind the development of LLM training techniques. In the US, model creators often cite the fair use doctrine, a legal defense (developed before the LLM era) that allows the use of copyrighted data without permission under certain circumstances (Lemley and Casey, 2021). Nonetheless, litigation has swept the United States and abroad as copyright owners challenge the use of their content for training and deploying foundation models--e.g., _Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc.,_ (2023); _Kadney v. Meta Platforms, Inc._ (2023). Generally, there is less legal risk, and a more likely fair use defense, if models do not output content substantially similar to the training data (Henderson et al., 2023; Sag, 2023; Lee et al., 2024).

Thus, model creators increasingly seek to use guardrails that prevent their models from regurgitating content. An example is Github Copilot, a code completion model, provides a duplication detection filter. When turned on, "GitHub Copilot checks code completion suggestions with their surrounding code of about 150 characters against public code on GitHub. If there is a match, or a near match, the suggestion is not shown" (GitHub, 2023b). OpenAI's ChatGPT appears to have a similar filter for some types of content, as well as training the model to reject requests that may ask for infringing outputs (Henderson et al., 2023). Such post-training mitigation strategies will be an essential aspect of model deployments. Even if model creators possess licenses and filter pre-training data, they mayunwittingly include copyrighted material that the model could regurgitate. For example, consider if a company licenses Reddit data for training. There is no guarantee that Reddit posts are not themselves infringing, and tracing the provenance of every piece of content is nearly impossible. Therefore, model deployers require a strategy to prevent models from outputting content that are too similar to specific copyrighted data, which they may only notice after training is complete. Noting the conceptual similarity to _DMCA Takedown_, we refer to this procedure as a **copyright takedown** for LMs, or simply _takedown_ when there is no ambiguity. Note unlike a DMCA Takedown, copyright takedown is not a formally defined legal term, and in this paper specifically refers to the post-training procedures applied to prevent an LM from generating texts that are too similar to specific contents. Legal scholars suggest that a takedown mechanism may be a necessary and effective part of future policymaking (Henderson et al., 2023; Pasquale and Sun, 2024; Lee et al., 2024). Yet, a key question remains: _Can "takedown" of copyrighted content be operationalized in the context of large language models?_

This paper introduces the first evaluation of the feasibility and side effects of copyright takedowns in language models. Our benchmark, CoTaEval, considers potential regurgitation of blocklisted content due to both memorized content and content retrieved through retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020; Shi et al., 2024) or tool-based approaches (Thoppilan et al., 2022).1CoTaEval assumes a "blocklist" of content that the model should not generate, as if requested by the copyright owner, and evaluates the model's ability to avoid generating the exact or substantially similar content. We evaluate interventions based on their ability to: (1) prevent similar outputs to blocklisted data (_low similarity_); (2) prevent downstream impacts on the ability to generate uncompyrightable factual content found in blocklisted data, (_high utility_); and (3) ensure the efficiency of the model (_low overhead_) (see Figure 1). A key difference from prior work, which evaluates whether methods remove all information about a piece of training data (Maini et al., 2024), is that our work evaluates whether interventions prevent near-similar outputs while retaining uncompyrightable information such as factual content present in the copyrighted material--it is perfectly acceptable to output uncompyrightable fact in a piece of blocklisted content, just as humans can learn and regurgitate facts.2 This work makes the following key contributions:

Footnote 1: Both scenarios are currently being litigated (_The New York Times Company v. Microsoft Corporation_, 2023).

Footnote 2: For example, a news article should not be regurgitated verbatim, but if the article mentions that “The 44th president of the United States was Barack Obama,” the model should not be prevented from outputting this uncompyrightable fact (_Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co._, 1991).

**A taxonomy of causes of undesirable regurgitation and takedown methods.** We identify two primary causes: memorization and retrieval augmentation (SS2.1), introduce the term of copyright takedown for LMs, referring to a mechanism to prevent generation that are too similar to certain requested content during deployment, and compile a taxonomy of takedown methods (SS2.2), ranging from 1) _generic prevention_ such as System Prompt, to 2) _decoding-time interventions_ such as MemFree (Ippolito et al., 2023), R-CAD, which downweights copyrighted content based on Shi et al. (2024); or Top-\(k\) Perturbation, which injects random noise to the top tokens during decoding, and 3) _training-based interventions_ such as machine unlearning (Golatkar et al., 2020; Thudi et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022; Rafailov et al., 2024)

**An evaluation suite.** We introduce CoTaEval, the first benchmark to evaluate the feasibility and side effects of takedowns (SS3). CoTaEval mainly covers books and news articles, two types of textual content that frequently raise concerns. It supports evaluating copyright concerns from

Figure 1: **Effective takedown methods should prevent models from generating text matching the blocklisted content (low similarity) while preserving uncopyrightable facts and fair use information (high utility).**

memorization and retrieval using eight metrics. It also quantifies takedown side effects on model utility with three metrics and measures efficiency impacts.

**An evaluation of takedown methods and implications** We evaluate the performance of takedown methods on CoTaEval (SS4), highlighting the following implications for deploying language models:

* System Prompt and MemFree offer some mitigation but cannot completely prevent undesirable regurgitation.
* Machine unlearning and Top-\(k\) Perturbation reduces regurgitation but significantly compromises factual knowledge from the blocklisted content.
* R-CAD is effective for takedown but comes at the cost of efficiency and risk of utility drop.

Therefore, while the implementation of copyright takedown mechanisms is desirable, as highlighted by recent policy discussions, our evaluation suggests that current off-the-shelf methods are not yet sufficient. These findings point to the pressing need for further research in this area.

## 2 Copyright and Language Models

Recent litigation (_Tremblay v. OpenAI, Inc._, 2023; _Kadrey v. Meta Platforms, Inc._, 2023; _Chabon v. OpenAI, Inc._, 2023; _DOE 1 v. GitHub, Inc._, N.D. Cal. 2022) has pointed to two scenarios where a LM deployment might lead to copyright concerns: (1) content is memorized within the model's parameters during training, and (2) content is incorporated as additional context during retrieval-augmented generation (SS2.1). These scenarios motivate the study of takedown methods (SS2.2).

### Causes to Regurgitation of Copyrighted Contents

**Memorization.** Language models are known to memorize and regurgitate portions of the data they were trained on (Carlini et al., 2019, 2021, 2023; Zhang et al., 2023; Nasr et al., 2023). Recent work by Min et al. (2023) proposes a solution where non-permissive data is offloaded into an external database, while the model's parameters are only trained on permissive data. However, this proposal does not fully solve the problem: 1) ensuring that all training data is actually permissive is very difficult, if not impossible, and 2) it does not address the risks posed by retrieval augmentation, as discussed next.

**Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).** In addition to potentially memorizing content baked into their training data, modern language models also risk regurgitating protected content by retrieving and incorporating material from external sources they can access during runtime. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG, Lewis et al., 2020) has been employed in many systems (Shi et al., 2024; Asai et al., 2023; Yasunaga et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2024), enabling them to search large knowledge bases or the open web, retrieve relevant information, and include it in their generation. With this capability, these models can locate, retrieve, and reproduce protected content while generating responses. Notably, ongoing lawsuits, such as _The New York Times Company v. Microsoft Corporation_ (2023), highlight that web search and retrieval-based methods are a significant source of potential issues related to copyright. While providing snippets from retrieved content (e.g., search previews) is permissible (e.g. in the US), generating entire contents from web pages in the response may not be.

### Takedown Methods for Language Models

The copyright owner could request the language models to refrain from generating content that are overly similar to their own data. While there is no legal obligation yet in most countries today, model deployers are highly motivated to develop such capabilities. We refer to this procedure as a **copyright takedown** for LMs, and the requested content from copyright owner as the _blocklisted content_. This can be achieved by copyright owners providing a blocklist of content that models should not generate, enabling deployers to implement takedown methods to ensure models refrain from generating any content from this blocklist.

Our evaluation considers three types of takedown methods that intervene at different stages of the language model: 1) strategies that generally try to prevent the regurgitation of training data without specifying a blocklist (SS2.2.1), 2) methods that prevent the generation of blocklisted content during decoding (SS2.2.2), and 3) training-based interventions like unlearning (SS2.2.3). Some of these specifically target undesirable regurgitation caused by memorization, while others are better suited for the scenario of RAG, and yet others can handle both scenarios (see Table 1).

#### 2.2.1 Generic Prevention Strategies

**System Prompt.** The System Prompt (Anthropic, 2023) is the initial set of instructions given to the language model to guide the model in understanding the operational rules it must follow during interactions. It has been leveraged by model deployers to generally direct the model to avoid generating certain types of content (rather than taking down particular pieces of content). See an example snippet from Bing Chat (Microsoft, 2023), a production-level model, below:

"You are a helpful, respectful and honest assistant. You must not reply with content that violates copyrights for books, news articles, or song lyrics."

**Top-\(k\) Perturbation.** Another general method to prevent the generation of memorized content or content from the context is to perturb the top tokens during generation, such as by adding Gaussian noise to the logits in top-\(k\) sampling.

#### 2.2.2 Decoding-Time Takedowns

Copyright takedown can also occur during the decoding phase, with strategies aimed at penalizing the generation of content similar to blocklisted copyrighted materials.

**MemFree.**MemFree decoding (Ippolito et al., 2023) aims to prevent the verbatim regurgitation of blocklisted content. At each step, it checks whether the model's chosen next token would create an \(n\)-gram found in the blocklist. If it would, the model selects the next highest-ranked token and checks again, continuing this process until a token that does not trigger a \(n\)-gram match is sampled.

**Reversed Context Aware Decoding (R-CAD).** Context-aware decoding (Shi et al., 2024) enables LMs to up-weight context during decoding to reduce hallucination. Applying this method in _reverse_ for blocklisted material (namely down-weighing blocklisted materials) could reduce specific regurgitation by downweighting the retrieved blocklisted materials in the context. Consider: if we let the model \(\theta\) generate response \(\boldsymbol{y}\) based on the query \(\boldsymbol{x}\), then the \(i\)th token of the response can be sampled from the distribution \(y_{i}\sim p_{\theta}(y_{i}\mid\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}_{<i})\propto\exp \operatorname{logit}_{\theta}(y_{i}\mid\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}_{<i})\). R-CAD aims to remove the "distribution" induced by the blocklisted content \(\boldsymbol{x}\), it will retrieve the content \(\boldsymbol{c}\) from the blocklisted content datastore,3 and sample \(y_{i}\) from the distribution \(y_{i}\sim\operatorname{softmax}[(1+\alpha)\operatorname{logit}_{\theta}(y_{t} |\boldsymbol{x},\boldsymbol{y}_{<i})-\alpha\operatorname{logit}_{\theta}(y_{t} |\boldsymbol{c},\boldsymbol{y}_{<i})]\), where \(\alpha\) is the weight of adjustment.

Footnote 3: We embed blocklisted content using OpenAI text-embedding-3-large embeddings and perform retrieval based on the cosine similarity between the query and document embeddings.

#### 2.2.3 Training-based Takedowns (Unlearning)

Machine unlearning (Cao and Yang, 2015; Guo et al., 2020) is a technique that aims to transform an existing trained model into one that behaves as though it had never been trained on certain data. This approach can be used to make the model forget the blocklisted materials they were exposed to during training. Most unlearning methods require a forget set (the data to be removed) and a retain set (the data to be kept). In our context, the forget set consists of copyrighted content that the model deployer wants to remove, while the retain set includes verified licensed content from a similar distribution. We evaluate four mainstream unlearning methods highlighted in Maini et al. (2024), including _Gradient ascent_ (UnlearningGA; Thudi et al., 2022), _Gradient Difference_ (UnlearningGD; Liu et al., 2022), _KL minimization_ (UnlearningK; Golatkar et al., 2020), and _Preference Optimization_ (UnlearningPO; Rafailov et al., 2024). More details about these methods can be found in Appendix A.2. Note that the objective of unlearning is to ensure that the unlearned model behaves as thought it had never encountered the forget set (Cao and Yang, 2015), mimicking an oracle model trained without the blocklisted content. Although these methods may prevent the verbatim generation of copyrighted content, their current design does not ensure that factual information contained within that content is preserved.

## 3 The CoTaEval Evaluation Pipeline

To evaluate the effectiveness of copyright takedown methods, we propose a new evaluation pipeline CoTaEval (**C**opyright **T**akedown **E**valuation). CoTaEval uses books and news articles as evaluation corpus and considers both the memorization and RAG scenarios (SS3.1). The effectiveness of different takedown methods is quantified based on three desiderata that we propose: **low similarity**, **high utility**, and **low overhead** (SS3.2).

### Evaluation Corpus and Target Scenarios

**Evaluation Corpus.** Our evaluation focuses on two prevalent types of text often involved in copyright-related cases: _news articles_ and _books_. For the _news articles_ domain, we use the NewsQA dataset (Trischler et al., 2017), which consists of CNN articles paired with questions and answers derived from those articles. For the _books_ domain, we use the BookSum dataset (Kryscinski et al., 2022), where each example includes a book chapter along with a summary of that chapter's content. Table 2 provides examples of each corpus.

**Target Scenarios.** We evaluate the two scenarios discussed in SS2: (1) When the blocklisted content is memorized in the model parameters (referred to as _Memorization_). We simulate this by fine-tuning the original model on blocklisted content and then running the evaluation. (2) When the blocklisted content is provided as additional context during retrieval-augmented generation (referred to as _RAG_). Here, we use the original model but present blocklisted content as the retrieved context to simulate the retrieval of the specific material in the evaluation. More details are provided in SS4.1.

### Metrics

We divide each corpus into two parts: blocklisted content \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{blocklisted}}\), which the model should avoid generating, and in-domain content \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{in-domain}}\), which is from the same domain as \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{blocklisted}}\) but not subject to takedown requests. We note three key criteria for effective takedown methods and evaluate them respectively:

* **Low Similarity** (SS3.2.1): Following the takedown, the model must avoid generating content that is too similar to the content in \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{blocklisted}}\).
* **High Utility** (SS3.2.2): Post-takedown, the model should retain essential factual knowledge from both \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{blocklisted}}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{in-domain}}\), because facts are not copyrightable (_Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises_, 1985; _Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co._, 1991).4 Footnote 4: So, if a news article is being taken down, but it includes key information like “2+2=4” or “Barack Obama is the 44th President of the United States,” these facts should not be blocked.
* **Low Overhead** (SS3.2.2): The process of takedown should not impose significant computational overhead, ensuring it can be feasibly implemented. This includes both a one-time offline cost (e.g., modifying the model or database) and an online cost (e.g., modification to the decoding process) incurred during each model interaction.

#### 3.2.1 Risk Evaluation

Copyright-related concerns are more likely to occur when content generated by a model is "substantially similar" to the blocklisted material. As such, we measure the risk via a variety of similarity measures. For each example \(x\) in the blocklisted content, we split it into a length-\(l\)_hint_\(x_{[:l]}\) and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Corpus** & **Original datapoint** & **Risk Eval** & **Unity Eval** & **Overall** \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**News**} & Friends and colleagues of _k_papic & **Hint**: Friends and colleagues of _k_papic & **Question**: Who is founder of \\  & founder Steve Jobs sent their & founder & **Apple?** & \\  & condiances Wednesday after his death at the age of 56. & **Output**: Steve Jobs sent their com & **Answer**: Steve Jobs \\  & defiances Wednesday after he passed & **way**: & & **MMU \&** \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{**Books**} & Mrs Dursley had a sister called & **Hint**: Mrs Dursley had a sister & **Question**: Sumarize this & MT-Bench \\  & Lily Potter. She and her husband James Potter had a son & **Output**: called Lily Potter. She and & paragraph. & **Summary**: Lily Potter and \\  & called Harry Potter. They lived far & **Sums**: Potter are Harry Potter. They lived far & James Potter are Harry Potter’s parents. They lived & \\  & did not speak to them. & **to** them. & & **Summary**: Lily Potter and \\  & & & & **James Potter are Harry Potter’s parents. They lived & \\  & & & & **James Potter are Harry Potter’s parents. They lived & \\  & & & & **for** the Dursley. & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: **Overview of the CoTaEval’s risk and utility evaluations.** For risk evaluation, we input “hint” and ask the model for completion. For utility evaluation, we ask the model to do question-answering for news and do summarization for books. We also evaluate the models general utility with MMLU and MT-Bench. Overlapping sequences between the generated content and the ground truth are highlighted in greenthe _ground truth_ continuation \(x_{[l+1:]}\). The model \(f\) is then prompted with \(x_{[l:]}\), and the generated continuation \(f(x_{[l:]})\) is compared to \(x_{[l+1:]}\) to assess potential risk. Given that any insufficient transformation of blocklisted content can lead to potential copyright concerns (Lemley and Casey, 2021; Sag, 2023; Henderson et al., 2023), CoTAeVal adopts eight similarity metrics covering both lexical and semantic similarity to evaluate the similarity between the generated \(f(x_{[l:]})\) and the ground truth continuation \(x_{[l+1:]}\) (see Figure 2):

* _Exact match_ is measured using two metrics: the length of character-level **L**ongest **C**ommon **S**ubsequence (LCS) \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{v}\) and the length of word-level LCS \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\).
* _Near duplicate_ is measured using five metrics: ROUGE-1, ROUGE-L (Lin, 2004), the length of word level **A**ccumulated **C**ommon **S**ubsequences (ACS) \(\ell_{\text{ACS}}^{w}\), Levenshtein Distance \(\ell_{\text{Lev}}\)(Levenshtein et al., 1966), and MinHash similarity \(\xi_{\text{MH}}\)(Broder, 1997).
* _Semantic similarity_\(\xi_{\text{Sem}}\) is captured by cosine similarity between the generated content and the blocklisted content using an off-the-shelf embedding model5. Footnote 5: [https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2)

More details about these metrics are provided in Appendix B.2. It is important to note that legal judgments of infringement often require case-by-case analysis. While these metrics may not be dispositive of infringement, they are potential indicators of high-risk, potentially infringing, outputs.

#### 3.2.2 Utility and Efficiency Evaluation

**Utility Evaluation.** Our utility evaluation encompasses factual knowledge preservation of blocklisted and in-domain content, as well as general utility:

* _Blocklisted and in-domain content utility._ To evaluate whether the model still retains uncopyrightable factual knowledge after takedown, we assess its performance on downstream knowledge-intensive tasks that are unlikely to result in copyright concerns. This evaluation is conducted on both the blocklisted content \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{blocklisted}}\) and the in-domain content \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{in-domain}}\) (not subject to takedown requests). For news articles, we ask the model to answer questions related to factual information within the articles and measure performance using the word-level F1 score between the output and the ground truth for QA tasks. For books, we ask the model to briefly summarize a book chapter and measure its performance using the ROUGE-L score, by comparing the output with the ground truth summary.
* _General utility._ Additionally, we measure the model's general utility using MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020) and MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2024), two widely adopted benchmarks that evaluate the model's knowledge and reasoning abilities across a diverse range of subjects and tasks.

More details on segmenting datasets and prompting methods for utility evaluation are in Appendix B.3.

**Efficiency Evaluation.** We also evaluate the computational efficiency of takedown methods during inference. This is crucial because these methods should not significantly slow down the model's response time or require excessive computational resources. For a fair comparison, when evaluating the efficiency, we limit the model to generate a fixed number of tokens, and report the average inference speed across examples from news articles or books.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we use CoTAeVal to evaluate copyright takedown methods detailed in SS2.2. We introduce our experimental setup in SS4.1 and present our results and observations in SS4.2.

Figure 2: **CoTAeVal investigates three scenarios of undesirable regurgitation motivated from copyright concerns: (a) exact match, (b) near-duplicate match, and (c) generation of text semantically similar. Verbatim matching sequences are highlighted in green, and semantic similar sequences are highlighted in yellow.**

### Experiment Setup

**Models.** Our evaluation focuses on open language models, as modifying either the training or decoding process is often necessary for most takedown methods, which are not always feasible with proprietary models. We evaluate three models in the RAG setting: Llama2-7B-chat and Llama2-7DB-chat (Touvron et al., 2023).6 For the memorization setting, we evaluate the Llama2-7B-chat model finetuned on news articles (see Appendix B.1 for more details).7

Footnote 6: We also perform ablations on the system prompt experiments for the DBRX model (Mosaic Research, 2024) because its system prompt explicitly mentions copyright in the instructions. See Appendix C.3. To further test the takedown performance across different model families, we also evaluate the performance of Gemma2-9B-it model (Team et al., 2024) for the RAG setting. See Appendix C.4.

Footnote 7: We exclude the book corpus from the evaluation of the memorization setting because measuring summarization performance requires presenting the original book chapters to the model. This approach complicates determining whether any observed matching is due to the model’s memorization of the chapter.

**Methods.** We evaluate eight takedown methods as detailed in Table 1. We notice that all methods except for System Prompt entail hyperparameters, so we conduct a hyperparameter search and report the one that achieves the best trade-off between risk reduction and utility preservation (see Appendix B for details). We use greedy decoding for all methods.

**Metrics.** The risk evaluation reports the win rate for each of our eight metric discussed in SS3.2, showcasing the method's overall effectiveness in reducing generation of text similar to blocklisted content. The win rate is defined as the probability that a given method will outperform another randomly sampled method under a (metric, example) pair. We aggregate these metrics by calculating an average win rate using \(1000\) examples for the news articles domain and \(500\) examples for the books domain, demonstrating the overall effectiveness of the takedown methods. The utility evaluation reports the average value with confidence intervals for four utility scores mentioned in SS3.2.2. We use \(500\) examples in the news articles domain and \(200\) examples in the books domain for both blocklisted and in-domain utility evaluation. More details are provided in Appendix B.3. We report the calibrated average inference speed (compared to Vanilla) for efficiency evaluation.

### Results and Observations

Table 3 presents the evaluation results for the RAG setting, while Table 4 for the memorization setting. Figure 3 shows the violin plot for selected metrics for the RAG setting and the memorization setting.

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: **Evaluation of takedown methods in the RAG scenario, where the blocklisted content is provided as additional input context.** We report confidence intervals for utility evaluation. A [after qu] indicates better performance. On average, System Prompt and MemFree help balance the reduction of undesirable regurgitation while maintaining utility and efficiency, while Top-\(k\) Perturbation will sacrifice utility a lot when it works. The only difference between news and books on MMLU/MT-Bench is MemFree, as the Bloom filter stores different blocklisted content for each domain. See Appendix D.2 for examples when MemFree is triggered in MT-Bench.

As we observe similar behaviors between Llama2-70B-chat and Llama2-7B-chat, our analysis below focuses on Llama2-7B-chat. Overall, none of the takedown methods excel across all metrics; each has its drawbacks, either in effectively reducing similarity to blocklisted content (win rates for each similarity metric are available in Appendix C) or in maintaining utility and efficiency. Our key observations are summarized as follows.

**System Prompt and MemFree offer some mitigation but cannot completely prevent undesirable regurgitation.** A system prompt provides general guidance for model behavior. In our experiment, we evaluate six options of system prompts,8 with the best one reported in Table 3 and Table 4. We observe that it effectively increases the chances that the model rejects outputting blocklisted content, and it is particularly effective in the RAG scenario within the news domain, as suggested by the highest win rate in reducing risk among all tested methods (see Table 3). However, it still fails occasionally; the model does not correctly reject every instance. Figure 3 shows that certain cases still exhibit a high \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\), \(\ell_{\text{ACS}}^{w}\), \(\xi_{\text{Sem}}\), and a low \(\ell_{\text{Lew}}^{w}\) after the intervention. (see Appendix D.1 for qualitative examples).

Footnote 8: This includes: three manually created and three from production-level models (GitHub Copilot (GitHub, 2023a), DBRX (Mosaic Research, 2024), and Bing Chat (Microsoft, 2023)). See Appendix B for more details.

MemFree can reduce the similarity to blocklisted content while generally preserving utility, particularly for exact matching measurement, as it employs a Bloom-filter-based detection algorithm, which identifies elements that exactly match those stored in the Bloom filter. This is verified by a high win rate for \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\) (see Figure 3). However, minor misspellings, extra whitespace, or additional newline characters cannot be captured by the exact match detector and can thus easily bypass detection. In fact, we observe that MemFree tends to apply these modifications to bypass exact match (see Appendix D.2), which does not actually reduce the risk. Consequently, it struggles to effectively prevent other forms of matching, such as near-duplicates, as suggested by the lower win rate on metrics such as \(\ell_{\text{ACS}}^{w}\), which captures the accumulated length for all common sequences (see Figure 3).

**Unlearning and Top-\(k\) Perturbation reduce similarity but significantly compromises factual knowledge from the blocklisted content.** Unlearning aims to post-edit models without retraining from scratch to erase content that needs to be taken down. Although some of the unlearning methods show their capability to reduce the similarity to blocklisted content (for example, \(\text{Unlearning}_{\text{PO}}\) and \(\text{Unlearning}_{\text{GD}}\)), we find they have several downsides. First, most of the unlearning methods are hyperparameter sensitive, an ideal unlearning result requires an extensive hyperparameter search across the learning rate and training epochs, which usually takes much time and computation (See

Mitigations for Copyright Concerns.Few solutions have been proposed to technically address the copyright and transparency issues associated with LMs. Min et al. (2023) suggest training a parametric language model on an open-source corpus and augmenting it with a non-parametric datastore containing copyrighted materials, which would be queried only during inference. Although their proposal eliminates undesirable regurgitation due to memorization in model weights, it does not tackle the scenario where blocklisted content is retrieved and prepended to the context, as the model may still copy the retrieved context verbatim. Decoding time methods like Mem-Free decoding (Ippolito et al., 2023) and GitHub Copilot's duplication detection filter (GitHub, 2023b) check generated sentences on the fly and prevent the model from generating verbatim copies. However, both methods cannot capture non-consecutive verbatim matches, potentially resulting in a false sense of privacy and copyright protection. Hans et al. (2024) propose goldfish loss to mitigate the copyright issues of the LMs, which only computes the loss on the tokens where its golden fish mask is \(1\) when training LMs. Though it shows some promise on the exact match and ROUGE-L score, its effectiveness on other metrics mentioned in CoTaEval requires further verification. Liu et al. (2024) propose SHEID, an agent-based mitigation strategy that can guide the LMs to refuse and warn the user when requesting the model to generate copyrighted materials.

Detecting Pretraining Data.Elazar et al. (2023) and Marone and Van Durme (2024) have proposed frameworks to inspect and analyze the training corpora of language models, providing insights into the composition and characteristics of the data used during the training process. Shi et al. (2023) propose a method to detect whether a piece of text has been used during the pretraining of language models, and used this tool to identify a collection of books that were likely used by OpenAI during training. Additionally, Wei et al. (2024) propose a data watermarking approach, allowing copyright holders to detect whether their proprietary data has been used in model training.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we propose CoTaEval, a comprehensive framework for evaluating copyright takedown methods for LMs. CoTaEval enables us to assess whether a takedown method achieves the desired outcomes: low similarity to blocklisted content, high utility, and minimal overhead. Through CoTaEval, we discover that none of the mainstream takedown methods excel across all metrics. This finding highlights the need for further research to develop improved takedown methods and address potential unresolved challenges in live policy proposals.

Limitations.While CoTaEval is an initial effort to evaluate copyright takedown methods, there is room for improvement in future studies. First, the metrics we provided only offer an indication of the extent to which the generated content may have copyright issues, rather than establishing a uniform measurement. Future work could focus on a more detailed exploration of legal standards for potential copyright concerns. Additionally, our benchmark covers two content categories (news and books), which may not fully represent the diverse scenarios encountered in real-world applications. Future research should aim to include a wider range of content types to enhance the evaluation's comprehensiveness and utility. Third, we have not explored the scalability of the mitigation mechanisms we propose. Future studies should consider the capacity to scale these mechanisms to accommodate larger volumes of blocklisted content. Fourth, there are potentially other important aspects of utility that we did not evaluate. For example, even if the blocklisted content contains a cover letter, the LM should not lose the ability to generate cover letters after the takedown procedure is applied. Finally, we did not evaluate some of the latest unlearning methods, such as RMU (Li et al., 2024) and Negative Preference Optimization (Zhang et al., 2024). Future research can utilize CoTaEval to assess the effectiveness of these methods and their potential side effects.

Societal Impacts.Our work seeks to provide an evaluation of whether content can be "taken down" - a process that prevents models from generating copyrighted content. However, we do not take a position on endorsing this approach as the definitive solution for managing complex legal scenarios. Legal scholars often suggest that takedown mechanisms should be part of a broader strategy that includes additional licensing schemes to compensate for challenges in authenticating the provenance of content on a large scale, as illustrated by our introduction's Reddit example. Moreover, relying solely on takedown procedures might not fully address concerns related to labor or intellectual property rights. It is crucial to clarify that our research does not advocate for takedowns as the sole approach, nor does it claim to resolve the intricate issues surrounding copyright.

### Machine Unlearning Methods

We provide details for unlearning methods used in SS2.2 and SS4 below. We first introduce the concept of the forget set and retain set used for unlearning, then discuss the four unlearning methods evaluated in our experiment in detail.

A machine unlearning algorithm seeks to remove \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\), a collection of data points, from a trained language model parameterized by \(\theta\). This collection of the datapoints \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\) is usually referred to as the _forget set_. In our setting, the content in the forget is the blocklisted content from a takedown request. At the same time, it is also desired that after unlearning, the model still preserves its performance on the examples that are not subject to the unlearning request, usually referred to as the _retain set_ and denoted as \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\). With the help of these notations, we now explain the four unlearning algorithms evaluated:

**Gradient Ascent**(Thudi et al., 2022) aims to maximize the training loss on the forget set, thereby achieving the goal of forgetting the content within this set. Unlike the traditional gradient descent algorithm, which minimizes the training loss on the training data, gradient ascent takes an inverse approach. This method ensures that the model forgets the content in the forget set by deliberately increasing the loss associated with it. For consistent representation, we take the negative of the loss function. Thus, for each example \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\in\mathcal{D}_{F}\), gradient ascent aims to minimize the loss function:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{GA}}=-\frac{1}{n_{F}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{i}\in\mathcal{D}_{F}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{i},\theta).\]

Here \(n_{F}\) represents the number of examples inside \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\).

**Gradient Difference**(Liu et al., 2022) aims to solve the problem in gradient ascent that it cannot guarantee the model retains the knowledge in the retain set. Therefore, gradient difference adds the loss on the retain set to \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{GA}}\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{GD}}=-\frac{1}{n_{F}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{i}\in\mathcal{D}_{F}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{i},\theta)+\frac{1}{n_{R}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{j}\in\mathcal{D}_ {R}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{j},\theta).\]Here \(n_{R}\) represents the number of examples inside \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\). By minimizing \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{GD}}\), the model will jointly forget the blocklisted content in the forget set, while preserving the knowledge in the retain set.

**KL Minimization**(Golatkar et al., 2020) considers two aspects. It want to minimize the Kullback-Leibler(KL) divergence between the predictions on \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\) from the original model \(\theta\) and the unlearned model \(\theta^{\prime}\), aiming to make the model retain the knowledge from \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\), while maximizing the loss on \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\). Therefore, KL Minimization aims to minimize:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}=-\frac{1}{n_{F}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{i}\in\mathcal{D}_{F}} \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{i},\theta)+\frac{1}{n_{R}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{z}}\in \mathcal{D}_{R}}\frac{1}{|\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}|}\sum_{l\leq|\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}|}\text{ KL}\left(p_{\theta}(y_{l}\mid\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}},\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{<l}})\right)\]

Here, \(p_{\theta}(y_{l}\mid\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}},\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{<l}})\) refers to the probability distribution of the next token \(y_{l}\) given the input query \(\mathbf{x}_{\mathbf{j}}\) and the generated output \(\mathbf{y}_{\mathbf{<l}}\). The key difference between \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{GD}}\) is the second term, where \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{GD}}\) directly adds the loss on the retain set, while \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{KL}}\) adds a KL-divergence term.

**Preference Optimization**(Rafailov et al., 2024; Maini et al., 2024b) aims to train the model to respond with "I don't know " when encountering the blocklisted content. For each example in \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\), it changes the answer to an alternative such as "I don't know". After having the modified forget set \(\mathcal{D}_{F}^{\text{PO}}\), preference optimization minimizes the loss functions on \(\mathcal{D}_{F}^{\text{PO}}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{PO}}=\frac{1}{n_{F}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{i}\in\mathcal{D}_{F}^{ \text{PO}}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{i},\theta)+\frac{1}{n_{R}}\sum_{\mathbf{x}_{j}\in \mathcal{D}_{R}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x}_{j},\theta).\]

Other training-based unlearning methods include **RMU**(Li et al., 2024), which perturbs the model's activation on \(\mathcal{D}_{F}\) and retains the model's activation on \(\mathcal{D}_{R}\) and **Negative Preference Optimization**(Zhang et al., 2024), which uses DPO objective for unlearning and uses the forget set as the negative preference data.

In addition to training-based unlearning methods, there are several other approaches for unlearning in language models that do not require training with an objective. Some methods remove blocklisted content by modifying specific regions within the model identified as storing this content (Meng et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2024a). Other methods achieve this by interpolating the weights (Iharco et al., 2022) or token distributions (Eldan and Russinovich, 2023), considering the combined influence from the target model and a reinforced model fine-tuned on the forget set. There are also some methods that do not require access to model weights. For example, Pawelczyk et al. (2023) achieves unlearning by providing specific kinds of inputs in context, without modifying model weights.

Experimental Details

### Experimental Setup

Compute Configuration.We conduct all the experiments on NVIDIA H100-80GB GPU cards with Intel Xeon Platinum 8468 CPU. The typical GPU hours for different experiments on vanilla cases (without any takedown strategies applied) are listed in Table 5.

Model Fine-Tuning.As discussed in SS4.1, to test the memorization setting, we fine-tune Llama2-7B-chat model with all the examples in NewsQA train set for evaluation. We use a learning rate of \(1\times 10^{-5}\) and train for 3 epochs.

Dataset License.We use NewsQA and BookSum datasets as our raw datasets. NewsQA is licensed under the MIT license, and BookSum is licensed under the bsd-3-clause license.

Hyperparamter Selection.For methods involving hyperparameters, we conduct a hyperparameter search to investigate how different combinations affect the model's final performance. The range of hyperparameters for each method is listed in Table 6.

Here, \(n\) represents the \(n\)-gram store in the Bloom filter for MemFree. The \(\mu\) and \(\sigma\) represent the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian noise in Top-\(k\) Perturbation, respectively. The parameter \(\alpha\) stands for the weight coefficient in R-CAD, while lr and epoch denote the learning rate and the number of training epochs for unlearning methods.

Based on the hyperparameter range provided in Table 6, we select the hyperparameter combination that can best balance the trade-off between risk reduction and utility preservation. We do this by following the strategies below:

* For System Prompt, MemFree, R-CAD, because these methods won't hurt the model's utility too much (can maintain more than \(85\%\) of utility for all hyperparameter combinations within the range), we select the one that has the best performance in reducing risk. Therefore, for System Prompt, we report the case with the system prompt from Bing Chat; for MemFree, we report the case when \(n=6\); for R-CAD, we report the case when \(\alpha=3\). We also provide the ablation study about how \(n\) will affect the performance of MemFree in Appendix C.5 and how \(\alpha\) will affect the performance of R-CAD in Appendix C.6.
* Given that Top-\(k\) Perturbation operates similarly to MemFree, with both mechanisms designed to alter the logits distribution during decoding by adding a logits processor, we examine the scenario where they achieve a nearly identical win rate (within a \(10\%\) margin) in mitigating risk. This comparison is made with MemFree with \(n=6\), and thus, we report the results when \(\sigma=3\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Methods & MemFree & Top-\(k\) Perturbation & R-CAD \\ \hline Hyperpaermters & \(n\in\{6,12,24\}\) & \(k=50,\mu=0,\sigma=\{0.5,1,3\}\) & \(\alpha\in\{1,2,3\}\) \\ \hline Methods & & 4 Unlearning Methods \\ \hline Hyperparameters & \(\mathrm{lr}\in[1\times 10^{-6},5\times 10^{-5}],\mathrm{epoch}\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Hyperparameter search range for different intervention methods.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Model & \# GPUs & Dataset & GPU Hours \\ \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Llama2-7B-chat} & \multirow{2}{*}{\(1\)} & News & \(1.00\) \\  & & Books & \(1.25\) \\  & & News & \(6.00\) \\  & & Books & \(5.50\) \\ \multirow{2}{*}{DBRX} & \multirow{2}{*}{\(4\)} & News & \(6.00\) \\  & & Books & \(5.00\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Typical GPU hours take in vanilla case for different models and corpus.

* For unlearning methods, they inevitably lose utility when they can significantly reduce the similarity to blocklisted content. Therefore, when selecting the "best" hyperparameter combination, we choose the one that maximizes similarity reduction while maintaining the blocklisted and in-domain utility at greater than \(40\%\) of the original value. Based on this criterion, we report the hyperparameter combination detailed in Table 7.

Offline Cost.Based on the GPU hours reported in Table 5, we can estimate how long it will take for the hyperparameter search of unlearning. Our grid search contains \(25\left(\mathrm{lr},\mathrm{epoch}\right)\) combinations per method, amounting to 100 combinations for four unlearning methods. An unlearning process typically takes \(10\) minutes per epoch. Without considering parallel processing, it will take about \(17\) hours to obtain these checkpoints. The evaluation process will require \(100\) hours (\(25\times 1.0\times 4\)) to complete. Therefore, the hyperparameter search for these methods will take approximately \(117\) GPU hours, or about \(30\) GPU hours per method. This makes machine unlearning extremely inefficient and impractical for real-world model deployment scenarios, especially given the potential need for frequent content removal operations.

### Metrics

Risk EvaluationWhen evaluating the risk of potential copyright concerns, we take different strategies for the RAG scenario and for the memorization scenario: For the RAG scenario, we simulate the case when the retriever can retrieve the whole copyrighted content for reference. Therefore, when prompting the model, we not only provide the hint but also provide the full blocklisted content in the prompt. For the memorization scenario, we simulate the case when the model has memorized the copyrighted content and can generate them without the full context. Therefore, in the memorization scenario, we only provide hint in the prompt.

Similarity Metrics ComputationWe use eight metrics to quantify the similarity, as mentioned in SS3.2.1. These include two metrics for exact match:

* Character-level LCS (\(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{c}\)): We first convert all the characters into lowercase, then remove all white spaces, newline characters, and punctuation. After processing, we compute the character length of the longest common subsequence;
* Word-level LCS (\(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\)): We first convert all characters to lowercase, then remove all punctuation. Next, we use.split() to get a list of words from the input sequence. After processing, we compute the word length of the longest common subsequence between the generated content and the ground truth;

five metrics for near duplicate:

* ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L Score: We use huggingface evaluate library9 to compute the ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-L Score (Lin, 2004). Because takedown methods will affect the final generation length, for fair comparison, we compute the ROUGE recall score, which is only related to the prompt length; Footnote 9: [https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/index](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/index)
* Word-level ACS (\(\ell_{\text{ACS}}^{w}\)): We follow a similar process of computing the \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\). The primary distinction here is that we focus on the cumulative word count for all matching subsequences with lengths greater than three. We establish this threshold because exceedingly short subsequences, such as a single occurrence of "the," are not substantial enough to serve as evidence of potential copyright concerns;

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline \hline Methods & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Unlearning\({}_{\text{GA}}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Unlearning\({}_{\text{GD}}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Unlearning\({}_{\text{KL}}\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Unlearning\({}_{\text{PO}}\)} \\ \hline \hline lr & \(1.5\times 10^{-6}\) & \(3\times 10^{-6}\) & \(2\times 10^{-6}\) & \(5\times 10^{-5}\) \\ epoch & \(1\) & \(1\) & \(1\) & \(4\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Best hyperparameter values for unlearning methods.

* Levenshtein Distance (\(\ell_{\mathsf{Lew}}\)): The Levenshtein distance (Levenshtein et al., 1966) between two sequences is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, or substitutions) required to change one sequence into the other. We use Levenshtein library to compute this metric;
* MinHash Similarity (\(\xi_{\mathsf{MH}}\)): To compute the Min Hash similarity (Broder, 1997), we first convert the generated content and the ground truth into two sets of \(3\)-grams, denoted as \(A\) and \(B\), respectively. We then use a hash function to encode the elements within \(A\) and \(B\). Finally, we calculate the Jaccard similarity \(J=|A\cap B|/|A\cup B|\) to quantify the similarity between these two sets;

and one metric for semantic similarity:

* Semantic Similarity (\(\xi_{\mathsf{Sem}}\)): We first use all-MiniLM-L6-v21 to map the generated content and the ground truth into two 384-dimensional vectors. We then compute the cosine similarity between these vectors. Footnote 11: [https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2) Footnote 12: We follow the implementation of Bloom filter in Data Portraits (Marone & Van Durme, 2024).

Efficiency Evaluation.To evaluate the efficiency of each method, we configure the model to generate 200 tokens (i.e., we set min_new_tokens=max_new_tokens=200) for each example and measure efficiency in terms of tokens per second. Using the value from the Vanilla case as our baseline, we report the relative speed of each method by dividing its tokens per second by the tokens per second of the Vanilla method.

### Dataset Details

**Genral Dataset Split Details.** For the news articles domain, we use the NewsQA's train set as our raw dataset. For the books domain, we use BookSum's train set and test set as our raw dataset. Below is the process of how we segment our dataset.

1. We compute the output perplexity of the Llama2-7B model for each example. And sort the examples based on their corresponding perplexity. By doing so, we hope to find the content that can easily induce the model to generate long copyrighted content.
2. We then remove the examples with high similarity between the hint and ground truth, and remove the examples with long context that will exceed the context length of Llama2 model.
3. After filtering, for NewsQA, we select the first \(1000\) examples as our blocklisted content, select the examples ranked from \(1000\) to \(2000\) as retain set, and use the rest of the examples as the in-domain content; For BookSum, we select first \(500\) examples in the processed train set as blocklisted content, and use rest of the content from the processed train set and processed test set as in-domain content.
4. For the NewsQA dataset, we followed a specific procedure to select blocklisted and in-domain questions. First, we sort questions based on the F1 scores without context from the Llama2-7B-chat model fine-tuned on NewsQA dataset. From these, we remove any questions whose answers also appeared in the retain set. After filtering, we select the \(500\) questions with the highest F1 score for blocklisted utility evaluation for both the RAG and memorization settings. Similarly, for the in-domain questions, we remove those whose answers appeared in the retain set and then select the top-\(500\) examples as in-domain questions.
5. For Booksum, because its downstream task is summarization, and it is only evaluated in the RAG setting, we directly use the corpus in the blocklisted content for blocklisted utility evaluation and use the corpus from the in-domain content for in-domain utility evaluation.

**Method-Specific Dataset Split Details.** We also provide details for some method-specific dataset splits. For MemFree, all blocklisted content is stored in the Bloom filter13. For machine unlearning methods, the forget set precisely matches the blocklisted content. Additionally, the retain set has no intersection with either the blocklisted content or the in-domain training data.

More Experiment Results

### Results for Evaluation in the RAG Scenario

The results for the evaluation for the RAG scenario, across all eight metrics are shown in Figure 4 (for news articles domain) and Figure 5 (for books domain). Except for Levenshtein Distance, lower values are better for all metrics. These results further corroborate the observations discussed in SS4: For System Prompt and MemFree, though they can reduce the average similarity, there are still cases that have high similarity; For Top-\(k\) Perturbation, it will hurt the utility when it becomes effective.

Figure 5: **Violin plots of all eight similarity metrics for books domain, within RAG scenario, using (a) Llama2-7B-chat and (b) Llama2-70B-chat model.** The short horizontal line indicates the mean value for each method. System Prompt, Top-\(k\) Perturbation, and MemFree cannot prevent every case away from regurgitating blocklisted content.

### Results for Evaluation in the Memorization Scenario

The results for the evaluation in the memorization scenario, across all eight metrics, are shown in Figure 6. We can make several observations based on the violin plot. First, it also indicates that System Prompt and MemFree can reduce the similarity on average, but cannot fully eliminate it; unlearning, Top-\(k\) Perturbation, and R-CAD show promise in reducing the similarity across most metrics, but also result in losses of utility and efficiency; Second, none of the methods perform well in terms of semantic similarity. All methods still exhibit instances of high semantic similarity, suggesting that mitigating high semantic similarity is more challenging than preventing verbatim matches and near duplicates. Table 14 in Appendix D.2 shows a qualitative example when \(\ell_{\text{LCS}}^{w}\) and \(\ell_{\text{ACS}}^{w}\) are low, but \(\xi_{\text{Sem}}\) is high.

### Ablation Study on the relationship between the value of \(\alpha\) and the performance of R-CAD

The violin plot for R-CAD with different values of \(\alpha\) in the memorization setting, evaluated on llama2-7B-chat fine-tuned on news articles, is shown in Figure 10. We also test the F1 score when the "golden document" is retrieved for all the examples. In this case, the blocklisted F1 scores are \(14.9_{\pm 1.6}\) (when \(\alpha=1\)), \(8.3_{\pm 1.2}\) (when \(\alpha=2\)), \(5.7\pm_{1.0}\) (when \(\alpha=3\)). Similar to MemFree, R-CAD exhibits a trade-off between reducing similarity metrics and maintaining utility. As \(\alpha\) increases, R-CAD becomes more effective at reducing similarity metrics but also increases the risk of utility loss if triggered.

Figure 10: **Violin Plot for R-CAD with different \(\alpha\). Increasing \(\alpha\) can make R-CAD better in reducing the similarity metrics, but also brings a higher risk of utility drop.**Qualitative Examples

We also include additional qualitative examples from our evaluation.

### Qualitative examples for System Prompt

We show two examples of adding System Prompt in the memorization setting, which are evaluated on fine-tuned Llama2-7b-Chat model on news articles. Table 11 shows a successful scenario where System Prompt assists the model in rejecting a question, thus preventing potential copyright concerns.

All the exact matching sequences are highlighted in green.

Nonetheless, the model does not always reject these cases correctly. Table 12 presents an example where System Prompt does not succeed. In this case, adding System Prompt cannot reduce _any_ possible regurgitation of blocklisted content. Recent study (Qi et al., 2024) has highlighted that the safety alignment of language models is shallow, extending only a few tokens. In our context, this means that if the model fails to reject a question correctly within the initial few tokens, it is highly probable that it will regurgitate the blocklisted content, just like the vanilla case.

### Qualitative examples for MemFree

As discussed in SS4, MemFree has several drawbacks. At times, it results in scenarios where \(\ell_{\mathsf{LCS}}^{w}\) is low, yet \(\ell_{\mathsf{LCS}}^{w}\) remains high. In other instances, both \(\ell_{\mathsf{LCS}}^{w}\) and \(\ell_{\mathsf{ACS}}^{w}\) are low, while \(\xi_{\mathsf{Sem}}\) is elevated. Furthermore, Memfree can sometimes hurt the model's utility. Below are some qualitative examples:

**Regurgitation Evaluation.** Table 13 shows a qualitative example when MemFree results low \(\ell_{\mathcal{LCS}}^{w}\) but high \(\ell_{\mathcal{LCS}^{w}}\). From this example, we can find:

* In many cases, the role of MemFree is just splitting a long matching sequence into several shorter matching sequences, which cannot help prevent the near duplicate matching.
* The intervention process often involves modifying factual information. For instance, in Table 13, the original text mentioned "The 2008 Atlantic hurricane season." However, MemFree, incorrectly changed it to "The 200 Atlantic hurricane season." This alteration distorts the factual accuracy of the paragraph and misrepresents its key idea.
* Small modifications can easily bypass the detection process of MemFree. For instance, in the ground truth, all commas are preceded by a whitespace, whereas in the generated content, there is no whitespace before the commas. Such a subtle difference can easily evade MemFree detection, allowing the model to produce content nearly identical to the original.

According to the Amnesty International report, the five main causes of pregnancy-related deaths in Peru are hemorrhage, pre-eclampsia, infection, complications following abortion, and obstructed birth. The report found that the Peruvian governments response to tackling the issue was inadequate, and that many indigenous women do not have access to health facilities. The United Nations estimates that the maternal mortality rate in Peru is much higher than the government figure of 185 deaths per 1 00,00 births, with 240 deaths per 00,00 births being a more accurate estimate.
