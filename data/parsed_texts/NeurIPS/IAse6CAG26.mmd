###### Abstract

Recently, multi-modal entity alignment has emerged as a pivotal endeavor for the integration of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) originating from diverse data sources. Existing works primarily focus on fully depicting entity features by designing various modality encoders or fusion approaches. However, uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues, such as weak inter-modal associations, description diversity, and modality absence, still severely hinder the effective exploration of aligned entity similarities. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Tackling uncertain correspondences method for Multi-modal Entity Alignment (TMEA). Specifically, to handle diverse attribute knowledge descriptions, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. In order to mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we propose to unify all modality features into a shared latent subspace and generate pseudo features via variational autoencoders according to existing modal features. Then, we develop an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints, to address weak semantic associations between modalities. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of TMEA with a clear improvement over competitive baselines.

## 1 Introduction

Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) effectively store a substantial volume of knowledge encompassing diverse modalities including visual, relational, and attribute information in a structured and organized manner [23, 43, 44]. They greatly facilitate the advancement of various downstream tasks such as recommender systems [41, 47, 12, 34], video understanding [40, 51, 39], and domain-specific applications [7, 30, 35, 49]. In order to construct a more comprehensive multi-modal knowledge base for supporting external knowledge comprehension and reasoning, the demand for integrating MMKGs from heterogeneous data sources has become extremely urgent. As a result, multi-modal entity alignment to match entities referring to identical real-world concepts from distinct MMKGs has emerged as an increasingly critical task for their integration [23, 5, 6].

In the literature, early investigations into entity alignment primarily rely on translational models [9, 53, 31] or graph neural networks [36, 3] to capture semantic relatedness of aligned entities through the geometrical structures in an embedding space. However, these methods were originally devised fortraditional knowledge graphs and struggle to accommodate diverse multi-modal knowledge, which makes it difficult to fulfill the need for aligning entities across MMKGs. Therefore, recent studies [5, 21, 19] have introduced diverse modality encoders or fusion approaches tailored to the characteristics of multi-modal knowledge, striving to fully extract information from all modalities so as to effectively portray the features of entities. For modality encoders, MSNEA [6] develops vision-guided encoders for relational and attribute knowledge to achieve inter-modal enhancement. ACK-MMEA [19] unifies the encoding of multi-modal features by designing a specialized graph neural network to ensure consistent modal aggregation. Regarding fusion approaches, MMEA [5] synthesizes multiple representations by transferring each uni-modal embedding into a common space. EVA [22] incorporates multi-modal features into a combined embedding using an attention-driven modality weighting mechanism.

Although these methods have made remarkable progress in extracting and fusing multi-modal features for entity representation, there still remain many substantial challenges, particularly the limitation of uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities [33, 16]. Figure 1 illustrates a toy example of such uncertain correspondences. Firstly, the weak semantic associations among diverse modal knowledge of entities pose a considerable challenge in inter-modal enhancement. In \(MMKG_{1}\), "Twilight" has attributes "Release Date" and "Runtime Duration" along with an image of a movie poster containing two roles. The poster does not include content that could semantically overlap with these attributes, which makes it hard to capture their feature commonality to perform inter-modal enhancement. Secondly, the distinct descriptive manners of entities across different MMKGs complicate the matching of attributes with the same meanings between aligned entities. For instance, "Release Date" for "Twilight" in \(MMKG_{1}\) and "Debut Date" for "Twilight (film)" in \(MMKG_{2}\) both mean the initial release date of the movie. This requires a more profound semantic understanding to ascertain if they convey the same meanings. Thirdly, MMKGs often lack complete entity knowledge, with certain modalities entirely devoid of data. This impedes the differentiation of whether two entities are aligned, as this distinction can be readily misled by consistent modality features of unaligned entities. Due to missing attributes for "Kristen Stewart" in \(MMKG_{1}\) and images for "KStew" in \(MMKG_{2}\), there is a high chance of erroneous matching "Bella Swan" in \(MMKG_{2}\) based on its visual similarity to "Kristen Stewart". Given the challenges presented above, the exploration of tackling uncertain correspondences is crucial in multi-modal entity alignment task.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel **T**ackling uncertain correspondences method for **M**ulti-modal **E**ntity **A**lignment (**TMEA**). Specifically, we encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations in a Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module. In MKE, to handle diverse attribute knowledge descriptions, we particularly design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the Large Language Model [25] (LLM) and in-context learning [13] into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the impact of the modality absence, we devise a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) [18] according to existing modal features. For the purpose of addressing the weak semantic associations between modalities, we develop an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in another Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE)

## 2 Related Work

In this section, we introduce the related research categorized into traditional entity alignment and multi-modal entity alignment.

**Traditional Entity Alignment.** Traditional knowledge graphs are composed of textual symbol triples, which often result in information overload [4]. Therefore, entity alignment was proposed to match the identical entities in various KGs for their integration [9]. Existing methods mainly rely on entity embedding techniques, which can be grouped into triple-based embedding [53; 31] and neighborhood embedding [36; 42]. _Triple-based embedding_ defines an energy function to measure the plausibility of triples. For example, MTransE [9] adopted TransE [2] as the entity encoder to embed different KGs into independent vector spaces and then learned the transitions between aligned entities. IPTransE [53] implemented an iterative strategy and employed it to supplement probably aligned entities into the training set. _Neighbor-based embedding_ exploits the subgraph structure organized by partial relations between entities. For instance, GCN-Align [36] used graph convolutional networks to aggregate the neighborhood information of entities. MixTEA [42] instructed the graph model learning by an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and probabilistic pseudo mappings. PEEA [32] increased the connections between far-away entities and labeled ones by incorporating positional information into the representation learning with a position attention layer. However, they cannot accommodate diverse multi-modal knowledge and satisfy the requirement for multi-modal entity alignment.

**Multi-Modal Entity Alignment.** Due to the urgent demand for the integration of MMKGs, extensive research has been dedicated to multi-modal entity alignment [23; 6; 21; 19]. Initially, multi-modal entity alignment was regarded as a special type of link prediction task, aiming to connect entities through the "SameAs" relation [23]. Subsequently, the first attempt in multi-modal entity alignment introduced the pioneering MMEA [5] approach, which transferred multi-modal representations into a unified space by minimizing the distance between the fused embeddings and each uni-modal embedding. Later, Liu et al. [22] believed that visual modality has abundant features as the advantage, thus leveraging visual similarities to augment the training data by iteratively adding aligned pairs. The previous studies employed independent encoders for feature extraction of each modality, without considering interactions between different modalities. Therefore, MSNEA [6] proposed a modality interaction mechanism to guide relationship learning and attribute selection using visual features, and designed multi-modal contrastive learning to make features of aligned entities more similar. Owing to the impact of contextual gaps on effectiveness, ACK-MMEA [19] utilized merge and generate operators to build an attribute-consistent MMKG, and aggregated the consistent information through graph neural networks. Despite their remarkable advancement, there still remain some significant challenges like uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities.

## 3 Preliminary

**Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG).** A MMKG consists of relational, attribute, and visual knowledge and is formally defined as \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{E},\mathcal{R},\mathcal{I},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{V}, \mathcal{T},\,\mathcal{P})\). Here, \(\mathcal{E}\), \(\mathcal{R}\), \(\mathcal{I}\), \(\mathcal{A}\), \(\mathcal{V}\), \(\mathcal{T}\), \(\mathcal{P}\) denote the sets of entities, relations, images, attributes, attribute values, triples, and entity-imagepairs, respectively. Specifically, the triple set \(\mathcal{T}\) includes relational and attribute triples, denoted as \(\mathcal{T}=\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}\cup\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{A}}\), where \(\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}=\{(e_{h},r,e_{t})\mid e_{h},e_{t}\in\mathcal{E},r\in \mathcal{R}\}\) refers to the set of relational triples, and \(\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{A}}=\{(e,a,v)\mid e\in\mathcal{E},a\in\mathcal{A},v\in \mathcal{V}\}\) represents the set of attribute triples. \(\mathcal{P}=\{(e,i)\mid e\in\mathcal{E},i\in\mathcal{I}\}\) indicates that the image \(i\) describes the entity \(e\).

**Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA).** We consider the MMEA task between two MMKGs \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\). The objective of MMEA is to pair 1-to-1 corresponding entities that describe identical concepts in the real world but exist in separate MMKGs. Represented symbolically, the inputs are two MMKGs \(\mathcal{G}_{1}=(\mathcal{E}_{1},\mathcal{R}_{1},\mathcal{I}_{1},\mathcal{A}_{ 1},\mathcal{V}_{1},\mathcal{T}_{1},\mathcal{P}_{1})\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{2}=(\mathcal{E}_{2},\mathcal{R}_{2},\mathcal{I}_{2},\mathcal{A}_ {2},\mathcal{V}_{2},\mathcal{T}_{2},\mathcal{P}_{2})\), and the output is the set of aligned entity pairs \(\mathcal{S}=\{(e_{1},e_{2})\mid e_{1}\in\mathcal{E}_{1},e_{2}\in\mathcal{E}_{2 },e_{1}\equiv e_{2}\}\), where \(\equiv\) means the equivalence of two entities.

## 4 Methodology

In this section, we introduce the technical details of our proposed TMEA. As illustrated in Figure 2, TMEA comprises three main modules: 1) _Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder_ (MKE) module to encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations, with alignment-augmented abstract representation to address diverse attribute knowledge descriptions; 2) _Missing Modality Imputation_ (MMI) module to unify diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generate a pseudo feature via VAEs according to existing modal features for completing the missing modality; 3) _Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement_ (MCE) module to enhance semantic associations between modalities by designing an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints. For model optimization strategy, we integrate multi-modal contrastive learning and bi-directional iteration.

### Multi-Modal Knowledge Encoder

In this module, we encode the relational, attribute, and visual modalities of knowledge to acquire their preliminary feature representations. In particular, to address the diversity of descriptive manners of attribute knowledge, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract.

**Relational Knowledge Encoder.** Relational knowledge is composed of a set of relational triples, in the form of \((e_{h},r,e_{t})\in\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}\). Here, we take TransE [2] with the swapping strategy [5] as the relational knowledge encoder to interpret \(r\) as a translation vector from \(e_{h}\) to \(e_{t}\), making relationships captured by simple geometric operations. The score function \(f(e_{h},r,e_{t})\) and the margin-based loss \(\mathcal{L}_{TranE}\) are defined as follows:

\[f(e_{h},r,e_{t})=\left\|\mathbf{e}_{h}^{\mathcal{R}}+\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{e}_{t }^{\mathcal{R}}\right\|_{2}^{2},\] (1)

Figure 2: The framework overview of TMEA.

\[\mathcal{L}_{TranE}=\sum_{\tau\in\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}}\sum_{\tau^{-}\in \mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}^{-}}\max\left(0,\gamma+f\left(\tau\right)-f\left(\tau^ {-}\right)\right),\] (2)

where \(\mathbf{e}_{h}^{\mathcal{R}}\), \(\mathbf{e}_{t}^{\mathcal{R}}\) are initial relational feature vectors of \(e_{h}\) and \(e_{t}\), \(\mathbf{r}\) is the feature embedding of \(r\), \(\left\|\cdot\right\|_{2}\) is the \(L_{2}\) norm, \(\gamma\) is the margin hyperparameter, and \(\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{R}}\) is the set of negative examples. By this means, we can obtain the initial relational feature of the entity, denoted as \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}\).

**Attribute Knowledge Encoder.** An attribute triple can be denoted as \((e,a,v)\in\mathcal{T}_{\mathcal{A}}\). Aligning attributes across different MMKGs is challenging due to the variations in the expression of identical attributes. It necessitates more than a basic lexical comparison and requires a profound semantic understanding to ascertain whether attributes with different labels indeed represent the same concept. Recently, the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs have been proven across multiple tasks [1; 8; 10]. The pre-existing knowledge within LLMs can help bridge gaps in information that may not be explicitly stated. Moreover, in-context learning [37; 52] is a prompt engineering method where task demonstrations are included in the prompt. With in-context learning, off-the-shelf LLM can solve attribute alignment without fine-tuning. Therefore, we design an alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the GPT 3.5 [25] and in-context learning [13] into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. For attribute alignment, the prompt is devised as shown in Appendix A. As the attributes that cannot be aligned often become noise [45], we only retain those attributes that can be aligned according to the results of GPT 3.5. Next, we convert the filtered attribute triples into a textual abstract sentence. For an entity \(e\) and its \(n\) filtered attribute triples \((e,a_{1},v_{1}),(e,a_{2},v_{2}),...,(e,a_{n},v_{n})\), the template of abstract sentence \(S\) is "\(a_{1}\) is \(v1\), \(a_{2}\) is \(v2\),..., \(a_{n}\) is \(v_{n}\)". Given two attribute triples ("Twilight", "Release Date", "2008.916") and ("Twilight", "Runtime Duration", "117") related to "Twilight", we construct a abstract sentence of "Release Date is 2008.916, Runtime Duration is 117". Then, we use a pre-trained BERT [11] model to generate the representation of this sentence, thus forming the attribute embedding of the entity in the following:

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}=\mathbf{W}_{\mathcal{A}}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}BERT (w_{j})+\mathbf{b}_{\mathcal{A}},\] (3)

where \(w_{j}\) denotes the \(j\)-th word in \(S\), \(BERT(\cdot)\) represents the hidden feature vector in the last layer of BERT, \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathcal{A}}\) is the weight matrix, and \(\mathbf{b}_{\mathcal{A}}\) is the bias vector.

**Visual Knowledge Encoder.** Visual knowledge is typically comprised of entity-image pairs, denoted as \((e,i)\in\mathcal{P}\). We employ a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) [14] to extract image features. Specifically, the last fully connected layer and softmax layer are removed to acquire the image embeddings of entities. The initial visual feature embedding \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}\) for \((e,i)\) is generated as follows:

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}=\mathbf{W}_{\mathcal{I}}ViT(i)+\mathbf{b}_{\mathcal{ I}},\] (4)

where \(ViT(\cdot)\) is the backbone of ViT, and \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathcal{I}}\), \(\mathbf{b}_{\mathcal{I}}\) are the weight matrix and bias vector.

### Missing Modality Imputation

In real-world scenarios, entities in MMKGs often lack the knowledge of certain modalities. This omission can result from limitations in data collection methods or source availability. Incomplete modal knowledge will potentially lead to erroneous alignment. Effectively addressing and compensating for these missing modalities to guarantee accurate integration are able to improve the robustness of entity alignment process.

In this module, we intend to complete the missing modality by unifying the diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) [18; 28] according to existing modal features. VAEs can learn latent representations of data, capturing essential structure and distribution. We utilize VAEs to unify features of one target modality and concatenated features of other modalities into a shared latent subspace. In this latent subspace, data from various modalities become comparable. We can use the latent representation of concatenated features derived from other modalities to approximate that of the target modality, thereby generating pseudo-features.

Typically, entities in MMKGs cannot lack relational knowledge, because entities without relations are isolated nodes, rendering them devoid of the graph's interconnected significance. Therefore, we aim to complete the visual and attribute knowledge for entities. Specifically, we first reduce the dimension of concatenated features of other modalities as follows:

\[\mathbf{g}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}=\mathbf{W}_{ga}Concat(\mathbf{e}^{ \mathcal{R}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}})+\mathbf{b}_{ga},\] (5)\[\mathbf{g}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A}}=\mathbf{W}_{gi}Concat(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}})+\mathbf{b}_{gi},\] (6)

where \(Concat(\cdot)\) is the concatenation operation, \(\mathbf{W}_{g*}\), \(\mathbf{b}_{g*}\) are projection matrix and bias vector. Then, we use multiple VAEs to learn the latent representations. For each VAE, \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{X}\) is a feature of target modality, \(\mathbf{z}\in\mathbf{Z}\) is the representation of \(\mathbf{x}\) in the latent space, \(q_{\phi}(\mathbf{z}\,|\,\mathbf{x})\) is a probabilistic encoder, and \(p_{\theta}(\mathbf{x}\,|\,\mathbf{z})\) is a probabilistic decoder. The loss of VAEs is designed as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\mathbf{X})=\mathbb{E}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z})\sim q_{ \phi}(\mathbf{Z}\,|\mathbf{X})}\left[\log p_{\theta}\left(\mathbf{x}\,|\, \mathbf{z}\right)\right]-D_{KL}\left(q_{\phi}\left(\mathbf{z}\,|\,\mathbf{x} \right)\|p_{\theta}\left(\mathbf{z}\right)\right),\] (7)

\[\mathcal{L}_{v}=\mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\mathbf{E}^{\mathcal{A}})+\mathcal{L}_{VAE }(\mathbf{G}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}})+\mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\mathbf{E}^{ \mathcal{I}})+\mathcal{L}_{VAE}(\mathbf{G}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A}}),\] (8)

where \(D_{KL}(\cdot)\) is the KL divergence, \(\mathbf{E}^{*}\) is the set of entity features of modality \(*\), and \(\mathbf{G}^{\mathcal{R}*}\) is the set of concatenated features of relation and modality \(*\). To unify features of one target modality and concatenated features of other modalities into a shared latent subspace, we minimize the distance of their latent representations as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}_{mse}=MSE(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{A}},\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{R} \mathcal{I}})+MSE(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{I}},\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A }}),\] (9)

where \(MSE(\cdot)\) is the mean-square error. Through this operation, we can use \(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}\) to approximate \(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{A}}\), and \(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A}}\) to approximate \(\mathbf{Z}^{\mathcal{I}}\). In the generation stage, we exploit the results of VAEs to complete the missing modality. We input the latent representation \(\mathbf{z}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}\), \(\mathbf{z}^{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A}}\) into the decoders \(p_{\theta}\big{(}\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}\,|\,\mathbf{z}^{\mathcal{A}}\big{)}\), \(p_{\theta}\big{(}\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}\,|\,\mathbf{z}^{\mathcal{I}}\big{)}\) to generate a pseudo feature \(\widetilde{\mathbf{e}}^{\mathcal{A}}\), \(\widetilde{\mathbf{e}}^{\mathcal{I}}\), respectively.

### Multi-Modal Commonality Enhancement

Generally, tenuous semantic associations between disparate modal representations of knowledge significantly hamper efforts toward inter-modal enhancement. In multi-modal tasks, semantic associations between different modalities are often utilized to mutually enhance features across modalities [50; 27]. If the semantic association is weak, mechanisms designed for interactions between different modalities may negatively impact overall performance, potentially resulting in performance worse than that of a single modality.

In this module, we enhance semantic associations between modalities by specially designing an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints, thereby facilitating a more holistic understanding of the entity. Cross-attention architectures have been empirically substantiated to efficiently capture semantic associations between multiple modalities [38; 29]. Specifically, we consider two distinct modal features, denoted as \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\). \(\mathbf{x}\) is designated as the query, while \(\mathbf{y}\) assumes the roles of both key and value within the attention. The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum over \(\mathbf{y}\), prioritizing elements that are most relevant to \(\mathbf{x}\). This process refines \(\mathbf{y}\) based on the commonality with \(\mathbf{x}\). The attention is defined as follows:

\[Att(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{K},\mathbf{V})=softmax\left(\frac{\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K} ^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}\right)\mathbf{V},head_{j}=Att\left(\mathbf{x}\mathbf{W}_{j}^{Q },\mathbf{y}\mathbf{W}_{j}^{K},\mathbf{y}\mathbf{W}_{j}^{V}\right),\] (10)

\[MH(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=Concat\left(head_{1},\dots,head_{\eta}\right) \mathbf{W}_{h}+\mathbf{b}_{h},\] (11)

where \(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{K}\), \(\mathbf{V}\) denote the query, key and value respectively, \(softmax(\cdot)\) is the activation function, \(d\) is the dimension of key, \(\eta\) is the number of heads, \(\mathbf{W}_{j}^{Q}\), \(\mathbf{W}_{j}^{K}\), \(\mathbf{W}_{j}^{V}\) are projection matrices for \(j\)-th attention head, and \(\mathbf{W}_{h}\), \(\mathbf{b}_{h}\) are the projection matrix and bias vector.

Building upon this cross-attention, we concurrently extract the commonalities among relational, attribute, and visual modalities to enhance the overall representation. The operation is as follows:

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}+}\!=\!w_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R} }+w_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}MH_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{ I}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}})+w_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{A}}MH_{\mathcal{R} \mathcal{A}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}),\] (12)

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}+}\!=\!w_{\mathcal{A}\mathcal{A}}\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{ A}}+w_{\mathcal{A}\mathcal{I}}MH_{\mathcal{A}\mathcal{I}}(\mathbf{e}^{ \mathcal{I}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}})+w_{\mathcal{A}\mathcal{R}}MH_{\mathcal{ A}\mathcal{R}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}),\] (13)

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}+}\!=\!w_{\mathcal{I}\mathcal{I}}\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{ I}}+w_{\mathcal{I}\mathcal{R}}MH_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{R}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}})+w_{\mathcal{I}\mathcal{A}}MH_{\mathcal{I}\mathcal{A}}( \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}),\] (14)

where \(w_{*\#}\), \(*,\#\in\{\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{I}\}\) are learnable weights normalized by the Softmax, and \(MH_{*\#}(\mathbf{e}^{\#},\mathbf{e}^{*})\) is the result of multi-head cross-attention for commonality extraction between two modalities.

To amplify the commonalities among features, we additionally design an orthogonal constraint loss, which ensures the difference calculated by subtracting the commonality features from the original features, is dissimilar to the query features. For example, \(MH_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}})\) means the refined version of \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}\) highly relevant to \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}\). The difference can be calculated as \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}-MH_{\mathcal{R}\mathcal{I}}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}})\)representing the content within \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}\) that does not include any elements related to \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}\). Hence, it exhibits an orthogonal relationship with \(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}\). The orthogonal constraint loss is defined as follows:

\[\mathcal{F}_{orth}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=(\mathbf{x}\mathbf{y}^{T})^{2}, \mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{*},\mathbf{e}^{\boldsymbol{\#}})=\mathbf{e}^{*}-MH _{*\boldsymbol{\#}}(\mathbf{e}^{\boldsymbol{\#}},\mathbf{e}^{*}),*,\boldsymbol {\#}\in\{\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{I}\},\] (15)

\[\mathcal{L}_{o}= \mathcal{F}_{orth}(\mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}),\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}})+\mathcal{F}_{orth}( \mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}),\mathbf{e }^{\mathcal{A}})+\mathcal{F}_{orth}(\mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}),\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}})+\] (16) \[\mathcal{F}_{orth}(\mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}),\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}})+\mathcal{F}_{orth}( \mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}}),\mathbf{e }^{\mathcal{R}})+\mathcal{F}_{orth}(\mathcal{F}_{d}(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{I}}, \mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}),\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}}),\]

where \(\mathcal{F}_{orth}(\cdot)\) is the orthogonal constraint function, \(\mathcal{F}_{d}(\cdot)\) is the calculation function of difference, \(\mathcal{L}_{o}\) is designed orthogonal constraint loss for commonality enhancement.

In this way, we can accentuate the commonalities between modalities to distill inter-modal correspondences for a more synergistic and semantically coherent representation.

### Model Optimization

Through the multi-modal knowledge learning in the prior three modules, we can obtain enhanced feature embeddings for relational, visual, and attribute modalities. By directly concatenating the enhanced features, we generate an integrated multi-modal representation of an entity as follows:

\[\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{M}}=Concat(\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{R}+},\mathbf{e}^{ \mathcal{I}+},\mathbf{e}^{\mathcal{A}+}),\] (17)

where \(\mathbf{e}_{\mathcal{M}}\) is the holistic enhanced entity embedding of entity \(e\).

To ensure that features of aligned entities from different MMKGs are more closely in the space and make the overall modeling more robust, we employ the multi-modal contrastive learning [6; 48] as our main optimization objective. Multi-modal contrastive learning contrasts the feature similarity of positive entity pairs with negative entity pairs, from multiple perspectives of holistic multi-modal representations and each uni-modal feature representation. Positive entity pairs refer to two aligned entities, and negative entity pairs refer to two unaligned entities. The main objective of optimization is defined as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}_{cl}(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{E}_{2}^{*})=\frac{1}{2|H|}\sum_{( e_{1},e_{2})\in H}(1-y)d^{2}(\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*})+y\max( \gamma_{cl}-d(\mathbf{e}_{1}^{*},\mathbf{e}_{2}^{*}),0)^{2},\] (18)

\[\mathcal{L}_{mcl}=\mathcal{L}_{cl}(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\mathcal{M}},\mathbf{E}_{ 2}^{\mathcal{M}})+\mathcal{L}_{cl}(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\mathcal{R}},\mathbf{E}_{ 2}^{\mathcal{R}})+\mathcal{L}_{cl}(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\mathcal{A}},\mathbf{E}_{2}^ {\mathcal{A}})+\mathcal{L}_{cl}(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{\mathcal{I}},\mathbf{E}_{2}^ {\mathcal{I}}),\] (19)

where \(\mathcal{L}_{mcl}\) is the main objective of optimization, \(*\in\{\mathcal{M},\mathcal{R},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{I}\}\) denotes the modality, \(\mathbf{E}_{1}^{*}\), \(\mathbf{E}_{2}^{*}\) are the sets of entity feature embeddings of modality \(*\) for \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\), \(H\) is the set of sampled entity pairs including positive and negative samples, \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the function of cosine similarity, \(y\) is the indicator of whether an entity pair can be aligned, and \(\gamma_{cl}\) is the margin hyperparameter.

Combining all the designed losses above, the overall objective of optimization \(\mathcal{L}\) is as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{TransE}+\lambda_{1}\mathcal{L}_{o}+\mathcal{L}_{mcl}+ \mathcal{L}_{v}+\lambda_{2}\mathcal{L}_{mse}.\] (20)

In training stage, we minimize \(\mathcal{L}\) and update the model parameters via the backpropagation. Owing to the high cost of manual annotations and the expansive scale of MMKGs, the availability of aligned entity pairs is frequently insufficient. Therefore, we adopt a bi-directional iterative strategy [24] based on the asymmetric nature of alignment directions to boost the training. The specific algorithm of this strategy is described in Appendix B.

## 5 Experiment

In this section, we provide extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. To begin, we offer a brief description of experimental setups. Next, the experimental results and analysis are presented to verify the effectiveness of TMEA. More details and results of experiments are provided in Appendix C.

### Experimental Setups

**Datasets.** Following previous studies [5; 20], we selected two commonly used public datasets, namely FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K [23], and allocated 20% of the aligned entity pairs as training data. These datasets contain two pairs of aligned MMKGs with relational, attribute, and visual knowledge.

**Evaluation Metrics.** We assessed the alignment probability between entities from different MMKGs based on cosine similarity calculation. Then, we chose H@N (Hits@N), MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), and MR (Mean Rank) as metrics to evaluate all the models. A higher value for H@N and MRR indicates better performance, whereas a lower value for MR suggests the same.

**Compared Methods** We benchmarked TMEA against a selection of both representative and state-of-the-art approaches. _For traditional KGs_: IPTransE [53], GCN-Align [36], BootEA [31], SEA [26], RAC [46], PEEA [32], and MixTEA [42]. _For MMKGs_: PoE [23], MMEA [5], EVA [22], MSNEA [6], MCLEA [21], ACK-MMEA [19], and MoAlign [20].

### Performance Comparison

We compared TMEA with several representative and state-of-the-art baselines for multi-modal entity alignment task on FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K datasets. Table 1 shows the performance of all methods with 20% aligned entity pairs for training. Overall, our proposed TMEA achieves the best performance on both datasets. Specifically, we have the following findings. First, TMEA exhibits significant improvements with a notable margin compared to not only traditional but also multi-modal methods. Compared to the strongest traditional alignment method, BootEA, TMEA achieves at least a 168.4%, 63.0%, and 118.3% improvement in H@1, H@10, and MRR on two datasets, respectively. When assessed against the leading multi-modal method, MSNEA, TMEA attained at least a 32.8%, 16.3%, and 26.4% increase in H@1, H@10, and MRR, respectively. Besides, we test the statistical significance and the results suggest TMEA has significant improvements (\(p\)-\(value<0.001\)) over baselines. Second, comparing multi-modal entity alignment methods to traditional ones, we observe a clear advantage in favor of multi-modal approaches in most cases. TMEA, MSNEA, and MCLEA surpass all traditional approaches, which suggests the effect of leveraging the rich and varied information that multi-modal knowledge provides. This additional context and modeling allow for a more comprehensive depiction of entity features, facilitating a more accurate determination of potential alignments. Third, our TMEA method, leveraging only 20% of aligned entity pairs for training, achieves a remarkable H@10 score of 0.944 and 0.916 on two datasets. This large margin of superiority over other multi-modal entity alignment methods can be attributed to the considering and effective tackling of uncertain correspondences in the alignment process. By addressing these inherent issues, TMEA is demonstrated to enhance the precision and reliability of entity alignment for MMKGs.

### Ablation Study

To verify the influence of each part in TMEA, we conducted two sets of ablation studies, one set for modality ablation and another for component ablation. The variants for modality ablation are named w/o V, w/o R, and w/o A, corresponding to the removal of visual, relational, and attribute knowledge respectively. In terms of component ablation, w/o MMI and w/o MCE refer to the elimination of

modules MMI and MCE, w/o \(\mathcal{L}_{o}\) and w/o \(\mathcal{L}_{mse}\) are the removal of constraint losses, w/o AP denotes the absence of preprocessing for attribute knowledge, and w/o IT indicates the exclusion of the iterative strategy. Table 2 shows the results of ablation study, demonstrating the effectiveness of each part in TMEA. In the results of the modality ablation study, it is evident across both datasets that each modality's features apparently contribute to the improvement of entity alignment performance. Furthermore, the most effective modality varies across datasets, which may depend on factors such as data sparsity or noise. Regarding the results of component ablation, the effectiveness of each designed component is validated. First, the considerable drop in performance without MCE module (w/o MCE) underscores the capability of MCE module to bolster the commonality among modalities, mitigating the impact of weak semantic associations. Second, the marked deterioration in performance without attribute preprocessing (w/o AP) verifies the effect of integrating the LLM and in-context learning into filtering and abstract sentence embedding. Third, removing MMI module (w/o MMI) leads to an increase in the MR metric, and the effect is different on two datasets, indicating that the effectiveness of MMI module is contingent on the proportion of missing modalities within the dataset. Last, the absence of the iterative strategy (w/o IT) highlights the strategy's role in boosting the robustness of the model, as evidenced by a marked deterioration in MR upon its removal.

### Modality Sensitivity Analysis

In MMKGs, entities often lack certain modalities of knowledge. Therefore, we address the missing modalities for entities in MMI module. To validate the ability of TMEA to maintain robust performance with missing modalities, we compared TMEA with the strongest baseline, MSNEA, under varying ratios of missing modal knowledge. Figure 3 presents the results of TMEA and MSNEA under scenarios with 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% entities having visual and attribute modalities on FB15K-DB15K, respectively. We observe that TMEA outperforms MSNEA at different ratios obviously. In scenarios with missing visual modality, TMEA exhibits a slower performance decline compared to MSNEA. Moreover, when only 20% of entities have visual modality, TMEA achieves an MRR exceeding 0.5, while MSNEA falls below 0.4. For missing attribute modality, both TMEA and MSNEA show a relatively minor performance decline. With only 20% of entities having attribute modality, TMEA achieves an MRR and H@1 close to 0.8. MSNEA remains relatively unchanged across different proportions due to its insufficient attribute learning of adaptive weights, even with a substantial number of attribute features that only yield marginal improvements. This also indicates that our attribute knowledge encoder more efficiently and fully leverages the semantics of attributes.

### Label Dependency Analysis

The availability of aligned entity pairs is frequently insufficient. Importantly, the effective and sufficient exploitation of multi-modal knowledge can significantly mitigate the dependency of methods on alignment labels during training. For the purpose of assessing these methods' reliance on the

quantity of aligned entity pairs, we conducted a series of experiments to train the models using 20%, 50%, and 80% aligned entity pairs. Figure 4 shows the comparison results of all multi-modal entity alignment methods. From the overview, TMEA provides an obviously leading performance with different proportions of training data. Only TMEA achieves H@1, H@10, and MRR scores above 0.8 across various percentages. Moreover, its performance does not show a clear decline even with the reduction of training data proportions, unlike the majority of methods that experience a marked loss in performance. For instance, ACK-MMEA and MoAlign achieve lower H@10 and MRR scores than MCLEA with 50% of training data, yet surpass MCLEA when the training data is increased to 80% on FB15K-YG15K. This indicates their strong dependency on aligned entity pairs. When the aligned sample pairs reach 80%, even though the performance of TMEA and MSNEA on the H@10 metric appears to be close, there is still a noticeable difference in MRR and H@1. This suggests that MSNEA performs poorly in aligning difficult samples.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel TMEA to tackle uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we first developed a Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module to encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations. In MKE, to address the diversity of descriptive manners of attribute knowledge, we particularly designed alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporated the LLM and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we devised a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via VAEs based on existing modal features. For enhancing the semantic associations between modalities, we invented an inter-modal community enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE) module. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of TMEA with a significant improvement over competitive baselines.

## Appendix A Prompt for Attribute Alignment

Aligning attributes necessitates a profound semantic understanding to ascertain whether attributes with different literals indeed represent the same concept. Therefore, we incorporate the GPT 3.5 2 and in-context learning into aligning attributes from two MMKGs. The prompt used for attribute alignment is shown in Table 3.

Footnote 2: https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt

## Appendix B Iterative Strategy Algorithm

We adopt a bi-directional iterative strategy [24] based on the asymmetric nature of alignment directions to boost the training. During the current iteration, if the entities \(e_{1}\in\mathcal{E}_{1}\) and \(e_{2}\in\mathcal{E}_{2}\) are the mutual nearest neighbors of each other, they will be treated as a newly aligned pair to be added into the training set for the subsequent iteration. Algorithm 1 outlines the details of this iterative process.

## Appendix C More Experimental Details and Results

### Dataset Description

We adopted two representative public datasets commonly used in multi-modal entity alignment task [23, 6, 19], namely FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K. The statistical details of FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K are presented in Table 4. FB15K is derived from Freebase 3, a large-scale knowledge base acquired by Google 4. It is widely applied for knowledge graph completion tasks and evaluating link prediction models. DB15K is a subset of DBpedia 5, while YG15K is a subset of YAGO 6. The entities in FB15K can be aligned with the entities in DB15K and YG15K, respectively.

### Metric Explanation

We chose H@N (Hits@N), MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), and MR (Mean Rank) as evaluation metrics. According to similarity ranking, H@N counts the number of times the true aligned entity

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l} \hline \hline You are an excellent attribute alignment expert, and now there are two sets of attributes in two knowledge graphs (KGs). You need to align the attributes in both KGs one by one based on whether they have the same meaning, but there may be attributes that cannot be aligned. \\ Here is an example: \\ The attributes and their values are \\ KG1: \{(date of birth, 1880-10-12), (latitude, 54.20867775), (longitude, 9.70404945)\}, \\ KG2: \{(birthDate, 1563.333), (activeYears, 1652), (birthYear, 1975), (long, 14.548)\}. \\ The attributes that can be aligned are \\ (date of birth, birthDate) \\ (longitude, long) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The prompt used for attribute alignment.

appears within the top-N predicted entities and calculates the average across all source entities. MRR denotes the mean reciprocal rank of correctly aligned entities, and MR represents the mean rank of correctly aligned entities. A higher value for H@N and MRR indicates better performance, whereas a lower value for MR suggests the same. The formulas for calculating these metrics are as follows:

\[\text{H@N}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|}\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{S}|}\mathbb{I}\left[ \mathrm{rank}_{i}\leq\ \mathrm{N}\right],\] (21)

\[\mathrm{MRR}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|}\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{S}|}\frac{1}{ \mathrm{rank}_{i}},\mathrm{MR}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{S}|}\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{S} |}\mathrm{rank}_{i},\] (22)

where \(\mathcal{S}\) refers to the set of aligned entity pairs, \(\mathrm{rank}_{i}\) denotes the rank of the correctly aligned entity for the \(i\)-th query entity, and \(\mathbb{I}\left[\cdot\right]\) is the function of indicator.

### Model Configurations

We initialized all weight matrices with Xavier Normal initializer [15]. For efficiency, we froze the parameters of pre-trained ViT [14] and BERT [11] in the training stage. The dimensions of all entity features and \(\mathbf{r}\) were 100. In VAEs, the encoder and decoder were both composed of two fully connected layers, and the dimension of the latent representations was set to 64. The number of heads \(\eta\) is 2. In \(\mathcal{L}_{TransE}\), we set \(\gamma\) as 1. In \(\mathcal{L}_{cl}\), \(\gamma_{cl}\) was 2. In the overall objective, \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) were 1e-2. We used the mini-batch method with a batch size of 5000. The learning rate was 0.001 and Adam optimizer [17] was adopted. Our model was implemented using the framework of PyTorch 7. The experiments were conducted on a server with two Intel Xeon Silver 4214R CPUs @ 2.40GHz, four NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPUs, and 256 GB RAM memory.

### Baseline Description

We selected both representative and state-of-the-art baselines for performance comparison. The descriptions of these baselines are introduced in detail as follows:

**For traditional KGs**:

* **IPTransE**[53] is the first to propose an iterative strategy for entity alignment to iteratively create newly aligned entity pairs for soft alignment.
* **GCN-Align**[36] leverages the graph convolutional networks to aggregate structural and attribute knowledge of entities.
* **BootEA**[31] adopts the iterative strategy for data augmentation and designs an alignment editing method to reduce error accumulation during the process of iterations.
* **SEA**[26] exploits labeled data and abundant unlabeled data together and learns the difference in degree of nodes with adversarial training.
* **RAC**[46] contrasts different views of entity representations by designing an unsupervised contrastive loss and exploits the unlabeled data to augment supervision signals.
* **PEEA**[32] increases the connections between far-away entities and labels ones by incorporating positional information into the representation learning with a position attention layer for fine-grained information.
* **MixTEA**[42] instructs the model learning by an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and probabilistic pseudo mappings.

**For MMKGs**:

* **PoE**[23] employs a Product of Experts approach to calculate the probability of alignment following the generation of individual uni-modal representations, subsequently determining the "SameAs" links between aligned entities.
* **MMEA**[5] initially produces entity representations with relational, visual, and numerical features and transfers each uni-modal feature embedding into a unified space to facilitate integration.
* **EVA**[22] adopts ResNet, GCN, feedforward network to learn images, graph structure, and triples, and then incorporates multi-modal data into a combined embedding using an attention-driven modality weighting.
* **MSNEA**[6] implements inter-modal enhancement that leverages visual features to steer the learning of relational and attribute features, with multi-modal contrastive learning to mitigate the overpowering impact of weak modalities.
* **MCLEA**[21] takes into account task-specific modalities and models the inter-modal relationships for each entity representation. It then employs contrastive learning to jointly capture both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions.
* **ACK-MMEA**[19] integrates consistent alignment knowledge via merge and generate operators, and leverages a graph neural network called ConsistGNN to aggregate consistent information.
* **MoAlign**[20] hierarchically incorporates neighbor features, multi-modal attributes, and entity types by a hierarchical modifiable self-attention block in a transformer encoder to maintain the unique semantics of different information.

The results of IPTransE, GCN-Align, SEA, PoE, and MMEA are reported in [5]. The results of BootEA, RAC, EVA, and MSNEA are reported in [6]. The results of ACK-MMEA and MoAlign are reported in [19] and [20]. The results of PEEA 8, MixTEA 9, and MCLEA 10 are reproduced by running the codes in GitHub with default hyperparameter settings.

### Parameter Sensitivity

We have introduced coefficients \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) for the two constraint losses in the overall objective function to balance the impact of different losses. Here, we investigate the performance change of TMEA with varying coefficients. We conducted experiments by choosing values for \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) from the list [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1], and the results on FB15K-DB15K are illustrated in Figure 5. The results indicate that the optimal values for \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\) are 1e-2. When values are greater than 1e-2, the performance shows a declining trend. This is because excessive emphasis on constraint behavior can lead to a deviation in the optimization direction.

## Appendix D Broader Impact

The impact of TMEA extends beyond its immediate application in integrating knowledge graphs from diverse data sources. By addressing the challenges of tackling uncertain correspondences, TMEA offers a framework that can be generalized to various multimodal learning tasks like multimodal recommendation systems, multimodal document classification, and multimodal sentiment analysis.

For instance, in the domain of multi-modal recommendation systems, where diverse sources of information need to be fused to provide personalized recommendations, TMEA can be adapted to enhance the alignment between different modalities (e.g., user preferences, item descriptions, and user-item interactions). By leveraging its alignment-augmented abstract representation and inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism, TMEA can effectively capture the subtle semantic associations between modalities, leading to more accurate and personalized recommendations.

Furthermore, TMEA's approach to handling diverse attribute knowledge descriptions and modality absence can also benefit other multi-modal learning tasks, such as image-text matching, cross-modal retrieval, and multimodal sentiment analysis. In these tasks, where aligning and integrating information from multiple modalities is crucial, TMEA's methodology of unifying modality features and enhancing commonalities can contribute to improved performance and robustness.

By fostering an environment where multi-modal data is more accurately aligned and integrated, the TMEA model paves the way for novel applications and research opportunities. For instance, in healthcare, it could support more robust diagnostic tools and patient care strategies by providing a comprehensive view of patient data across modalities. In financial markets, it might offer deeper insights through the integration of textual reports, market data, and socio-economic indicators, leading to more informed investment strategies. Beyond these, the model's application could extend to areas like intelligent urban planning, environmental monitoring, and personalized education, each benefiting from the nuanced understanding and integration of diverse data streams.

Figure 5: The parameter sensitivity on FB15K-DB15K.

In summary, TMEA's broader impact lies in its potential to advance the field of multi-modal learning by providing a versatile framework that can be applied to a wide range of tasks or scenarios requiring multi-modal fusion and alignment.

## Appendix E Limitations

Although the TMEA method offers apparent advantages, its practical application is limited by several factors. Firstly, the attribute knowledge encoder relies on the large language model trained on general corpora, rather than KG-specific data. Consequently, the model's semantic understanding may lack the depth and specificity necessary for KG contexts. In the future, we will explore fine-tuning open-source large language models to enhance semantic understanding specifically tailored to KG attributes. Secondly, TMEA depends on aligned entity annotation data for feature extraction and model optimization. This dependency presents challenges, particularly in scenarios where annotations are scarce or costly to obtain. To address this issue, our future investigations will focus on fully leveraging multi-modal data in unsupervised settings, aiming to mitigate the reliance on annotated data while enhancing model performance.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see the parts of abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations in the Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: Please see Section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Appendix C.3 and Appendix C.4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see the code and datasets in our GitHub. Guidelines:

* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Appendix C.3, C.4 and Section 5.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Section 5 and Table 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Appendix C.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We conduct the research with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The datasets are from https://github.com/mniepert/mmkb in [23]. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The documentation is provided in our GitHub. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
