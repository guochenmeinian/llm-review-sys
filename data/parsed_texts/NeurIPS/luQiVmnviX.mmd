###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various tasks using the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. However, their effectiveness is often compromised by inherent bias, leading to prompt brittleness--sensitivity to design settings such as example selection, order, and prompt formatting. Previous studies have addressed LLM bias through external adjustment of model outputs, but the internal mechanisms that lead to such bias remain unexplored. Our work delves into these mechanisms, particularly investigating how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads result in the bias of LLMs. By Interpreting the contribution of individual FFN vectors and attention heads, we identify the biased LLM components that skew LLMs' prediction toward specific labels. To mitigate these biases, we introduce UniBias, an inference-only method that effectively identifies and eliminates biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that UniBias significantly enhances ICL performance and alleviates prompt brittleness of LLMs. The code is available at https://github.com/hzzhou01/UniBias.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities in various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, employing the in-context learning (ICL) paradigm. This paradigm conditions LLMs on a context prompt comprising of a few example-label pairs [1, 2, 13].

Despite their impressive performance, LLMs are prone to prompt brittleness, characterized by high sensitivity to the choice [11] and order [14] of examples, and prompt formatting [14], as demonstrated in Figure 1. Such prompt brittleness is found to be arise from the bias in LLMs towards predicting certain answers [11]. The presence of the LLM bias undermines the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in diverse applications.

Extensive research has focused on identifying factors that lead to LLM bias and strategies for mitigation. For instance, vanilla label bias [15] and recency bias [11] demonstrate the LLM's inherent non-contextual preference for certain labels and contextual preference for specific positions, respectively. Additionally, several calibration methods [15, 14, 16] are proposed to counteract the bias by adjusting decision boundaries of model output probabilities. However, these approaches are derived from _external_ observations or adjustments of LLM outputs, leaving **the _internal_ mechanisms within LLMs that cause such bias poorly understood**.

In this work, we investigate the internal mechanism of LLM bias, specifically how feedforward neural networks (FFNs) and attention heads contribute to such bias. Building on findings in mechanisticinterpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Dar et al., 2023), we assess the contribution of individual attention heads and FFN vectors1 to label predictions in LLMs. By identifying FFN vectors and attention heads that convey biased influences towards label prediction, we reveal the internal mechanisms behind several key bias factors, including vanilla label bias (Fei et al., 2023), recency bias (Zhao et al., 2021), and selection bias (Zheng et al., 2023). For instance, our analysis of FFN vectors without input context demonstrates that their cumulative impact biases the LLM towards specific labels, indicating a non-contextual preference for certain labels, i.e., vanilla label bias. We elaborate on the background of mechanistic interpretability in Section 2.1 and present our findings on the internal mechanisms of LLM biases in next section.

Footnote 1: FFN vector refers to the value vector in the second weight matrix of the FFN layer. We elaborate on this in Section 2.1

Given our findings that various bias factors stem from the biased behaviors of attention heads and FFN vectors, we are prompted to ask: Can we identify the biased components of LLMs and mitigate their detrimental impact on label prediction? Motivated by this intuition, we propose **UniBias**, an inference-only method designed to identify and eliminate biased FFN vectors and attention heads in LLMs. Specifically, we begin by projecting each FFN vector and attention head into the vocabulary space to interpret the information conveyed by their outputs. We then detect biased components based on three criteria we defined: the relatedness criterion, the bias criterion, and the low variance criterion. After identification, we mitigate their impact by masking these biased components. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that LLMs, from which biased components have been removed, consistently outperform their original counterparts by a significant margin. Further, as illustrated in Figure 1, our method significantly improves both the performance and robustness of ICL with perturbations of various design settings.

The contributions of our work are summarized as follows:

* In contrast to existing works based on external adjustments of LLM outputs, we mitigate LLM bias through manipulation of LLM internal structure. This novel perspective potentially offers a new direction for the field. Moreover, our method demonstrate an effective way to manipulate internal structures of LLMs.
* We conduct a thorough investigation of the internal mechanisms underlying biases in LLMs, revealing the inner causes of these biases.
* Extensive experiments across 12 NLP datasets demonstrate that, by removing the biased components, our UniBias method significantly enhances ICL performance and achieve state-of-the-art results. Additionally, it effectively addresses the issue of prompt brittleness.

## 2 Internal Mechanisms Causing the Bias of LLMs

This section reveals the internal mechanisms within LLMs that lead to various bias factors.

Figure 1: illustrates the prompt brittleness of ICL and the effectiveness of our method in mitigating this issue. Experiments are conducted in one-shot setting, using SST2 (Socher et al., 2013) dataset for experiments on example selection and prompt formatting and AGnews (Zhang et al., 2015) dataset for example order experiment due to more diverse combination of orders.

### Background

The theoretical background of this work is based on research on mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022; Geva et al., 2021), which aims to explain the internal processes in language models (LMs), facilitating the interpretation of the contributions of individual model components to the final prediction.

We are focusing on decoder-only LMs in this paper. They are composed by a sequence of transformer layers, each composed of a multi-head self-attention layer and an feedforward neural network layer. The background knowledge for interpreting the contribution of each FFN vector and attention head to the models' prediction are demonstrated as follows.

**The Residual Stream** We interpret Transformers following the view of residual stream (Elhage et al., 2021; Dar et al., 2023). Due to the residual connection of Transformers, each layer takes a hidden state as input, and adds information obtained by its attention layer and FFN layer to the hidden state through residual connection. In this section, the hidden state is a residual stream passed along layers, and each attention layer and FFN layer contribute to the final prediction by adding information to the residual stream.

**Attention Heads** Following Elhage et al. (2021); Dar et al. (2023), the output of each attention layer of LM can be computed as the sum of all its attention heads. Specifically, for \(l\)-th layer, the input is \(X^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}\), and the attention layer is parameterized by four matrices \(W_{Q}^{l}\), \(W_{K}^{l}\), \(W_{V}^{l}\), \(W_{O}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\). The columns of each projection matrix and the rows of the output matrix can be split into \(H\) parts: \(W_{Q}^{\ell,j},W_{K}^{\ell,j},W_{V}^{\ell,j}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times\frac{H}{H}}\) and \(W_{O}^{\ell,j}\in\mathbb{R}^{\frac{H}{H}\times d}\), where \(H\) is the number of attention heads. We then find that:

\[\text{At}^{\ell}(X^{\ell})=\text{\bf Concat}\left[A^{\ell,1}X^{\ell}W_{V}^{ \ell,1},A^{\ell,2}X^{\ell}W_{V}^{\ell,2},\dots,A^{\ell,H}X^{\ell}W_{V}^{\ell,H }\right]W_{O}^{\ell}=\sum_{j=1}^{H}A^{\ell,j}(X^{\ell}W_{V}^{\ell,j})W_{O}^{ \ell,j}\]

\[\text{where }A^{\ell,j}=\text{softmax}\left(\frac{(X^{\ell}W_{O}^{\ell,j})(X^{ \ell}W_{K}^{\ell,j})^{T}}{\sqrt{d/H}}+M^{\ell,j}\right)\text{, }M^{\ell,j}\text{ is the attention mask. Therefore, the output of an attention layer is equivalent to computing attention heads independently, multiplying each by its own output matrix, and adding them into the residual stream of the LM.

**FFN** In line with Geva et al. (2021, 2022), transformer FFN layers can be cast as linear combination of vectors. Specifically, for an input vector \(\mathbf{x}^{\ell}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), FFN parameter matrices \(\mathbf{K}^{\ell},\mathbf{V}^{\ell}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{m}\times d}\), the FFN output can be derived as:

\[\text{FFN}^{\ell}(\mathbf{x}^{\ell})=f(\mathbf{x}^{\ell}\mathbf{K}^{\ell^{T}} )\mathbf{V}^{\ell}=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{m}}f(\mathbf{x}^{\ell}\cdot\mathbf{k}_{i}^{ \ell})\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\ell}=\sum_{i=1}^{d_{m}}m_{i}^{\ell}\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\ell}\]

where \(f\) is the activation function, \(i\) is the index of the vector. Then, the FFN layer can be viewed as a linear combination of vectors: the multiplication of \(\mathbf{x}^{\ell}\) and the key vector \(\mathbf{k}_{i}\) produces the coefficient \(m_{i}^{\ell}\) that weights the corresponding value vector \(\mathbf{v}_{i}\).

**Logit Lens** The logit lens (Nostalgebraist, 2020) is a technique that directly decode hidden states into the vocabulary space using the unembedding matrix of the LLM for interpretation. This approach has been validated in various studies as an efficient method for interpreting the weight matrix or hidden states of LLMs (Dar et al., 2023; Hanna et al., 2023; Feng et al., 2024; Yu et al., 2023; Geva et al., 2021).

In summary, each attention layer and FFN layer contribute to the final prediction by adding their output hidden states to the residual stream. These outputs can be viewed as the sum of their respective attention heads and FFN vectors. Each attention head or FFN vector's output can be interpreted through the logit lens.

### Internal Mechanisms of Bias Factors

We delve into the mechanisms behind several bias factors, analyzing the contributions of attention heads and FFN vectors to the biased predictions in LLMs. We explore vanilla label bias, position bias, and selection bias using the Llama-2 7B model (Touvron et al., 2023).

**Vanilla Label Bias** The vanilla label bias (Fei et al., 2023), also known as common token bias (Zhao et al., 2021), is the inherent, uncontextual preference of the model towards predicting certain label names. Given the contextual nature of attention layers, our investigation focuses on the FFN layers, where we identified a corresponding uncontextual preference. Specifically, by projecting the FFN value vectors into the vocabulary space, we compute the logits for various label names for each FFN vector. Utilizing the residual stream insight, we then aggregate these logits for all FFN vectors whose label logits rank within the top \(10\) over the vocabulary, reflecting unconttextual influences of FFN vectors that are effective in label prediction. This process yields what we term _uncontextual accumulated FFN logits_, revealing the intrinsic bias of the LLM towards predicting label names without the influence of input.

Figure 2 illustrates the accumulated uncontextual FFN logits across different label names in the sentiment analysis task, alongside their corresponding zero-shot prediction frequencies on the SST-2 dataset. For example, the label name 'positive' exhibits higher uncontextual accumulated FFN logits compared to 'negative,' leading to a higher frequency of 'positive' predictions. Additionally, when comparing the labels 'good' and 'bad', the difference in their uncontextual accumulated FFN logits is more pronounced than that between 'positive' and 'negative,' resulting in a larger discrepancy in prediction frequency. Conversely, the accumulated logits for the labels'satisfied' and 'disappointed' show a reverse trend relative to 'positive' and 'negative', which results in a corresponding reverse trend in their prediction frequency ratios.

**Recency Bias** Recency bias refers to the tendency of LLMs to favor the label of the example at the end of the prompt (Zhao et al., 2021). By examining the behavior of attention heads within LLMs, we observe that specific heads consistently prioritize the example at the end of the prompt, providing an internal perspective on the origin of recency bias.

We identify the biased attention head using the method introduced in Section 3. We compare the behaviors of a biased attention head (layer 16, head 29) and an unbiased attention head (layer 16, head 19) in terms of the attention weight assigned to examples at different positions and the label logits of the corresponding attention head for the last output. Specifically, we use the SST-2 dataset, including one positive and one negative example in the prompt, and test with 40 samples, evenly split between positive and negative examples. More experimental details are provided in Appendix A.

Experimental results in Figure 3 reveal that the biased attention head (layer 16, head 29) consistently assigns significantly larger attention weights to the final example, irrespective of the ground truth labels of the test samples. This bias persists even when the sequence of examples is reversed, as shown in the second subfigure, indicating a biased preference of this attention head for the last example in the prompt. Furthermore, the biased attention weight assignment leads to biased logits, as shown in the third subfigure. In contrast, the unbiased attention head (layer 16, head 19) assigns very close averaged attention weights to both examples in the prompt. Interestingly, we observe that this unbiased head generally assigns larger weights to the example whose label matches the ground

truth label of the test sample, resulting in 35 out of 40 samples being correctly classified based on this pattern by this single attention head. The preference shown by specific attention heads for the example at the end of the prompt reveals the internal mechanism of recency bias.

Selection BiasThe selection bias refers that LLMs prefer to select specific option ID (like "Option A") as answers for multiple choice questions [Zheng et al., 2023]. We have identified both FFN vectors and attention heads that consistently favor a specific option regardless of the ground truth label of the test sample, revealing the internal mechanism of selection bias.

We evaluate the Llama-2 7B model on the ARC dataset, which contains four options (A, B, C, D). We use a zero-shot setting to avoid the influence of position bias from multiple examples. More details are provided in Appendix A. Experimental results are illustrated in Figure 4. Firstly, we observe that the LLM exhibits a vanilla label bias favoring option "A", as shown in the first subfigure. Additionally, we identify a biased attention head that demonstrates a position bias consistently favoring the first option regardless of the ground truth labels of the test samples (second subfigure) or changes in the sequence of options (third subfigure). Since option A is usually the first option, these two biases both lead to the LLM's preference for option A.

## 3 Methodology

In the previous section, we unveil that **various bias factors are stem from the biased behaviors of attention heads and FFN vectors**. Naturally, we pose the question: _Can we identify the biased components of LLMs and mitigate their impact on label prediction?_ Therefore, we propose our **UniBias** method to **Un**veil and **m**itigate LLMs' label **Bias** through internal attention and FFN manipulation. Notably, our method is proposed for decoder-only LLMs.

### Biased FFN Vectors Identification

Identifying biased FFN vectors in LLMs hinges on whether the contribution of each FFN vector is independent and interpretable. As discussed in Section 2.1, the output of an FFN layer can be cast as a linear combination of FFN vectors. Each FFN vector contributes to the final prediction by adding information encoded in its value vector, \(\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\ell}\), weighted by its corresponding coefficient, \(m_{i}^{\ell}\). This information within \(\mathbf{v}_{i}^{\ell}\) can be interpreted through the logit lens, enabling us to interpret it as a distribution of logits across the vocabulary space.

How to identify an FFN vector as biased? we assess whether it consistently introduces a biased preference towards specific labels into the residual stream, regardless of variations in the test samples. Such consistent biases can skew the LLM's predictions. We introduce the following criteria to detect biased components in LLMs, which are also applicable for identifying biased attention heads:

* **Relatedness Criterion**: The information introduced by the FFN vector (or attention head) should closely relate to label prediction.
* **Biased Criterion**: The information contributed to the residual stream by the FFN vector (or attention head) exhibits a biased distribution, favoring certain labels over others.
* **Low Variance Criterion**: The label prediction information added by the FFN vector (or attention head) to the residual stream is almost identical across a set of test samples with different labels, i.e., exhibits very small variance.

The third criterion is key to identifying biased FFN vectors (or attention heads), as consistently low variance indicates that the FFN vector is not adequately responsive to varying inputs. Combined with the second criterion, this suggests a bias towards certain predictions regardless of the input's contextual differences.

Figure 4: The internal mechanism of the selection bias.

To examine these criteria, we interpret the information contributed by each FFN vector, i.e., \(m\mathbf{v}\). For simplicity, we omit the layer number \(\ell\) and FFN index \(i\). Since the FFN value vector \(\mathbf{v}\) is fixed, changes in the FFN coefficient \(m\) across different samples reflect the change in information brought by the FFN vector. We interpret this information by projecting each FFN value vector into the vocabulary space and analyzing the logit distribution over label tokens, termed _label logits_.

Specifically, given an FFN value vector \(\mathbf{v}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), the unembedding matrix \(E\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d_{e}}\), a label token mapping matrix \(L\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d_{e}}\), where each row is a one-hot vector indicating the token id of the first token of each label name, the label logits \(\mathbf{g}^{(\mathbf{k})}=[g_{0}^{(k)},g_{1}^{(k)},\dots,g_{c-1}^{(k)}]^{\top}\) (where \(c\) is the class number) corresponding to the FFN value vector \(\mathbf{v}\) of \(k\)-th sample can be obtained by:

\[\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{v}\cdot E\cdot L^{\top}\]

We use \(p\) unlabeled samples from the task to assess the three criteria we defined. The coefficients and label logits of an FFN vector for these samples are denoted as \(\mathbf{m}=[m_{0},m_{1},\dots,\ m_{p-1}]\) and \(\mathbf{G}=[\mathbf{g}^{(0)},\mathbf{g}^{(1)},\dots,\mathbf{g}^{(p-1)}]^{ \top}\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times c}\), respectively. An FFN vector is considered biased if it meets the following conditions, each corresponding to one of the three criteria we defined:

\[\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Sum}\left(\mathbf{G}_{k,:}\right) =\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Sum}\left(\mathbf{g}^{(\mathbf{k})} \right)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}g_{j}^{(k)}>th_{FFN}^{1}\] (1) \[\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Bias}\left(\mathbf{G}_{k,:}\right) =\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Bias}\left(\mathbf{g}^{(\mathbf{k})} \right)=\frac{1}{p}\frac{1}{c}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}\left(g_{j}^{(k) }-\mu(\mathbf{g}^{(\mathbf{k})})\right)>th_{FFN}^{2}\] (2) \[CV\left(\mathbf{m}\right)=\frac{\sigma(\mathbf{m})}{\mu(\mathbf{ m})}=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{1}{p}\sum_{j=0}^{p-1}\left(m_{k}-\mu(\mathbf{m}) \right)^{2}}}{\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}m_{k}}<th_{FFN}^{3}\] (3)

where \(\mu(\mathbf{g}^{(k)})=\frac{1}{c}\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}g_{j}^{(k)}\), \(\mu(\mathbf{m})=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}m_{k}\). The thresholds \(th_{FFN}^{1},th_{FFN}^{2},th_{FFN}^{3}\) are set by grid search, which is elaborated in Section 3.4

The first equation corresponds to the relatedness criterion, measured by the sum of label logits. A higher sum indicates that the information introduced by the FFN vector is more relevant to label prediction. The second equation relates to the bias criterion, quantified by the deviation of the average logit for each label from the overall average logit across all labels. Ideally, for a set of test samples with different labels, the average logits for each label should be relatively balanced. A greater deviation from each label's average compared to the overall average across all labels indicates a more biased distribution. The third equation addresses the low variance criterion, measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the FFN vector coefficients across different samples. The CV, calculated as the standard deviation normalized by the mean, indicates whether the label prediction information added by the FFN vector remains almost the same across different samples.

### Biased Attention Heads Identification

The identification of biased attention heads closely resembles the process of identifying biased FFN vectors. As discussed in Section 2.1, each attention head's contribution to the final prediction is independent and interpretable. Therefore, we project the output hidden states of each attention head into the vocabulary space to interpret the information they contribute.

To identify biased attention heads, we use the same three criteria introduced for identifying biased FFN vectors. To apply these criteria, we project the output hidden states from each attention head into the vocabulary space and analyze their label logits as the information contributes to label prediction. The output from each attention head consists of hidden states generated for every token in the sequence. For our analysis, we specifically use the hidden state of the last token preceding the prediction of label names, interpreting it as the most direct contribution of the attention head to the prediction, given the autoregressive nature of LLMs.

Specifically, to obtain the label logits for an attention head, consider the output hidden states \(H\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}\) of this head, the unembedding matrix \(E\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d_{e}}\), and the label token mapping matrix \(L\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d_{e}}\). Given the token position \(p_{\text{label}}\in\{0,1,\dots,N-1\}\), which indicates the index of the first token of the predicted label names, the label logits \(\mathbf{a}^{(k)}=[a_{1}^{(k)},a_{2}^{(k)},\dots,a_{c}^{(k)}]^{\top}\) of the attention head for the \(k\)-th sample are derived by:

\[\mathbf{a}^{(k)}=H_{(p_{\text{label}}-1),:}\cdot E\cdot L^{\top}.\]we employ the same \(p\) unlabeled samples from the task to assess the criteria for identifying biased attention head. The label logits for these samples are formed as \(A=[\mathbf{a}^{(0)},\mathbf{a}^{(2)},\ldots,\mathbf{a}^{(m-1)}]^{\top}\in\mathbb{ R}^{m\times c}\). An attention head is considered biased if it meets the following conditions:

\[\begin{cases}\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Sum}\left(A_{k,:}\right)=\frac{1} {p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Sum}\left(\mathbf{a}^{(k)}\right)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k= 0}^{p-1}\sum_{j=1}^{c}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{(k)}>th_{Att}^{1}\\ \frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\text{Bias}\left(A_{k,:}\right)=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k= 0}^{p-1}\text{Bias}\left(\mathbf{a}^{(k)}\right)=\frac{1}{p}\frac{1}{c}\sum_{ k=0}^{p-1}\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}\left(a_{j}^{(k)}-\mu(\mathbf{a}^{(k)})\right)>th_{Att}^{2}\\ \sum_{j=0}^{c-1}w_{j}\cdot CV\left(A_{,:}\right)=w_{j}\cdot\frac{\sigma(A_{,: })}{\mu(A_{,:})}<th_{Att}^{3}\end{cases}\]

where \(w_{j}=\sum_{j=0}^{c-1}\frac{\mu(A_{,:})}{\sum\mu(A_{,:})}\), \(\mu(A_{,:})=\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}A_{,:}\), \(\sigma(A_{,:})=\sqrt{\frac{1}{p}\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}(A_{,:}-\mu(A_{,:}))^{2}}\).

The functions of the first two criteria are identical to those for biased FFN vector identification. The third function is the weighted sum of the coefficient variance of each label across test samples. The thresholds for biased attention head identification are also derived by grid search.

### Biased FFN Vectors and Attention Heads Manipulation

After identifying the biased components of the LLM, we eliminate their influence by masking these biased FFN vectors and attention heads. Specifically, we create masks for the attention heads in each attention layer and reset the coefficient of the biased FFN vector and biased attention head mask.

### Grid Searching

Specifically, we utilize a small subset of training data as a support set, with 20 samples for each class. We then grid search all combinations of threshold values and select the combination that results in the most balanced distribution of average label logits. Specifically, let \(\mathbf{T}\) represents the set of threshold combinations, and \(P(t)\) denote the average label logits for a threshold combination \(t\in\mathbf{T}\), we aim to find the combination \(t^{*}\) that minimizes the bias of label logits: \(t^{*}=\arg\min_{t\in\mathbf{T}}\text{Bias}(\mathbf{P}(t))\).

It is noteworthy that although there are multiple combinations of thresholds, they usually result in a few set of different biased components. For example, for a grid search of thresholds of FFN vectors with 80 combinations, it only result in 4 different sets of biased FFN vectors that need to be examined with the support set on the SST-2 dataset. Additionally, during the inference stage of evaluating test samples, the computation time of the UniBias method is completely identical to that of the original LLMs.

Additionally, the support set can be replaced with unlabeled samples, using approximately twice the number of unlabeled samples compared to labeled ones. For further details, please see Appendix F.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we aims to investigate a few research questions (RQ). **RQ 1**: After eliminating biased components from LLMs, does the ICL performance improve compared to the original LLM? Additionally, how does our UniBias method compare to existing calibration methods? **RQ 2**: Given that ICL suffers from prompt brittleness, can our UniBias method contribute to more robust ICL performance? **RQ 3**: Are there any observable patterns of biased FFN vectors and attention heads within and across tasks? **RQ 4**: What is the performance of LLMs after eliminating only the biased FFN vectors and only the biased attention heads, respectively? **RQ 5**: What is the impact of support set size on the performance of the UniBias method?

### Experimental Setup

DatasetsWe evaluate our UniBias method on 12 diverse natural language processing datasets across various tasks, including sentiment analysis, topic classification, natural language inference, reasoning, and word disambiguation. Statistics and details about the datasets can be found in Table 4 in Appendix.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

### Alleviating Prompt Brittleness

Existing studies have found that LLMs are prone to prompt brittleness, with various factors such as the selection and order of examples, as well as the prompt formatting. To address **RQ 2**, we simulate these brittle scenarios by choosing different demonstration samples, using different prompt formats, and changing the example order to observe variations in LLM performance.

Figure 1 presents Llama-2 7b's performance both with and without UniBias. Without UniBias, the standard ICL's performance varies significantly, ranging from 8% to 26%, demonstrating its instability. After applying UniBias, the accuracy remains consistently high and stable, with variations consistently less than 4% under perturbations of various design settings. We provide further theoretical analysis on why UniBias can mitigate prompt brittleness and address various bias factors in Appendix G.

### Biased Components Analysis and Common Biased Components Elimination

In response to **RQ3**, we present the frequency counts of identified biased attention heads (AHs) and FFNs under repeated experiments in Figure 6. A large frequency count for an LLM component indicates a higher repeat of being identified as biased in the corresponding dataset. The first subfigure displays the biased components for various example selections, revealing several commonly biased LLM components across different prompts within a single dataset. The second subfigure highlights the common biased components across different datasets (ARC and MMLU) for the reasoning task, indicating that different datasets with similar tasks could share common biased LLM components. The third subfigure demonstrates the presence of common biased LLM components across different tasks.

Experimental results suggest an interesting future direction: we may identify global biased components that would mitigate bias across multiple tasks and diverse prompt design settings. We conduct an preliminary experiment to explore the potential of eliminating common biased components. Specifically, we eliminate attention heads that are frequently identified as biased and apply this setting to diverse tasks, rather than handling each task individually. Experimental results in Table 2 demonstrate that although not as effective as our full Unibias method, eliminating common biased components outperforms the vanilla ICL by a large margin. Experiment details are in Appendix D.

### Ablations

We conduct ablation studies to analyze the impact of exclusively eliminating biased AHs or FFNs to address **RQ 4**. Table 3 presents the results of removing only biased FFN vectors (FFN-only) and only

biased attention heads (attention-only). Both FFN-only and attention-only methods outperform the standard ICL, demonstrating their effectiveness. When combined as UniBias, the method achieves the best results across most datasets, indicating that the two approaches are complementary.

Additionally, we further conduct experiments to investigate the impact of support set size (**RQ 5**), which is detailed in Appendix E.

## 5 Related Work

Bias in LLMs: It is well recognized that LLMs are unstable under various ICL design settings, and this instability arises from biases in LLMs toward predicting certain answers (Zhao et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2022). To understand these biases, existing studies have identified various bias factors, including recency bias, majority label bias, common token bias (Zhao et al., 2021), and domain label bias (Fei et al., 2023) in classification tasks. More recently, selection bias, which consistently favors specific options in multiple-choice questions, has also been identified (Zheng et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023b). To address these biases, several calibration methods have been proposed, including contextual calibration (Zhao et al., 2021), domain-context calibration (Fei et al., 2023), and prototypical calibration (Han et al., 2023). However, these identified bias factors and calibration methods are derived from external observations or adjustments of LLM outputs, leaving the underlying mechanisms within LLMs that cause such biases poorly understood.

Prompt Brittleness: Regarding prompt brittleness, it is demonstrated in the literature that this instability of prompt arises from LLMs' inherent bias towards predicting certain answers (Zhao et al., 2021). Therefore, current research efforts address the prompt brittleness by mitigating LLMs' bias towards labels (Fei et al., 2023; Han et al., 2023; Zhao et al., 2021).

Mechanistic Interpretability: Mechanistic interpretability (Elhage et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022) aims to explain the internal processes in language models, facilitating the interpretation of the contributions of individual model components to the final prediction. Our work builds on the understanding of the residual stream (Elhage et al., 2021), the logit lens (Nostalgebraist, 2020), and the interpretation of LLM components in the vocabulary space (Dar et al., 2023; Geva et al., 2021).

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we have deepened the understanding of biases in LLMs by unveiling the internal mechanisms that contribute to various bias factors. Building on this understanding, we proposed our UniBias method to mitigate these biases by identifying and eliminating biased FFN vectors and attention heads, demonstrating an effective way to manipulate the internal structures of LLMs. Extensive experiments show that our UniBias method achieves state-of-the-art performance across 12 NLP datasets and different ICL settings. Additionally, our method successfully alleviates prompt brittleness and enhances the robustness of ICL.

Experimental Details

### Datasets

We evaluate our Unibias method using 12 diverse natural language processing datasets across tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic classification, reasoning, natural language inference, and word disambiguation, as presented in Table 4. In our experiments, we utilize \(k\) (where \(k=0,1,2,4\)) training samples per class as prompt examples for \(k\)-shot ICL. For testing, we randomly select 2000 samples for MMLU and 3000 samples for MNLI and MR, while employing the original testing sets for other datasets. Detailed dataset statistics are available in Table 4.

### Implementation Details

**Experiments on internal mechanisms of biased factors**: All experiments are conducted on Llama-2 7b model. For the vanilla label bias experiment, we projecting all FFN value vectors into the vocabulary space and sum the label logits for all FFN vectors whose label logits rank within the top \(10\) over the vocabulary to calculate uncontextual accumulated FFN logits. We change different set of label words in prompt to derive the label prediction frequency of different label pairs. For the recency bias experiment, based on findings in [Wang et al., 2023a], instead of the summed attention weights over the whole example, we adopt the sum of attention weights on label words of the example, e.g. "Answer: positive" as the effective attention weight on each example. For the selection bias experiment, we use zeroshot ARC dataset prompts in Table 8, and we use 12 samples for each class. The attention weight is also summed on label words instead of the whole option.

**Baselines**: We reproduce all baselines using the publicly available code released by the authors to ensure a fair comparison. For the PC method, instead of using test samples as in the original work, we employ 200 training samples per class as the estimate set for parameter estimation using the EM algorithm. This adjustment is made to reflect real-world scenarios where test samples are not readily available. Additionally, the number of samples used by the PC method is significantly larger than that used by our UniBias method.

**Unibias**: In our method, all threshold values are determined through grid searching as described in the methodology section. Specifically, we use 20 samples per class as the support set for grid searching in all experiments. For each repetition of the experiment, the support set is randomly selected based on different random seeds. Additionally, to manipulate biased FFN vectors and attention heads, we create masks for the attention heads of all attention layers and adjust the FFN coefficient values and attention head masks using the hook operation. Additionally, we conduct the experiment on four A5000 GPUs.

## Appendix B Limitation and Future Work

In this work, we provide a novel insight into the internal mechanisms behind the bias of LLMs. As a pioneering effort in mitigating LLM bias through manipulation of the model's internal structures, our approach relies on grid searching with a small set of labeled training samples. Future research could focus on reducing this reliance, potentially improving the efficiency and applicability of our method.

There are many interesting avenues for future research. For instance, instead of identifying biased components for each ICL prompt, future work could explore the identification of global biased components that mitigate bias across multiple tasks and diverse prompt design settings. Additionally, the biased FFN vectors and attention heads we identify could potentially serve as sensors for guiding effective prompt generation. We expect that this internal perspective on LLM bias will inspire more innovative applications in both bias mitigation methods and prompt engineering.

## Appendix C Evaluation on More LLMs

Figure 7 demonstrates the performance of various methods across multiple datasets when applied to GPT-J and GPT2-XL models. For both models, our UniBias method consistently outperforms the baseline methods including vanilla ICL, CC, DC and PC. Notably, the improvement on the GPT2-XL model is substantial, demonstrating over an over \(20\%\) increase in accuracy on SST-2 dataset compared to vanilla ICL.

## Appendix D Eliminating Common Biased Components

We explore the potential of eliminating common biased components and apply it to diverse tasks, rather than addressing each task individually. We conduct additional experiments on multiple tasks to assess the effectiveness of directly eliminate these components. Experimental results in Table 2 indicate that although not as effective as our full Unibias method, it outperforms the vanilla ICL by a large margin. Notably, eliminating common biased components represents cost-free gain in performance, as it involves only the direct masking of biased components identified in our work and is applicable to diverse tasks. The attention heads that are masked are listed in Table 5.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r r r r} \hline \hline \((19,10)\) & \((19,14)\) & \((16,29)\) & \((19,21)\) & \((25,21)\) & \((16,11)\) & \((18,31)\) & \((18,1)\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: List of common biased attention heads eliminated. Indexing Starts from 0.

Figure 7: Performance comparison of our UniBias method against baseline methods using GPT-J and GPT2-XL models.

## Appendix E Impact of Support Set Size

Our proposed UniBias method employs a small support set for grid searching. To analyze its effect, we vary the size of the support set. Figure 7 illustrates Unibias's performance with support set sizes ranging from 5 to 50 samples. The results indicate that the performance stabilizes when the support set contains 20 or more samples per class. Notably, for the SST2 dataset, even with much fewer support samples, Unibias significantly outperforms the standard ICL.

## Appendix F Using Unlabeled Samples for Support Set

To Address the potential challenge in accessing labeled samples, we further explore the alternative of using unlabeled samples during grid search. In our method, labeled samples are used to ensure each class is represented proportionally in the grid search, without direct use of the specific label information. Therefore, for balanced datasets, it is equally effective to employ a slight larger pool of unlabeled samples.

Our experimental findings, illustrated in Figure 9 of the rebuttal PDF, indicate that approximately \(40\times\#Classes\) unlabeled samples achieves performance comparable to that obtained with labeled samples.

## Appendix G Additional Analysis

We further analyze why mitigating model's bias towards labels can alleviate prompt brittleness in our method. Due to the inherent bias of LLMs, different prompts can lead to varying biases towards labels. For example, due to recency bias, placing a negative sentiment analysis sample at the end of a prompt can make LLMs tend to predict 'negative', incorrectly classifying positive samples and thus degrading ICL performance. Various bias factors lead to different direction and extend of bias, resulting in different changes in ICL performance and leading to the prompt brittleness. In contrast, our UniBias method effectively mitigates various potential biases inherent in LLMs by addressing their root causes internally from LLMs. By doing so, it minimizes the introduction of bias towards labels regardless of the difference in prompts, leading to more stable and accurate ICL performance across different prompt configurations.

Additionally, our UniBias method seeks to address a broad range of factors that lead to LLM bias, extending beyond those discussed in Section 2. Given the significant variability in prompts, models, and data corpuses, numerous unanticipated bias factors may emerge. Our approach is designed totackle these diverse bias factors comprehensively. This is feasible because biased behaviors observed externally in LLMs originate from their internal components--specifically, the feedforward neural network (FFN) vectors and attention heads, which house nearly all LLM parameters. By directly identifying and mitigating biases within these FFN vectors and attention heads, UniBias offers a foundational strategy to counteract various forms of bias.

## Appendix H Prompt Templates

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We believe the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect our paper's contributions and scope. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Section 3 and Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will release our code upon acceptance to facilitate easy reproduction. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: p-value less than 0.01 is derived on our main experiment. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We believe our research conform NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: They are properly credited. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer:[NA] Justification: Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer:[NA] Justification: Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer:[NA] Justification: Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
