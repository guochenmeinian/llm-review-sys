###### Abstract

This paper studies a risk minimization problem with decision dependent data distribution. The problem pertains to the performative prediction setting in which a trained model can affect the outcome estimated by the model. Such dependency creates a feedback loop that influences the stability of optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent (SGD). We present the first study on performative prediction with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We analyze a greedy deployment scheme with SGD (SGD-GD). Note that in the literature, SGD-GD is often studied with strongly convex loss. We first propose the definition of stationary performative stable (SPS) solutions through relaxing the popular performative stable condition. We then prove that SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution in expectation. We consider two conditions of sensitivity on the distribution shifts: (i) the sensitivity is characterized by Wasserstein-1 distance and the loss is Lipschitz w.r.t. data samples, or (ii) the sensitivity is characterized by total variation (TV) divergence and the loss is bounded. In both conditions, the bias levels are proportional to the stochastic gradient's variance and sensitivity level. Our analysis is extended to a lazy deployment scheme where models are deployed once per several SGD updates, and we show that it converges to an SPS solution with reduced bias. Numerical experiments corroborate our theories.

## 1 Introduction

When trained models are deployed in social contexts, the outcomes these models aim to predict can be influenced by the models themselves. Taking email spam detection as an example. On one hand, email service providers design filters to protect their users by identifying spam emails. On the other hand, spammers aim to circumvent these filters to distribute malware and advertisements. Each time a new classifier is deployed, spammers who are interspersed within the general population may alter the characteristics of their messages to evade detection. The above example pertains to the strategic classification problem [1, 1, 2, 16, 17] and can be modelled by dataset shifts [14].

The scenarios described can be captured by the recently proposed performative prediction problem, which called the above dataset shift phenomena as the 'performative' effect. Perdomo et al. [1] proposed to study the risk minimization problem with a _decision-dependent_ data distribution:

\[\min_{\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}}\ V(\bm{\theta}):=\mathbb{E}_{Z \sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})}[\ell(\bm{\theta};Z)],\] (1)

where \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is a loss function that is continuously differentiable with respect to (w.r.t.) \(\bm{\theta}\) for any given data sample \(z\in\mathsf{Z}\), and \(\mathsf{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{p}\) is the sample space. The dependence on \(\bm{\theta}\) in \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) explicitly captures the distribution shift effect of prediction models on data samples. The objective function \(V(\bm{\theta})\) is also known as the performative risk.

The decision variable \(\bm{\theta}\) in (1) affects simultaneously the distribution and the loss function. As such, optimizing \(V(\bm{\theta})\) directly is often difficult. Mendler-Dunner et al. (2020) considered the following stochastic gradient (SGD) recursion: for any \(t\geq 0\) and let \(\gamma_{t+1}>0\) be a stepsize,

\[\bm{\theta}_{t+1}=\bm{\theta}_{t}-\gamma_{t+1}\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+ 1}),\text{ where }Z_{t+1}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t}).\] (2)

The above is known as the _greedy deployment_ scheme with SGD (SGD-GD), where the learner deploys the current trained model \(\bm{\theta}_{t}\) before drawing samples from \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\). The SGD-GD scheme describes a training procedure when the learner is _unaware of the performative phenomena_ with the data distribution \(\mathcal{D}(\cdot)\), which is plausible in many applications. Relevant studies to (2) include lazy deployment where the learner deploys a new model only once every few iterations, or repeated risk minimization; see Mendler-Dunner et al. (2020); Perdomo et al. (2020).

Existing convergence analysis of (2) are limited to the case when \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is _strongly convex_1 w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\). Perdomo et al. (2020) introduced the concept of _performative stable_ (PS) solution as the unique minimizer of (1) with fixed distribution. The PS solution, while being different from an optimal or stationary solution to (1), is shown to be the unique limit point of the recursion (2) provided that the sensitivity of the distribution map \(\mathcal{D}(\cdot)\), measured w.r.t. the Wasserstein-1 (\(W_{1}\)) distance, is upper bounded by a factor proportional to the strong convexity modulus of \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\)Mendler-Dunner et al. (2020). Furthermore, such convergence condition is proven to be tight Perdomo et al. (2020) and the analysis has been extended to proximal algorithm Drusvyatskiy and Xiao (2023), online optimization Cutler et al. (2023), saddle point seeking Wood and Dall'Anese (2023), multi-agent consensus learning Li et al. (2022), non-cooperative learning Wang et al. (2023); Narang et al. (2023); Piliouras and Yu (2023), state-dependent learning Brown et al. (2022); Li and Wai (2022), etc.

Footnote 1: Note that \(V(\bm{\theta})\) is still non-convex.

This paper provides the _first analysis_ of SGD-GD and related stochastic optimization schemes in performative prediction when \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is _smooth but possibly non-convex_. This is a more common scenario in machine learning than the strongly convex loss considered in the prior works, e.g., it covers the case of training neural network (NN) models. We notice that existing works are limited to imposing structure on the loss function \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) and the distribution \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\), utilizing advanced algorithms that demand extra knowledge on \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\), etc., as we overview below.

**Related Works.** In the non-convex setting, the most related work to ours is (Mofakhami et al., 2023) which proved that a variant of PS solution can be found when training NN in the performative prediction setting, i.e., a special case with non-convex loss. However, their analysis is restrictive: (i) it requires a loss function of the form \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)=\tilde{\ell}(f_{\bm{\theta}}(x);y)\) where \(\tilde{\ell}(\hat{y};y)\) is strongly convex w.r.t. \(\hat{y}\), (ii) it only analyzes the case of training NN using a repeated risk minimization (RRM) procedure which _exactly_ minimizes a non-convex objective function at each step. In comparison, we concentrate on stochastic (first order) optimization schemes and require only smoothness for \(\ell(\cdot;z)\).

Table 1: **Comparison of Results in Existing Works**. ‘Sensitivity’ indicates the distance metric imposed on \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) when the latter is subject to perturbation, given in the form \(d(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}))\leq\epsilon\| \bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\|\) such that \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is a distance metric between distributions. ‘\(\theta_{\infty}\)’ indicates the type of convergent points: ‘PS’ refers to performative stable solution [cf. (4)], ‘SPS’ refers to Def. 1.

Other works departed from tackling the PS solution and considered alternative algorithms to directly minimize \(V(\bm{\theta})\). For example, Roy et al. (2022) assumed that unbiased estimates of \(\nabla V(\bm{\theta})\) is available and studied the convergence of stochastic conditional gradient algorithms towards a stationary solution of \(V(\bm{\theta})\), Li and Wai (2022) assumed bounded biasedness w.r.t. \(\nabla V(\bm{\theta})\) in (2) and show that (2) converges to a biased stationary point of \(V(\bm{\theta})\). Notice that estimating \(\nabla V(\bm{\theta})\) requires knowledge on \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) which has to be learnt separately. To circumvent this difficulty, two phases algorithms are studied in Miller et al. (2021); Izzo et al. (2021) that learn \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) via a large batch of samples at the first stage, then optimize \(\bm{\theta}\) later (see Zhu et al. (2023) for a two-timescale type online algorithm), derivative free optimization are studied in Miller et al. (2021); Ray et al. (2022); Liu et al. (2023), and confidence bound methods in Jagadeesan et al. (2022). In addition, Miller et al. (2021) proposed a mixture dominance assumption that can imply the strong convexity of \(V(\bm{\theta})\). We remark that Zhao (2022) studied conditions to ensure \(V(\bm{\theta})\) to be weakly convex. Our work does not require such advanced algorithms and show that stochastic (first order) optimization converges towards a similar solution as the PS solution. We display a comparison between these related works in Table 1.

**Our Contributions**: This work provides the _first_ analysis of stochastic gradient-based methods for performative prediction with smooth but possibly _non-convex_ losses. Our contributions are:

* We propose the concept of _stationary performative stable_ (SPS) solutions which is a relaxation of the commonly used performative stable (PS) condition Perdomo et al. (2020). The relaxation is necessary for handling non-convex losses using first-order methods.
* We show that the stochastic gradient method with greedy deployment (SGD-GD) finds a biased SPS solution. Assume that the distribution shift is \(\epsilon\)-sensitive, i.e., it holds \(d(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}))\leq\epsilon\| \bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\|\) for some distance measure \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) between the shifted distributions \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime})\), SGD-GD converges at a rate of \(\mathcal{O}(T^{-\frac{1}{2}})\) in expectation to an \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\)-SPS solution. The bias level is further improved to \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2})\) when the gradient is exact.
* Our analysis relies on constructing a time varying Lyapunov function that may shed new lights for non-gradient stochastic approximation Dieuleveut et al. (2023). We studied two alternative conditions on the distance metric between distributions. When \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the Wasserstein-1 distance, SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution for Lipschitz loss function. When \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the total variation (TV) distance, SGD-GD converges to a biased SPS solution for bounded loss function.
* We extend the analysis to the lazy deployment scheme with SGD Mendler-Dunner et al. (2020). The latter scheme finds an _SPS solution with reduced bias_ as the epoch length of lazy deployment grows.

Lastly, we provide numerical examples on synthetic and real data to validate our theoretical findings. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. SS2 introduces the problem setup and assumptions for establishing our convergence results of SGD-GD. Furthermore, we highlight the challenges in analyzing non-convex performative prediction. SS3 introduces the concept of SPS solutions and presents the convergence results for SGD-GD under two alternative assumptions on the distribution shifts. We also outline the use of a time varying Lyapunov function to handle the dynamic nature of SGD-GD. SS4 shows the results for the lazy deployment scheme. Lastly, SS5 provides numerical experiments to illustrate our results.

**Notations.** Let \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\) be the \(d\)-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with inner product \(\langle\cdot\,|\,\cdot\rangle\) and induced norm \(\|x\|=\sqrt{\langle x\,|\,x\rangle}\). Let \(\mathcal{S}\) be a (measurable) sample space, and \(\mu,\nu\) are two probability measures defined as \(\mathcal{S}\). \(\mathbb{E}[\cdot]\) denotes taking expectation w.r.t all randomness, \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\cdot]:=\mathbb{E}_{t}[\cdot|\mathcal{F}_{t}]\) means taking conditional expectation on the filtration \(\mathcal{F}_{t}:=\sigma(\{\bm{\theta}_{0},\bm{\theta}_{1},\cdots,\bm{\theta}_ {t}\})\), where \(\sigma(\cdot)\) is the sigma-algebra generated by the random variables in the operand and \(\{\bm{\theta}_{t}\}\) is the sequence of iterates generated by the SGD-GD scheme (2).

## 2 Stationary Condition for Performative Stability

This section prepares the analysis of (1) with SGD-GD and related schemes in the non-convex loss setting. To fix idea, we define the decoupled performative risk and the decoupled partial gradient:

\[J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{\theta}_{2})=\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{ 2})}\left[\ell(\bm{\theta}_{1};Z)\right],\quad\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{ \theta}_{2})=\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2})}\left[\nabla\ell( \bm{\theta}_{1};Z)\right].\] (3)Observe that while \(V(\bm{\theta})=J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})\), \(\nabla J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})\neq\nabla V(\bm{\theta})\) in general since \(\nabla J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})\) only represents a partial gradient of \(V(\bm{\theta})\); see (Izzo et al., 2021). In (2), the conditional expectation of the stochastic gradient update term satisfies \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})]=\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t} ;\bm{\theta}_{t})\).

If the loss \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is strongly convex w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\), then the decoupled performative risk \(J(\bm{\theta};\bar{\bm{\theta}})\) admits a unique minimizer w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\) for any \(\bar{\bm{\theta}}\). It has hence motivated (Perdomo et al., 2020) to study the _performative stable_ (PS) solution \(\bar{\bm{\theta}}_{PS}\) which is defined as a fixed point to the map

\[\mathcal{T}(\bar{\bm{\theta}}):=\arg\min_{\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}}J(\bm{ \theta};\bar{\bm{\theta}}),\ \ \text{i.e.,}\ \ \bm{\theta}_{PS}=\mathcal{T}(\bm{\theta}_{PS}).\] (4)

In the above, the uniqueness and existence of \(\bm{\theta}_{PS}\) follows by observing that \(\mathcal{T}(\cdot)\) is a contraction if and only if the sensitivity of \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\), i.e., the'smoothness' of \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\), is upper bounded by the inverse of condition number of \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\). The convergence of SGD-GD follows by analyzing (2) as a stochastic approximation (SA) scheme for the repeated risk minimization (RRM) procedure \(\bm{\theta}\leftarrow\mathcal{T}(\bm{\theta})\)(Mendler-Dunner et al., 2020).

For the case of _non-convex_ loss in this paper, the analysis becomes more nuanced since the map \(\mathcal{T}(\cdot)\) is no longer well-defined, e.g., there may exist more than one minimizers to \(\min_{\bm{\theta}}J(\bm{\theta};\bar{\bm{\theta}})\). Our remedy is to concentrate on the following non-convex counter part to the PS solution:

**Definition 1**.: _(\(\delta\) **stationary performative stable solution**) Let \(\delta\geq 0\), the vector \(\bm{\theta}_{\delta-SPS}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) is said to be an \(\delta\) stationary performative stable (\(\delta\)-SPS) solution of (1) if:_

\[\left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{\delta-SPS};\bm{\theta}_{\delta-SPS})\right\|^{ 2}=\left\|\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{\delta-SPS})}\left[ \nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{\delta-SPS};Z)\right]\right\|^{2}\leq\delta.\] (5)

We also say that \(\bm{\theta}_{SPS}\) is an (exact) SPS solution if it satisfies (5) with \(\delta=0\). In other words, \(\delta\geq 0\) measures the stationarity of a solution. Notice that if \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is strongly convex w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\), then an SPS solution is also a PS solution defined in (Perdomo et al., 2020).

Although (5) is similar to the usual definitions of stationary solution in smooth optimization, there is a subtle but critical difference since \(\nabla J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})\) may not be the _gradient_ of any function in \(\bm{\theta}\). For example, consider \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)=(1/2)\|\bm{\theta}-z\|^{2}\) and \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\equiv\mathcal{N}(A\bm{\theta},\bm{I})\) for some square but asymmetric matrix \(A\), the map \(\nabla J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})=(I-A)\bm{\theta}\) has a Jacobian of \(I-A\) which is not symmetric. Furthermore, we observe that the mean field for SGD-GD scheme (2) is \(\nabla J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta})\), which is not a gradient. The SGD-GD scheme is thus a special case of non-gradient SA scheme (Dieuleveut et al., 2023).

To get further insight, as investigated in (Dieuleveut et al., 2023), a common analysis framework of non-gradient SA scheme is by identifying a smooth Lyapunov function linked to the recursion (2). When \(\ell(\cdot;z)\) is strongly convex, we may study the Lyapunov functions as the squared distance \(\|\bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}_{PS}\|^{2}\) (cf. (4)). It can be shown that the properties required in (Dieuleveut et al., 2023) are satisfied under the conditions analyzed by (Mendler-Dunner et al., 2020). However, in the case of non-convex loss, identifying a suitable Lyapunov function for non-gradient SA scheme is hard. In the next section, we demonstrate how to address this challenge by identifying a time varying Lyapunov function for SGD-GD.

## 3 Main Results

This section presents theoretical results on the SGD-GD scheme with non-convex loss. We first show how to construct a time varying Lyapunov function tailor made for (2). We then show the convergence of SGD-GD under two different sets of conditions.

We introduce two basic and natural assumptions on the risk minimization problem (1):

**A1**.: _For any \(z\in\mathbb{Z}\), there exists a constant \(L\geq 0\) such that_

\[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta};z)-\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}^{\prime};z)\right\| \leq L\left\|\bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\right\|,\ \forall\ \bm{\theta},\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{d},\] (6)

_where \(\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) denotes the gradient of \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) w.r.t. \(\bm{\theta}\). Moreover, there exists a constant \(\ell^{\star}>-\infty\) such that \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\geq\ell^{\star}\) for any \(\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\)._

**A2**.: _For any fixed \(\bm{\theta}_{1},\bm{\theta}_{2}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), the stochastic gradient \(\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{1};Z)\), \(Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2})\) is unbiased such that \(\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2})}[\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{1};Z)]= \nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{\theta}_{2})\), and there exists constants \(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1}\geq 0\) such that_

\[\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2})}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{ \theta}_{1};Z)-\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{\theta}_{2})\right\|^{2}\right] \leq\sigma_{0}^{2}+\sigma_{1}^{2}\left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{\theta}_{2}) \right\|^{2}.\] (7)Note that A1, 2 are standard assumptions that hold for a wide range of applications and the respective stochastic optimization based training schemes. For instance, A1 requires the loss function to be smooth, while A2 assumes the stochastic gradient estimates to have a variance that may grow with \(\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{1};\bm{\theta}_{2})\|^{2}\). For the _non performative prediction_ setting where the data distribution is not shifted by \(\bm{\theta}\), i.e., \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\equiv\mathcal{D}\), these assumptions guarantee that SGD algorithm (i.e., SGD-GD with \(Z_{t+1}\sim\mathcal{D}\)) to converge to a stationary solution of (1) with a suitable step size schedule (Ghadimi and Lan, 2013). In particular, in this case A1 implies that \(\mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}}[\ell(\bm{\theta};Z)]\) is a smooth function and serves as a Lyapunov function for the SGD algorithm.

In this light, it might be tempting to use the performative risk \(V(\bm{\theta})\) [cf. (1)] as the Lyapunov function for (2) and directly adopt the analysis in (Dieuleveut et al., 2023). However, the condition A1 is insufficient to guarantee that \(V(\bm{\theta})\) is smooth, and the mean field of (2) may not be aligned with \(\nabla V(\bm{\theta})\). Instead, from A1, 2, we proceed with a descent-like lemma for the iterates of SGD-GD:

**Lemma 1**.: _Under A1, 2. Suppose that the step size satisfies \(\sup_{t\geq 1}\gamma_{t}\leq 1/(L(1+\sigma_{1}^{2}))\), then for any \(t\geq 0\), the sequence of iterates \(\{\bm{\theta}_{t}\}_{t\geq 0}\) generated by SGD-GD (2) satisfies_

\[\frac{\gamma_{t+1}}{2}\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2} \leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{ \theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})]+\tfrac{L}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}.\] (8)

Proof.: Fix any \(z\in\mathsf{Z}\), applying A1 and the recursion (2) lead to

\[\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};z)\leq\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};z)-\gamma_{t+1}\left\langle \nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};z)\,|\,\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\rangle +\frac{L\gamma_{t+1}^{2}}{2}\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\| ^{2},\] (9)

for any \(t\geq 0\). Note that \(z\in\mathsf{Z}\) can be any fixed sample while \(Z_{t+1}\) is the r.v. drawn from \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\) in (2). Let \(p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\geq 0\) denotes the pdf of \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\). We then multiply \(p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\) on both sides of the inequality and integrate w.r.t. \(z\in\mathsf{Z}\), i.e., taking the operator \(\int_{\mathsf{Z}}(\cdot)p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\mathrm{d}z\). This yields

\[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})\leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})- \gamma_{t+1}\left\langle\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\,|\,\nabla \ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\rangle+\frac{L\gamma_{t+1}^{2}}{2}\left\| \nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2},\] (10)

since \(\int\ell(\bm{\theta};z)p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\mathrm{d}z=J(\bm{\theta};\bm{ \theta}_{t})\) according to definition (3). We next evaluate the conditional expectation, \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\cdot]\), on both sides of the above inequality

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})]\leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t}; \bm{\theta}_{t})-\gamma_{t+1}\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2 }+\frac{L\gamma_{t+1}^{2}}{2}\mathbb{E}_{t}[\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+ 1})\|^{2}].\] (11)

Using A2, we note that \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2}]\leq \sigma_{0}^{2}+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\| ^{2}\). Reshuffling terms and using the step size condition yield the desired result (8); see SSA for a detailed proof. 

For sufficiently small \(\gamma_{t+1}>0\) and when \(\bm{\theta}_{t}\) is not SPS, eq. (8) implies the descent relation \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})]<J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{ \theta}_{t})\). This suggests that at the \(t\)th iteration, the function \(J_{t}(\bm{\theta}):=J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{t})\) may serve as a Lyapunov function for the SGD-GD scheme. Meanwhile, \(J_{t}(\bm{\theta})\) is a _time varying_ Lyapunov function. The said descent relation does not necessarily imply the convergence towards an SPS solution. Instead, the first term on the right hand side of (8) can be decomposed as:

\[\mathbb{E}[J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t})-J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]=\mathbb{E}[J_{t}(\bm {\theta}_{t})-J_{t+1}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]+\underbrace{\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}(\bm{ \theta}_{t+1})-J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]}_{\text{residual}}.\] (12)

The first part is a difference-of-sequence which is summable, while the second part is a residual term. The convergence of SGD-GD with non-convex losses hinges on bounding the latter residual. Taking a closer look, the residual is the difference of evaluating \(\bm{\theta}_{t+1}\) on \(J_{t}(\cdot)\) and \(J_{t+1}(\cdot)\), i.e.,

\[\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})-J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]=\mathbb{E}\left[ \mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t}),Z^{\prime}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{ \theta}_{t+1})}[\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};Z^{\prime})-\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};Z)] \right].\] (13)

The above further depends on the differences between the distributions \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})\), i.e., the _sensitivity_ of the data distribution w.r.t. perturbation in \(\bm{\theta}\). Next, we study sufficient conditions that imply the convergence of SGD-GD through bounding \(\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})-J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]\).

### Sufficient Conditions for Convergence of SGD-GD

From (8), we anticipate the convergence of SGD-GD towards a biased SPS solution if it holds \(\mathbb{E}[J_{t+1}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})-J_{t}(\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]=\mathcal{O}( \mathbb{E}[\|\bm{\theta}_{t}-\bm{\theta}_{t+1}\|])=\mathcal{O}(\gamma_{t+1} \mathbb{E}[\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\|])\). Now, as seen from (13), establishing such relation would require \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) to satisfy a certain sensitivity criterion when subject to perturbation in \(\bm{\theta}\). Our subsequent discussions are organized according to various distributional distance measures on sensitivity.

**Wasserstein-1 Sensitivity.** Our first set of conditions uses the Wasserstein-1 distance for measuring the sensitivity of data distribution. The measure is commonly used in the studies of performative prediction, e.g., as pioneered by (Perdomo et al., 2020; Mendler-Dunner et al., 2020):

**W1**.: _(\(\epsilon\) sensitivity w.r.t. Wasserstein-1 distance) There exists \(\epsilon\geq 0\) such that_

\[W_{1}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}))\leq \epsilon\|\bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\|,\] (14)

_for any \(\bm{\theta},\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\). Notice that the Wasserstein-1 distance is defined as \(W_{1}(\cdot,\cdot):=\inf_{P\in\mathcal{P}(\cdot,\cdot)}\mathbb{E}_{(z,z^{ \prime})\sim P}\left[\|z-z^{\prime}\|_{1}\right]\), where \(\mathcal{P}\left(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}\left(\bm{\theta}^{ \prime}\right)\right)\) is the set of all joint distributions on \(\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\) whose marginal distributions are \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}\left(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\right)\)._

In this case, we require the loss function to be Lipschitz continuous w.r.t. shifts in the data sample \(z\).

**W2**.: _There exists a constant \(L_{0}>0\) such that for all \(z,z^{\prime}\in\mathbb{Z}\), and \(\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\),_

\[|\ell(\bm{\theta};z)-\ell(\bm{\theta};z^{\prime})|\leq L_{0}\left\|z-z^{ \prime}\right\|.\] (15)

Our key observation is that the above conditions imply the desired Lipschitz continuity property on \(J(\bm{\theta};\cdot)\). In fact, we have:

**Lemma 2**.: _Under W1, 2. For any \(\bm{\theta}_{1},\bm{\theta}_{2},\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), it holds_

\[|J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{1})-J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{2})|\leq L_{0} \epsilon\left\|\bm{\theta}_{1}-\bm{\theta}_{2}\right\|.\] (16)

The proof, which is a variant of (Drusvyatskiy and Xiao, 2023, Lemma 2.1), can be found in SSB.

**TV distance Sensitivity.** Although W1 holds for a number of applications, such as the location family distributions (e.g., (Miller et al., 2021; Perdomo et al., 2020; Narang et al., 2023)), the assumption of Lipschitz loss function in W2 can be difficult to verify, especially if we want \(L_{0}\) (and thus the Lipschitz continuity constant of \(\ell(\bm{\theta};\cdot)\) given by \(L_{0}\epsilon\)) to be small. As an alternative, we consider a slightly stronger sensitivity condition on \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) via the total variation (TV) distance.

**C1**.: _(\(\epsilon\) sensitivity w.r.t. TV distance) For any \(\bm{\theta},\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), there exists a constant \(\epsilon\geq 0\) such that_

\[\delta_{TV}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{1}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2}))\leq \epsilon\left\|\bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\right\|,\] (17)

_where \(\delta_{TV}(\cdot,\cdot)\) is the total variation distance defined as \(\delta_{TV}(\mu,\nu):=\sup_{A\subset\mathbb{Z}}|\mu(A)-\nu(A)|=\frac{1}{2}\int |p_{\mu}(z)-p_{\nu}(z)|\,\mathrm{d}z\) such that \(\mu,\nu\) are two probability measures supported on \(\mathbb{Z}\) and \(p_{(\cdot)}(z)\) denotes their probability distribution functions (p.d.f.s)._

Although C1 is slightly strengthened from W1, it allows us to relax the Lipschitz continuity assumption W2 on the loss. Particularly, we consider replacing W2 by:

**C2**.: _There exists a constant \(\ell_{max}\geq 0\) such that \(\sup_{\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d},z\in\mathbb{Z}}|\ell(\bm{\theta};z)|\leq \ell_{max}\)._

The above condition requires \(\ell(\cdot;\cdot)\) to be uniformly bounded. Compared to W2, it can be easier to verify and \(\ell_{max}\) is typically small. For example, it holds with \(\ell_{max}=1\) for the case of sigmoid loss.

Similar to W1, 2, we observe that the above conditions imply \(J(\bm{\theta};\cdot)\) is Lipschitz continuous:

**Lemma 3**.: _Under C1, 2. For any \(\bm{\theta}_{1},\bm{\theta}_{2},\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), it holds that_

\[|J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{1})-J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{2})|\leq 2\ell_{ max}\epsilon\left\|\bm{\theta}_{1}-\bm{\theta}_{2}\right\|.\] (18)

See SSC. The only difference with Lemma 2 is that (18) has a different Lipschitz constant.

**Remark 1**.: _It is worth noting that in lieu of C1, Mofakhami et al. (2023) assumed the following sensitivity condition with respect to the Pearson \(\chi^{2}\) divergence, i.e.,_

\[\chi^{2}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime})):=\int\frac {(p_{\bm{\theta}}(z)-p_{\bm{\theta}^{\prime}}(z))^{2}}{p_{\bm{\theta}}(z)} \mathrm{d}z=\mathcal{O}(\|f_{\bm{\theta}}(\cdot)-f_{\bm{\theta}^{\prime}}( \cdot)\|^{2})\] (19)_where \(f_{\bm{\theta}}(\cdot)\) represents the output of a neural network parameterized by \(\bm{\theta}\), \(p_{\bm{\theta}}(\cdot)\) and \(p_{\bm{\theta}^{\prime}}(\cdot)\) are the probability density functions (p.d.f.s) of the induced distributions \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) and \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime})\), respectively._

_Our TV distance sensitivity condition in C1 constitutes a weaker condition since for any bounded sample space \(\mathsf{Z}\), the following holds:_

\[W_{1}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}))\leq\mathrm{ diam}(\mathsf{Z})\cdot\delta_{TV}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{ \theta}^{\prime}))\leq\frac{\mathrm{diam}(\mathsf{Z})}{2}\sqrt{\chi^{2}( \mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}))},\]

_as shown in (Gibbs and Su, 2002, Sec. 2), where \(\mathrm{diam}(\mathsf{Z}):=\sup_{z,z^{\prime}\in\mathsf{Z}}\|z-z^{\prime}\|\) denotes the diameter of the sample space._

### Convergence of SGD-GD with Non-convex Loss

Equipped with Lemmas 2, 3, we are ready to present the convergence result for SGD-GD with smooth but non-convex losses. Observe the following theorem whose proof can be found in SSD:

**Theorem 1**.: _Under A1, 2. Let the step sizes satisfy \(\sup_{t\geq 1}\gamma_{t}\leq 1/(L(1+\sigma_{1}^{2}))\). Moreover, let_

\[\tilde{L}=L_{0}\ \ \text{if \ W1, 2 hold},\ \ \text{or}\ \ \tilde{L}=2\ell_{max}\ \ \text{if \ C1, 2 hold}.\] (20)

_Then, for any \(T\geq 1\), the iterates \(\{\bm{\theta}_{t}\}_{t\geq 0}\) generated by SGD-GD satisfy_

\[\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\frac{\gamma_{t+1}}{4}\mathbb{E}[\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t}; \bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}]\leq\Delta_{0}+\tilde{L}\epsilon\left(\sigma_{0}+(1+ \sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right)\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\gamma_{t+1}+\frac{L}{ 2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\gamma_{t+1}^{2},\] (21)

_where \(\Delta_{0}:=J(\bm{\theta}_{0};\bm{\theta}_{0})-\ell_{\star}\) is an upper bound to the initial optimality gap of performance risk._

Using a fixed step size schedule, we simplify the bound as:

**Corollary 1**.: _Under A1, 2, the alternative conditions W1, 2, or C1, 2. Let \(T\geq 1\) be the maximum number of iterations and set \(\gamma_{t}=1/\sqrt{T}\). Let \(\mathsf{T}\) be a random variable chosen uniformly and independently from \(\{0,1,\cdots,T-1\}\). For any \(T\geq L^{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})^{2}\), the iterates by SGD-GD satisfy_

\[\mathbb{E}\left[\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{\mathsf{T}};\bm{\theta}_{\mathsf{T}}) \|^{2}\right]\leq 4\left(\Delta_{0}+\frac{L}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\right)\cdot \frac{1}{\sqrt{T}}+\underbrace{4\tilde{L}\epsilon\left(\sigma_{0}+(1+\sigma_{1 }^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right)}_{\mathbf{bias}}.\] (22)

As \(T\to\infty\), the first term in (22) vanishes as \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})\) and the above shows that the SGD-GD scheme finds an \(\mathcal{O}(\sigma_{0}\,\epsilon+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\,\epsilon^{2})\)-SPS solution. This yields the first convergence guarantee for performative prediction with non-convex loss via a stochastic optimization scheme.

Lastly, an interesting observation is that the bias level is controlled at \(\mathcal{O}(\sigma_{0}\,\epsilon+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\,\epsilon^{2})\). The latter estimate highlights the role of the stochastic gradient's variance. To see this, let us concentrate on the case when \(\epsilon\) is small. When stochastic gradient is used such that \(\sigma_{0}>0\), SGD-GD finds an \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\)-SPS solution; while with deterministic gradient, i.e., when \(\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})=\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\) with \(\sigma_{0}=\sigma_{1}=0\), SGD-GD finds an \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2})\)-SPS solution. Such a distinction in the bias levels indicate that a _unique property_ of non-convex performative prediction where the asymptotic performance of SGD-GD is sensitive to the stochastic gradient's noise variance. Furthermore, our result suggests that adjusting the minibatch size in SGD-GD may have a significant effect on reducing the bias level since \(\sigma_{0},\sigma_{1}\) can be controlled by the latter.

**Remark 2**.: _Prior analysis in (Mendler-Dunner et al., 2020, Drusvyatskiy and Xiao, 2023) showed that with \(\mu\) strongly convex loss \(\ell(\cdot;z)\), both the existence/uniqueness of the PS solution and the convergence of SGD-GD to the PS solution critically depend on the condition \(\epsilon<\mu/L\) (in addition to our A1, 2, W1). When \(\epsilon>\mu/L\), it is shown that the SGD-GD scheme may even diverge. In contrary, Theorem 1 does not exhibit such an explicit condition on \(\epsilon\) for the convergence results (21), (22) to hold. This happens because our result requires the loss function itself to be Lipschitz [cf. W2] or bounded [cf. C2], which may not be satisfied by their strongly convex losses._

## 4 Extension: Lazy Deployment Scheme with SGD

Implementing the SGD-GD scheme (2) requires deploying the latest model every time when drawing samples from \(\mathcal{D}(\cdot)\). This may be difficult to realize since deploying a new classifier in real time can be time consuming. As inspired by (Mendler-Dunner et al., 2020), this section studies an extension of (2) to the _lazy deployment_ scheme where the new (prediction) models are deployed only once per several SGD updates.

To describe the extended scheme, let \(K\geq 1\) denotes the epoch length of lazy deployment, we have

\[\begin{split}&\bm{\theta}_{t,k+1}=\bm{\theta}_{t,k}-\gamma\nabla \ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1}),\text{ where }Z_{t,k+1}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t}),\ k=0,...,K-1,\\ &\bm{\theta}_{t+1}=\bm{\theta}_{t+1,0}=\bm{\theta}_{t,K}.\end{split}\] (23)

For simplicity, we focus on the case with a constant step size \(\gamma>0\). Observe that the lazy deployment scheme is a double-loop algorithm where the index \(t\) denotes the number of deployments and the index \(k\) denotes the SGD update. To analyze the convergence of (23), we further require the stochastic gradient to be uniformly bounded:

**A3**.: _There exists a constant \(G\geq 0\) such that \(\sup_{\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d},z\in\mathbb{Z}}\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta};z )\|\leq G\)._

Despite being a stronger assumption, the above remains valid for practical non-convex losses, e.g., sigmoid loss. We observe the following convergence results whose proof is in SSE:

**Theorem 2**.: _Under A1, 2, 3, and the alternative conditions W1, 2, or C1, 2. Let \(T\geq 1\) be the maximum number of deployments to be run, we set \(\gamma=1/(K\sqrt{T})\) and let \(\mathsf{T}\) be a random variable chosen uniformly and independently from \(\{0,1,\cdots,T-1\}\). For any \(T\geq L^{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})^{2}/K^{2}\), the iterates generated by the lazy deployment scheme with SGD (23) satisfy:_

\[\mathbb{E}\left[\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{\mathsf{T}};\bm{\theta}_{\mathsf{T}}) \|^{2}\right]\leq\frac{8\Delta_{0}}{\sqrt{T}}+\frac{4L\sigma_{0}^{2}}{K\sqrt{ T}}+\frac{2LG^{2}}{3T}+\frac{8\tilde{L}\epsilon}{K}\left(\sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+ \sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right),\] (24)

_where we recall that \(\tilde{L}\) was defined in (20) and \(\Delta_{0}=J(\bm{\theta}_{0};\bm{\theta}_{0})-\ell_{\star}\)._

In (24), the first three terms decay as \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})\) similar to SGD-GD, the last term simplifies to \(\mathcal{O}((\tilde{L}\epsilon)^{2}\frac{K+\sigma_{1}^{2}}{K})\). The lazy deployment scheme (23) finds an \(\mathcal{O}((\tilde{L}\epsilon)^{2})\)_-SPS solution_ when \(T\to\infty,K\to\infty\), contrasting with SGD-GD which admits a bias level of \(\mathcal{O}(\tilde{L}\epsilon)\).

We remark that the above result can be anticipated. During the \(t\)th deployment, (23) runs an SGD recursion for \(\min_{\bm{\theta}}J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{t})\) where it will find a stationary solution for the non-convex optimization as \(K\to\infty\). The lazy deployment scheme resembles RRM and we expect that it may find a reduced bias SPS solution as inspired by (Mofakhami et al., 2023) which studied a similar algorithm.

## 5 Numerical Experiments

We consider two examples of performative prediction with non-convex loss based on synthetic data and real data. All simulations are performed with Pytorch on a server using a Intel Xeon 6318 CPU. Additional results can be found in SSF.

**Synthetic Data with Linear Model.** We first consider a binary classification problem using linear model. To enhance robustness to outliers, we adopt the sigmoid loss function (Ertekin et al., 2010):

\[\ell(\bm{\theta};z):=(1+\exp(c\cdot y\langle x\,|\,\bm{\theta}\rangle))^{-1}+( \beta/2)\left\|\bm{\theta}\right\|^{2}.\] (25)

For small regularization \(\beta>0\), \(\ell(\cdot;z)\) is smooth but non-convex. To define the data distribution, we have a set of \(m\) unshifted samples \(\mathcal{D}^{o}\equiv\{(x_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{m}\) with feature \(x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) and label \(y_{i}\in\{\pm 1\}\). For any \(\bm{\theta}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) is a uniform distribution on \(m\)_shifted samples_\(\{(x_{i}-\epsilon_{L}\bm{\theta},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{m}\), where \(\epsilon_{L}>0\) controls the shift magnitude. Applying SGD-GD to the setup yields a scheme such that A1, 2, W1 (with \(\epsilon=\epsilon_{L}\)) are satisfied, and W2 holds as \(\left\|\bm{\theta}^{t}\right\|\) is bounded in practice. To generate the training data, the unshifted samples \(\mathcal{D}^{o}\) are generated first as \(x_{i}\sim\mathcal{U}[-1,1]^{d}\), i.e., the uniform distribution, \(\bar{y}_{i}=\text{sgn}(\langle x_{i}\,|\,\bm{\theta}^{o}\rangle)\in\{\pm 1\}\) such that \(\bm{\theta}^{o}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\bm{I})\), then a randomly selected 10% of the labels are flipped to generate the final \(y_{i}\). Furthermore, we set \(m=800,d=10,c=0.1,\beta=10^{-3},\epsilon\in\{0,0.1,0.5,2\}\). For (2), the batch size is \(b=1\) and the stepsize is \(\gamma_{t}=\gamma=1/\sqrt{T}\) with \(T=10^{6}\).

First, we validate the convergence behavior of SGD-GD in Theorem 1. In Fig. 1 (left), we compare \(\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\) against the number of iteration \(t\) for the SGD-GD scheme over \(10\) repeated runs. The shaded region indicate the \(95\%\) confidence interval. We observe that after a rapid transient stage,the SPS stationarity \(\left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\) saturates and stay around a constant level, indicating that the SGD-GD converges to a biased-SPS solution. Increasing \(\epsilon_{L}\) leads to an increased bias, corroborating with Theorem 1 that the bias level is \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\). Fig. 1 (middle) further evaluate the performance of the trained classifier \(\bm{\theta}_{t}\) in terms of the performative risk value. Second, we compare the lazy deployment scheme in SS4 with \(K\in\{5,10\}\) and stepsize \(\gamma=1/(K\sqrt{T})\). For fairness, we test SGD-GD with batch size of \(b\in\{5,25\}\) and compare the SPS stationarity against the number of samples accessed. The results in Fig. 1 (right) verifies Theorem 2 where increasing \(K\) effectively reduces the bias level.

**Real Data with Neural Network.** Our second example deals with the task of training a neural network (NN) on the spambase Hopkins et al. (1999) dataset with \(m=4601\) samples, each with \(d=48\) features. We split the training/test sets as \(8:2\). Our aim is to study the behavior of SGD-GD when training NN classifier. To specify (1), we let \(z\equiv(x,y)\) where \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) is the feature vector, \(y\in\{0,1\}\) is label (0 for not spam, 1 for spam). Consider the regularized binary cross entropy loss:

\[\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\equiv\tilde{\ell}(f_{\bm{\theta}}(x);y)=-y\log(f_{\bm{ \theta}}(x))-(1-y)\log(1-f_{\bm{\theta}}(x))+(\beta/2)\left\|\bm{\theta} \right\|^{2},\] (26)

where \(f_{\bm{\theta}}(x)\) denotes the NN classifier. The unshifted data is denoted by \(\mathcal{D}^{o}=\{(x_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{m}\). Sampling from the shifted data distribution \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\) is achieved through (i) uniformly draw a sample \(\bar{z}\equiv(\bar{x},\bar{y})\) from \(\mathcal{D}^{o}\), (ii) maximize the following utility function:

\[x=\arg\max_{x^{\prime}}U(x^{\prime};\bar{x},\bm{\theta}):=-f_{\bm{\theta}}(x^{ \prime})-\tfrac{1}{2\epsilon_{\text{NN}}}\left\|x^{\prime}-\bar{x}\right\|^{2},\] (27)

to get \(z\equiv(x,\bar{y})\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta})\). In practice, we take the approximation \(x\approx\bar{x}-\epsilon_{\text{NN}}\nabla_{x}f_{\bm{\theta}}(\bar{x})\).

In our experiment, we set \(\epsilon_{\text{NN}}\in\{0,10,100\}\), batch size as \(b=8\). For SGD-GD, we use \(\gamma_{t}=\gamma=200/\sqrt{T}\) and for lazy deployment, we use \(\gamma=200/(K\sqrt{T})\) with \(T=10^{5}\). The NN encoded in \(f_{\bm{\theta}}(x)\) consists of three fully-connected layers with \(\tanh\) activation and a sigmoid output layer, i.e.,

\[f_{\bm{\theta}}(x)=Sigmoid\big{(}\bm{\theta}_{(1)}^{\top}\cdot\tanh(\bm{ \theta}_{(2)}^{\top}\cdot\tanh(\bm{\theta}_{(3)}^{\top}x))\big{)},\]

where \(\bm{\theta}_{(i)}:=[w_{(i)};b_{(i)}]\) concatenates the weight and bias for each layer with \(d_{1}=10,d_{2}=50,d_{3}=57\) neurons, making a total of \(d=3421\) parameters for \(\bm{\theta}\). For the training, we initialize these parameters as \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\) for weights and constant values for the biases.

Fig. 2 (left) compares the SPS measure \(\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\) against the iteration number \(t\) using SGD-GD. As observed, SGD-GD converges to a near SPS solution and the behavior seems to be insensitive to \(\epsilon_{\mathsf{NN}}\). We speculate that this is due to the shift model (27) but would relegate its study to future work. Fig. 2 (middle & right) compare the greedy and lazy deployment schemes with \(\epsilon_{\mathsf{NN}}\in\{10,10^{4}\}\) against the number of samples used. Compared to SGD-GD, lazy deployment performs relatively better as \(\epsilon_{\mathsf{NN}}\uparrow\), as seen from the no. of samples needed to reach \(\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}=10^{-4}\) in the plots. This agrees with (24) which shows the dominant term as \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{2})\) and \(\epsilon\) is related to \(\epsilon_{\mathsf{NN}}\).

## 6 Conclusions

This paper provides the first study on the performative prediction problem with smooth but possibly non-convex loss. We proposed a stationary performative stable (SPS) condition which is the counterpart of performative stable condition used with strongly convex loss. Using the SPS solution concept, we studied the convergence of greedy deployment and lazy deployment schemes with SGD. We prove that SGD-GD finds a biased, \(\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\)-SPS solution, while the lazy deployment scheme finds a reduced bias SPS solution when the lazy deployment epoch is large. As an initial work on this subclass of problems, our findings can lead to more general analysis on algorithms under the non-convex performative prediction framework.

\[\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};z) \leq\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};z)+\left\langle\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t}; z)\,|\,\bm{\theta}_{t+1}-\bm{\theta}_{t}\right\rangle+\frac{L}{2}\left\|\bm{ \theta}_{t+1}-\bm{\theta}_{t}\right\|^{2}\] \[\leq\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};z)-\gamma_{t+1}\left\langle\nabla\ell( \bm{\theta}_{t};z)\,|\,\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\rangle+\frac {L\gamma_{t+1}^{2}}{2}\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2},\]

where the second inequality is due to the update rule of (2) as we recall that \(Z_{t+1}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\). Taking integration on \(z\) with weights given by the p.d.f. of \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\), i.e., \(\int(\cdot)p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\mathrm{d}z\), on both sides of above inequality leads to

\[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})\leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})- \gamma_{t+1}\left\langle\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\,|\,\nabla \ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\rangle+\frac{L}{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}\left\| \nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2}.\]

As \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})]=\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t}; \bm{\theta}_{t})\), taking the conditional expectation \(\mathbb{E}_{t}[\cdot]\) on both sides yield

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right] \leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-\gamma_{t+1}\left\| \nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}+\frac{L}{2}\gamma_{t+1} ^{2}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2}\right]\] (28) \[\overset{(a)}{=}J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-\gamma_{t+1} \left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\] \[\quad+\frac{L}{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}\left(\mathbb{E}_{t}\left\| \nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})-\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t}) \right\|^{2}+\left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2} \right),\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-\gamma_{t+1 }\left\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}+\frac{L}{2} \gamma_{t+1}^{2}\left(\sigma_{0}^{2}+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\left\|\nabla J(\bm{ \theta};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\right),\]

where \((a)\) used A2 and the property:

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2} \right]=\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})-\nabla J (\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\right]+\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{ t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2},\]

and \((b)\) is due to the variance bound in A2. Rearranging terms in (28) leads to

\[\left(1-\frac{L}{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\gamma_{t+1}\right)\gamma_{t+1}\left\| \nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t}; \bm{\theta}_{t})-\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})]+\frac{L }{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}.\]

The step size condition implies \(1-\frac{L}{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\gamma_{t+1}\geq 1/2\). This concludes the proof. 

## Appendix B Proof of Lemma 2

Proof.: Our proof is modified from Lemma 2.1 of [23]. By W2, since \(\ell(\bm{\theta};z)\) is \(L_{0}\)-Lipchitz in \(z\), we have

\[|J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{1})-J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{2})|=\left| \mathbb{E}_{Z\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{1})}\ell(\bm{\theta};Z)-\mathbb{E}_ {Z^{\prime}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2})}\ell(\bm{\theta};Z^{\prime}) \right|\leq L_{0}W_{1}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{1}),\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2 })).\]

Applying W1 gives

\[|J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{1})-J(\bm{\theta};\bm{\theta}_{2})|\leq L_{0} \epsilon\left\|\bm{\theta}_{1}-\bm{\theta}_{2}\right\|,\]

which finishes the proof. 

## Appendix C Proof of Lemma 3

Proof.: Under C1 & C2, we observe

\[|J(\bm{\theta},\bm{\theta}_{1})-J(\bm{\theta},\bm{\theta}_{2})| =\left|\int\ell(\bm{\theta};z)(p_{\bm{\theta}_{1}}(z)-p_{\bm{ \theta}_{2}}(z))\mathrm{d}z\right|\] \[\overset{(a)}{\leq}\int|\ell(\bm{\theta};z)|\cdot|p_{\bm{ \theta}_{1}}(z)-p_{\bm{\theta}_{2}}(z)|\,\mathrm{d}z\] \[\leq\ell_{max}\cdot\int|p_{\bm{\theta}_{1}}(z)-p_{\bm{\theta}_{2} }(z)|\,\mathrm{d}(z)\] \[\leq\ell_{max}\cdot 2\delta_{TV}(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{1}), \mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{2}))\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}2\ell_{max}\epsilon\|\bm{\theta}_{1}-\bm{ \theta}_{2}||.\]

where (a) is due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, (b) is due to the stated assumptions C1.

Proof of Theorem 1

Proof.: We recall from Lemma 1 the following relation:

\[\frac{\gamma_{t+1}}{2}\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\leq\mathbb{ E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})]+ \frac{L}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}.\] (29)

We notice that Lemmas 2, 3 imply

\[|J(\bar{\bm{\theta}};\bm{\theta})-J(\bar{\bm{\theta}};\bm{\theta}^{\prime})| \leq\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\,\|\bm{\theta}-\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\|,\]

where \(\tilde{L}=L_{0}\) if W1, 2 hold, or \(\tilde{L}=\ell_{max}\) if C1, 2 hold. Subsequently, the first term on the right hand side of (29) can be bounded by

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{\theta}_ {t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})] \leq\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{ \theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]+\mathbb{E}_{t}[|J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{ \theta}_{t+1})-J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t})|]\] \[\leq\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{ \theta}_{t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]+\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\,\mathbb{E}_{t}[\|\bm {\theta}_{t+1}-\bm{\theta}_{t}\|]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{\theta}_ {t+1};\bm{\theta}_{t+1})]+\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\,\mathbb{E}_{t}[ \|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\|].\]

Notice that

\[\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\,\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\|\nabla \ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\|\right] \overset{(a)}{\leq}\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\sqrt{\mathbb{ E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\right\|^{2}\right]}\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\left(\sigma _{0}+\sqrt{1+\sigma_{1}^{2}}\,\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|\right)\] \[\overset{(c)}{\leq}\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\left(\sigma _{0}+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}+\frac{1}{4\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}}\, \|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\right),\]

where \((a)\) is due to the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality \(\mathbb{E}[\|X\|]\leq\sqrt{\mathbb{E}[\|X\|^{2}]}\), \((b)\) is due to the chain:

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})\|^{2}\right] =\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}+\mathbb{E}_{t} \left[\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t};Z_{t+1})-\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{ \theta}_{t})\|^{2}\right]\] \[\leq\sigma_{0}^{2}+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t}; \bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\leq\left(\sigma_{0}+\sqrt{1+\sigma_{1}^{2}}\|\nabla J (\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|\right)^{2}\]

and \((c)\) is due to the Young's inequality. Substituting back into (29) gives

\[\frac{\gamma_{t+1}}{4}\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\leq \mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})-J(\bm{\theta}_{t+1};\bm{ \theta}_{t+1})]+\gamma_{t+1}\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\left(\sigma_{0}+(1+\sigma_{1} ^{2})\tilde{L}_{\epsilon}\right)+\frac{L}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma_{t+1}^{2}.\]

Notice that taking full expectation and summing both sides of the inequality from \(t=0\) to \(T-1\) yields the theorem. 

## Appendix E Proof of Theorem 2

Proof.: The first steps of our proof resemble that of Lemma 1 and is repeated here for completeness. Under A1, for any fixed \(z\in\mathbb{Z}\), we have that

\[\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k+1};z) \leq\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};z)+\left\langle\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta }_{t,k};z)\,|\,\bm{\theta}_{t,k+1}-\bm{\theta}_{t,k}\right\rangle+\frac{L}{2 }\left\|\bm{\theta}_{t,k+1}-\bm{\theta}_{t,k}\right\|^{2}\] \[\leq\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};z)-\gamma\left\langle\nabla\ell(\bm{ \theta}_{t,k};z)\,|\,\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\rangle+ \frac{L\gamma^{2}}{2}\left\|\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|^{2},\]

where the second inequality is due to the update rule of (2) as we recall that \(Z_{t+1}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\). Taking integration on \(z\) with weights given by the p.d.f. of \(\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t})\), i.e., \(\int(\cdot)p_{\bm{\theta}_{t}}(z)\text{d}z\), on both sides of above inequality leads to

\[J(\bm{\theta}_{t,k+1};\bm{\theta}_{t,0})\leq J(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};\bm{\theta}_{t,0})- \gamma\left\langle\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};\bm{\theta}_{t,0})\,|\,\nabla\ell( \bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\rangle+\frac{L}{2}\gamma^{2}\left\|\nabla\ell (\bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|^{2}.\]

As \(Z_{t,k+1}\sim\mathcal{D}(\bm{\theta}_{t,0})\), we have \(\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[\nabla\ell(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})]=\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t,k};\bm{\theta}_{t,0})\), where \(\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[\cdot]\) denotes the conditional expectation on the filtration

\[\mathcal{F}_{t,k}=\sigma(\{\bm{\theta}_{0},\bm{\theta}_{0,1},\cdots,\bm{\theta}_{0,K},\bm{\theta}_{1,1},\cdots,\bm{\theta}_{t},\bm{\theta}_{t,1},\cdots,\bm{\theta}_{t,k}\}).\]Taking the conditional expectation \(\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[\cdot]\) on both sides yield

\[\mathbb{E}_{t,k}\left[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k+1};\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t,0})\right] \leq J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})-\gamma\left\| \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}+\frac {L\gamma^{2}}{2}\mathbb{E}_{t,k}\left\|\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{ t,k+1})\right\|^{2}\] (30) \[\overset{(a)}{=} J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})-\gamma \left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq} J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})-\gamma \left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2 }+\frac{L}{2}\gamma^{2}\left(\sigma_{0}^{2}+(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\left\|\nabla J (\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}\right),\]

where \((a)\) used A2 and the property:

\[\mathbb{E}_{t,k}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1}) \right\|^{2}\right]=\mathbb{E}_{t,k}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})-\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}\right]+\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\|^{2},\]

and \((b)\) is due to the variance bound in A2. Rearranging terms in (30),

\[\left(1-\frac{L}{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\gamma\right)\gamma\left\|\nabla J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}\leq J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})-\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})]+\frac{L}{2}\sigma_{0} ^{2}\gamma^{2}.\] (31)

The step size condition implies \(1-\frac{L}{2}(1+\sigma_{1}^{2})\gamma\geq\frac{1}{2}\).

\[\frac{\gamma}{2}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta} _{t,0})\right\|^{2}\leq J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0} )-\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})]+ \frac{L}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2}.\]

Taking summation on \(k\) from 0 to \(K-1\) leads to

\[\frac{\gamma}{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}\leq J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})-\mathbb{E}_{t,k}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1,0}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})]+\frac{LK}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2}.\] (32)

Recall that \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1,0}=\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}=\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,K}\). Subsequently, the first term on the right hand side of (32) can be bounded by

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t })-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})] \leq\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t};\boldsymbol{\theta }_{t})-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})]+\mathbb{E}_{t }[|J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})-J(\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})|]\] \[\leq\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t};\boldsymbol{\theta }_{t})-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})]+\tilde{L}_{ \epsilon}\,\mathbb{E}_{t}[\|\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1}-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t }|]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{t}[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})-J (\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})]+\gamma\tilde{L}_{ \epsilon}\,\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|\right].\]

Notice that through a careful use of A2 and the independence between stochastic gradients, we have

\[\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol {\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|\right]\leq\sqrt{\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\| \sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|^{2} \right]}\] \[\leq\sqrt{2\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}(\nabla \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})-\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}))\right\|^{2}\right]+2\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k= 0}^{K-1}\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2 }\right]}\] \[=\sqrt{2\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla\ell( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})-\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\right]+2\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k =0}^{K-1}\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2 }\right]}\] (33) \[\leq\sqrt{2K\sigma_{0}^{2}+2\sigma_{1}^{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E }_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}) \right\|^{2}\right]+2\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\nabla J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\right]}\] \[\leq\sqrt{2K\sigma_{0}^{2}+2(K+\sigma_{1}^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{K-1} \mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}) \|^{2}\right]}.\]Using \(\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}\leq a+b\) for \(a,b\geq 0\), we have

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\nabla \ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};Z_{t,k+1})\right\|\right]&\leq \sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+\sqrt{2(K+\sigma_{1}^{2})}\sqrt{\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E }_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}) \right\|^{2}\right]}\\ &\leq\sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+\sigma_{1}^{2})\,\tilde{L}\epsilon+ \frac{1}{4\tilde{L}\epsilon}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}_{t}\left[\left\|\nabla J (\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\right],\end{split}\] (34)

where the last inequality used the property \(\sqrt{ax}\leq\frac{ca}{2}+\frac{x}{2c}\) for any \(c>0\). Substituting above results to (32) and taking full expectation on both sides give us

\[\frac{\gamma}{4}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2} \leq\mathbb{E}\left[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta} _{t})-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})\right]\] (35) \[\quad+\gamma\tilde{L}\epsilon\left(\sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+ \sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right)+\frac{LK}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2}.\]

Next, we lower bound the left hand side by observing:

\[\begin{split}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,0})\right\|^{2}& \stackrel{{(a)}}{{\geq}}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E} \left[\frac{1}{2}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta} _{t})\right\|^{2}-\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k};\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t})-\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}) \right\|^{2}\right]\\ &\stackrel{{(b)}}{{\geq}}\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\| \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-L\sum_{ k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,k}-\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t} \right\|^{2}\\ &\stackrel{{(c)}}{{=}}\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\| \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-L\sum_{ k=0}^{K-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\sum_{\ell=0}^{k-1}\gamma\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t,\ell};Z_{t,\ell})\right\|^{2}\\ &\geq\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t },\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-L\gamma^{2}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}k\sum_{\ell= 0}^{k-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla\ell(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t,\ell};Z_{t,\ell}) \right\|^{2}\\ &\stackrel{{(d)}}{{\geq}}\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\| \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-L\gamma^{ 2}\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}k\sum_{\ell=0}^{k-1}G^{2}\\ &=\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t },\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-LG^{2}\gamma^{2}\cdot\frac{K(K-1)(2K-1) }{6}\\ &\geq\frac{1}{2}K\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t },\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}-LG^{2}\gamma^{2}\cdot\frac{K^{3}}{3}, \end{split}\]

where \((a)\) is due to the fact that \(\left\|a\right\|^{2}\geq\frac{1}{2}\left\|a+b\right\|^{2}-\left\|b\right\|^{2}\), for any \(a,b\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \((b)\) is due to A1, \((c)\) is obtained from the updating rule (23). In \((d)\), we used the additional assumption A3. The last chain is due to \(\sum_{k=0}^{K-1}k^{2}=\frac{K(K-1)(2K-1)}{6}\leq\frac{K^{3}}{3}\), when \(K\geq 1\). Substituting the above lower bound to (35) and rearrange terms lead to

\[\begin{split}\frac{\gamma K}{8}\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J( \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}& \leq\mathbb{E}\left[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{t})-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t+1})\right]+ \frac{1}{12}\gamma^{3}LG^{2}K^{3}\\ &\quad+\gamma\tilde{L}\epsilon\left(\sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+\sigma _{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right)+\frac{LK}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2}.\end{split}\]

Taking summation from \(t=0,1,\cdots,T-1\) gives us

\[\begin{split}\frac{\gamma K}{8}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\mathbb{E}\left\| \nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}& \leq\mathbb{E}\left[J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0},\boldsymbol{ \theta}_{0})-J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{T},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{T})\right]+ \frac{T}{12}\gamma^{3}LG^{2}K^{3}\\ &\quad+\gamma T\tilde{L}\epsilon\left(\sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+ \sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right)+\frac{TLK}{2}\sigma_{0}^{2}\gamma^{2}. \end{split}\]

Dividing \(\gamma KT/8\) on both sides, we have

\[\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\mathbb{E}\left\|\nabla J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{t}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{t})\right\|^{2}\leq\frac{8\Delta_{0}}{\gamma KT}+4L\sigma_{0}^ {2}\gamma+\frac{2}{3}\gamma^{2}LG^{2}K^{2}+\frac{8\tilde{L}\epsilon}{K}\left( \sqrt{2K}\sigma_{0}+2(K+\sigma_{1}^{2})\tilde{L}\epsilon\right),\]

where we recall \(\Delta_{0}:=J(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{0})-\ell_{max}\)Additional Numerical Results

This section provides additional details for the numerical experiments that were omitted due to space limitation.

Synthetic Data with Linear ModelFig. 3 shows the trajectories of training and testing accuracy with the SGD-GD scheme under different shift parameters, using the same settings as in Fig. 1 (left & right). Note that the testing dataset with 200 samples is generated from the same procedure described in the main paper with the same ground truth \(\bm{\theta}^{o}\), but without the label flipping step. In this case, although increasing the shift leads to a larger risk value \(J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\) and more biased stationary solution in terms of \(\|\nabla J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\|^{2}\) [cf. Fig. 1 (left & middle)], the test/train accuracy remain relatively stable regardless of the shift parameter. We remark that as observed from (Miller et al., 2021, Fig. 2), increasing the shift parameter \(\epsilon\) does not always lead to a deteriorated or improved model accuracy. Importantly, the effects can be unpredictable in general, especially when only biased SPS solutions are guaranteed.

Fig. 4 shows the trajectories of loss values \(J(\bm{\theta}_{t};\bm{\theta}_{t})\), training and testing accuracy with the greedy and lazy deployment scheme using the same settings as in Fig. 1 (right). We observe similar behaviors as indicated in Fig. 3. Moreover, we notice that although the lazy deployment scheme converges to a less biased SPS solution than greedy deployment scheme utilizing the same number of samples, the initial convergence speed is slower. This can be predicted from Theorem 2 as the lazy deployment scheme is simulated with a larger noise variance \(\sigma_{0}\).

Real Data with Neural Network ModelSimilar to the above paragraph, Fig. 5, 6, 7 show the trajectories of train/test accuracy, for greedy/lazy deployment scheme when \(\epsilon\in\{10,10^{4}\}\) for completeness. The figures demonstrate similar behavior as described in the main paper. Moreover, we observe that the sensitivity parameter \(\epsilon_{\text{NN}}\) has a small effect in the training/testing accuracies of the trained models.

2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed about the limitation in conclusions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We provides a complete set of assumptions in Section 3 and proofs for each theoretical result in Appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discloses all necessary information (e.g. parameters settings, model structure) for reproducing the experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper will provide open access to the source code, ensuring that the main experimental results can be faithfully reproduced. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper specifies all training and test details, including data splits, hyperparameters and etc. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper reports the confidence intervals for experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We described the computation platform used in Section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors have ensured that the research conducted in the paper complies with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, preserving anonymity. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none which we feel must be specifically highlighted here. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: Our data were obtained from openly available datasets and modes are classical machine learning model, mitigating any risk of misuse.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We have appropriately cited and described the sources of our data.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
