###### Abstract

Direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods, such as DPO, have recently emerged as efficient alternatives to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), that do not require a separate reward model. However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are usually collected ahead of training and never updated, thus the feedback is purely offline. Moreover, responses in these datasets are often sampled from a language model distinct from the one being aligned, and since the model evolves over training, the alignment phase is inevitably off-policy. In this study, we posit that online feedback is key and improves DAP methods. Our method, online AI feedback (OAF), uses an LLM as annotator: on each training iteration, we sample two responses from the current model and prompt the LLM annotator to choose which one is preferred, thus providing online feedback. Despite its simplicity, we demonstrate via human evaluation in several tasks that OAF outperforms both offline DAP and RLHF methods. We further show that the feedback leveraged in OAF is easily controllable, via instruction prompts to the LLM annotator.

## 1 Introduction

To maximise the benefits of large language models (LLMs) to society, it is important to align them with human expectations and values (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022; Bubeck et al., 2023). The first method introduced for alignment was reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF, Christiano et al., 2017; Stiennon et al., 2020), which trains a reward model (RM) from pairwise preferences and then optimises a policy against the RM via reinforcement learning (RL). More recently, direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods have emerged as popular alternatives to RLHF, such as direct preference optimisation (DPO, Rafailov et al., 2023), sequence likelihood calibration with human feedback (SLiC, Zhao et al., 2023), and identity policy optimisation (IPO, Azar et al., 2023). In contrast to RLHF, the DAP methods directly update the language model (a.k.a. policy) \(\pi_{\theta}\) using pairwise preference data, making the alignment simpler, more efficient and more stable (Rafailov et al., 2023).

However, the preference datasets used in DAP methods are often collected ahead of training and the responses in the dataset are usually generated by different LLMs. Thus, the feedback in DAP methods is usually purely offline, as \(\pi_{\theta}\) cannot get feedback on its own generations over training. This is problematic because of the significant distribution shift between the policy that generated the dataset and the policy being aligned: we train on the distribution induced by \(\rho\) but evaluate on the distribution induced by \(\pi_{\theta}\) in the end. In contrast, in RLHF, the RM provides online feedback to generations from \(\pi_{\theta}\) during the RL step. This practice leads to on-policy learning, which was shown to improve exploration and overall performance (Lambert et al., 2022).

Inspired by RL from AI feedback (RLAIF) (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023), we hereby propose Online AI Feedback (OAIF) for DAP methods. Our method inherits both the practical advantages of DAP methods and the online nature of RLHF. Specifically, when aligning an LLM policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\), we follow a three-step procedure: 1) we sample two responses to a prompt from the current policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\); 2) we obtain online feedback over the two responses by prompting an LLM to mimic human preference annotation; 3) we use this online feedback to update the model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) through standard DAP losses. Our approach is depicted in Fig 1. Unlike methods proposed by Xu et al. (2023); Liu et al. (2023); Xiong et al. (2023), OAIF skips the RM training, and directly extracts the preference from an LLM.

To show the effectiveness of our proposal, we perform an extensive empirical comparison between OAIF, existing offline DAP methods and RLHF methods. Our experimental protocol uses both AI and human evaluation on standard LLM alignment tasks: TL; DR (Ziegler et al., 2019), Anthropic Helpfulness and Harmlessness (Bai et al., 2022a). To summarise, we make the following contributions.

* We demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of OAIF for turning offline DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) into online methods. Our human evaluation shows that the average win rate of online DAP methods (DPO, IPO, SLiC) over offline versions of the same methods is \(\sim\)\(66\%\).
* We confirm the usefulness of making DAP methods online: human raters favour DPO with OAIF (thus, online DPO) over SFT baseline, RLHF and RLAIF \(58.00\%\) of time on the TL;DR task in 4-way comparisons.
* We demonstrate the controllability of the LLM annotator, by injecting specific instructions into the prompts. We use response length as a test-bed. By asking the LLM annotator to prefer shorter responses, the average length of responses from the aligned policy is significantly shortened from \(\sim\)\(120\) to \(\sim\)\(40\), while its quality is still improved over the SFT baseline.

## 2 Background

**Pairwise preference collection**. Current methods for LLM alignment first collect a dataset of pairwise preferences, as follows. A prompt \(\bm{x}\) is sampled from a prompt distribution \(p_{\mathcal{X}}\), then two distinct responses \(\bm{y}^{1}\) and \(\bm{y}^{2}\) are sampled independently from an existing LLM \(\rho\). Then, human (Christiano et al., 2017) or AI annotators (Lee et al., 2023) rank the responses, yielding a preferred response \(\bm{y}^{+}\) and a less preferred one \(\bm{y}^{-}\). With some abuse of notation, we assume that there exists a function that uniquely maps \((\bm{y}^{1},\bm{y}^{2})\) to \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\), and we will therefore write \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\sim\rho(\cdot|\bm{x})\). A preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},\bm{y}^{+}_{i},\bm{y}^{-}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\) is then constructed by repeating the above process \(N\) times.

**Direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods.** DAP methods directly update the target policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) from the preference pairs \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\). The loss functions for the three main DAP methods

Figure 1: **Summary of the proposed online AI feedback (OAIF) approach for making direct alignment from preferences (DAP) methods online and on-policy**. Given an input prompt \(\bm{x}\), two responses \(\bm{y}^{1}\) and \(\bm{y}^{2}\) are first sampled from the current language model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{+}}\), then labelled as \(\bm{y}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}^{-}\) by the LLM annotator. The language model parameters are then updated using the objective function of DAP methods.

investigated in this work are summarised below. They take the form \(\ell(\bm{x},\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-},\bm{\theta})\) for a prompt \(\bm{x}\sim p_{\mathcal{X}}\), a response pair \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\sim\rho(\cdot|\bm{x})\) and model parameters \(\bm{\theta}\).

* DPO loss: \[-\log\sigma\left(\beta\log\frac{\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})\pi_{\bm{ \theta}^{0}}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})}{\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})\pi_{ \bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})}\right)\] (1)
* IPO loss: \[\left(\log\left(\frac{\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0 }}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})}{\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0 }}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})}\right)-\frac{1}{2\beta}\right)^{2}\] (2)
* SLiC loss: \[\max\left(0,1-\beta\log\left(\frac{\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})\pi_{ \bm{\theta}^{0}}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})}{\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}^{-}|\bm{x})\pi_ {\bm{\theta}^{0}}(\bm{y}^{+}|\bm{x})}\right)\right)\] (3)

where \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\) is the SFT baseline used as reference, \(\sigma\) is the logistic function, and \(\beta\) is a scalar hyperparameter. We emphasise once again that \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\) are sampled from \(\rho(\cdot|\bm{x})\), not from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}(\cdot|\bm{x})\), as this will be the key difference with the online variant we propose in the next section. One advantage of these loss functions is that their gradients \(\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\ell(\bm{x},\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-},\bm{\theta})\) can be computed exactly in an efficient way. In contrast, because the loss function used in RLHF involves an expectation over the space of responses (Ziegler et al., 2019), policy gradient methods are typically used to obtain an unbiased estimate of the gradient and a value function is typically used to reduce the variance, which requires storing an additional model in memory.

**Offline feedback**. In most real-world applications, due to the financial cost and complexity of collecting pairwise preferences from human annotators, the preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}\) is usually collected ahead of aligning a language model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) and kept fixed throughout training. Obtaining online preferences on new responses is usually not feasible, as there is no human-in-the-loop. Using a fixed dataset \(\mathbb{D}\) makes all preference data _offline_, which means the policy1\(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) cannot get feedback on its own generations on-the-fly over the alignment procedure. It is worth mentioning that the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF is _online_ as the training data is acquired interactively. See Appendix A.1 for an in-depth discussion on online vs. offline feedback.

Footnote 1: In this work, we use language model and policy interchangeably to refer to the model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) being aligned.

**Off-policy learning**. Beyond the offline feedback problem illustrated above, aligning an LLM policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) with DAP methods on a pre-collected dataset \(\mathbb{D}\) also yields a distribution shift between the generation from the policy \(\rho\) and the policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\) at each time step \(t\). This keeps evolving over learning. This shift problem is illustrated in Figure 2. We also provide an empirical verification of this problem in Appendix B. In DPO, this problem is tackled by supervised finetuning \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) on \(\mathbb{D}\) so that \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\approx\rho\), but the off-policy issue remains during alignment as \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\) gradually departs from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\). Thanks to the _online_ nature of RL RL methods are also _on-policy_, as the responses used to update \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\) are all sampled from it. See Appendix A.2 for more details on on-policy vs. off-policy learning in LLMs.

**RM-based online feedback for DAP methods**. To avoid the distribution shifts arising when aligning LLMs with offline DAP methods on a given dataset \(\mathbb{D}\), an intuitive and straightforward solution is to introduce an RM to provide online feedback. Liu et al. (2023) proposed RSO, a method that uses an RM to perform rejection sampling in order to sample from the optimal policy, which improved the alignment compared to offline DAP baselines. Besides, pseudo-labelling the generations from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\) by RMs can also be helpful, as done in the Iterative DPO method (Xu et al., 2023) and the West-of-N

Figure 2: **Illustration of the distribution shift problem.** The responses \((\bm{y}_{1},\bm{y}_{2})\) sampled from the current model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\) differ from preference dataset responses \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\) sampled from \(\rho\), as \(\rho\neq\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\). Two independent distribution shifts can occur: an initial distribution shift (\(\rho\neq\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\)) and a gradual distribution shift (\(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{0}}\neq\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{i}}\)) during the alignment procedure.

method (Pace et al., 2024). Although the aforementioned RM-based methods make the alignment of a policy online and on-policy, the distribution shift problem still exists when training the RM. More specifically, the RM is trained on the preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}\sim\rho\), but used to annotate preference over responses from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{t}}\) at training step \(t\), where \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\neq\rho\). Therefore, RM-based online feedback cannot fully avoid distribution shift issues.

**LLM-based online feedback for DAP methods**. The method we propose next, "Online AI Feedback" (OAIF), consists in using an LLM as an online annotator. Our method relies on the observation that LLMs can approximate well human labelling and can generate reliable preferences over responses (Lee et al., 2023). In recent concurrent work, Yuan et al. (2024) proposed a "self-rewarding" approach, in which the policy being aligned provides online feedback to itself. In comparison, OAIF can leverage feedback from any LLM, including ones stronger than the LLM being aligned. Swamy et al. (2024) also concurrently investigates the importance of online preference, but still relying on RMs.

In Table 1, we summarise the characteristics of OAIF and of the existing offline and online DAP methods.

## 3 Direct alignment from online AI feedback

**Bridging the gap**. As we saw, DAP methods are simple, do not require a separate RM, but they use preference data pre-collected offline. On the other hand, RLHF methods interact online with the language model being aligned, but they require policy gradient techniques to obtain an unbiased gradient estimate and a value function to reduce the variance. To bridge the gap between these two families of methods, we propose a simple yet effective way to make DAP methods online.

As pointed out by Ziegler et al. (2019), online data collection is crucial for aligning language models. To solve the aforementioned offline problem in DAP methods, we propose to collect preferences on-the-fly for responses generated by the language model being aligned. Naturally, using human feedback would be prohibitively expensive. Prior studies have shown that AI feedback is a reliable and effective approximation to human labellers, especially for pairwise preference labelling (Lee et al., 2023). We therefore propose to use an LLM as online annotator, in order to collect the preference over pairs of responses, sampled from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{t}}\) on-the-fly during its alignment. We refer to the proposed approach as **OAIF**, which stands for online AI feedback.

**Proposed algorithm**. An overview of OAIF is given in Figure 1, and a more formal description is provided in Algorithm 1 (for simplicity, we use batches of size \(1\)). Given a prompt \(\bm{x}\), sampling \(\bm{y}^{1},\bm{y}^{2}\) from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{t}}(\cdot|\bm{x})\) ensures _on-policy_ learning. Prompting the annotating LLM to obtain

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Method & No RM & On-policy & Online \\  & needed & generation & feedback \\ \hline Offline DPO & & & \\ Rafailov et al. (2023) & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ \\ \hline Offline IPO & & & \\ Azar et al. (2023) & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ \\ \hline Offline SLiC & & & \\ Zhao et al. (2023) & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ \\ \hline RSO & & & \\ Liu et al.

\end{table}
Table 1: **Comparison between OAIF (proposed) and existing DAP methods**, with or without a separate RM. Technically, training RMs on pre-collected preference data still suffers from the distribution shift problem, as RMs cannot get feedback for responses from the model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{t}}\).

ensures _online_ learning. We emphasise that the approach is general and works with any differentiable DAP loss function \(\ell(\bm{x},\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-},\bm{\theta})\).

**Gradient computation**. An important technical detail of online DAP methods is that \(\bm{\theta}\) is involved in both the response sampling and the DAP loss function. In contrast, \(\bm{\theta}\) is involved only in the loss for offline DAP methods and only in the sampling for RLHF methods. In addition, using OAIF, the sampled responses go through an LLM annotator to obtain \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\), thus \((\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-})\) are also in principle functions of \(\bm{\theta}\). In practice, we propose to simply use \(\nabla_{\bm{\theta}}\ell(\bm{x},\bm{y}^{+},\bm{y}^{-},\bm{\theta})\) as our gradients, which amounts to placing a stop_gradient on both the sampling and LLM annotation steps.

**Annotating prompts with text-controllability**. We adopt a pairwise prompting scheme to collect AI feedback, i.e. we instruct the LLM annotator to choose which response is preferred among a pair, as in (Lee et al., 2023). To avoid position bias, we calculate scores for the two response possible orders and use the average as the final score. Since OAIF leverages prompting techniques to collect feedback, the reward signals or the preference function can be easily adapted by modifying the prompts (Sun et al., 2024). This offers high flexibility without incurring any extra computation (such as retraining the RM) compared to RLHF and RLAIF. For example, in our experiments, we show that we can control the response length by simply prompting the annotator to prefer shorter responses.

## 4 Experiments

### Experimental setup

We use three tasks for experiments: TL; DR(Stiennon et al., 2020), Anthropic Helpfulness and Anthropic Harmlessness(Bai et al., 2022). For each task, we prepare the prompt dataset \(\mathbb{D}_{\mathcal{X}}\) by simply extracting the input prompts from the preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}\). We adopt PaLM 2 (Anil et al., 2023) as the language model and also the LLM annotator. Unless otherwise specified, all policy models are initialised from the model obtained by supervised finetuning (SFT) PaLM 2-XS (Extra Small), which is referred to as the SFT baseline. For the annotating model, we use PaLM 2-L (Large). To obtain online feedback from the annotating model, we adopt the _Detailed 0-shot_ prompt from Lee et al. (2023). The prompts we used and how we get preference scores from them are detailed in Appendix E.

To demonstrate the generality of OAIF, we experiment with three DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC. Based on preliminary experiments, we set \(\beta=0.1\) in DPO, \(\beta=1.0\) in IPO, and \(\beta=0.002\) in SLiC. We sample responses with a temperature of 0.9 during training. We adopt Adafactor (Shazeer & Stern, 2018) as the optimiser, and set the batch size to 128 and the learning rate to \(5\cdot 10^{-7}\), with a warm-up period of \(150\) steps for all experiments. We used 64/128 TPU-v3 chips to train PaLM-XS/S, which takes about 3.5/5 days for each experiment. We evaluate models by computing win rates, i.e. how often one model's response is better than the other. For automatic evaluation, we apply the same prompting technique as above but with Gemini Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2023) to reduce the risk of over-fitting and reward hacking (Gao et al., 2023). The validity of Gemini Pro as the judge generated from a corresponding policy model, on a scale from 1 to 5 and select the best response. Please see Appendix F for more details about the human evaluation study.

### How effective is OAIF for LLM alignment?

We start by examining the effectiveness of OAIF for DAP methods (that use online AI feedback), compared to their offline counterparts (that use pre-collected offline human preferences). As a sanity check, we track the win rate of DPO with OAIF ("Online DPO") and vanilla DPO ("Offline DPO")

Figure 3: Win rate of DPO with OAIF (online DPO), vanilla DPO (offline DPO), RLAIF, and RLHF against the SFT baseline on the TL; DR task, judged by _Gemini Pro_.

against the SFT baseline on TL;DR. The results are given in Figure 3, where the results for RLAIF and RLHF are provided as references.

Not surprisingly, both online and offline DPO improve the performance of the model, as shown by the substantially high win rate achieved against the SFT baseline. However, as indicated by the sharp drop of the red curve around training step \(3,500\), offline DPO rapidly _overfits_ the offline and off-policy preferences in \(\mathbb{D}\). In contrast, the win rate of online DPO keeps increasing over training, and _surpasses_ offline DPO after \(4,000\) steps. This demonstrates the effectiveness of OAIF. To consolidate the findings we got with Gemini Pro as automatic evaluator, the same experiment was also carried out with PaLM 2-L as the automatic evaluator. The results, given in Appendix D, confirm that our observations hold under both automatic evaluators.

Next, we evaluate OAIF on different tasks, i.e., TL;DR, Helpfulness and Harmlessness. We select the best performing online and offline DPO models according to both manual inspection and their development set win rate against the SFT baseline by Gemini Pro. We then report side-by-side human evaluations comparing online DPO and offline DPO in Table 2.

Human evaluation shows that OAIF significantly improves the performance of DPO across all tasks with substantial superiority over offline DPO. This consolidates our conclusion that using the offline feedback and off-policy generations in a pre-collected preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}\) can be detrimental for LLM alignment, and OAIF benefits greatly from online and on-policy AI feedback.

### How does OAIF generalise to other DAP methods?

As shown in Algorithm 1, OAIF is compatible with arbitrary DAP loss functions. We therefore check the effectiveness of OAIF for IPO and SLiC. The side-by-side human evaluation results on TL;DR comparing the online and offline counterparts of these methods are given in Table 3.

Compared to their offline counterparts, DAP methods with OAIF achieve promising win rates, ranging from \(\sim\)\(64\%\) to \(\sim\)\(71\%\). The consistent ineffectiveness of offline DAP methods confirms that the existence of the offline and off-policy issue in DAP methods and greatly hinders the performance of aligning LLMs. The consistent superiority of online DAP methods via OAIF against their offline counterparts demonstrates that OAIF is a general framework effectively addressing these challenges.

### How do DAP methods using OAIF perform compared to RLHF/RLAIF?

Understanding the merits of DPO and RLHF is still a relatively open research question. We argue that comparing online DPO with RLAIF and RLHF, which is interesting on its own sake, can also contribute to answering this question.

We adopt similar experimental setups for RLAIF and RLHF as before, to make the comparison as fair as possible: we employ PaLM 2-L as the AI feedback model for RLAIF and use the same pre-collected preference dataset to train RMs for RLHF. Our training and optimisation procedures

follow Lee et al. (2023). Figure 3(a) shows the human evaluation results, where online DPO is more preferred than the other methods, in \(58\%\) of the time.

We emphasise that the RM used in RLAIF and RLHF is often not updated during policy training. As a result, its response assessment ability may not generalise, as the output distribution from \(\pi_{\theta^{t}}\) evolves. To verify this hypothesis, we also trained an online DPO with the same RM used for RLAIF. It outperforms RLAIF, but significantly underperforms online DPO with OAIF, with a win rate of \(<\)\(30\%\) judged by Gemini Pro. This experimental result supports the superiority of using LLMs over RMs to provide online feedback. Synchronously retraining the RM is feasible theoretically (Ziegler et al., 2019), but this would greatly complicate the training pipeline and increase training cost.

Despite the great performance of OAIF compared to various baselines, we found that OAIF tends to produce significantly longer responses. This may affect the LLM and human evaluation as both evaluators often prefer long generations, referred to as "length bias" by Singhal et al. (2023). To avoid the effect of such bias on analysing the performance of OAIF, we group the responses by their length, and plot the average quality score of each group. The results in Figure 3(b) show that online DPO with OAIF provides responses of higher quality than the other methods at fixed length, which further validates the effectiveness of OAIF.

### How does the size of the LLM annotator affect performance?

Another important dimension arising during our experiment is the size of the annotating LLMs. Previous experiments are all based on PaLM 2 L for feedback collection. To examine the feasibility of feedback from smaller LLM annotators, we then replicate online DPO experiments on TL;DR but with feedback from PaLM 2-XS and PaLM 2-S instead. Figure 5 shows the comparison to SFT baseline, offline DPO, RLAIF, and RLHF models we used, as in the previous experiments.

The size of the LLM annotator clearly has a significant impact on OAIF. Generally, as size increases, online DPO obtains better performance. Compared to the initial SFT model, online DPO with OAIF performs significantly better regardless of AI labeller model sizes, suggesting that even OAIF from a small LLM annotator is helpful in improving the performance of alignment. In particular, OAIF

Figure 4: **Left**: Fraction of outputs from online DPO, offline DPO, RLAIF, and RLHF being preferred in a 4-way comparison; **Right**: average quality scores (y-axis, higher is better) assigned to responses of different lengths (x-axis). The responses of each model were first grouped into six buckets by their length. The mean and standard error of responses in a bucket are then plotted as a data point. All results are judged by _human raters_ on TL;DR.

with PaLM 2-XS (i.e. an LLM annotator of same-size) achieves comparable performance to RLHF, although the latter learns from human feedback. Further human evaluation confirms this observation: OAIF with PaLM 2-XS obtains an overall quality score of 3.41 out of 5, slightly better than RLHF (3.38) and comparable to offline DPO (3.46).

### How prompt-controllable is OAIF?

While the necessity of LLM alignment has been widely recognised, what to align them with is still under debate, as human expectations vary greatly across regions and cultures, and may evolve over time. This indicates that the human preference annotation might change dramatically and frequently. In RLHF, such changes require re-annotating the preference dataset and re-training the RM, leading to high cost. In contrast, as OAIF is obtained through prompting the LLM annotator, its reward signal could be adjusted by simply modifying the prompts.

To examine this, we choose to explore the controllability of the length of responses by modifying the prompts to the LLM annotators. We take the online DPO model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) trained to be as _helpful_ as possible in Section 4.2 as the reference. We further train another two online DPO models with the same experiment setup, but in which the annotator is prompted to favour "_helpful and short_" and "_helpful and very short_" responses. The exact prompts given to the LLM annotators are provided in Table 6 and Table 8.

We display the average length of responses over training in Figure 5(a). The "short" and "very short" prompts given to the LLM annotator significantly shorten the responses from \(\sim\)\(120\) tokens to \(\sim\)\(90\) and \(\sim\)\(40\) tokens respectively. This direct evidence demonstrates that the behaviour of policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) can be significantly changed through prompting the annotating LLM differently, and the degree of the changes can be controlled as well.

However, the above changes come at a cost. In Figure 5(b), we plot the win rate of the "helpful", "helpful and short", and "helpful and very short" models against the initial SFT baseline. We noticed that the shorter responses become much less helpful, as judged by Gemini Pro. Nevertheless, they still improve the performance of the aligned model over the SFT baseline. This finding is also confirmed by human evaluation: from "helpful", "helpful and short" to "helpful and very short", the average quality score drops from 4.08, 3.72 to 3.26, all outperforming the SFT baseline (3.19) still.

### Can weaker AI labeller improve stronger LLM?

Section 4.5 shows that PaLM 2-XS could provide reasonable feedback that helps improving the alignment of LLMs, although it's significantly smaller than PaLM 2-S/L. We argue that our approach offers an orthogonal solution to the _weak-to-strong generalisation_ problem investigated by Burns et al. (2023). To verify that a weaker AI labeller can improve the performance of a stronger LLM model, we perform experiments using PaLM 2-S as the policy model (student) under two teacher

settings: one with PaLM 2-XS (weaker teacher) and the other with PaLM 2-L (stronger teacher). The side-by-side automatic evaluation results on Helpfulness comparing against the SFT baseline and offline DPO are given in Figure 7. Our results suggest that OAIF from a weaker teacher indeed improved the alignment of PaLM 2-S, though they are less effective compared with the OAIF from a stronger teacher.

We hereby emphasise the essential difference between the setup investigated by Burns et al. (2023) and ours. In their work, the tasks for the teacher and student model are both supervised learning tasks, thus they are of equal difficulty. However, in our work, the role of teacher is a simpler discriminative task (labelling preference), whereas the student model being aligned is given a more difficult one (generating proper responses). Following this perspective, our method is actually closer in spirit to the generative adversarial network proposed by Goodfellow et al. (2020), but doesn't train a particular discriminator.

## 5 Limitations

In this work, we study only the shift between distributions over responses, e.g. \(\rho(\bm{y}|\bm{x})\) and \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\dagger}}(\bm{y}|\bm{x})\). However, the shifts also happen on the user prompt distribution \(p_{\mathcal{X}}\) and the ground-truth human value function. Although the prompt-controllability of OAIF raises a possible solution to later case, the shift of \(p_{\mathcal{X}}\) is still a challenge. Since we extract prompts from the given preference dataset, our study assumes an in-distribution of prompts used for evaluation, thus lacks of evaluating the performance of the aligned LLMs on out-of-distribution prompts. In the meantime, we use a separate annotating prompt for each task studied in Section 4, whereas aligning LLMs towards general human values requires a universal prompt to get OAIF across tasks. We hereby argue that the principles for the constitutional AI proposed by Bai et al. (2022b) can serve as a good basis for extending this work. Moreover, the model aligned in Section 4 is mostly PaLM 2-XS, thus whether our conclusion holds after scaling up is not investigated. As pointed out by Bai et al. (2022a), it is harder to distinguish responses of higher quality. Therefore, how much can OAIF work for responses from larger LLMs requires further study.

## 6 Conclusion

To circumvent the offline feedback problem in direct alignment from preference (DAP) methods, such as DPO, we proposed Online AI Feedback (OAIF), a simple and effective way to make DAP methods online via AI feedback. We carried out an extensive empirical evaluation, using both AI and human evaluation, which showed the effectiveness of DAP methods combined with OAIF, against their offline counterparts. We also exhibited the tendency of offline DAP methods to overfit, and in contrast the usefulness of OAIF as a way to mitigate reward overoptimization. We further verified the generality of OAIF, as our empirical results hold for three prominent DAP methods: DPO, IPO and SLiC.

Beyond the empirical evaluation of OAIF, our work also contributes the comparison of two types of methods: online DAP methods (e.g., online DPO) and RLAIF. Since the feedback comes from identical models in both learning algorithms, our experiment setup ensures that the AI feedback is of the same quality and that only the learning procedures differ. Our experimental results in various tasks show that online DPO outperforms RLAIF and RLAIF, which further confirms the effectiveness of OAIF, compared to offline feedback. Moreover, we used response length as a test bed to demonstrate that the LLM annotator can be controlled easily using instruction prompts. This shows that OAIF can be used to achieve desirable alignment goals.

Overall, this work demonstrates the effectiveness and importance of OAIF for aligning LLMs, and paves the way for more scalable alignment strategies, requiring reduced human annotation effort.

Definition of On/offline and On/off-policy Learning in LLM Alignment

In this section, we are going to illustrate the online and offline, as well as the on-policy and off-policy aspects arising in DAP methods, RLHF, and RLAIF.

### Online learning vs offline learning

In RL, online learning, as opposed to offline learning, is about whether there are dynamic interactions between the policy and the environment Levine et al. (2020):

* **Online RL** refers to a scenario where the agent learns by directly interacting with the environment in real-time. Online RL is characterised by a continuous cycle of action, feedback, and learning, making it suitable for environments where the model can afford to learn through trial and error.
* **Offline RL**, on the other hand, involves learning from a fixed dataset of experiences, without further interaction with the environment. This dataset comprises previous interactions, which may have been generated by the same agent or different policies.

Let's now consider the setup of LLM alignment, following the notations we use in Section 2.

In DAP methods, suppose that the LLM policy at training step \(t\) is \(\pi_{\theta^{t}}\) and the minibatch trained on is \(\mathbb{B}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},\bm{y}_{i}^{+},\bm{y}_{i}^{-})\}\). The learning is then:

* **online** if \((\bm{y}_{i}^{+},\bm{y}_{i}^{-})=f(\bm{x},\bm{y}_{i}^{1},\bm{y}_{i}^{2})\) where \(f\) is an accessible preference function (either human labellers, RMs, or LLM annotators), and \((\bm{y}_{i}^{1},\bm{y}_{i}^{2})\sim\pi_{\theta^{t}}(\cdot|\bm{x}_{i})\);
* **offline** if \(\bm{y}_{i}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}_{i}^{-}\) were generated from a potentially different policy \(\rho\), ahead of training.

Therefore, in RLHF and RLAIF, their RL step is consistently _online_, as \(\bm{y}\) is sampled on-the-fly from the current policy, and the RM is always accessible to score \(\bm{y}\) over training. We discuss the RM step in RLHF and RLAIF separately in Appendix A.3.

To sum up, online vs offline learning is about whether the responses are generated by the current policy and the feedback is given on-the-fly by a preference function, or the responses along with the feedback are pre-collected and kept fixed.

### On-policy learning vs off-policy learning

The concepts of on-policy and off-policy learning in RL Sutton & Barto (2018) are given as follows:

* **On-policy learning** refers to a scenario where the learning algorithm improves the policy based on data generated by _the policy itself_.
* **Off-policy learning**, on the other hand, leverages data obtained from a different policy than the one being trained. Off-policy learning makes it possible to leverage the data generated by _other models_, or by previous versions of the policy.

In DAP methods, suppose the policy at training step \(t\) is \(\pi_{\theta^{t}}\) and the batch we use to train it is \(\mathbb{B}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},\bm{y}_{i}^{+},\bm{y}_{i}^{-})\}\). The learning is then:

* **On-policy** if \((\bm{y}_{i}^{+},\bm{y}_{i}^{-})\sim\pi_{\theta^{t}}(\cdot|\bm{x}_{i})\), i.e. both \(\bm{y}_{i}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}_{i}^{-}\) are sampled from \(\pi_{\theta^{t}}\) with \(\bm{x}_{i}\) as the input.
* **Off-policy** otherwise.

Therefore, DAP methods are off-policy if preference data comes from \(\rho\). Note that the conclusion is still true even if \(\rho=\pi_{\theta^{0}}\), since \(\pi_{\theta}\) keeps changing over training and \(\pi_{\theta^{t}}\neq\pi_{\theta^{0}}\) for \(t\neq 0\). By contrast, the approach proposed in this work is an on-policy alternative, as responses are sampled from the current policy at each training step.

As can be seen from the above definitions and the ones in Appendix A.1, for DAP methods, _offline_ DAP is also _off-policy_, as \(\bm{y}_{i}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}_{i}^{-}\) are not sampled from the current policy. As a side note, it is technically possible for the _online_ DAP to be _off-policy_, for instance if leveraging both online and offline data, but this practice is seldom used as of now.

Regarding the RL step in RLHF and RLAIF, as shown by the objective function in Equation 4 as well as the common practice in RLHF and RLAIF, the response to be scored by the RM is always from \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\):

\[\max_{\bm{\theta}}\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}\sim p_{\bm{x}},\bm{y}\sim\pi_{\bm{\theta} }(\bm{y}|\bm{x})}\left[r(\bm{x},\bm{y};\bm{\phi})-\beta\log\left(\frac{\pi_{ \bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}|\bm{x})}{\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}(\bm{y}|\bm{x})}\right) \right].\] (4)

Therefore, the RL step in RLIF is _on-policy_. Although the RL step can be technically off-policy, if partially or exclusively learning from samples from different policies, we note that such practice is not widespread at the time of writing.

To sum up, the on-policy and off-policy learning is about whether the distribution over responses \(\bm{y}_{i}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}_{i}^{-}\) learned from is \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}(\cdot|\bm{x}_{i})\).

### Distribution shift between RM training and inference

In RLHF (and RLAIF), the RM is usually trained on a given set of preference triplets \(\mathbb{D}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},\bm{y}_{i}^{+},\bm{y}_{i}^{-})\}_{i=1}^{N}\). Suppose that the RM is trained on \(\mathbb{D}\sim\rho\) and the LLM policy at training step \(t\) is \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\), the RM is then labelling:

* **in-distribution** samples, if \(\rho=\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\), i.e. if doing online data collection (Ziegler et al., 2019);
* **out-of-distribution** (OOD) samples, if \(\rho\neq\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\), which is the most common practice in RLHF.

In short, when an RM is trained on \(\mathbb{D}\sim\rho\neq\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\), there is then a shift between the RM training distribution (\(\mathbb{D}\sim\rho\)) and the RM inference distribution (\(\pi_{\bm{\theta}^{\ast}}\)).

## Appendix B Distribution Shift in Preference Data Curation

As illustrated in Section 2 and Figure 2, there might exist a distributional gap between samples from the preference dataset \(\mathbb{D}\) and samples from the policy \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\). To verify this gap, we use the preference dataset \(\mathtt{Stylistic\text{-}Continuation}\) collected by Stiennon et al. (2020) based on GPT-2 Large Radford et al. (2019). In \(\mathtt{Stylistic\text{-}Continuation}\), each prompt \(\bm{x}\) has a preferred summary \(\bm{y}^{+}\) and we randomly select a less preferred summary as \(\bm{y}^{-}\). We treat GPT-2 Large as the policy model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\), thus both \(\bm{y}^{+}\) and \(\bm{y}^{-}\) are on-policy responses. We then synthesised an off-policy response \(\bar{\bm{y}}\) by sampling from PaLM 2 S (\(\rho\), Anil et al., 2023).

Next, we inspect the log-probability of the preferred response \(\bm{y}^{+}\), the less preferred response \(\bm{y}^{-}\) and the off-policy response \(\bar{\bm{y}}\) using GPT-2 Large, i.e. \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\). As shown in Figure 8, there is a clear margin between the log-probability of on-policy and off-policy responses, where GPT-2 Large assigns significantly lower probabilities to generations from PaLM 2-S. Thus, the results verify the existence of the distribution shift between the on-policy and off-policy preference data. Moreover, our experiments in Section 4.2 on comparing online and on-policy learning with offline and off-policy learning also indirectly shows the significance of solving this problem.

## Appendix C Alignment Accuracy of Gemini Pro

Lee et al. (2023) showed that the judgement of PaLM 2-L correlates significantly with human, thus we adopted PaLM 2-L for online feedback collection during the training. To reduce the risk of over-fitting, we resort to Gemini Pro Gemini Team et al. (2023) instead for automatic evaluation at the test phase. However, the quality of Gemini Pro's judgement is not well studied yet.

In this section, we explore the correlation of Gemini Pro's judgement with human's judgement on the three datasets explored. Following Lee et al. (2023), we report alignment accuracy which measures the accuracy of LLM-labelled preferences with respect to human preferences.

Table 4 shows that Gemini Pro achieves an average alignment accuracy of 70.21%, which performs comparably to PaLM 2 L (70.72%). These results support our use of Gemini Pro for the judgement.

## Appendix D Win Rate of Online DPO and Offline DPO against SFT over Training on TL;DR by PaLM 2 L

## Appendix E Prompts for LLM Evaluation and AI Feedback Labelling

In this section, we list the prompts used for OAIF and the automatic evaluation. Each prompt follows a pairwise selection paradigm Lee et al. (2023), which includes both responses apart from the input context and asks LLM to select the preferred one. In practice, we instruct LLM to produce a preference distribution by computing the softmax of the log-probabilities of generating the tokens "1" vs. "2". We treat the probability as the preference score, based on which we provide online AI feedback and compute the win rate.

Lee et al. (2023) observed that the order of the two responses when instantiating the prompt has non-negligible impact on the selection, i.e. the so-called _positional bias_. To address this issue, we average the distribution over "{response1} vs. {response2}" and "{response2} vs. {response1}".

## Appendix F Human Evaluation

For human evaluation study we used Amazon Mechanical Turk platform 2. To run the human evaluation we created 3 projects for each of the 3 datasets correspondingly. The raters are presented with a set of responses from each of the evaluated model and are asked to rate each one of them on 1-5 scale, where 1 means poor response and 5 means great response. See Figure 10, Figure 11 and Figure 12 for the examples of tasks presented to the human raters.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Setting & TL;DR & Helpfulness & Harmlessness \\ \hline Gemini Pro vs. Human & 69.33\% & 72.04\% & 69.27\% \\ PaLM 2 L vs. Human & 73.23\% & 69.11\% & 69.83\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Alignment accuracy for Gemini Pro and PaLM 2 L vs. Human based on the _Detailed 0-shot_ prompt in Appendix E.

To avoid positional bias, we randomly shuffle the responses presented to the raters. We show each example to 3 different raters independently and then aggregate the results. To aggregate response-wise scores we average the values across all the raters that rated the corresponding response. To aggregate the final selection, we use the majority vote. If there's no clear winner according to majority voting, we consider this a tie.

We paid raters $0.75 per task for Reddit, $1.0 per task for Helpfullness (7-way) and $0.6 per task for Harmlessness (5-way).

## Appendix G Impact statements

We propose a new method to improve the alignment of AI with human values. Our method paves the way for more scalable alignment with reduced human efforts. Since we rely on AI feedback, to tackle other challenges in RLHF (Casper et al., 2023) and mitigate safety risks (Amodei et al., 2016), our approach must be considered within the larger context of responsible and safe AI.

A good summary is a shorter piece of text that has the essence of the original. It tries to accomplish the same purpose and conveys the key information from the original post. Below we define four evaluation axes for summary quality: coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality.

Coherence: This axis answers the question 'how coherent is the summary on its own?" A summary is coherent if it's easy to understand when read on its own and free of English errors. A summary is not coherent if it's difficult to understand what the summary is trying to say. Generally, it's more important that the summary is understandable than it being free of grammar errors.

Accuracy: This axis answers the question "does the factual information in the summary accurately match the post?" A summary is accurate if it doesn't say things that aren't in the article, it doesn't mix up people, and generally is not misleading.

Coverage: This axis answers the question "how well does the summary cover the important information in the post?" A summary has good coverage if intentions the main information from the post that's important to understand the situation described in the post. A summary has poor coverage if someone reading only the summary would be missing several important pieces of information about the situation in the post. A summary with good coverage should also match the purpose of the original post (e.g. to ask for advice).

Overall quality: This axis answers the question "how good is the summary overall at representing the post?" This can encompass all of the above axes of quality, as well as others you feel are important. If it's hard to find ways to make the summary better, the overall quality is good. If there are lots of different ways the summary can be made better, the overall quality is bad.

You are an expert summary rater. Given a piece of text and two of its possible summaries, output 1 or 2 to indicate which summary best adheres to coherence, accuracy, coverage, and overall quality as defined above.

The most important part of the task is choosing which of the Assistant's responses is more helpful and honest.

Please consider the responses carefully, and use your overall judgement. Ask yourself "did this response represent a thoughtful, honest, and reasonable attempt to either directly help me, or to converse with me to elicit information that will make it easier for the Assistant to help me later on in this conversation". Note that this is subtle - if the context is about a difficult personal situation, a helpful response might involve showing empathy and understanding. But if the context is about something practical, a helpful response may be a concise response, and not one that prolongs the interaction with irrelevant questions and comments. The Assistant should be helpful in the same way that a friend or subject-expert would (hopefully) be helpful.

Note that response containing "Human:" and/or "Assistant:" that tries to extend the conversation should be considered as not helpful and honest.

NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide thorough empirical experiment results to support the claims we made in the abstract and introduction in Section 4 and all appendices. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitations of this work are discussed in Section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: Our work is an empirical work, and we have empirically verified the existence of our research problem in Appendix B.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

**Experimental Result Reproducibility**

Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Our method is clearly illustrated in Section 3, along with all the hyperparameters we used in Section 4.1. The models used in this work can be fine-tuned via publicly available platform.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

**Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?

Answer: [No]

Justification: Unfortunately, we cannot release the code of this project, according our affiliation's policy. The necessary information to reproduce our experiment results, on the other hand, are covered sufficiently in Section 3 and 4.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experiment details are sufficiently covered in Section 3 and 4. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We directly compare outputs of the proposed method and various baselines to get the win rate in our experiments. Moreover, it is expensive to run experiments we tried in Section 4, especially the human evaluation. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided details for computational resources in the experimental setup section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We confirm that this work follows the ethics guidelines from NeurIPS-2024. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The broader impact of this work is discussed in Appendix G. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: We don't release models and data from this project.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: All works of the baselines used in this works are cited, and the credit is due to the authors of the original papers. Regarding the LLM infrastructure provided by our affiliation, we will acknowledge their credit in the camera-ready version by a separate acknowledgement section.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work doesn't release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided all the details of the human evaluation study, including the screenshots of tasks, full text of instructions and compensation details in Appendix F. Regarding the automatic evaluation, we provide all details in Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [No] Justification: We checked the "This project may contain potentially explicit or offensive content, for example, nudity." box when creating the task on Amazon Mechanical Turk platform and set the task visibility setting to private to make sure the tasks are not shown to underage raters.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
