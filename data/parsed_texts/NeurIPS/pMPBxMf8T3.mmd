###### Abstract

Models are expected to engage in invariance learning, which involves distinguishing the core relations that remain consistent across varying environments to ensure the predictions are safe, robust and fair. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, we show that model has the potential to learn invariance through standard training procedures. In other words, this paper studies the implicit bias of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) over heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias drives the model learning towards an invariant solution. We call the phenomenon the _implicit invariance learning_. Specifically, we theoretically investigate the multi-environment low-rank matrix sensing problem where in each environment, the signal comprises (i) a lower-rank invariant part shared across all environments; and (ii) a significantly varying environment-dependent spurious component. The key insight is, through simply employing the large step size large-batch SGD sequentially in each environment without any explicit regularization, the oscillation caused by heterogeneity can provably prevent model learning spurious signals. The model reaches the invariant solution after certain iterations. In contrast, model learned using pooled SGD over all data would simultaneously learn both the invariant and spurious signals. Overall, we unveil another implicit bias that is a result of the symbiosis between the heterogeneity of data and modern algorithms, which is, to the best of our knowledge, first in the literature.

## 1 Introduction

In real applications, the machine learning models are often heavily over-parameterized, which means that the number of parameters exceeds the number of data. For over-parameterized models,the generalization in the general case becomes ill-posed. One key insight to generalize well is the implicit preference of the optimization algorithm which plays the role of regularization/bias [45; 22]. Nowadays, there are several kinds of implicit bias discovered from optimization algorithms under different models and settings. One common feature of the bias is the simplicity which concludes that (stochastic) gradient-based algorithms perform the incremental learning with the model complexity gradually increasing. Therefore, benign generalization is possible even when the number of training data is limited. For example, Li et al. [31], Gunasekar et al. [18] show that unregularized gradient descent can find the low-rank solution efficiently for matrix sensing models. Kalimeris et al. [27], Gissin et al. [16], Jiang et al. [24], and Jin et al. [25] further show that (Stochastic) Gradient Descent ((S)GD) learn models from simple ones to complex ones. Most of the existing works study the implicit bias of algorithms over a single distributional environment data.

However, data in modern practice are often collected from multiple sources, thus exhibiting certain heterogeneity. For example, medical data may come from multiple hospitals, and training sets for large language models consist of numerous corpus from the Internet [1]. So _what is the impact of implicit bias for standard training algorithms over heterogeneous data?_

This paper initializes the study and shows that implicit bias of SGD on an over-parameterized model using multi-environment heterogeneous data and shows that the implicit bias can not only save the number of training data but also, more importantly, drive the model learning the invariant relation across diverse environments.

Learning the invariant relation that remains consistent across varying environments [43] has garnered significant attention in recent years. Though the association-based standard machine learning pipelines can achieve a good performance with identical data distributions, a higher requirement is to make predictions robustly generalize over diverse downstream environments. Learning invariance produces reliable, fair, robust predictions against strong structural mechanism perturbation. More importantly, it opens the door to pursue causality blind to any prior knowledge and can unveil direct causes when the heterogeneity among environments is sufficient [17; 43]. While existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning, this work shows that implicit bias of algorithms over heterogeneous data has the potential to automatically learn the invaraince. We call the phenomenon _the implicit invariance learning_, partially explains why active invariance learning may not be necessary in practice [42]. Our key insight is:

Figure 1: An illustration comparing training from aggregated data versus from heterogeneous data. The left example resembles the case where the model is trained on complete datasets, resulting in a stable spurious signal that the model tends to fit. The right example simulates a two-environment case where the spurious signal changes at each step. This oscillation creates a contraction effect, preventing the model from fitting the spurious signal.

_The heterogeneity of the data, and the large step size adopted in the optimization algorithm jointly provide strong multiplicative oscillations in the spurious signal space, which prevents the model from moving in the direction of unstable and spurious solutions, thus resulting in an implicit bias to the invariant solution._

We illustrate it rigorously through a simple, canonical but insightful model - multi-environment matrix sensing, where in each environment the signal consists of two parts: an invariant low-rank matrix \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) and an environment-varying spurious low-rank matrix \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) where environment \(e\in\mathcal{E}\), the set of environments. For each environment \(e\in\mathcal{E}\), the joint distribution of \((\mathbf{X}^{(e)},y^{(e)})\) satisfies \(y^{(e)}=\langle\mathbf{X}^{(e)},\mathbf{A}^{\star}\rangle+\langle\mathbf{X}^{ (e)},\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\rangle\) with matrix inner product \(\langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\rangle=\mathrm{Trace}(\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{A})\). Here \(\mathbf{X}^{(e)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) is a random linear measurement and \(y^{(e)}\in\mathbb{R}\) is the response. We consider the case that association does not coincide invariance (or causality), where averaging over all the environments, the best prediction of \(y\) given \(\mathbf{X}\) is

\[f^{\star}(\mathbf{X})=\underbrace{\langle\mathbf{X},\mathbf{A}^{\star} \rangle}_{invariant\ part}+\underbrace{\langle\mathbf{X},\mathbb{E}_{e}[ \mathbf{A}^{(e)}]\rangle}_{spurious\ part}\qquad\text{with}\qquad\mathbb{E}_{e} [\mathbf{A}^{(e)}]\neq 0.\]

In this case, it is not surprising that given enough data, the standard empirical risk minimizer algorithm, for example, running SGD on pooled data, will return a solution that converges to \(f^{\star}\), which diverges from the invariant solution. In this paper, we will show that surprisingly, if each batch is sampled from data in one environment rather than data in all the environments, the heterogeneity in the environments together with the implicit regularization effects in the SGD algorithm can drive it towards the invariant solution. This can be stated informally as follows.

**Theorem 1** (Main result, informal).: _Under a sufficient heterogeneity condition and some regularity conditions in matrix sensing, if we adopt an over-parameterized model and runs stochastic gradient descent where batches are sampled from one environment, i.e., \(\mathtt{HeteroSGD}\) (Algorithm 3), then_

\[\|\hat{\theta}_{\mathtt{HeteroSGD}}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\|_{F}=o_{\mathbb{P}}(1).\]

_Instead, the standard approach, i.e., \(\mathtt{PooledSGD}\), will return solution \(\hat{\theta}_{\mathtt{PooledSGD}}\) satisfying_

\[\|\hat{\theta}_{\mathtt{PooledSGD}}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\|_ {F}=o_{\mathbb{P}}(1)\qquad\text{thus}\qquad\|\hat{\theta}_{\mathtt{PooledSGD}}- \mathbf{A}^{\star}\|_{F}=\Omega_{\mathbb{P}}(1).\]

An illustration of our result is shown in Figure 1. Our result demonstrates that implicit bias of commonly used algorithms over heterogeneous data has the potential to drive the model to learn the invariant relation. Such a result thereby provides an explanation for why models may attain some robust and even causal prediction after SGD training.

We emphasize that the previous implicit bias studies are restricted to the same data distribution generalization, under which the population-level minimizer \(f^{\star}\) minimizing the loss with infinite data is the target in pursuit. However, both the population-level minimizer and those "good" solutions under previous studies diverge from an invariant solution in general and are no longer benign in this context, this is termed as "curse of endogeneity" [12; 13].

**Notations.** We use the conventional notations \(O(\cdot),o(\cdot),\Omega(\cdot)\) to ignore the absolute constants, \(\tilde{O}(\cdot),\tilde{o}(\cdot),\tilde{\Omega}(\cdot)\) to further ignore the polynomial logarithmic factors. Similarly, \(a\lesssim b\) means that there exists an absolute constant \(C>0\) such that \(a\lesssim Cb\). We also denote it as \(a\ll b\), \(b\gg a\) if \(a=o(b)\). Unless otherwise specified, we use lowercase bold letters such as \(\mathbf{v}\) to represent vectors, and use \(\|\mathbf{v}\|\) to denote its Euclidean norm. We use uppercase bold letters such as \(\mathbf{X}\) to represent matrices and use \(\|\mathbf{X}\|,\|\mathbf{X}\|_{F},\|\mathbf{X}\|_{*}\) to denote its operator norm, Frobenius norm and nuclear norm, respectively. We use \(\kappa(\mathbf{X})\) to denote the condition number, which is \(\sigma_{\max}(\mathbf{X})/\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{X})\). We define \(Z=o_{\mathbb{P}}(1)\) if the random variable \(Z\) satisfies \(Z\overset{P}{\rightarrow}0\).

## 2 Related Works

**Implicit Regularization.** It is believed that implicit bias is a key factor in why over-parameterized models can generalize well. Through the analysis of certain settings, existing results suggest that GD/SGD prefers solutions with specific properties [45; 19; 41; 38; 23], or specific local landscapes [3; 9; 32; 38]. For the matrix sensing problem, several works [18; 31; 27; 16; 46; 52; 24; 25] analyze the (S)GD dynamics to show how (S)GD recovers the ground truth low-rank matrix. Recently, the effects of large step size have aroused much attention, particularly the edge-of-stability phenomenon [8]. Lu et al. [37] investigates the phenomenon "benign oscillation", which suggests that SGD with a large learning rate can effectively help neural networks learn weak features thereby benefiting generalization. Several works [20; 48; 11] show that label noise with large step size has a sparsifying effect for sparse linear regression. This paper instead studies multi-environment scenarios and fills in the understanding of the impact of randomness on matrix sensing problems.

**Federated Learning.** Federated learning [39; 26] is a machine learning paradigm where data is stored separately and locally on multiple clients and not exchanged, and clients collaboratively train a model. Extensive work has focused on designing effective decentralized algorithms (e.g. [39; 29]) while preserving privacy (e.g. [10; 7]). The importance of fairness in federated learning has also garnered attention [30; 33]. One important issue in federated learning is to handle the heterogeneity across the data and hardware. Our work shows that by training with certain stochastic gradient descent methods, the system can automatically remove the bias from the individual environment and thus learn the invariant features. Our work provides insights into discovering the implicit regularization effects of standard decentralized algorithms.

**Invariance Learning.** This research line initiates from causal inference literature [43; 40; 15] since invariant covariates correspond to _direct cause_. From theoretic aspects, Fan et al. [13] proposes the EILLS method that provably achieves invariant variable selections under mild conditions for linear models. Invariance learning has raised much attention in machine learning since Arjovsky et al. [2] proposes the structural-agnostic framework IRM. Subsequent works analyze its limitations [44; 28] or propose variant methods [50; 36; 34; 21; 51] as regularization and reweighting. About the failure of classical methods, Wald et al. [49] construct a hard problem and show that interpolation-based methods fail to learn invariance.

To the best of our knowledge, all the existing works consider specific algorithms to realize invariance learning or constructing hard cases that classical methods fail. In contrast, this paper studies commonly used training algorithms and aims to understand how the algorithms can go beyond learning associations to achieve invariance learning in certain scenarios.

## 3 Main Results

### Problem Formulation

**Data Generating Process.** Suppose we observe data from a set of environments \(\mathcal{E}\) sequentially. Let \(D\) be some distribution on \(\mathcal{E}\). At each time \(t=0,1,\ldots\), we receive \(m\) samples \(\{(\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},y_{i}^{(e_{t})})\}_{i=1}^{m}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\times\mathbb{R}\) from environment \(e_{t}\sim D\) satisfying

\[y_{i}^{(e_{t})}=\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{A}^{\star}\rangle+ \langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t})}\rangle,\quad i=1,\ldots m,\] (1)

where \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) is an unknown rank \(r_{1}\)\(d\times d\) symmetric and positive definite matrix that represents the _true signal_ invariant across different environments, \(\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t})}\) is an unknown \(d\times d\) symmetric matrix with rank at most \(r_{2}\) that represents the _spurious signal_ that may vary. Here \(\langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\rangle=\mathrm{trace}(\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{ A})\). We aim to estimate the \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) using data from heterogeneous environments.

**Algorithm.** We consider running batch gradient descent on an over-parametrization of the model, where at each step \(t\) one gradient update is performed using the data from environment \(e_{t}\). To be specific, we parameterize our fitted model as \(y=\langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\top}\rangle\) with a \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{U}\) for the sake of simplicity. One can generally use the parameterization \(\mathbf{X}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\) by the same technique of HaoChen et al. [20], Fan et al. [14]. We initialize \(\mathbf{U}\) as \(\mathbf{U}_{0}=\alpha\mathbf{I}_{d}\) for some small enough \(\alpha>0\). At timestep \(t\), we run a one-step gradient descent on the standard least squares loss using \(\{(\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},y_{i}^{(e_{t})})\}_{i=1}^{m}\):

\[L_{t}(\mathbf{U})=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left(y_{i}^{(e_{t})}-\langle \mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\top}\rangle\right)^{2}.\] (2)

That is, \(\mathbf{U}_{0}=\alpha\mathbf{I}_{d}\) and

\[\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\nabla L_{t}(\mathbf{U}_{t})=\left( \mathbf{I}_{d}-\eta\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})}, \mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\rangle-y_{i}^{(e_{t})})\mathbf{X}_{i}^{ (e_{t})}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\] (3)for \(t=0,\ldots,T-1\). See a complete presentation in Algorithm 3.

```  Set \(\mathbf{U}_{0}=\alpha\mathbf{I}_{d}\), where \(\alpha\) is a small positive constant to be determined later.  Set large step size \(\eta=\Theta(1)\). for\(t=1,\ldots,T-1\)do  Receive \(m\) samples \(\{(\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},y_{i}^{(e_{t})})\}_{i=1}^{m}\) from current environment \(e_{t}\).  Gradient Descent \(\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\frac{\eta}{m}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left( \left\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} \right\rangle-y_{i}^{(e_{t})}\right)\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})}\right]\mathbf{U}_ {t}\). endfor Output:\(\mathbf{U}_{T}\). ```

**Algorithm 3**HeteroSGD

**Standard Method: Pooled Stochastic Gradient Descent.** As a comparison, we consider the standard approach where data in each batch come from different environments and the weights follow from \(D\). To be specific, the pooled stochastic gradient descent over all environments adopted the update rule

\[\mathbf{U}\leftarrow\mathbf{U}-\eta\nabla\bar{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbf{U}),\text{ where }\bar{\mathcal{L}}(\mathbf{U})=\frac{1}{2m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\left[\left(y_{i}^{(e_{i })}-\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{i})},\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\top}\rangle\right)^ {2}\right],\quad e_{i}\sim D.\] (4)

### Assumptions

We first impose some standard assumptions used in matrix sensing. Since we are dealing with learning true invariant signals from heterogeneous environments, several conditions on the structure of the invariant signal \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) and the spurious signals \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\) should be imposed.

**Assumption 1** (Invariant and Spurious Space).: _There exists \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{2}}\) both with orthogonal columns, i.e., \((\mathbf{U}^{\star})^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}=\mathbf{I}_{r_{1}}\) and \((\mathbf{V}^{\star})^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}=\mathbf{I}_{r_{2}}\) such that_

* \(C\log^{4}(d)\leq r_{1}\wedge r_{2}\) _and_ \(d\geq(r_{1}+r_{2})^{C}\) _for some large absolute constant_ \(C\)_._
* \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}(\mathbf{U}^{\star})^{\top}\)_._
* \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}=\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e)}(\mathbf{V}^{\star})^ {\top}\) _with some symmetric_ \(r_{2}\times r_{2}\) _matrix_ \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e)}\) _for any_ \(e\in\mathcal{E}\)_._
* \(\|(\mathbf{U}^{\star})^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\|\leq\epsilon_{1}\) _for some small quantity_ \(\epsilon_{1}\geq 0\)_._

In Condition (b), we assume that the singular values of the true signal \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) are the same to simplify the presentation since our main focus is to reduce the spurious signals. It holds for the basic case when there is only one invariant signal, i.e. \(r_{1}=1\). The analysis for varying singular values using the technique of Li et al. [31] is deferred to Section D in Appendix. Other assumptions are usual and easy to achieve. Condition (a) requires that the total dimension of invariant signals and spurious signals are small relative to the ambient dimension \(d\). Condition (c) resembles the RIP condition [6] in sparse feature selection [5]. Condition (d) says the overlap of invariant subspace and spurious subspace should be small. Such a condition can be easily satisfied for random projections in high dimensions where \(r_{1}+r_{2}\ll d\), under which we have \(\epsilon_{1}=\Theta(\sqrt{(r_{1}+r_{2})/d})\), see Proposition 1 below.

**Proposition 1**.: _Let \(\mathbf{M}_{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{1}}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{2}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{2}}\) be two mutually independent random matrix with i.i.d. \(N(0,1)\) entries. Denote their QR decompositions as \(\mathbf{M}_{1}=\mathbf{U}_{1}^{\star}\mathbf{R}_{1}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{2}=\mathbf{U}_{2}^{\star}\mathbf{R}_{2}\), respectively. Then there exists a universal constant \(C_{1}>0\) such that_

\[\left\|(\mathbf{U}_{1}^{\star})^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{2}^{\star}\right\|\leq t\sqrt {\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}},\] (5)

_with probability at least \(1-4\exp\left(-C_{1}^{-1}d\right)-2\exp\left(-C_{1}^{-1}(r_{1}+r_{2})t^{2}\right)\)._

**Assumption 2** (Regularity on Spurious Signal \(\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}\)).: _There exists some constant-level quantity \(M_{1},M_{2}\) such that_

\[\sup_{e\in\mathcal{E},i\in[r_{2}]}|\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}_{ii}|<M_{1}\qquad\text{and} \qquad\min_{i\in[r_{2}]}\frac{\operatorname{Var}_{e\sim D}[\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}_{ ii}]}{1+\left|\operatorname{E}_{e\sim D}[\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}_{ii}]\right|}>M_{2},\] (6)

_where \(M_{1}<C_{0}M_{2}\) for some universal constant \(C_{0}>0\). Moreover, \(\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}\) is strongly diagonal dominant for any \(e\in\mathcal{E}\), i.e.,_

\[\sup_{e\in\mathcal{E}}\max_{i\in[r_{2}]}r_{2}^{2}\sum_{j\neq i}|\bm{\Sigma}^{( e)}_{ij}|\leq\frac{c_{o}}{M_{2}^{1.5}}\] (7)

_where \(c_{o}>0\) is some universal constant._

The first inequality in (6) requires that all the spurious signals have a uniform bound, under which a fixed step size can be adopted. The second inequality in (6) requires that the heterogeneity of the spurious signals be large compared to the bias of the spurious signals. For example, some variables receive different interventions in different environments. The condition (7) is imposed to prevent the explosion of spurious signals during training. When the diagonal and off-diagonal elements are of the same order, empirical studies and theoretical analyses in some toy examples illustrate the failure of recovering \(\bm{\mathrm{A}}^{\star}\). Condition (d) in Assumption 1 and (6) resemble the RIP condition in sparse feature selection. Example 1 can fulfill all our conditions.

Finally, we impose assumptions on measurements. Recall the RIP condition [6]:

**Definition 1** (RIP for Matrices [6]).: _A set of linear measurements \(\bm{\mathrm{X}}_{1},\ldots,\bm{\mathrm{X}}_{m}\) satisfy the restricted isometry property (RIP) with parameter \((s,\delta)\) if the following inequality_

\[(1-\delta)\|\bm{\mathrm{M}}\|_{F}^{2}\leq\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\bm{ \mathrm{X}}_{i},\bm{\mathrm{M}}\rangle^{2}\leq(1+\delta)\|\bm{\mathrm{M}}\|_{ F}^{2}\] (8)

_holds for any \(d\times d\) matrix \(\bm{\mathrm{M}}\) with rank at most \(s\)._

**Assumption 3** (RIP Condition for Linear Measurements).: \(\bm{\mathrm{X}}_{1}^{(e_{t})},\ldots,\bm{\mathrm{X}}_{m}^{(e_{t})}\) _satisfies the RIP with parameter \(s=4(r_{1}+r_{2})\) and \(\delta\lesssim\frac{1}{(M_{2}\log(d))^{1.5}r_{2}^{2.5}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}}\) for all \(e\in\mathcal{E}\)._

It is known from Candes and Plan [6] that for symmetric Gaussian measurements, sample complexity \(m=\tilde{\Omega}(ds\delta^{-2},M_{2})=d\operatorname{poly}(r,\log(d))\ll d^{2}\) suffices.

### Convergence Analysis

The main conceptual challenge in the problem is that any \(\bm{\mathrm{U}}\) with \(\bm{\mathrm{U}}\bm{\mathrm{U}}^{\top}=\bm{\mathrm{A}}^{\star}\) is no longer a local minimum since \(\operatorname{\mathbb{E}}_{e\sim D}[\bm{\Sigma}^{(e)}]\) is non-zero and could even be comparable to \(\bm{\mathrm{A}}^{\star}\). This further implies that running stochastic gradient descent on pooled data will fail to recover \(\bm{\mathrm{A}}^{\star}\). However, our main result below shows that simply adopting online gradient descent with "heterogeneous batches" can successfully recover the true, invariant signal from heterogeneous environments.

**Theorem 2** (Main Theorem).: _Under Assumption 1-3, suppose further that \(\epsilon_{1}<\delta/2\). Define \(\delta^{\star}:=(c_{v}M_{2}\log(d))^{1.5}\delta r_{2}^{2}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\) for some absolute constant \(c_{v}\). If we choose \(\eta\in(24M_{2}^{-1},\frac{1}{64}M_{1}^{-1})\) and \(\alpha\in(1/d^{4},1/d^{2})\), then running Algorithm 3 in \(T=\Theta(\log(\alpha^{-1})/\eta)\) steps, the algorithm outputs \(\bm{\mathrm{U}}_{T}\) that satisfies_

\[\|\bm{\mathrm{U}}_{T}\bm{\mathrm{U}}_{T}^{\top}-\bm{\mathrm{A}}^{\star}\|_{F} \leq C\max\{\delta^{\star}{}^{2}\sqrt{r_{1}}M_{1}^{2},\delta^{\star}M_{1}\} \log^{2}d\] (9)

_for some absolute constant \(C\), with probability over \(0.99\)._

Consider the case where \(r_{1},r_{2},M_{1}\) are sufficiently large but is regarded at constant level, and the batch size \(m\), ambient dimension \(d\) satisfy \(d\log^{2}(d)\ll m\). It follows from the RIP result [6] with \(\delta=\Theta(\sqrt{d/m})\) and Theorem 2 that one can adopt \(\alpha=\Theta(d^{-1})\), \(\eta=\Theta(1)\), and early stop \(T=\Theta(\log d)\) such that

\[\mathbb{P}\left[\|\bm{\mathrm{U}}_{T}\bm{\mathrm{U}}_{T}^{\top}-\bm{\mathrm{A}} ^{\star}\|_{F}\leq C_{1}\log(d)\sqrt{d/m}\right]\geq 1-C_{1}(d\log(d)/m)^{2/5}\] (10)provided \(\epsilon_{1}\leq C_{1}^{-1}\sqrt{d/m}\) with some large enough constant \(C_{1}>0\). In this case, it follows from (10) that one can distinguish the true invariant signals from those spurious heterogeneous ones since

\[\max\left\{\left\|(\mathbf{U}^{\star})^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top }\mathbf{U}^{\star}-\mathbf{I}_{r_{1}}\right\|_{2},\left\|(\mathbf{V}^{\star})^ {\top}\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\right\|_{2}\right\} =o_{\mathbb{P}}(1).\] (11)

The underlying reason why the online gradient descent can recover \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) is that the heterogeneity of \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\) and the randomness in the SGD algorithm jointly prevent it from moving in the direction of spurious signals. At the same time, the standard RIP conditions and the almost orthogonality between \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) in Condition 1 ensure a steady movement towards the invariant signals.

Conversely, running pooled stochastic gradient descent using all data will result in a biased solution:

**Theorem 3** (Negative Result for Pooled SGD).: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 2 and some mild conditions, for the certain case where \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\perp\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{e\in D}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e)}=\mathbf{I}_{r_{2}}\), if we perform SGD over all samples with batch size \(m=\Omega(d\operatorname{poly}(r_{1}+r_{2},M_{1}M_{2},\log(d)))\) and ends with \(T=\Theta(\log d)\), then \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\) keeps approaching \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\), in the sense that_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{ \star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right\|_{F}\leq o (1),\] (12)

_during which for all \(t=0,1,\ldots,T\):_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\right\|_{F} \gtrsim\sqrt{r_{1}\wedge r_{2}}.\] (13)

The convergence (12) is similar to (9) in derivation. To see this, since each update uses batch from the whole data, the update in effect degenerates to the case for one environment with no heterogeneity. Now the one-environment invariant solution \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) in (9) is exactly equal to \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{ \star}{}^{\top}\) in (12). One can also show that for sufficiently large \(t\), \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\) is sufficiently away from \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\), indicating that the biased estimation is not attributed to early stopping.

Our framework can be applied to learning the invariant features for a two-layer neural network with quadratic activation functions, by recognizing the fact that [31]:

\[\mathbf{1}^{\top}q(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{x})=\left\langle\mathbf{x}\mathbf{x}^{ \top},\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}^{\top}\right\rangle,\] (14)

where \(q(\cdot)\) is the element-wise quadratic function. The following example shows that Theorem 7 implies success of invariant feature learning for 2-layer NN when the ground truth invariant and variant features are independent random vectors sampled from normal distribution.

**Example 1** (Two-Layer NN with Quadratic Activation).: _Let \(\mathbf{a}_{1},\cdots,\mathbf{a}_{r}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) be random vectors sampled from normal distribution \(N(0,\frac{1}{d}\mathbf{I}_{d})\). For environment \(e\in\mathcal{E}\), suppose the target function is determined by \(r_{1}\) invariant features and \(r_{2}\) variant admits that for each sample \((\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)},y_{i}^{(e)})\):_

\[y_{i}^{(e)}=\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1}}q(\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)})+ \sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}q(\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)})= \left\langle\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)},\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1}} \mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}+\sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}\mathbf{a} _{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\right\rangle,\] (15)

_which is equivalent to matrix sensing problem with_

\[\mathbf{A}^{\star}=\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1}}\mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\,\ \mathbf{A}^{(e)}=\sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}\mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{ \top}\ \text{and}\ \mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e)}=\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}{}^{\top}.\] (16)

_And our goal is to train a two-layer NN to capture the invariant features \((\mathbf{a}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{a}_{r_{1}})\). In this example, the invariant component and the spurious component have a more intuitive characterization: they are two disjoint groups of neurons. Moreover, it can be shown that the invariant and variant features are nearly orthogonal (Proposition 1). Then if \(\{a_{j}^{(e)}\}_{j,e}\) satisfies \(\frac{\sup_{e,j}\{|a_{j}^{(e)}|\}\cdot\max_{j}\{1+|E_{e}a_{j}^{(e)}|\}}{\min_{j }\{\operatorname{Var}_{i}[a_{j}^{(e)}]\}}<c_{0}\) for some absolute constant \(c_{0}\), the variant version of Algorithm 3 returns a solution that only significantly selects invariant features with probability over \(0.99\).

We define the invariant part \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{1}}\), spurious part \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times r_{2}}\) in \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\) as

\[\mathbf{R}_{t}:=\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}\qquad\text{and} \qquad\mathbf{Q}_{t}:=\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\] (17)and let the residual be the error part, that is,

\[\mathbf{E}_{t}:=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top}+ \mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}\right)=(\mathbf{I}-\mathbf{U}^{\star }\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}) \mathbf{U}_{t}.\] (18)

It is worth noticing that \(\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}\) and \(\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}=\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\) are both orthogonal projections, and \(\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}:=\mathbf{I}-\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}- \mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}\) is not.

It follows from the model (1) and the gradient update that

\[\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X }_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}- \mathbf{A}^{(e_{t})}\rangle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})}\mathbf{U}_{t}.\] (19)

We use operator \(\mathsf{E}_{e_{t}}\circ(\mathbf{M})\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) to denote the RIP error of the batch at time step \(t\) for some \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{M}\), i.e.,

\[\mathsf{E}_{e_{t}}\circ(\mathbf{M}):=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X }_{i}^{(e_{t})},\mathbf{M}\rangle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e_{t})}-\mathbf{M}.\] (20)

We also write \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{M}):=\mathsf{E}_{e_{t}}\circ(\mathbf{M})\) when there is no ambiguity, and we simply denote matrix \(\mathsf{E}_{t}=\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}- \mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma }_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\) with \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}:=\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}\). Then the gradient update of \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\) can be written as

\[\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} -\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma }_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\underbrace{ \mathsf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}}_{\text{RIP Error}}.\] (21)

Combining our definition (17) with (21), we obtain

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{R}_{t+1}&=\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}- \eta(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{ }^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}) \mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\mathsf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right)^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star }\\ &=\underbrace{(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}+ \eta\mathbf{I})\mathbf{R}_{t}}_{\text{Dominating Dynamics}}+\eta\underbrace{ \mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star} {}^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}}_{\text{Interaction Error}}-\eta\underbrace{ \mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathsf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}^{\star}}_{\text{RIP Error}}. \end{split}\] (22)

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}&=\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}- \eta(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star }{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}) \mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\mathsf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right)^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star }\\ &=\underbrace{\mathbf{Q}_{t}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t} \mathbf{Q}_{t}+\eta\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}}_{\text{Fuctuation Dynamics}}+\eta\underbrace{\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}}_{ \text{Interaction Error}}-\eta\underbrace{\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathsf{E}_{t} \mathbf{V}^{\star}}_{\text{RIP Error}}.\end{split}\] (23)

For the error part, combining (18) with (21) yields

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{E}_{t+1}&=\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res }}\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{ \star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top})\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta \mathsf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right)\\ &=\underbrace{\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} \mathbf{U}_{t})}_{\text{Strinkage Dynamics}}+\eta\underbrace{\mathrm{Id}_{ \mathrm{res}}(\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top})\mathbf{U}_{t}}_{\text{ Interaction Error}}-\eta\underbrace{\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathsf{E}_{t} \mathbf{U}_{t}}_{\text{RIP Error}}.\end{split}\] (24)

For the invariant part \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\), though different singular values of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) will grow at different speeds because of the randomness from RIP error and \(e_{t}\), we claim that all the singular values of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) are close to \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) during the training process, where the scalar sequence \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) is defined recursively as

\[\mathrm{R}_{t+1}=(1-\eta\mathrm{R}_{t}^{2}+\eta)\mathrm{R}_{t},\quad\mathrm{R}_ {0}=\alpha.\] (25)

The dynamics of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) are very complicated because of the randomness of \(e_{t}\) and the RIP error. Such a dynamic will also impact that of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) through the complicated dependencies between these three parts, which will also make it difficult to utilize probability inequalities applicable under independence. Instead, we claim that such a "fluctuation dynamics" of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) can be controlled as

\[\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|<\mathrm{poly}(\log(d),r,M_{1})\mathrm{L}_{t}\text{ \ with \ }\mathrm{L}_{t}=\begin{cases}\alpha&,\ t<O(\frac{1}{\eta}\log(r_{1}+r_{2}))\\ O(\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathrm{R}_{t})&,\ t\geq O(\frac{1}{\eta} \log(r_{1}+r_{2}))\end{cases}.\] (26)

## 6 Conclusions

This paper explains that implicit bias of heterogeneity leads the model learning towards invariance and causality. We show that under heterogeneous environments, online gradient descent with large step sizes can select out the invariant matrix in the over-parameterized matrix sensing models. We conjecture that both heterogeneity and stochasticity are indispensable. Over-parameterization may not be. We leave future studies to understand the necessity of the three factors.

Figure 4: The left figure shows that the large step size helps eliminate the spurious signal. The right figure shows that both true and spurious signals flow up when \(\eta\) is small, and when \(\eta\geq 0.05\), the spurious signal is eliminated.

Figure 5: The left figure shows that heterogeneity helps eliminate the spurious signal. The right figure shows that Pooled SGD fits invariant signal and spurious signal simultaneously without distinction.

## Appendix A Deferred Proofs in Theorem 2

This section is organized as follows: In Section A.1, we state some useful properties from the definition of RIP. In Section A.2 and A.3, we formally define the auxiliary sequences we use to control the dynamics and develop several useful lemmas we frequently use. In Section A.4 and A.5, we bound \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) respectively. In Section A.6 and A.7, we prove Theorem 4 and Theorem 5.

### Restricted Isometry Properties

In this section, we list some useful implications of the definition of RIP property. Below we assume the set of linear measurements \(\mathbf{A}_{1}^{(e_{t})},\ldots,\mathbf{A}_{m}^{(e_{t})}\ \in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) satisfy the RIP property with parameter\((r,\delta)\) and denote \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{M}):=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{ \left(e_{t}\right)},\mathbf{M}\rangle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{\left(e_{t}\right)}- \mathbf{M}\) for some symmetric \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{M}\). Some lemmas are direct corollaries and some lemmas serve as extensions to rank above \(r\) case. The proof of these lemmas can be found in Li et al. [31].

**Lemma 1**.: _Under the assumption of this subsection, if \(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}\) are \(d\times d\) matrices with rank at most \(r\), then_

\[|\langle\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{X}),\mathbf{Y}\rangle|\leq\delta\| \mathbf{X}\|_{F}\|\mathbf{Y}\|_{F}.\] (27)

**Lemma 2**.: _Under the assumption of this subsection, if \(\mathbf{X}\) id \(d\times d\) matrix with rank at most \(r\) and \(\mathbf{Z}\) is a \(d\times d^{\prime}\) matrix, then_

\[\|\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{X})\mathbf{Z}\|\leq\delta\|\mathbf{X}\|_{F}\| \mathbf{Z}\|.\] (28)

**Lemma 3**.: _Under the assumption of this subsection, if \(\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}\) are \(d\times d\) matrices and \(\mathbf{Y}\) has rank at most \(r\), then_

\[|\langle\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{X}),\mathbf{Y}\rangle|\leq\delta\| \mathbf{X}\|_{*}\|\mathbf{Y}\|_{F}.\] (29)

**Lemma 4**.: _Under the assumption of this subsection, if \(\mathbf{X}\) id \(d\times d\) matrix and \(\mathbf{Z}\) is a \(d\times d^{\prime}\) matrix, then_

\[\|\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\mathbf{X})\mathbf{Z}\|\leq\delta\|\mathbf{X}\|_{*}\| \mathbf{Z}\|.\] (30)

Lemma 1 is from Candes [4]. The other three lemma can be derived from Lemma 1 through selecting \(\mathbf{Z}\) or decomposing \(\mathbf{X}\) into a series of rank-1 matrices [31].

### Additional Auxiliary Sequences

In this section, we additionally define some auxiliary sequences. Some for calibrating the dynamics, that is, describe how the dynamic progresses without error or randomness and track the trajectories with the accumulation of error. Some are used for characterizing the impact of randomness on the dynamic.

The next two deterministic sequences help to track the dynamic of singular values of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) when it accumulates errors in each step.

**Definition 2**.: _We define the following two deterministic sequences:_

\[\begin{split}\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}&=(1-\eta \overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}^{2}+\eta)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}+\frac{\eta}{32} \log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t},\qquad \overline{\mathrm{R}}_{0}=\alpha\\ \underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}&=(1-\eta\underline{ \mathrm{R}}_{t}^{2}+\eta)\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}-\frac{\eta}{32}\log^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t},\qquad\underline{ \mathrm{R}}_{0}=\alpha.\end{split}\] (31)

The next lemma shows that the deviation between \(\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\) and \(\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\) can be bounded.

**Lemma 5** (Bounded Deviation between \(\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\) and \(\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\)).: _Let the sequence \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) be defined as (25). Let \(T_{1}\) be the first time \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) enters the region \((\frac{1}{3}-\eta,\frac{1}{3})\), we have_

\[\begin{split}\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}&\leq(1+1/6) \mathrm{R}_{t};\\ \underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}&\geq(1-1/6)\mathrm{R}_{t}, \end{split}\] (32)

_for any \(t=0,\ldots,T_{1}\)._

Proof.: First, for \(\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\) have that

\[\frac{\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}}{\mathrm{R}_{t+1}}=\frac{(1-\eta\overline{ \mathrm{R}}_{t}^{2}+\eta)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}+\frac{\eta}{32}\log^{-1} \left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}}{(1-\eta\mathrm{R}_{t}^{2 }+\eta)\mathrm{R}_{t}}\leq\left(1+\frac{\eta}{32}\log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{ \alpha}\right)\right)\frac{\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}}{\mathrm{R}_{t}}\] (33)

It takes \(T_{1}\leq\frac{4}{\eta}\log\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\) steps for \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) to reach \((\frac{1}{3}-\eta,\frac{1}{3})\). We can conclude that

\[\frac{\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{T_{1}}}{\mathrm{R}_{T_{1}}}\leq\left(1+\frac{\eta }{32}\log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\right)^{T_{1}}\leq\exp(1/8)<1+\frac{ 1}{6}\] (34)

where we use \(1-x\geq\exp(-2x),1+x\geq\exp(\frac{x}{2})\) for \(x\in[0,1/2]\). Similarly, For \(\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\), we have

\[\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}=(1-\eta\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}^{2}+\eta) \underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}-\frac{\eta}{32}\log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha} \right)\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\geq(1-\eta\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}^{2}+ \eta)\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}-\frac{\eta}{32}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\log^{-1}\left( \frac{1}{\alpha}\right)\mathrm{R}_{t},\] (35)\[\frac{\mathds{R}_{t+1}}{\mathds{R}_{t+1}}=\frac{(1-\eta\mathds{R}_{t}^{2}+\eta) \mathds{R}_{t}-\frac{\eta}{32}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha} \right)\mathds{R}_{t}}{(1-\eta\mathds{R}_{t}^{2}+\eta)\mathds{R}_{t}}\geq \frac{\mathds{R}_{t}}{\mathds{R}_{t}}-\frac{\eta}{32}\cdot\frac{7}{6}\log^{-1 }\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right),\] (36)

which implies

\[\frac{\mathds{R}_{T_{1}}}{\mathds{R}_{T_{1}}}\geq 1-\frac{7}{48}>1-\frac{1}{6}.\] (37)

One can also see that, \(\overline{\mathds{R}}_{t}\leq(1+1/6)\mathds{R}_{t}\) and \(\underline{\mathds{R}}_{t}\geq(1-1/6)\mathds{R}_{t}\) holds for any \(t\leq T\), which completes our proof.

Next, we formally define the calibration line \(\mathds{L}_{t}\). In later parts, we can show that the norm of each column of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) behaves like a biased random walk with reflecting barrier \(\mathds{L}_{t}\).

**Definition 3**.: _Let \(\alpha,\mathds{R}\) be defined as above. For \(t=0,1,\ldots\), we define the calibration line:_

\[\mathds{L}_{t}=\alpha\lor 40M\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathds{R}_{t}.\] (38)

Next, we define a stochastic process \(q_{i}^{t}\) based on \(\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\). The reason why we define this sequence is that though the randomness only directly affects \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\), the dynamic of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) also shares the randomness, therefore the dynamics become difficult to reason about since they are deeply coupled. Therefore, we define this "external" random sequence to dominate them.

**Definition 4** (Controller Sequence).: _We fix the violation probability \(p=c_{v}/(M_{2}\log(d))\) for some small absolute constant \(c_{v}\). For each fixed \(i\), we define a stochastic process \(q_{i}^{t}\) for \(t=0,1,2,\ldots\) with \(q_{i}^{0}=\alpha\), and_

\[q_{i}^{t+1}=\begin{cases}q_{i}^{t}&,\quad\text{if there exists $\tau\leq t$ such that $q_{i}^{\tau}\geq p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathds{L}_{\tau}$}\\ (1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{(t+1)}+2\eta)q_{i}^{t}\vee\mathds{L}_{t+1}&, \quad\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]

\(q_{i}^{t}\) is used for providing an upper bound the norm of columns of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\). Before \(q_{i}^{t}\) hits the upper absorbing boundary \(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathds{L}_{t}\), it can be considered as a "reflection and absorbing" process, with reflection barrier \(\mathds{L}_{t}\) and absorbing barrier \(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathds{L}_{t}\). The following lemma gives an upper bound for \(\{q_{i}^{t}\}_{i,t}\):

**Lemma 6** (Upper bound for \(q_{i}^{t}\)).: _With probability over \(0.995\) over the randomness of the \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}\), for all \(i=1,2,\ldots,r_{2}\) and \(t=0,1,\ldots,T_{2}\), we have_

\[q_{i}^{t}<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathds{L}_{t}.\] (39)

To prove this, we define a family of random sequences \(X_{k,t}^{i}\).

**Definition 5**.: _For each \(i=1,\ldots,r_{2}\), we construct a family of non-negative stochastic processes \(\{X_{k,t}^{i}\}_{t=0}^{T_{2}}\) for \(k=0,\ldots,T_{2}\) as follows:_

\[X_{k,t}^{i}=\begin{cases}\mathds{L}_{t}&,\quad 0\leq t\leq k\leq T_{2}\\ (1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{(e_{t})}+2\eta)X_{k,t-1}^{i}&,\quad 0\leq k<t \leq T_{2}\end{cases}\] (40)

\((X_{k,t}^{i})_{k,t\in[T_{2}]}\) can be expressed as the following form:

\[\left(X_{k,t}^{i}\right)=\begin{pmatrix}L_{0}&(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{1})}+2 \eta)L_{0}&\left(\prod_{s=1}^{2}(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{s})}+2\eta)\right) \cdot L_{0}&\cdots&\left(\prod_{s=1}^{T}(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{s})}+2\eta) \right)\cdot L_{0}\\ L_{1}&L_{1}&(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{2})}+2\eta)L_{1}&\cdots&\left(\prod_{s=2}^{ T}(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{s})}+2\eta)\right)\cdot L_{1}\\ L_{2}&L_{2}&L_{2}&\cdots&\left(\prod_{s=3}^{T}(1+\eta\Sigma_{ii}^{(e_{s})}+2\eta) \right)\cdot L_{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\\ L_{T_{2}}&L_{T_{2}}&L_{T_{2}}&\cdots&L_{T_{2}}\end{pmatrix}.\]It can be noticed that \(X^{i}_{k,t}\) and \(q^{t}_{i}\) have close relations. At the beginning we have \(q^{t}_{i}=X^{i}_{0,t}\), \(t=0,1,\ldots\), progress along the 0-th row. If \(q^{t}_{i}\) gets lower than the calibration line \(L_{t}\) at some timestep \(t=t_{0}\), it switches to the the \(t_{0}\)-th row \(X^{i}_{t_{0},t},t=t_{0},\ldots\) until the next time it gets lower than calibration line \(L_{t}\), and so on. We can see that \(q^{t}_{i}\) always progress along a certain row. Thus

\[\mathbb{P}\left(\exists k\text{ such that }q^{t}_{i}=X^{i}_{k,t}\right)=1,\quad \forall i\in[r_{2}]\text{ and }t\in[T_{2}].\] (41)

Therefore, any uniform bound of \(X^{i}_{k,t}\) can also be a bound for \(q^{t}_{i}\). Later in the context, we analyze \(X^{i}_{k,t}\) for each \(i\) so we omit the argument \(i\) in \(X^{i}_{k,t}\) for convenient notation.

We define \(\sigma\)-field \(\mathcal{F}_{t}=\sigma(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{0})},\ldots,\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_ {t-1})})\) for \(t=1,\ldots T_{2}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{0}=\sigma(\emptyset)\). Then we have \(\mathcal{F}_{0}\subset\mathcal{F}_{1}\subset\cdots\subset\mathcal{F}_{T_{2}}\) form a filtration. The next lemma shows that a certain power of \(\{X_{k,t}\}_{t}\) is a non-negative supermartingale w.r.t. \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\).

**Lemma 7**.: _For each \(i=1,\ldots,r_{2}\) and \(k=0,\ldots,T_{2}\), if the learning rate \(\eta\) satisfies \(\eta\in(\frac{24}{M_{2}},\frac{1}{64M_{1}})\), then the process \(\{X^{2/3}_{k,t}\}_{t=0}^{T_{2}}\) is a non-negative supermartingale with respect to \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\)._

Proof.: First, its easy to verify the adaptiveness \(X^{2/3}_{k,t}\in\mathcal{F}_{t}\) since \(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(t)}_{ii}\in\mathcal{F}_{t}\) for all \(t=0,1,\ldots T_{2}\). Next, note that

\[\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2/3}_{k,t+1}|\mathcal{F}_{t}\right]=\begin{cases}X^{2/3}_{ k,t}&,t+1\leq k\\ \mathbb{E}\left((1+\eta(\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii})+2\eta)\right)^{2/3}X^{ 2/3}_{k,t}&,t\geq k\end{cases}\] (42)

So it suffices to prove that

\[\mathbb{E}_{e\sim D}\left[(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii}+2\eta)^{2/3} \right]\leq 1.\]

For any \(\gamma\in(0,1)\) and \(|x-1|<\frac{1}{16}\), from Taylor's expansion, we have

\[x^{1-\gamma}\leq 1+(1-\gamma)(x-1)-\frac{1}{4}(1-\gamma)\gamma(x-1)^{2}.\] (43)

Therefore,

\[\mathbb{E}_{e_{t}}\left[(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii}+2\eta)^{1-\gamma }\right]\leq 1+\eta(1-\gamma)(2+\mathbb{E}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii})- \frac{1}{4}\eta^{2}(1-\gamma)\gamma\operatorname{Var}_{e_{t}}[\mathbf{\Sigma }^{(e_{t})}_{ii}].\] (44)

Hence, it suffices to choose \(\eta,\gamma\) such that

\[(2+\mathbb{E}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii})\leq\frac{1}{4}\eta\gamma \operatorname{Var}[\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii}],\quad\eta<\frac{1}{64M_{1}}.\] (45)

When \(\gamma=\frac{1}{3}\), \(\eta\in(\frac{24}{M_{2}},\frac{1}{64M_{1}})\) suffices. Hence we prove \(\mathbb{E}\left[(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e_{t})}_{ii}+2\eta)^{2/3}\right]\leq 1\) and we can conclude that

\[0\leq\mathbb{E}\left[X^{2/3}_{k,t+1}|\mathcal{F}_{t}\right]\leq X^{2/3}_{k,t}.\] (46)

Now we are ready to prove Lemma 6.

Proof of Lemma 6.: From the above observations, before \(q^{t}_{i}\) hits the upper absorbing boundary \(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\), there always exists some \(k\) such that \(q^{t}_{i}=X_{k,t}\). Therefore, \(q^{t}_{i}\) hits \(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\) implies there exists some \(k\) that \(X_{k,t}\) hits \(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\). So it suffices to bound \(X_{k,t}\).

For any fixed \(k=0,...,T_{2}\), we denote two stopping times:

\[\tau_{k}^{0} \stackrel{{\mathrm{def}}}{{=}}T_{2}\wedge\min_{k\leq t \leq T_{2}}\{X^{2/3}_{k,t}<(\mathrm{L}_{t})^{2/3}\};\] (47) \[\tau_{k}^{1} \stackrel{{\mathrm{def}}}{{=}}T_{2}\wedge\min_{k\leq t \leq T_{2}}\{X^{2/3}_{k,t}\geq(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t})^{2/3}\}.\]One gets that

\[\mathbb{P}\left(\tau_{k}^{1}<\tau_{k}^{0}\right)\overset{(a)}{\leq} \frac{1}{(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot L_{k})^{2/3}}\mathbb{E}X_{k,\tau_{k}^{1.5} \wedge\tau_{k}^{0}}^{2/3} \overset{(b)}{\leq} \frac{1}{(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot L_{k})^{2/3}}\mathbb{E}X_{k,0}^{ 2/3}\] (48) \[\overset{(c)}{\leq} \frac{(L_{k})^{2/3}}{(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t})^{2/3}} \leq(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5})^{-2/3}.\]

Where the inequality \((a)\) is from Markov's inequality. Inequality \((b)\) is from the optional stopping time theorem for supermartingales and inequality \((c)\) is from the fact that \(\mathrm{L}_{t}\) is non-decreasing. Therefore, we can conclude that:

\[\mathbb{P}(\exists i\leq r_{2},\tau\leq T_{2}\text{ such that }q_{i}^{\tau} \leq p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{\tau})\] (49) \[\leq r_{2}\mathbb{P}(\exists k\text{ such that }\tau_{k}^{1}< \tau_{k}^{0})\] \[\leq r_{2}\sum_{k=0}^{T_{2}-1}\mathbb{P}\left(\tau_{k}^{1}<\tau_ {k}^{0}\right)\] \[\leq r_{2}T_{2}(p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5})^{-2/3}\] \[\leq T_{2}p\]

where the first inequality is simply a union bound over \(i=1,2,...,r_{2}\). Then

\[T_{2}p\leq O(\eta^{-1}\log(d))\frac{c_{v}}{M_{2}\log(d)}\leq O(M_{2}\log(d)) \frac{c_{v}}{M_{2}\log(d)}\leq 0.01,\] (50)

where the constant hidden in \(O(\cdot)\) only depends on the choice of \(\alpha\). Since \(\log(1/\alpha)\leq 4\log(d)\), the constant hidden in \(O(\cdot)\) is absolute. Therefore, the last inequality holds with sufficiently small \(c_{v}\), which does not depend on other parameters. 

### Useful Lemmas

In this part we bound some quantities that we frequently encounter as the error terms. These lemmas will simplify our proofs in later parts.

The next lemma helps to bound the "interaction error" arose from the non-orthogonality of \(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\).

**Lemma 8**.: _Let \(\mathbf{R}_{t},\mathbf{Q}_{t},\mathbf{E}_{t}\) and \(\epsilon_{1}\) be defined as above. We have_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}-\left(\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{R}_{t} ^{\top}+\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{Q}_{t}^{\top}+\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{E}_ {t}\right)\right\|\leq 6\epsilon_{1}\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|^{2}\] (51)

Proof.: From the definition of \(\mathbf{R}_{t},\mathbf{Q}_{t},\mathbf{E}_{t}\), we have

\[\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t} =\left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{E}_{t}\right)^{\top}\left(\mathbf{U}^{ \star}\mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}+ \mathbf{E}_{t}\right)\] (52) \[=\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{R}_{t}^{\top}+\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{Q}_{t} ^{\top}+\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{E}_{t}+\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\Big{(} \mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}+\mathrm{Id}_{ \mathbf{V}^{\star}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\] \[\qquad\qquad+\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{ \star}}+\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}+\mathrm{Id} _{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\Big{)}\mathbf{U}_{t}.\]

Note that

\[\left\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}\right\| =\left\|\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star }\mathbf{}^{\top}\right\|\leq\epsilon_{1}\] (53)

and

\[\left\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\right\|= \left\|(\mathbf{I}-\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}-\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{ \star}})\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U}^{\star}}\right\|=\left\|-\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{U }^{\star}}\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}\right\|\leq\epsilon_{1}.\] (54)

Similarly, for the other terms, we can prove that all the six terms in the bracket in the last line of 52 have operator norm \(\leq\epsilon_{1}\). This completes the proof. 

The next lemma helps to bound the RIP error in the dynamic of \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\).

**Lemma 9** (Upper Bound for \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\)).: _Under the assumption of Theorem 2, if \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|,\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|,\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|<1.1\) and \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}<1\), we have that:_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U }_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\right\|\leq 2M_{1}\delta \sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|.\] (55)Proof.: \[\left\|\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{ \top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{ \Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\right\|\] \[\overset{(a)}{\leq}\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\right\|+\left\| \mathbf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\right)\right\|+ \left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{ U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\right)\right\|\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}\delta\Big{(}\left\|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t} \right\|_{F}+\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\right\|_{*}\] \[\qquad+\left\|\mathbf{R}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{t}-\mathbf{I} \right\|_{F}+\left\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}_{t}\right\|_{F}+2\left\| \mathbf{E}_{t}\right\|(\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|_{F}+\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|_{F})+2\left\| \mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{t}\right\|_{F}\Big{)}\] \[\leq\delta(\sqrt{r_{2}}M_{1}+1+3\sqrt{r_{1}}+4\sqrt{r_{2}}+8( \sqrt{r_{1}}+\sqrt{r_{2}})+8\sqrt{r_{1}})\] \[\leq 2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}},\]

where in \((a)\) we use the linearity of \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\circ(\cdot)\) and the triangle inequality. In \((b)\) we use Lemma 2 for the first term, Lemma 4 for the second term, and the expansion:

\[\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U} ^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}( \mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{t}-\mathbf{I})\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+ \mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\] (57) \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\mathbf{E} _{t}(\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star }{}^{\top})+(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{U}^{\star} \mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top})\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{Q}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+ \mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{R}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{ \top}.\]

for the third term which shows that \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{ \top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\) has rank no more than \(2(r_{1}+r_{2})\). Hence we can conclude that:

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{E}_{t}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{ U}_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{V}^{ \star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\right\|\leq 2M_{1} \delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\cdot\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|.\] (58)

The following lemma tells how to bound the interaction error and RIP error using the auxiliary sequences \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) and \(\mathrm{L}_{t}\) we have already defined:

**Lemma 10** (Bound Using calibration Line).: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 2, if \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\leq\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|\leq\min\{4\mathrm{R}_{t},1.1\}\) and \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\leq\sqrt{r_{2}}p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\), we have_

\[\left(M_{1}\epsilon_{1}+2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\|\mathbf{U}_{t} \|\leq\mathrm{L}_{t}\wedge\frac{5}{576}\log^{-1}\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right) \mathrm{R}_{t}.\] (59)

Proof.: From triangle inequality and the condition of this lemma \((2\epsilon_{1}\leq\delta)\), we have that:

\[\left(M_{1}\epsilon_{1}+2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\| \mathbf{U}_{t}\| \leq\frac{5}{2}M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}(\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|+ \|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|)\] (60) \[\leq\frac{5}{2}M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}(8\mathrm{R}_{t}+ \sqrt{r_{2}}p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}).\]

Then it suffices to check:

\[\begin{cases}20M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathrm{R}_{t}\overset{(a)}{\leq }\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{L}_{t};\\ \frac{2}{5}M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{2}}p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathrm{ L}_{t}\overset{(b)}{\leq}\frac{1}{2}\mathrm{L}_{t};\\ 20M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathrm{R}_{t}\overset{(c)}{\leq}\frac{5}{1152} \log^{-1}\big{(}\frac{1}{\alpha}\big{)}\,\mathrm{R}_{t};\\ \frac{2}{5}M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{2}}p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\mathrm{ L}_{t}\overset{(d)}{\leq}\frac{5}{1152}\log^{-1}\big{(}\frac{1}{\alpha}\big{)}\, \mathrm{R}_{t},\end{cases}\]

where \((a)\) is from the definition of \(\mathrm{L}_{t}\), \((b)\) and \((c)\) are from the assumption on \(\delta\) in Theorem 2, and \((d)\) is from the assumption on \(\delta\) (the absolute constant \(c\) in the condition for \(\delta\)) and the fact that \(\mathrm{L}_{t}\leq\mathrm{R}_{t}\). Hence the proof is completed.

### Bounds of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\)

For evaluating the magnitude of \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\), we consider its columns. We denote each column of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) as \(\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)}\) for \(i=1,2,\ldots,r_{2}\). And use \(q_{i}^{t}\) we defined above to upper bound them. Once we provide a uniform bound for all \(\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)}\), we can also bound \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\).

**Lemma 11**.: _Under the assumption of Theorem 2, under the event of \(q_{i}^{t}<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\) with \(p\geq\epsilon_{2}^{2/3}\) for all \(i=1,2,\ldots,r_{2}\) and \(t=0,1,\ldots,T\), if \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\leq\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|\leq 1.1\,,\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}<1\) and \(\|\mathbf{q}_{j}^{t}\|\leq q_{j}^{t}\) for all \(j=1,\ldots,r_{2}\), then we have_

\[\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t+1)}\|\leq q_{i}^{t+1}<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\mathrm{L}_{t+1}\] (61)

_for all \(i=1,2,\ldots,r_{2}\)._

Proof.: From the dynamic of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\):

\[\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}=\mathbf{Q}_{t}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t} \mathbf{Q}_{t}+\eta\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{\Sigma}-\eta\left[\left(\epsilon_{1}+ 2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|\right],\]

we can see that for each column \(\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)}\) of \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\):

\[\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t+1)}\| \leq\left\|\left(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_ {t}+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{(e_{t})}\mathbf{I}\right)\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)} \right\|+\eta\sum_{j\neq i}|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ji}^{(e_{t})}|\|\mathbf{q}_{j}^{( t)}\|+\eta\left(\epsilon_{1}+2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|\] \[\leq(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{(e_{t})})\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)} \|_{2}+\eta\sum_{j\neq i}|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ji}^{(e_{t})}|\|\mathbf{q}_{j}^{( t)}\|+\eta\mathrm{L}_{t}.\]

where we use Lemma 10. For the second term we have:

\[\eta\sum_{j\neq i}|\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ji}^{(e_{t})}|\|\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(t)}\| \overset{(a)}{\leq}\eta\frac{c_{o}}{r^{2}M_{2}^{1.5}}p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5} \mathrm{L}_{t}\overset{(b)}{\leq}\eta\mathrm{L}_{t}(c_{o}c_{v}^{-1.5}r^{-0.5} \log^{1.5}d)\overset{(e)}{\leq}1,\] (62)

where in \((a)\) we use Assumption 1 (c) and induction hypothesis that \(\|\mathbf{q}_{j}^{(t)}\|<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\), in \((b)\) we use the definition of \(p\) (Definition 4), and in \((c)\) we use Assumption 1 (a) and Assumption 2 with sufficiently small \(c_{o}\) (which depends solely on another universal constant \(c_{v}\)). Hence we have

\[\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t+1)}\|\leq(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{(e_{t})})\|\mathbf{ q}_{i}^{(t)}\|_{2}+2\eta\mathrm{L}_{t}.\] (63)

There are two probable cases:

\[\begin{cases}\text{If }\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)}\|\leq\mathrm{L}_{t},\text{ then }\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t+1)}\|\leq(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{t}+2\eta)\mathrm{L}_{t }\leq(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{t}+2\eta)q_{i}^{t}\leq q_{i}^{t+1};\\ \text{If }\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t)}\|>\mathrm{L}_{t},\text{ then }\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{(t+1)}\| \leq(1+\eta\mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{t}+2\eta)\|\mathbf{q}_{i}^{t}\|\leq(1+\eta \mathbf{\Sigma}_{ii}^{t}+2\eta)q_{i}^{t}\leq q_{i}^{t+1}.\end{cases}\]

Both lead to the results we desire. 

With the above lemma, we can also give a bound for \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\):

**Corollary 1**.: _Under the condition of Lemma 11, we have that_

\[\|\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}\|\leq\|\mathbf{Q}_{t+1}\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{r_{2}} (q_{i}^{t+1})^{2}}<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}\mathrm{L}_{t+1}.\] (64)

### Bounds of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\)

In this section, we bound the increments of both the operator norm and the Frobenius norm of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\). The next lemma provide an upper bound for \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\).

**Lemma 12** (Increment of Spectral Norm of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\)).: _Under the assumption of Lemma 11, we have_

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\|\leq\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|+\eta\mathrm{L}_{t}.\] (65)Proof.: From the dynamic of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) (24), we can derive that

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\| \leq\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\left(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top }\mathbf{U}_{t}\right)\right\|+\eta\left(\left\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \left(\mathbf{U}^{*}{\mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{*}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{ t}{\mathbf{V}^{*}}^{\top}\right)\right\|+\left\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \mathbf{E}_{t}\right\|\right)\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|\] \[\overset{(a)}{\leq}\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|+\eta\left(\left(\epsilon_{1 }+M_{1}+2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|\right.\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|+\eta 5M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}} \left(\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|+\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\right)\] \[\overset{(c)}{\leq}\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|+\eta\mathrm{L}_{t},\]

where \((a)\) is from Lemma 9 and the fact that \(\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{U}_{t}\|,\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \mathbf{U}_{t}\|\leq\epsilon_{1}\). \((b)\) and \((c)\) are derived similarly as Lemma 10. 

The next lemma bounds the F-norm of error component \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\).

**Lemma 13** (Increment of the F-norm of Error Dynamic).: _Under the assumption of Lemma 11, and we further assume that \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\lesssim\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\log(1/\alpha)\), then the Frobenius norm of \(\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\) can be bounded by_

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\|_{F}^{2} \leq(1+O(\eta\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}))\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{ F}^{2}+\eta O(\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/\alpha)),\] (66)

_which immediately implies,_

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2} \lesssim\left((1+O(\eta\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}))^{t}-1 \right)\delta M_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})\log(1/\alpha)\] (67) \[\lesssim t\eta\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/\alpha).\]

Proof.: We expand \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\|_{F}^{2}\) from the dynamic of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) (24):

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\|_{F}^{2}\] (68) \[=\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} \mathbf{U}_{t})\right\|_{F}^{2}+\eta^{2}\left\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right\|_{F}^{2}\] \[\qquad-2\eta\left\langle\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_ {t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}),\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_ {t}\right\rangle\] \[\qquad+\left\|\eta\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\left(\mathbf{U}^{*}{ \mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{*}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}{\mathbf{V}^{*}}^{ \top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\right\|_{F}^{2}\] \[\qquad+\left\langle\mathbf{E}_{t}\left(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_ {t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right),\eta\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\left(\mathbf{U}^ {*}{\mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{*}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}{\mathbf{V}^{* }}^{\top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\right\rangle\] \[\qquad+\left\langle\eta\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\left(\mathbf{U}^ {*}{\mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{*}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}{\mathbf{V}^{* }}^{\top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t},\eta\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{E}_{t} \mathbf{U}_{t}\right\rangle\] \[\overset{\text{\tiny def}}{=}(1)+(2)+(3)+(4)+(5)+(6).\]

Now we bound the six parts separately. For the first part, since \(0\preceq\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}\preceq\mathbf{I}\), we have

\[\|\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t})\|_{F}^{2 }\leq\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}.\] (69)

For the second part:

\[(2) \leq\eta^{2}\left\langle\mathbf{E}_{t},\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} {}^{2}\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\right\rangle\] (70) \[\overset{(a)}{\leq}\eta^{2}\delta\left(\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U }_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{*}{\mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_ {t}{}^{\top}\|_{F}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\|_{*}+\|\mathbf{V}^ {*}\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}{\mathbf{V}^{*}}^{\top}\|_{F}\right)\] \[\leq\eta^{2}\delta\left(\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}- \mathbf{U}^{*}{\mathbf{U}^{*}}^{\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top} \|_{F}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\|_{*}+\|\mathbf{V}^{*} \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{t}{\mathbf{V}^{*}}^{\top}\|_{F}\right)\] \[\qquad\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\left(\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^ {\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\right\|_{F}+\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t} \mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\right\|_{*}\right)\] \[\overset{(b)}{\lesssim}\eta^{2}\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}} \cdot\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\cdot\left(O(\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}})+\|\mathbf{E} _{t}\|_{F}^{2}\right)\] \[\lesssim\eta^{2}\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}.\]In \((a)\) we use similar technique as in Lemma 9 to divide \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top} -\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\) into three parts so that we can use Lemma 1 and Lemma 3. In \((b)\) we use Lemma 9 to bound the first two terms and (57) to bound the third term with the assumption that \(\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|,\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|,\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|<2\).

For the third part:

\[(3) \stackrel{{(a)}}{{=}}-2\eta\left\langle\mathsf{E}_{ t},\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top} \mathbf{U}_{t})\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\right\rangle\] (71) \[=-2\eta\left\langle\mathsf{E}_{t},\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t})(\mathbf{ E}_{t}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{Q}_{t} \mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top})\right\rangle\] \[\stackrel{{(b)}}{{\leq}}2\eta\delta\left(\|\mathbf{ U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\star}{}^{\top}-\mathbf{E}_{t} \mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\|_{F}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\|_{*}+\| \mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\|_{F}\right)\] \[\quad\cdot\left(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^ {\top}\mathbf{U}_{t})\mathbf{E}_{t}{}^{\top}\|_{*}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}(\mathbf{I} -\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t})\mathbf{R}_{t}\|_{F}+\|\mathbf{E}_{ t}(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t})\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|_{F}\right)\] \[\stackrel{{(c)}}{{\leq}}2\eta\delta O(M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1 }+r_{2}})\left(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|_ {F}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|_{F}\right)\] \[\leq 2\eta\delta O(M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}})\left(\|\mathbf{E}_{t} \|_{F}^{2}+(2\sqrt{r_{1}}+2\sqrt{r_{2}})\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\right)\] \[\lesssim\eta\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^ {2}+\eta\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/\alpha),\]

where in \((a)\) we use the fact that \(\langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\mathbf{C}\mathbf{D}\rangle=\langle\mathbf{B}^{ \top}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{D}^{\top},\mathbf{C}\rangle\). In \((b)\) we separate \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\) as in (70). In \((c)\), for the first term we use the upper bound for \(\mathsf{E}_{t}\) appeared in Lemma 9, for the second term we use \(\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}\|_{F}\leq\|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|_{F}\) (and similarly for nuclear norm) and \(\|\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}\|\leq 1\).

For the fourth part:

\[(4)\leq 2\eta^{2}\epsilon_{1}^{2}\left\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\right\|_{F}^{2}+2\eta^{2} \epsilon_{1}^{2}\left\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\right\|_{F}^{2}\leq 8\eta^{2}\epsilon_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{ 2}),\] (72)

where the first inequality is from Cauchy's inequality and the fact that \(\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{U}^{\star}\|\), \(\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{V}^{\star}\|\leq\epsilon_{1}\).

For the fifth part:

\[(5) \leq\left\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\left(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{ \top}\mathbf{U}_{t}\right)\right\|\cdot\left\|\eta\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\right\|_{*}\] (73) \[\lesssim\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\eta\epsilon_{1}M_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})\] \[\lesssim\eta\left(\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\log(1/\alpha) \right)\epsilon_{1}M_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})\] \[\leq\eta\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/\alpha),\]

where the first inequality is from the norm inequality \(\langle\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}\rangle\leq\|\mathbf{X}\|_{*}\|\mathbf{Y}\|\) and in the last inequality we use the fact that \(\epsilon_{1}<\delta\).

For the sixth part:

\[(6) =\eta^{2}\left\langle\mathsf{E}_{t},\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}{}^{2 }\left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star} \mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t }^{\top}\right\rangle\] (74) \[\stackrel{{(a)}}{{\leq}}\eta^{2}\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\| \cdot\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}{}^{2}\left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{ \star}{}^{\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{\Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\star}{}^{\top} \right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\|_{*}\] \[\leq\] \[\stackrel{{(b)}}{{\lesssim}}\eta^{2}\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1 }+r_{2}}\cdot\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\|^{2}\epsilon_{1}(r_{1}+M_{1}r_{2})\] \[\lesssim\eta^{2}\delta M_{1}\epsilon_{1}M_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\] \[\lesssim\eta^{2}\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}.\]

In \((a)\) we use the norm inequality \(\langle\mathbf{X},\mathbf{Y}\rangle\leq\|\mathbf{X}\|_{*}\|\mathbf{Y}\|\) and in \((b)\) we use \(\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\|\leq 1\) and \(\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}}\mathbf{U}_{t}\|,\|\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{res}} \mathbf{U}_{t}\|\leq\epsilon_{1}\).

Now combining Equation (69)-(74), along with the fact that \(\|\mathbf{E}_{0}\|_{F}^{2}\leq d\alpha^{2}<d^{-1}\ll\delta^{2}r^{1.5}\), we can derive the result we desire.

### Analysis for Phase 1

In this section, we give a rigorous analysis for phase 1:

**Theorem 4** (Phase 1 analysis).: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 2. During the first \(T_{1}=O(\frac{1}{\eta}\log(\frac{1}{\alpha}))\) steps, with probability at least \(0.995\), the following holds for any \(t\in[0,T_{1}]\), that_

* \(\sigma_{j}(\mathbf{R}_{t+1})>(1+\eta/3)\sigma_{j}(\mathbf{R}_{t})\) _for all_ \(j\in[r_{1}]\)_;_
* \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|_{F}\leq p^{-1.5}r_{1}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}\cdot\mathbf{L}_{t} \leq\delta^{\star}<0.01\)_, where_ \(\mathrm{L}_{t}\) _is formally defined in (_38_)._
* \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\lesssim\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\leq\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|\) _and_ \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}\lesssim\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/ \alpha)^{2}\)_._

_Finally, we have \(\sigma_{1}(\mathbf{R}_{T_{1}}),\sigma_{r_{1}}(\mathbf{R}_{T_{1}})\in\left( \frac{1}{4},\frac{7}{18}\right)\)._

In the below contexts, unless otherwise specified, we abbreviate the largest and smallest singular values of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) as \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\) and \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\).

The next lemma tells that, if \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\) are both small, then \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) increases steadily and the deviation between its singular values is small.

**Lemma 14** (Dynamic of Singular Values of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) in Phase 1).: _For some \(t\leq T_{1}-1\), under the assumptions of Lemma 11, if \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|,\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|<\frac{1}{96}\log^{-1}\left(1/\alpha\right)\) and \(\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\leq\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\leq\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\leq \overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\), then_

\[\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}\leq\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)}\leq\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)} \leq\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}.\] (75)

_and_

\[\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)} \geq(1+\eta/3)\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\] (76) \[\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)} \geq(1+\eta/3)\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\]

Proof.: From the dynamic of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\):

\[\mathbf{R}_{t+1} =(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{U}_{t}+\eta \mathbf{I})\mathbf{R}_{t}+\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{V}^{\ast}\mathbf{ \Sigma}_{t}\mathbf{V}^{\ast\top}\mathbf{U}^{\ast}-\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} \mathbf{E}_{t}\mathbf{U}^{\ast}\] (77) \[=(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{R}_{t}\mathbf{R}_{t}^{\top}+\eta\mathbf{ I})\mathbf{R}_{t}-\eta(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{Q}_{t}^{\top}+\mathbf{E}_{t}^{ \top}\mathbf{E}_{t})\mathbf{R}_{t}+\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\left[(M_{1} \epsilon_{1}+2M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r+r_{2}})\right].\]

We use \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\) and \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\) to denote the largest/smallest singular value of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\). To control the dynamic of \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\) and \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\), we need to bound the magnitude of the error term, that is

\[\begin{split}&\left\|\eta(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\mathbf{Q}_{t}^{\top}+ \mathbf{E}_{t}^{\top}\mathbf{E}_{t})\mathbf{R}_{t}+\eta\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top} [2.5\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}]\right\|\\ &\leq\eta\left(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|^{2}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|^{2}+ \frac{1}{32}\log^{-1}\left(1/\alpha\right)\right)\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\\ &\leq\eta(\frac{1}{96}+\frac{1}{96}+\frac{1}{96})\log^{-1}\left( 1/\alpha\right)\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\\ &\leq\frac{\eta}{32}\log^{-1}\left(1/\alpha\right)\sigma_{1}^{(t) },\end{split}\] (78)

where in the first inequality we use the assumption for \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\) and \(\delta\). Therefore, from Weyl's inequality, we have that

\[\begin{cases}\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\leq(1-\eta{\sigma_{1}^{(t)}}^{2}+\eta)\sigma_ {1}^{(t)}+\frac{\eta}{32}\log\left(1/\alpha\right)^{-1}\sigma_{1}^{(t)};\\ \sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)}\geq(1-\eta{\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}}^{2}+\eta)\sigma_{r_{1} }^{(t)}-\frac{\eta}{32}\log\left(1/\alpha\right)^{-1}\sigma_{1}^{(t)}.\end{cases}\] (79)

Using the assumption that

\[\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\leq\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t},\quad\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\geq \underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t},\quad t=0,1,\dots,T_{1}.\] (80)

And Lemma 5, we can conclude that

\[(1-1/6)\mathrm{R}_{t+1}\leq\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}\leq\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+ 1)}\leq\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\leq\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t+1}\leq(1+1/6)\mathrm{R}_ {t+1}.\] (81)

For the increasing speed of \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\), note that \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}<2\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\), therefore

\[\begin{cases}\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\geq(1-\frac{1}{4}\eta+\eta-\frac{1}{32}\eta) \sigma_{1}^{(t)};\\ \sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)}\geq(1-\frac{1}{4}\eta+\eta-\frac{2}{32}\eta)\sigma_{r_{1 }}^{(t)}.\end{cases}\] (82)

This proves the desired result.

Now that the supporting lemmas are prepared, we can begin the proof of Theorem 4

Proof of Theorem 4.: The initial value of \(\mathbf{U}_{0}\) implies that

\[\|\mathbf{U}_{0}\|=\|\mathbf{R}_{0}\|=\|\mathbf{Q}_{0}\|=\|\mathbf{E}_{0}\|= \alpha,\quad\|\mathbf{E}_{0}\|_{F}^{2}\leq\alpha^{2}d.\] (82)

Recall that the time \(T_{1}\leq\frac{5}{\eta}\log(1/\alpha)\) is the first time \(\mathrm{R}_{t}\) enters the region \((1/3-\eta,1/3)\). We have that the event of \(q_{i}^{t}<p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{t}\) for all \(i=0,\ldots,r_{2},t=0,\ldots,T_{1}\) happens with probability over \(0.995\). In this event, we can use Lemma 11, 12, 13 and 14 to inductively prove:

* For the operator norm of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\), we have that for all \(t\leq T_{1}\): \[\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\| \leq\alpha+\eta\sum_{t=0}^{T}\mathrm{L}_{t}\] \[\leq\alpha(1+\eta\cdot\frac{240}{\eta}\log\left(\frac{1}{\alpha} \right))\] \[\qquad+40M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\cdot\frac{\eta}{3}\cdot \Big{(}1+(1+\eta/3)^{-1}+(1+\eta/3)^{-2}+\cdots\Big{)}\] (83) \[\leq 250\alpha\log\left(\frac{1}{\alpha}\right)+40M_{1}\delta \sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}(1+\eta/3)\] \[\leq 40M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\] \[<\frac{1}{96}\log^{-1}(1/\alpha).\] where in the second inequality we use Lemma 14 that \(\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|\) increases with rate not less than \((1+3/\eta)\).
* For the Frobenius norm of \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\): \[\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}\leq T_{1}\eta\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5 }\log(1/\alpha)\lesssim\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log^{2}(1/\alpha)<1\] (84)
* For \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\), we use Corollary 1: \[p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}\mathrm{L}_{T_{1}}\lesssim p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5} \sqrt{r_{2}}\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}<\frac{1}{96}\log^{-1}(1/\alpha).\] (85)
* For \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\), we have for \(t\leq T_{1}\): \[(1-1/6)\mathrm{R}_{t}\leq\underline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\leq\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)} \leq\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\leq\overline{\mathrm{R}}_{t}\leq(1+1/6)\mathrm{R}_{t}.\] (86)
* For the condition \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\leq\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|\): \[\|\mathbf{E}_{t+1}\|-\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\leq\eta\mathrm{L}_{t}\leq\frac{\eta}{ 10}\mathrm{R}_{t}<\frac{\eta}{5}\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|<\|\mathbf{R}_{t+1}\|-\| \mathbf{R}_{t}\|.\] (87)

Hence the proof is completed.

### Analysis for Phase 2

In phase 1, the signal component \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) grows at a stable speed from \(\alpha\) to \(O(1)\) while the spurious component \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) and the error component \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) are kept at low levels. In phase 2, we will characterize how \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\) approach 1 and how to continually keep \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\).

**Lemma 15** (Stability of \(\mathbf{R}_{t}\)).: _If there exists some real number \(g\) satisfying_

\[0.01>g\geq\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|^{2}+\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|^{2}+4\|\mathbf{U}_{t}^{ \top}\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\] (88)

_for all \(t=T_{1}+1,\ldots,T_{1}+T-1\), then we have_

\[1-5g\leq\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\leq\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\leq 1+g,\] (89)

_for all \(t=T_{1}+O(\frac{1}{\eta}\log\left(\frac{1}{g}\right)),\ldots,T_{1}+T-1\)_Proof.: First we consider the upper bound for \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\). Similar to Equation (78), we have

\[\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\leq(1-\eta{\sigma_{1}^{(t)}}^{2}+\eta+\eta g)\sigma_{1}^{(t)}.\] (90)

Note that Equation (90) is equivalent to

\[\sqrt{1+g}-\sigma_{1}^{(t+1)}\geq(\sqrt{1+g}-\sigma_{1}^{(t)})\left(1-\eta( \sigma_{1}^{(t)}+\sqrt{1+g})\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\right).\] (91)

With \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}(T_{1})<\frac{1}{2}\), one can see that \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\) never goes above \(\sqrt{1+g}\leq 1+g\).

Now we consider \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\). After phase 1 we have \(\sigma_{r}^{(T_{1})}\geq\frac{5}{6}(1/3-\eta)>\frac{1}{4}\). If \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\leq 5\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\), similarly we have:

\[\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)}\geq(1-\eta{\sigma_{1}^{(t)}}^{2}+\eta-5\eta g)\sigma_{ r_{1}}^{(t)}.\] (92)

Which implies that, if \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}<\sqrt{1-5g}\),

\[\sqrt{1-5g}-\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t+1)} \leq(\sqrt{1-5g}-\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)})(1-\eta(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t )}+\sqrt{1-5g})\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)})\] (93) \[\leq(1-\frac{1}{4}\eta)(\sqrt{1-5g}-\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)})\]

Therefore, \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\) will get larger than \(\sqrt{1-5g}-g^{2}\geq 1-5g\) at some time \(t\leq T_{1}+\frac{8}{\eta}\log\left(\frac{1}{g}\right)\). Also from Equation (92) we can see that, \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\) keeps increasing before it gets larger than \(\sqrt{1-5g}\). And once it surpasses \(\sqrt{1-5g}\), it never falls below than \(\sqrt{1-5g}\) again. Therefore, \(\sigma_{1}^{(t)}\leq 5\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\) is satisfied and the proof proceeds. 

Now we can state and prove:

**Theorem 5** (Phase 2 Analysis).: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 2. Let \(T_{2}=T_{1}+O(\frac{1}{\eta}\log((r_{1}+r_{2})/\delta))\leq O(\frac{1}{\eta} \log(\frac{1}{\alpha}))\). Then with probability at least \(0.995\), we have_

\[\sigma_{1}(\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}}),\sigma_{r}(\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}})\in\left(1-O( \delta^{\star 2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}),1+O(\delta^{ \star 2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}})\right).\] (94)

_And for \(t=T_{1}+1,\ldots,T_{2}\), we have_

* \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|_{F}\leq p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}\mathrm{L}_{t}\leq p ^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}40M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}=40M_{1}\delta^{\star}\)_;_
* \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\lesssim\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\log(1/\alpha))\) _and_ \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}\lesssim\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log( 1/\alpha)^{2}\)_._

Proof of Theorem 5.: The error \(g\) in Lemma 15 is no less than \(\Omega(\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2}))\gg\alpha\) order, therefore \(T_{2}=T_{1}+\frac{1}{\eta}\log\left(1/\alpha\right)\) suffices for \(\sigma_{r_{1}}^{(t)}\) to reach \(1-5g\). Then similar to the induction in the proof of Theorem 4, we can derive(in the same high probability event):

* \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\leq 40\eta\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}+40\eta\delta M_{1} \sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}(t-T_{1})\leq 80\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\log(1/\alpha))<0.01\);
* \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}\lesssim t\eta\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5} \log(1/\alpha)\lesssim\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log(1/\alpha)^{2}<1\);
* \(\|\mathbf{Q}_{t}\|\leq p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}\mathrm{L}_{t}\leq p^{-1.5}r_{2}^{1.5}\sqrt{r_{2}}40M_{1}\delta\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}=p^{-1.5}40M_{1} \delta^{\star}<0.01\);

Hence the assumption in Lemma 15 is satisfied, with

\[g\lesssim p^{-3}\delta^{\star 2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\] (95)

Therefore,

\[\big{|}\,\|\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}}\|-1\|\,\big{|}\lesssim p^{-3}\delta^{\star 2}M_{1}^{2} \vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\] (96)Proof of Theorem 2.: Using Theorem 4 and Theorem 5 with \(T=T_{2}\), we have

\[\|\mathbf{U}_{T_{2}}\mathbf{U}_{T_{2}}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\|_ {F} \overset{(a)}{\leq}\|\mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}\mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}^{\top}\|_ {F}+\|\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}}-\mathbf{I}\|_{F}+\|\mathbf{Q}_ {T_{2}}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}\] \[\quad+2\|\mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}\mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}+2\|\mathbf{E} _{t}\mathbf{R}_{t}\|_{F}+2\|\mathbf{R}_{T_{2}}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}\] \[\overset{(b)}{\leq}\|\mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}^{2}+O\left(\delta^ {\star\,2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}\right)\sqrt{r_{1}}+\| \mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}^{2}\] \[\quad+2\|\mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}\|\|\mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}+2\| \mathbf{E}_{T_{2}}\|\|\mathbf{R}_{t}\|_{F}+2\|\mathbf{Q}_{T_{2}}\|_{F}\| \mathbf{R}_{t}\|\] \[\overset{(c)}{\lesssim}\delta^{2}M_{1}^{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})^{1.5}\log ^{2}(1/\alpha)+(\delta^{\star\,2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta M_{1}\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}) \sqrt{r_{1}}+\delta^{\star\,2}M_{1}^{2}\] \[\quad+(\delta^{\star\,2}M_{1}^{2}\vee\delta^{\star\,2}M_{1}^{2} \vee\delta^{\star\,2}M_{1})\log^{2}d.\]

where in \((a)\) we decompose \(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{U}_{t}{}^{\top}\) (See (57)) and triangle inequality. In \((b)\) and \((c)\) we use Theorem 5 and repeatedly use the fact \(\|\mathbf{A}\mathbf{B}\|_{F}\leq\|\mathbf{A}\|\|\mathbf{B}\|_{F}\). This completes the proof. 

## Appendix B Deferred Proofs

### Proof of Proposition 1

In the below contexts, notations such as \(C,c,C_{1},c_{1}\) always denote some positive absolute constants. Such notation is widely adopted in the field of non-asymptotic theory.

We first state some useful definitions and lemmas:

**Definition 6** (\(\epsilon\)-Net and Covering Numbers).: _Let \((T,d)\) be a metric space. Let \(\epsilon>0\). For a subset \(K\subset T\), a subset \(\mathcal{M}\subseteq K\) is called an \(\epsilon\)-net of \(K\) if every point in \(K\) is within distance \(\epsilon\) of some point in \(\mathcal{M}\). We define the covering number of \(K\) to be the smallest possible cardinality of such \(\mathcal{M}\), denoted as \(\mathcal{N}(K,\epsilon)\)._

**Lemma 16** (Covering Number of the Euclidean Ball).: _Let \(\mathcal{S}^{n-1}\) denote the unit Euclidean sphere in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\). The following result satisfies for any \(\epsilon>0\):_

\[\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{S}^{n-1},\epsilon)\leq\left(\frac{2}{\epsilon}+1\right)^ {n}.\] (97)

**Lemma 17** (Two-sided Bound on Gaussian Matrices).: _Let \(\mathbf{A}\) be an \(d\times r\) matrix whose elements \(\mathbf{A}_{ij}\) are independent \(N(0,1)\) random variables. Then for any \(t\geq 0\) we have_

\[\sqrt{d}-C(\sqrt{r}+t)\leq\sigma_{r}(\mathbf{A})\leq\sigma_{1}(\mathbf{A}) \leq\sqrt{d}+C(\sqrt{r}+t)\] (98)

_with probability at least \(1-2\exp(-t^{2})\)._

**Lemma 18** (Approximating Operator Norm Using \(\epsilon\)-nets).: _Let \(\mathbf{A}\) be an \(m\times n\) matrix and \(\epsilon\in[0,1/2)\). For any \(\epsilon\)-net \(\mathcal{M}_{1}\) for the sphere \(\mathcal{S}^{n-1}\) and any \(\epsilon\)-net \(\mathcal{M}_{2}\) of the sphere \(\mathcal{S}^{m-1}\), we have_

\[\sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{1},\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{M}_{2}}\langle \mathbf{A}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle\leq\|\mathbf{A}\|\leq\frac{1}{1-2 \epsilon}\sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{1},\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{M}_{2}} \langle\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\rangle.\] (99)

_Moreover, if \(m=n\), then we have_

\[\sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{1}}\langle\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x} \rangle\leq\|\mathbf{A}\|\leq\frac{1}{1-2\epsilon-\epsilon^{2}}\sup_{x\in \mathcal{M}_{1},y\in\mathcal{M}_{2}}|\langle\mathbf{A}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y} \rangle|.\] (100)

**Lemma 19** (Concentration Inequality for Product of Gaussian Random Variables).: _Suppose \(X\) and \(Y\) are independent \(N(0,1)\) random variables. Then \(\langle X,Y\rangle\) is a sub-exponential random variable. Therefore for \((X_{1},\ldots,X_{m},Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{m})^{\top}\sim N(0,\mathbf{I}_{2m})\), the following holds for any \(t\geq 0\):_

\[\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{m}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle X_{i},Y_{i}\rangle \right|>t\right)<2\exp\left(-c\min(t^{2},t)\cdot m\right).\] (101)Proof.: Note that

\[\langle X,Y\rangle=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}X+\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}Y\right) ^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}X-\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}Y\right)^{2}.\] (102)

The two terms are independent and following Gamma distribution \(\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2},1\right)\). Since Gamma distribution random variables are sub-exponential, \(\langle X,Y\rangle\) is sub-exponential too. The concentration inequality follows from Bernstein's inequality. (See Theorem 2.8.2 of Vershynin [47]). 

Now we prove Proposition 1:

Proof of Proposition 1.: First we provide a bound for \(\|\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{2}\|\). We fix \(\epsilon=1/4\), and we can find an \(\epsilon\)-net \(\mathcal{M}_{1}\) of the sphere \(\mathcal{S}^{r_{1}-1}\) and \(\epsilon\)-net \(\mathcal{M}_{2}\) of the sphere \(\mathcal{S}^{r_{2}-1}\) with

\[|\mathcal{M}_{1}|\leq 9^{r_{1}},\quad|\mathcal{M}_{2}|\leq 9^{r_{2}}.\] (103)

For each \(x\in\mathcal{M}_{1}\) and \(y\in\mathcal{M}_{2}\), we have for \(0<u<1\),

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{d}\mathbf{x}^{\top} \mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{2}\mathbf{y}>u\right)&=\mathbb{ P}\left(\frac{1}{d}\langle\mathbf{M}_{1}\mathbf{x},\mathbf{M}_{2}\mathbf{y} \rangle>u\right)\\ &\leq 2\exp(-cdu^{2}),\end{split}\] (104)

where we use the fact that \(\mathbf{M}_{1}\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{2}\mathbf{y}\) are independent \(N(0,\mathbf{I}_{d})\) random vectors and an application of Lemma 19. We let \(u=\sqrt{\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\cdot t\) for \(t<\sqrt{\frac{d}{r_{1}+r_{2}}}\), we have:

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{d}\|\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top} \mathbf{M}_{2}\|\geq\sqrt{\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\cdot t\right)& \stackrel{{(a)}}{{\leq}}\mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{d} \max_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{1},\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{M}_{2}}\mathbf{x}^{ \top}\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{2}\mathbf{y}\geq\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac {r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\cdot t\right)\\ &\stackrel{{(b)}}{{\leq}}9^{r_{1}+r_{2}}\cdot 2\exp \left(-c_{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})t^{2}\right)\\ &=2\exp\left(-(r_{1}+r_{2})(c_{2}t^{2}-\log(9))\right),\end{split}\] (105)

where in \((a)\) we use Lemma 18, in \((b)\) we apply a union bound over all \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{1}\) and \(\mathbf{y}\in\mathcal{M}_{2}\).

Next, we bound \(\|\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-1}\|\) and \(\|\mathbf{R}_{2}^{-1}\|\). Recall the QR-decompositions of \(\mathbf{M}_{1}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{2}\):

\[\mathbf{M}_{1}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}_{1}\mathbf{R}_{1}\quad\text{and}\quad \mathbf{M}_{2}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}_{2}\mathbf{R}_{2},\] (106)

which implies \(\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{1}=\mathbf{R}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{1}\) and \(\mathbf{M}_{2}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{2}=\mathbf{R}_{2}^{\top}\mathbf{R}_{2}\), and consequently \(\|\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-1}\|=\sigma_{r_{1}}(\mathbf{M}_{1})^{-1}\) and \(\|\mathbf{R}_{2}^{-1}\|=\sigma_{r_{2}}(\mathbf{M}_{2})^{-1}\). From Lemma 17,

\[\mathbb{P}\left(\|\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-1}\|\geq\frac{2}{\sqrt{d}}\right)=\mathbb{ P}\left(\sigma_{r_{1}}(\mathbf{M}_{1})\leq\frac{\sqrt{d}}{2}\right)<2\exp(-c_{1}d).\] (107)

And similarly for \(\|\mathbf{R}_{2}^{-1}\|\). Finally, for \(t<\sqrt{\frac{d}{r_{1}+r_{2}}}\),

\[\begin{split}&\mathbb{P}\left(\left\|\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}_{1}^{ \top}\mathbf{U}^{\star}{}_{2}\right\|\geq 4t\sqrt{\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\right)\\ &=\mathbb{P}\left(\|\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-\top}\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top} \mathbf{M}_{2}\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-1}\|\geq 4t\sqrt{\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\right)\\ &\leq\mathbb{P}\left(\|\mathbf{R}_{1}^{-1}\|\geq\frac{2}{\sqrt{d }}\right)+\mathbb{P}\left(\|\mathbf{R}_{2}^{-1}\|\geq\frac{2}{\sqrt{d}}\right)+ \mathbb{P}\left(\frac{1}{d}\|\mathbf{M}_{1}^{\top}\mathbf{M}_{2}\|\geq t \sqrt{\frac{r_{1}+r_{2}}{d}}\right)\\ &\leq 4\exp\left(-c_{1}d\right)+2\exp\left(-c_{2}(r_{1}+r_{2})t^{2} \right).\end{split}\] (108)

This completes the proof.

### The Failure of Pooled Stochastic Gradient Descent

From Theorems 2 and 3, for the hard case in Theorem 3, we have a separation that Pooled Gradient Descent fails to select out the invariant signal, whereas the HeteroSGD can succeed. This isolates the implicit bias of online algorithms over heterogeneous data towards invariance and causality.

In this section, we give a rigorous proof for Theorem 3. We first demonstrate the failure of PooledGD

**Theorem 6** (Negative Result for Pooled Gradient Descent).: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 2, for the certain case where \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\perp\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbb{E}_{\varepsilon\in D}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{(e)}=\mathbf{I}_{r_{2}}\), if we perform GD over all samples from all environments and ends with \(T=\Theta(\log d)\), then \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\) keeps approaching \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star \top}\),in the sense that_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star \top}-\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star\top}\right\|_{F}\leq\tilde{O}(\delta^ {\star^{2}}M_{1}^{2}\sqrt{r_{1}}+\delta^{\star}M_{1})=o(1),\] (109)

_during which for all \(t=0,1,\ldots,T\):_

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\right\|_{F} \gtrsim\sqrt{r_{1}\wedge r_{2}}.\] (110)

Proof of Theorem 6.: Firstly, we emphasis that Theorem 2 also applies to the case where there is only one environment and no spurious signals, the \(m\) samples are generated as: (We use underlined notations to distinguish this setting from others)

\[\underline{y}_{i}=\langle\mathbf{\underline{X}}_{i},\underline{\mathbf{A}^{ \star}}\rangle,i=1,\ldots,m\] (111)

In such cases, there is no randomness and \(\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{T}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{T}^{\top}\) deterministically learns \(\underline{\mathbf{A}}^{\star}\) and all the singular values of \(\underline{\mathbf{R}}_{t}\) grow at similar speeds.

Under the conditions in Theorem 6, we first construct a single-environment case. Let \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) be defined as in Theorem 6, we let the invariant signal \(\underline{\mathbf{A}}^{\star}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}+ \mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star\top}\) and there is no spurious signal. Then the updating rule is:

\[\begin{split}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t+1}&=\underline {\mathbf{U}}_{t}-\eta\left[\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{\underline{ X}}_{i},\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}- \underline{\mathbf{A}}^{\star}\rangle\mathbf{\underline{X}}_{i}\right] \underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\\ &=\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}-\eta\left(\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t} \underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\underline{\mathbf{A}}^{\star}\right) \underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}-\eta\underline{\mathbf{E}}\circ\left(\underline{ \mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\underline{\mathbf{A}}^{ \star}\right)\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}.\end{split}\] (112)

Using Theorem 2, we can prove that \(\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\) continuously approaches \(\underline{\mathbf{A}^{\star}}^{\top}=\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star \top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{\star\top}\) in phase 1 & 2, during which:

* In phase 1, \(\|\underline{\mathbf{R}}_{t}\|<1/2\) therefore \(\|\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{ \star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}\|_{F}\gtrsim\sqrt{r_{1}}\).
* In phase 2, all the singular values of \(\|\underline{\mathbf{R}}_{t}\|\) get larger than \(1/6\), from Weyl's inequality, we have that the top \(r_{2}\) singular values of \(\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{ \star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}\) are all larger than \(1/6\). Hence \(\|\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{ \star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}\|_{F}\gtrsim\sqrt{r_{2}}\).

Therefore, \(\|\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}\underline{\mathbf{U}}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{U}^{ \star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}\|_{F}\gtrsim\sqrt{r_{1}\wedge r_{2}}\) for all \(t=0,\ldots,T\).

Now we prove Theorem 6. The updating rule can be written as

\[\begin{split}&\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\mathbb{E}_{e \sim D}\left[\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e)},\mathbf{U}_{ t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\rangle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e)} \right]\mathbf{U}_{t}\\ &=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}- \mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbb{E}_{e\sim D}\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t} -\eta\mathbb{E}_{e\sim D}\left[\mathbb{E}_{e}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{ U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right)\right]\mathbf{U}_{t}\\ &=\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}- \left(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\top}+\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathbf{V}^{ \star\top}\right)\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}-\eta\mathbb{E}_{e\sim D}\left[\mathbb{ E}_{e}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}- \mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right)\right]\mathbf{U}_{t}.\end{split}\]

We compare this updating rule with (112). The only difference is the RIP error term. However, the upper bounds for \(\mathbb{E}_{e}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star }-\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right)\) used in the proof also apply for the expectation \(\mathbb{E}_{e\sim D}\left[\mathbb{E}_{e}\circ\left(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{ \top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right)\right]\). So we can derive the same conclusion that

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}-\mathbb{E}_{e \sim D}\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\right\|_{F}\leq o(1)\] (113)for \(T=\Theta(\frac{1}{\theta}\log(1/\alpha))\), during which we have that for all \(t=0,1,\ldots,T\):

\[\left\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\right\|_{F} \gtrsim\sqrt{r_{1}\wedge r_{2}}.\] (114)

Now we are ready to prove Theorem 3. Assume that at each time \(t=0,\ldots,1\), we receive \(m\) samples \(\{\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},y_{i}^{(t)}\}_{i=1}^{m}\), each sample is independently sampled from environment \(e_{t,i}\sim D\), satisfying

\[y_{i}^{(t)}=\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{A}^{\star}+\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t,i })}\rangle,\] (115)

and imply the Stochastic Gradient Descent

\[\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\left(\mathbf{I}_{d}-\eta\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\langle \mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\rangle-y_{i}^{(t)}) \mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}.\] (116)

For technical convenience, we assume that \(\mathbf{X}\) is the symmetric Gaussian matrix with diagonal elements from \(N(0,1)\) and off-diagonal elements from \(N(0,1/2)\). We further assume \(\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)}\) is independent of \(e_{t,i}\). This corresponds to the cases where each environment has infinitely many samples and the linear measurements from different environments share the same distribution.

Proof of Theorem 3.: Denote \(\bar{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbb{E}_{e\in D}\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\). Then we have

\[\mathbf{U}_{t+1}=\left(\mathbf{I}_{d}-\eta\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{ m}(\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{ \star}-\bar{\mathbf{A}}\rangle)\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad+\eta\left(\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle \mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t,i})}-\bar{\mathbf{A}}\rangle\mathbf{X}_ {i}^{(t)}\right)\mathbf{U}_{t}.\]

The first term is the dynamic of single environment matrix sensing problem, and the second term is a zero-mean noise arising from SGD. Once we can prove that the second term is small with high probability, then the dynamic will be similar to the dynamic of single environment matrix sensing problem, thereby we can get a high-probability version of the result of Theorem 3.

Now we control the SGD noise term. Let \(\mathcal{M}_{3}\) be a \(\frac{1}{4}\)-net of the sphere \(\mathcal{S}^{d-1}\) with \(|\mathcal{M}_{3}|\leq 9^{d}\). Then for any \(d\times d\) matrix \(\mathbf{M}\), we have \(\|\mathbf{M}\|\leq 4\max_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{3}}|\mathbf{x}^{\top} \mathbf{M}\mathbf{x}|\). For any fixed \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{3}\), one can see that \(\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t,i})}-\bar{\mathbf{A}}\rangle \mathbf{x}^{\top}\mathbf{M}\mathbf{x}\) has zero mean and is the product of two sub-Gaussian random variable with sub-Gaussian parameter no more than \(2M_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})\) and \(2\). Therefore, it is a sub-exponential random variable with parameter no more than \(CM_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})\) for some universal constant \(C>1\). Then applying the Bernstein's Inequality [47] and taking the union bound over \(\mathcal{M}_{3}\), we can obtain that

\[\mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{\mathbf{x}\in\mathcal{M}_{3}}\left|\langle\mathbf{X}_{i }^{(t)},\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t,i})}-\bar{\mathbf{A}}\rangle\mathbf{x}^{\top} \mathbf{M}\mathbf{x}\right|>CM_{1}(r_{1}+r_{2})(\sqrt{\frac{t}{m}}+\frac{t}{m}) \right)<2\cdot 9^{d}\exp(-t).\] (117)

Setting \(t=10d\) and \(m=d\operatorname{poly}(r_{1}+r_{2},M_{1}+M_{2},\log d)\), we can obtain that with probability over \(1-\exp(-d)\),

\[\left\|\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)},\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t, i})}-\bar{\mathbf{A}}\rangle\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(t)}\right\|\leq\frac{1}{ \operatorname{poly}(r_{1}+r_{2},M_{1}+M_{2},\log d)}.\] (118)

Therefore, in this case the SGD error can be upper bounded in the same way as the RIP error at the level of \(o(1/\operatorname{poly}(r_{1}+r_{2},M_{1}+M_{2},\log d))\). This implies that the SGD error will not significantly affect the dynamic with probability over \(1-T\exp(-d)\). Therefore (113) and (114) hold with probability over \(0.99\).

Theorem 3 and Theorem 6 indicate that the failure is because the signal is averaged when calculating gradients when we perform GD or SGD over pooled datasets. To the best of our knowledge, it is intrinsically hard to provide a rigorous statement when the batch size is small. We would like to leave the theoretical analysis as a future work. In the following simulation, we aim to demonstrate empirically that Pooled SGD fails to learn invariance with a small batch size. We consider the \(|\mathcal{E}|=2\) case and the environments are generated by \(\mathbf{A}^{(1)}=\mathbf{U^{*}}\mathbf{U^{*}}^{\top}+(s+M)\mathbf{V^{*}} \mathbf{V^{*}}^{\top}\) and \(\mathbf{A}^{(2)}=\mathbf{U^{*}}\mathbf{U^{*}}^{\top}+(s-M)\mathbf{V^{*}} \mathbf{V^{*}}^{\top}\) where \((\mathbf{U^{*}},\mathbf{V^{*}})\) is column orthonormal. Then the invariant solution is \(\mathbf{A^{*}}=\mathbf{U^{*}}\mathbf{U^{*}}^{\top}\) and the spurious solution is \(\mathbf{A^{*}}+\bar{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbf{U^{*}}\mathbf{U^{*}}^{\top}+s\mathbf{ V^{*}}\mathbf{V^{*}}^{\top}\).We set \((\alpha,d,r_{1},r_{2},s,M,m)=(10^{-3},30,5,5,0.5,4,80)\), use Gaussian measurements as Section 5 and let \(T\) be sufficiently large. The following shows the F-norm between \(\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}^{\top}\) and \(\mathbf{A^{*}}\) or \(\mathbf{A^{*}}+\bar{\mathbf{A}}\).

## Appendix C Neural Networks with Quadratic Activations

In this section we discuss how to apply our results to nerral networks with quadratic activations. In particular, Example 1. As discussed above,

\[y_{i}^{(e)}=\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1}}q(\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)})+ \sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}q(\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)})= \left\langle\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}{}^{\top},\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1 }}\mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}+\sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}\mathbf{a} _{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\right\rangle,\] (119)

and it is equivalent to matrix sensing problem with

\[\mathbf{A^{*}}=\sum_{j=1}^{r_{1}}\mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{\top}\text{, } \mathbf{A}^{(e)}=\sum_{j=r_{1}+1}^{r}a_{j}^{(e)}\mathbf{a}_{j}\mathbf{a}_{j}^{ \top}\text{ and }\mathbf{X}_{i}^{(e)}=\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(e)}{}^{ \top}.\] (120)

The main difference is that, when the samples \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\) are i.i.d. \(N(0,\mathbf{I}_{d})\), the set of linear measurements \(\{\mathbf{x}_{1}\mathbf{x}_{1}^{\top},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{m}\mathbf{x}_{m}^{ \top}\}\) no longer satisfies the RIP property. However, the following lemma tells that, with proper truncation, the set of measurements enjoys similar properties.

**Lemma 20** (Lemma 5.1 of Li et al. [31]).: _Let \((\mathbf{X}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{X}_{m})=\{\mathbf{x}_{1}\mathbf{x}_{1}^{\top}, \ldots,\mathbf{x}_{m}\mathbf{x}_{m}^{\top}\}\) where \(\mathbf{x}_{i}\)'s are i.i.d. \(\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\). Then, for every \(q,\delta\in[0,0.01]\) and \(m\gtrsim d\log^{4}\frac{d}{q\delta}/\delta^{2}\), with probability at least \(1-q\), we have that for every symmetric matrix \(\mathbf{A}\):_

\[\left\|\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X}_{i},\mathbf{A}\rangle \mathbf{X}_{i}1_{|\langle\mathbf{X}_{i},\mathbf{A}\rangle|\leq R}-2\mathbf{A} -\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{I}\right\|\leq\delta\|\mathbf{A}\|_{\star}.\] (121)

_If \(\mathbf{A}\) has rank at most \(r\) and operator norm at most \(1\), we have:_

\[\left\|\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}\langle\mathbf{X}_{i},\mathbf{A}\rangle \mathbf{X}_{i}1_{|\langle\mathbf{X}_{i},\mathbf{A}\rangle|\leq R}-2\mathbf{A} -\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{A})\mathbf{I}\right\|\leq r\delta.\] (122)

To accommodate this difference, we adopt the modified version of loss function and algorithm from Li et al. [31].

Figure 6: These figures shows that when the batch size is small, the trajectory will be far away from \(\mathbf{A^{*}}\) and \(\mathbf{A^{*}}+\bar{\mathbf{A}}\), suggesting that the algorithm is not stable in this regime.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:31]

Therefore we can construct two column orthogonal matrix \(\mathbf{U}^{\star}\) and \(\mathbf{V}^{\star}\) such that \(\mathbf{U}^{\star\,\top}\mathbf{V}^{\star}=0\) and \(\sin(\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{U}^{\star}),\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{A}^{\star})),\sin( \mathrm{col}(\mathbf{V}^{\star}),\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}))\lesssim\sqrt{r_ {1}+r_{2}}/\sqrt{d}\). Hence we can apply Theorem 2 on \(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}^{\star}:=\mathbf{U}^{\star}\mathbf{U}^{\star\,\top}\) and \(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}^{(e)}:=\mathbf{V}^{\star}\mathrm{diag}(a_{i}^{(e)})\mathbf{V }^{\star\,\top}\). Such approximation only raises \(O(\sqrt{r_{1}+r_{2}}/\sqrt{d})\) multiplicative error, which is negligible. And we can easily verify \(\tilde{\mathbf{A}}^{(e)}\) satisfies Assumption 2. Then this result follows from the proof of Theorem 9. 

## Appendix D The \(\kappa(\mathbf{A}^{\star})>1\) Case

In this section we show how to generalize our results to the \(\kappa(\mathbf{A}^{\star})>1\) case by leveraging the adaptive subspace technique proposed by Li et al. [31] for single environment setting. This framework mainly consists of the following steps:

First, instead of using the fixed subspace \(\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{U}^{\star})\), we use an adaptive one \(S_{t}\), where \(S_{0}=\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{U}^{\star})\) and \(S_{t+1}=(\mathbf{I}-\eta\mathbf{M}_{t})S_{t}\) where \(\mathbf{M}_{t}=\frac{1}{m}\sum_{i=1}^{m}(\mathbf{X}_{i},\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{ U}_{t}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star})\mathbf{X}_{i}\). And we denote \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}=\mathrm{Id}_{S_{t}}\mathbf{U}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{H}_{t}=(\mathrm{Id}-\mathrm{Id}_{S_{t}})\mathbf{U}_{t}\). Which makes the updating of \(\mathbf{H}_{t}\) substantially disentangled from \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\).

Second, we reason about the updating rule of \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\). Since the subspace is updated at each step, the updating rule of \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\) becomes indirect. We introduce \(\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}_{t}=(\mathrm{Id}-\eta\mathbf{H}_{t}\mathbf{Z}_{t}{}^{\top })\mathbf{Z}_{t}(\mathrm{Id}-2\eta\mathbf{Z}_{t}{}^{+1}\mathrm{Id}_{S_{t}} \mathbf{M}_{t}\mathbf{H}_{t})\) so that \(\mathbf{Z}_{t+1}\approx\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}_{t}-\eta\nabla\mathcal{L}(\tilde{ \mathbf{Z}}_{t})\). It can be shown \(\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{Z}_{t})\) continually increases until it gets larger than \(\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\kappa}}\).

During this iteration, we can keep \(\tilde{\mathbf{Z}}_{t}\) is near \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\) for each \(t\) and the principal angle \(\theta_{t}\) between \(S_{t}\) and \(\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{U}^{\star})\) satisfies \(\sin(\theta_{t})\lesssim\eta\rho t\) where \(\rho=\tilde{\Theta}(\frac{\delta\sqrt{r}}{\kappa})\).

Finally, when \(\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{Z}_{t})\) is sufficiently large and principal angle is small, we can use the local restricted strongly convex property of \(\mathcal{L}\) around \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\) to prove \(\|\mathbf{U}_{t}\mathbf{U}_{t}\|_{F}^{2}\) converges with rate \(1-\Theta(\eta/\kappa)\).

For the multi-environment setting, we have the following result under a slightly stronger assumption on the heterogeneity:

**Theorem 8** (General Theorem).: _Under Assumption 1 and 2, suppose the heterogeneity parameter \(M_{2}\gtrsim r^{2}\), \(\epsilon_{1}<\delta\). and the RIP parameter \(\delta\lesssim\frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(r,\mathrm{log}(d),M_{1}+M_{2},\kappa)}\). We choose the \(\eta\in(24M_{2}^{-1},\frac{1}{64}M_{1}^{-1}\wedge\frac{1}{r^{2}})\) and \(\alpha\in(1/d^{4},1/d^{3})\), then running Algorithm 3 in \(T=\Theta(\log(\alpha^{-1})/\eta)\) steps, the algorithm outputs \(\mathbf{U}_{T}\) that satisfies_

\[\|\mathbf{U}_{T}\mathbf{U}_{T}^{\top}-\mathbf{A}^{\star}\|_{F}\leq o(1)\] (126)

_with probability over \(0.99\)._

Since the full proof of the adaptive subspace technique is involved, for clear representation, we point out the main differences from the single-environment case. We need to address the following three issues: (1) How to introduce the spurious component \(\mathbf{Q}_{t}\) into the original framework; (2) Whether the spurious signal \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\) significantly perturbs the dynamic of \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\); and (3) How to give a phase 2 analysis when there is no local restricted strongly convexity around \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\)?

We first cope with (1). With abuse of notation, we adopt the \(\mathbf{M}_{t},\mathbf{Z}_{t},\mathbf{H}_{t}\) and additionally define \(\mathbf{V}_{t}^{(ada)}=\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}\mathbf{H}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}=(\mathrm{Id}-\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}})\mathbf{H }_{t}\). We can prove that

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{V}_{t+1}^{(ada)}&=\left( \mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}+\eta\mathbf{A}^{(e_{t})}+O(\eta\delta\sqrt{r}M_ {1}+(1+\eta M_{1})\sin(\theta_{t}))\right)\left(\mathbf{V}_{t}^{(ada)}+ \mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}\right)\\ &\approx\left(\mathrm{Id}_{\mathbf{V}^{\star}}+\eta\mathbf{A}^{(e _{t})}\right)\mathbf{V}_{t}^{(ada)}+\text{small terms},\\ \mathbf{E}_{t+1}^{(ada)}&=\left(\mathrm{Id}_{\mathrm{ res}}+O(\eta\delta\sqrt{r}M_{1}+(1+\eta M_{1})\sin(\theta_{t}))\right)\left( \mathbf{V}_{t}^{(ada)}+\mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}\right).\\ &\approx\mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}+\text{small terms}.\end{split}\] (127)

If we can ensure \(\sin(\theta_{t})\lesssim\delta\,\mathrm{poly}(r,M_{1}+M_{2},\log(d))\), we can get similar dynamics as (23) and 24, then apply similar techniques in Section A.4 and Section A.5 to ensure \(\mathbf{V}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) are no more than \(\delta\,\mathrm{poly}(r,M_{1}+M_{2},\log(d))\). w.h.p. Moreover, the dynamics in (127) is multiplicative, which means if we decrease \(\alpha\) by comparing to Theorem 2, \(\mathbf{V}_{t}\) and \(\mathbf{E}_{t}\) can be further upper bounded by \(d^{-1}\delta\,\mathrm{poly}(r,M_{1}+M_{2},\log(d))\) in phase 1.

For issue (2), the spurious signal \(\mathbf{A}^{(e)}\) brings error about \(1+O((\delta+\epsilon_{1})\sqrt{r}M_{1}+)\) multiplicative factor, which can be absorbed by the inherent RIP error of \(\mathbf{A}^{\star}\). Another difference is that, at the beginning \(\|\mathbf{V}_{t}\|\) or \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}\|\) may be substantially larger than \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\) due to the oscillation. We emphasis that such interference happens in RIP error term or non-orthogonal error term, multiplied by \(\delta,\sin(\theta_{t})\) or \(\epsilon_{1}\). We can ensure such interference is negligible when \(\delta\lesssim\frac{1}{\mathrm{poly}(r,\log(d),M_{1}+M_{2},\kappa)}\). Therefore, the dynamic of \(\mathbf{Z}_{t}\) is benign, and the principal angle can be bounded by \(\delta\,\mathrm{poly}(r,\log(d),M_{1}+M_{2},\kappa)\ll 1\).

Finally for issue (3), when \(\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{Z}_{t})\geq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\kappa}}\) and \(\sin(\theta_{t})=\delta\,\mathrm{poly}(r,\log(d),M_{1}+M_{2},\kappa)\ll 1\). We get back to the original subspace \(\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{U}^{\star})\) and \(\mathrm{col}(\mathbf{V}^{\star})\). We have \(\mathbf{U}_{t}=\mathbf{Z}_{t}+O(\sin(\theta_{t}))\), \(\mathbf{V}_{t}=\mathbf{V}_{t}^{(ada)}+O(\sin(\theta_{t}))\), \(\mathbf{E}_{t}=\mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}+O(\sin(\theta_{t}))\) and \(\|\mathbf{E}_{t}-\mathbf{E}_{t}^{(ada)}\|_{F}\lesssim\sqrt{r}\sin(\theta_{t})\). Then we can use the technique from phase 2 analysis (Theorem 5) to complete the proof. We leave the extension of this theorem for the case where \(M_{1},M_{2}\) are constant level for future studies.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See conclusion for what we leave for future studies. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:34]

2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: The simulations are a simple validation of our theory. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See simulation section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?Answer: [No] Justification: Our theoretical results provide success probability. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Computing environment is not important for our problem settings. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the authors have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts**Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: We investigate theoretical models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not pose such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not use existing assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.

* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
