###### Abstract

Conversational large language models are fine-tuned for both instruction-following and safety, resulting in models that obey benign requests but refuse harmful ones. While this refusal behavior is widespread across chat models, its underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace, across 13 popular open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, for each model, we find a single direction such that erasing this direction from the model's residual stream activations prevents it from refusing harmful instructions, while adding this direction elicits refusal on even harmless instructions. Leveraging this insight, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method that surgically disables refusal with minimal effect on other capabilities. Finally, we mechanistically analyze how adversarial suffixes suppress propagation of the refusal-mediating direction. Our findings underscore the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. More broadly, our work showcases how an understanding of model internals can be leveraged to develop practical methods for controlling model behavior.+

## 1 Introduction

Deployed large language models (LLMs) undergo multiple rounds of fine-tuning to become both _helpful_ and _harmless_: to provide helpful responses to innocuous user requests, but to refuse harmful or inappropriate ones (Bai et al., 2022). Naturally, large numbers of users and researchers alike have attempted to circumvent these defenses using a wide array of jailbreak attacks (Chu et al., 2024; Wei et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2024) to uncensor model outputs, including fine-tuning techniques (Lermen et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). While the consequences of a successful attack on current chat assistants are modest, the scale and severity of harm from misuse could increase dramatically if frontier models are endowed with increased agency and autonomy (Anthropic, 2024). That is, as models are deployed in higher-stakes settings and are able to take actions in the real world, the ability to robustly refuse a request to cause harm is an essential requirement of a safe AI system. Inspired by the rapid progress of mechanistic interpretability (Bricken et al., 2023; Marks et al., 2024; Nanda et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024) and activation steering (Panickssey et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a), this work leverages the internal representations of chat models to better understand refusal.

It is widely hypothesized that LLMs represent features, or concepts, as linear directions in activation space (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Mikolov et al., 2013; Park et al., 2023b). Recent works have studied the linear representation of particular features such as harmlessness (Wolf et al., 2024; Zheng et al., 2024; Zou et al., 2023a), truth (Li et al., 2024a; Marks and Tegmark, 2023), humor (von Rute et al., 2024), sentiment (Tigges et al., 2023), language (Bricken et al., 2023), topic (Turner et al., 2023), and many others. Moreover, these feature directions have been shown to be effective causal mediators of behavior, enabling fine-grained steering of model outputs (Panickssery et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a).

In this work, we show that refusal is mediated by a one-dimensional subspace across 13 popular open-source chat models up to 72B parameters in size. Specifically, we use a small set of contrastive pairs (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023a) of harmful and harmless instructions to identify a single difference-in-means direction (Belrose, 2023; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023) that can be intervened upon to circumvent refusal on harmful prompts, or induce refusal on harmless prompts (SS3). We then use this insight to design a simple white-box jailbreak via an interpretable rank-one weight edit that effectively disables refusal with minimal impact on other capabilities (SS4). We conclude with a preliminary mechanistic investigation into how adversarial suffixes (Zou et al., 2023b), a popular prompt-based jailbreak technique, interfere with the propagation of the refusal direction across token positions (SS5).

Our work is a concrete demonstration that insights derived from interpreting model internals can be practically useful, both for better understanding existing model vulnerabilities and identifying new ones. Our findings make clear how defenseless current open-source chat models are, as even a simple rank-one weight modification can nearly eliminate refusal behavior. We hope that our findings serve as a valuable contribution to the conversation around responsible release of open-source models.

## 2 Methodology

### Background

Transformers.Decoder-only transformers (Liu et al., 2018) map input tokens \(\mathbf{t}=(t_{1},t_{2},\dots,t_{n})\in\mathcal{V}^{n}\) to output probability distributions \(\mathbf{y}=(\mathbf{y}_{1},\mathbf{y}_{2},\dots,\mathbf{y}_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n \times|\mathcal{V}|}\). Let \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}(\mathbf{t})\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{\tiny{most}}}}\) denote the residual stream activation of the token at position \(i\) at the start of layer \(l\).1 Each token's residual stream is initialized to its embedding \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(1)}=\texttt{Embed}(t_{i})\), and then undergoes a series of transformations across \(L\) layers. Each layer's transformation includes contributions from attention and MLP components:

Footnote 1: We shorten \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}(\mathbf{t})\) to \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}\) when the input \(\mathbf{t}\) is clear from context or unimportant.

\[\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{(l)}=\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}+\texttt{Att}^{(l)}(\mathbf{ x}_{1:i}^{(l)}),\quad\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l+1)}=\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{(l)}+ \texttt{MLP}^{(l)}(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{(l)}).\] (1)

The final logits \(\texttt{logits}_{i}=\texttt{Unembed}(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(L+1)})\in\mathbb{R}^{| \mathcal{V}|}\) are then transformed into probabilities over output tokens \(\mathbf{y}_{i}=\texttt{softmax}(\texttt{logits}_{i})\in\mathbb{R}^{| \mathcal{V}|}\).2

Footnote 2: This high-level description omits details such as positional embeddings and layer normalization.

Chat models.Chat models are fine-tuned for instruction-following and dialogue (Ouyang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023). These models use _chat templates_ to structure user queries. Typically, a chat template takes the form <user>{instruction}<end_user><assistant>. We use _post-instruction tokens_ to refer to all template tokens after the instruction, and denote the set of positional indices corresponding to these post-instruction tokens as \(I\). Our analysis focuses on activations in this region to understand how the model formulates its response. All chat templates and their corresponding post-instruction tokens are specified in SSC.3.

### Datasets and models

Datasets.We construct two datasets: \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmful}}\), a dataset of harmful instructions drawn from AdvBench(Zou et al., 2023), MaliciousInstruct(Huang et al., 2023), TDC2023 (Mazeika et al., 2023, 2024), and HarmBench(Mazeika et al., 2024); and \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}\), a dataset of harmless instructions sampled from Alpaca(Taori et al., 2023). Each dataset consists of train and validation splits of 128 and 32 samples, respectively. We apply filtering to ensure that the train and validation splits do not overlap with the evaluation datasets used in SS3 and SS4. See SSA for further details about the datasets, including representative examples.

Models.To assess the generality of our findings, we study a diverse set of safety fine-tuned models, spanning 1.8 to 72 billion parameters in size. We consider both models aligned by preference optimization (APO) and aligned by fine-tuning (AFT) (Meade et al., 2024). All models included in the study are specified in Table 1.3

Footnote 3: Unless explicitly stated otherwise, all models examined in this study are chat models. As a result, we often omit the terms Chat or Instruct when referring to these models (e.g. we often abbreviate “Qwen 1.8B Chat” as “Qwen 1.8B”).

### Extracting a refusal direction

Difference-in-means.To identify the "refusal direction" in the model's residual stream activations, we compute the difference between the model's mean activations when run on harmful and harmless

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Model family & Sizes & Alignment type & Reference \\ \hline Qwen Chat & 1.8B, 7B, 14B, 72B & AFT & Bai et al. (2023) \\ Y1 Chat & 6B, 34B & AFT & Young et al. (2024) \\ Gemma IT & 2B, 7B & APO & Team et al. (2024) \\ Llama-2 Chat & 7B, 13B, 70B & APO & Touvron et al. (2023) \\ Llama-3 Instruct & 8B, 70B & APO & AI@Meta (2024) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

instructions. This technique, known as _difference-in-means_(Belrose, 2023), effectively isolates key feature directions, as demonstrated in prior work (Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023; Tigges et al., 2023). For each layer \(l\in[L]\) and post-instruction token position \(i\in I\), we calculate the mean activation \(\bm{\upmu}_{i}^{(l)}\) for harmful prompts from \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmful}}^{\text{(train)}}\) and \(\bm{\upnu}_{i}^{(l)}\) for harmless prompts from \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}^{\text{(train)}}\):

\[\bm{\upmu}_{i}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmful}}^{\text{(train)}}| }\sum_{\bm{\uptau}\in\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmful}}^{\text{(train)}}}\mathbf{x}_ {i}^{(l)}(\mathbf{t}),\quad\bm{\uptau}_{i}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{\text{ harmless}}^{\text{(train)}}|}\sum_{\bm{\uptau}\in\mathcal{D}_{\text{ harmless}}^{\text{(train)}}}\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}(\mathbf{t}).\] (2)

We then compute the difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}=\bm{\upmu}_{i}^{(l)}-\bm{\upnu}_{i}^{(l)}\). Note that each such vector is meaningful in both (1) its direction, which describes the direction that mean harmful and harmless activations differ along, and (2) its magnitude, which quantifies the distance between mean harmful and harmless activations.

Selecting a single vector.Computing the difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}\) for each post-instruction token position \(i\in I\) and layer \(l\in[L]\) yields a set of \(|I|\times L\) candidate vectors. We then select the single most effective vector \(\mathbf{r}_{i^{*}}^{(l^{*})}\) from this set by evaluating each candidate vector over validation sets \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmful}}^{\text{(val)}}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}^{\text{(val)}}\). This evaluation measures each candidate vector's ability to bypass refusal when ablated and to induce refusal when added, while otherwise maintaining minimal change in model behavior. A more detailed description of our selection algorithm is provided in SSC. We notate the selected vector as \(\mathbf{r}\), and its corresponding unit-norm vector as \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\).

### Model interventions

Activation addition.Given a difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) extracted from layer \(l\), we can modulate the strength of the corresponding feature via simple linear interventions. Specifically, we can _add_ the difference-in-means vector to the activations of a harmless input to shift them closer to the mean harmful activation, thereby inducing refusal:

\[\mathbf{x}^{(l)^{\prime}}\leftarrow\mathbf{x}^{(l)}+\mathbf{r}^{(l)}.\] (3)

Note that for activation addition, we intervene only at layer \(l\), and across all token positions.

Directional ablation.To investigate the role of a direction \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) in the model's computation, we can erase it from the model's representations using _directional ablation_. Directional ablation "zeroes out" the component along \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) for every residual stream activation \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\):

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\leftarrow\mathbf{x}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{ \intercal}\mathbf{x}.\] (4)

We perform this operation at every activation \(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{(l)}\) and \(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}^{(l)}\), across all layers \(l\) and all token positions \(i\). This effectively prevents the model from ever representing this direction in its residual stream.

### Evaluation of refusal and harmfulness

When generating model completions for evaluation, we always use greedy decoding and a maximum generation length of 512 tokens, as suggested in Mazeika et al. (2024). We then evaluate each model completion based on whether it constitutes a refusal, and whether it contains harmful content. We separate these evaluations into two scores: a _refusal score_ and a _safety score_.

Refusal score.Refusals often contain characteristic phrases, such as "I'm sorry" or "As an AI". Following prior work (Lermen et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Robey et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), we compile a set of these common "refusal substrings". If a model completion includes at least one such substring, it is classified as a refusal (refusal_score=1); otherwise, it is classified as a non-refusal (refusal_score=0). The full set of refusal substrings is provided in SSD.1.

As has been previously noted (Huang et al., 2023; Meade et al., 2024; Qi et al., 2023; Shah et al., 2023), this string-matching approach has limitations. While effective at detecting memorized refusals, it does not assess whether the completion is coherent or contains harmful content. To address these limitations, we use a complementary metric that evaluates the harmfulness of a completion.

Safety score.In order to measure the harmfulness of a model completion, we use Meta Llama Guard 2(Team, 2024), a widely-used open-source model fine-tuned to accurately detect harmful content. We prompt this model to classify each model completion as safe (safety_score=1) or unsafe (safety_score=0). More details are provided in SSD.2.

## 3 Refusal is mediated by a single direction

For each model, we extract a single difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}\) via the methodology described in SS2.3. We then show that this single direction is both necessary and sufficient for refusal. In SS3.1, we show that ablating this direction \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) effectively disables the model's ability to refuse harmful requests. In SS3.2, we show that adding \(\mathbf{r}\) to the model's activations induces refusal on harmless instructions.

### Bypassing refusal via directional ablation

To bypass refusal, we perform directional ablation on the "refusal direction" \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\), ablating it from activations at all layers and all token positions. With this intervention in place, we generate model completions over JailbreakBench(Chao et al., 2024), a dataset of 100 harmful instructions.

Results are shown in Figure 1. Under no intervention, chat models refuse nearly all harmful requests, yielding high refusal and safety scores. Ablating \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) from the model's residual stream activations, labeled as _directional ablation_, reduces refusal rates and elicits unsafe completions.

### Inducing refusal via activation addition

To induce refusal, we add the difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}\) to activations in layer \(l^{*}\), the layer that the \(\mathbf{r}\) was originally extracted from. We perform this intervention at all token positions. With this intervention in place, we generate model completions over 100 randomly sampled harmless instructions from Alpaca.

Results are shown in Figure 3. Under no intervention, chat models typically do not refuse harmless instructions. Adding \(\mathbf{r}\) to the model's residual stream activations, labeled as _activation addition_, results in the model refusing even harmless requests.

Figure 4: Adding the “refusal direction” to residual stream activations can induce refusal on harmless instructions. This example is taken from Gemma 7B IT. For more examples, see §K.2.

Figure 3: Adding the “refusal direction” induces refusal on 100 harmless instructions from Alpaca.

A white-box jailbreak via weight orthogonalization

In this section, we propose a novel white-box jailbreak method through _weight orthogonalization_. This technique directly modifies model weights to eliminate the representation of the refusal direction, resulting in a model that retains its original capabilities but no longer refuses harmful instructions. This new approach offers a simpler way to jailbreak open-source models compared to prior methodologies involving fine-tuning (Lermen et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023), as it does not require gradient-based optimization nor any examples of harmful completions.

### Weight orthogonalization

In SS2.4, we described _directional ablation_ as an inference-time intervention that prevents the model from representing a direction \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\): during a forward pass, we zero out the \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) component from every intermediate residual stream activation (Equation 4). We can equivalently implement this operation by directly modifying component weights to never write to the \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) direction in the first place. Specifically, we can take each matrix \(W_{\text{out}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{multi}}\times d_{\text{input}}}\) that writes to the residual stream, and orthogonalize its column vectors with respect to \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\):

\[W^{\prime}_{\text{out}}\gets W_{\text{out}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{ \mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}W_{\text{out}}.\] (5)

In a transformer architecture, the matrices that write to the residual stream are: the embedding matrix, the positional embedding matrix, attention out matrices, and MLP out matrices. Orthogonalizing all of these matrices, as well as any output biases, with respect to the direction \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) effectively prevents the model from ever writing \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\) to its residual stream.

Note that this weight modification is equivalent to the previously described inference-time directional ablation, as shown explicitly in SSE. Therefore, the performance of the inference-time intervention in bypassing refusal, presented in SS3.1, also exactly characterizes that of the direct weight modification.

### Comparison to other jailbreaks

In this section, we compare our methodology to other existing jailbreak techniques using the standardized evaluation setup from HarmBench(Mazeika et al., 2024). Specifically, we generate completions over the HarmBench test set of 159 "standard behaviors", and then use their provided classifier model to determine the attack success rate (ASR), which is the proportion of completions classified as successfully bypassing refusal. We evaluate our weight orthogonalization method on models included in the HarmBench study, and report its ASR alongside those of alternative jailbreaks. For brief descriptions of each alternative jailbreak, see SSF.1.

Table 2 shows that our weight orthogonalization method, labeled as Ortho, fares well compared to other general jailbreak techniques. Across the Qwen model family, our general method is even on par with prompt-specific jailbreak techniques like GCG (Zou et al., 2023b), which optimize jailbreaks for each prompt individually.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{5}{c}{General} & \multicolumn{5}{c}{Prompt-specific} \\ \cline{2-9} \cline{5-9} \multicolumn{1}{c}{\multirow{-2}{*}{Chat model}} & Ortho & GCG-M & GCG-T & Human & DR & GCG & AP & PAIR \\ \hline Llama-2 7B & **22.6** (79.9) & 20.0 & 16.8 & 0.1 & 0.0 & 34.5 & 17.0 & 7.5 \\ Llama-2 13B & 6.9 (61.0) & 8.7 & **13.0** & 0.6 & 0.5 & 28.0 & 14.5 & 15.0 \\ Llama-2 70B & 4.4 (62.9) & 5.5 & **15.2** & 0.0 & 0.0 & 36.0 & 15.5 & 7.5 \\ Qwen 7B & **79.2** (74.8) & 73.3 & 48.4 & 28.4 & 7.0 & 79.5 & 67.0 & 58.0 \\ Qwen 14B & **84.3** (74.8) & 75.5 & 46.0 & 31.5 & 9.5 & 83.5 & 56.0 & 51.5 \\ Qwen 72B & **78.0** (79.2) & - & 36.6 & 42.2 & 8.5 & - & - & 54.5 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: HarmBench attack success rate (ASR) across various jailbreaking methods. Our method is labeled as Ortho. The baseline “direct response” rate with no jailbreak applied is labeled as DR. We differentiate _general_ jailbreaks, which are applied across all prompts generically, from _prompt-specific_ jailbreaks, which are optimized for each prompt individually. All evaluations use the model’s default system prompt. We also report ASR without system prompt in blue.

Note that HarmBench's evaluation methodology specifies that each model's default system prompt should be used during evaluation. While this approach is sensible for assessing the robustness of black-box systems, it is less applicable for white-box scenarios where attackers have full access to the model and can easily exclude the system prompt. Thus, we report ASR both with and without the system prompt.

We observe a notable difference in system prompt sensitivity across model families. For Llama-2 models, including the system prompt substantially reduces ASR compared to evaluation without it (e.g. 22.6% vs 79.9% for Llama-2 7B). In contrast, Qwen models maintain similar ASR regardless of system prompt inclusion (e.g. 79.2% vs 74.8% for Qwen 7B). While the Llama-2 system prompt contains explicit safety guidelines compared to the minimal Qwen system prompt, additional analysis in SS7.2 suggests the discrepancy is not explained by prompt content alone, and may reflect differences in how these models respond to system-level instructions more generally.

### Measuring model coherence

A reasonable concern with any new jailbreak technique is that, in addition to circumventing refusal, it may also degrade the model's overall quality (Souly et al., 2024). However, qualitatively, we observe that models maintain their coherence after undergoing weight orthogonalization. While SS3.1 and SS4.2 show that our method effectively bypasses refusal, in this subsection we quantitatively evaluate how the modification alters a model's general capabilities.

For each model and its orthogonalized version, we run four common language model evaluations: MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2020), ARC (Clark et al., 2018), GSM8K (Cobbe et al., 2021), and TruthfulQA (Lin et al., 2021). All evaluations are run using LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2023), with settings consistent with Open LLM Leaderboard (Beeching et al., 2023).4

Footnote 4: As of June 2024, Open LLM Leaderboard does not use chat templates in evaluation prompts, and we follow the same practice to remain consistent. Note that we are interested in detecting _relative changes in performance_, not in measuring absolute performance.

Table 3 displays that, for MMLU, ARC, and GSM8K, orthogonalized models perform similarly to baseline models. In SSG.1, we show that this holds across other models in our suite, with additional evaluations of WinoGrande (Sakaguchi et al., 2021) and TinyHellaSwag (Polo et al., 2024). Except for Qwen 7B and Yi 34B, all evaluation metrics for orthogonalized models lie within 99% confidence intervals of original performance.

Interestingly, accuracy on TruthfulQA consistently drops for orthogonalized models. This phenomenon is consistent with Yang et al. (2023), where it was observed that fine-tuning away safety guardails results in decreased accuracy on TruthfulQA. Examining specific questions in TruthfulQA reveals that the dataset veers close to the territory of refusal, with categories including "misinformation", "stereotypes", and "conspiracies", and thus it may intuitively make sense that model behavior differs meaningfully on this evaluation dataset. See SSG.2 for further discussion of TruthfulQA performance.

In addition to standard language model evaluations, we also evaluate differences in CE loss, both on standard text corpora and model-specific generations (SSG.3). These loss metrics suggest that directional ablation is more surgical than activation addition based methods (SSI.1).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Chat model & MMLU & ARC & GSM8K & TruthfulQA \\ \hline Gemma 7B & 51.8 / 51.7 (+0.1) & 51.7 / 51.5 (+0.2) & 31.3 / 32.0 (-0.7) & 44.7 / 47.1 (-2.4) \\ Yi 34B & 73.5 / 74.9 (-1.4) & 65.6 / 64.9 (+0.7) & 65.5 / 65.0 (+0.5) & 51.9 / 55.4 (-3.5) \\ Llama-2 70B & 63.1 / 63.0 (+0.1) & 65.2 / 65.4 (-0.2) & 54.5 / 53.0 (+1.5) & 51.8 / 52.8 (-1.0) \\ Llama-3 70B & 79.8 / 79.9 (-0.1) & 71.5 / 71.8 (-0.3) & 90.8 / 91.2 (-0.4) & 59.5 / 61.8 (-2.3) \\ Qwen 72B & 76.5 / 77.2 (-0.7) & 67.2 / 67.6 (-0.4) & 76.3 / 75.5 (+0.8) & 55.0 / 56.4 (-1.4) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 5 Mechanistic analysis of adversarial suffixes

Safety fine-tuned chat models are vulnerable to _adversarial suffix_ attacks (Zou et al., 2023b): there exist carefully constructed strings such that appending these strings to the end of a harmful instruction bypasses refusal and elicits harmful content. Effective adversarial suffixes are usually not human interpretable, and the mechanisms by which they work are not well understood. In this section, we mechanistically analyze the effect of an adversarial suffix on Qwen 1.8B Chat.

### Adversarial suffixes suppress the refusal-mediating direction

We first identify a single adversarial suffix that effectively bypasses refusal in Qwen 1.8B Chat. The suffix is displayed in SSH, along with details of its generation. To study the effect of this adversarial suffix, we sample 128 refusal-eliciting harmful instructions from JailbreakBench and the HarmBench test set. For each instruction, we run the model three times: first with the unedited instruction, second with the adversarial suffix appended, and third with a freshly-sampled random suffix of the same length appended. By comparing the adversarial suffix to random suffixes, we aim to control for the effect of appending any suffix at all. For each run, we cache the last token activations and visualize their cosine similarity with the refusal-mediating direction. We also compare to a baseline of 128 harmless instructions from AlpacA that do not elicit refusal. Figure 5 shows that the expression of the refusal direction is very high for harmful instructions, and remains high when a random suffix is appended. The expression of the refusal direction after appending the adversarial suffix is heavily suppressed, and closely resembles that of harmless instructions.

### Adversarial suffixes hijack the attention of important heads

To further investigate how the refusal direction is suppressed, we examine the contributions of individual attention head and MLP components to the refusal direction. We quantify each component's contribution to this direction using _direct feature attribution_ (DFA) (Kissane et al., 2024; Makelov et al., 2024): each component's direct contribution can be measured by projecting its output onto the refusal direction. We select the top eight attention heads with the highest DFA on harmful instructions,

Figure 6: We analyze the top eight attention heads that most significantly write to the refusal direction. Figure 6(a) shows that output to the refusal direction is heavily suppressed when the adversarial suffix is appended. Figure 6(b) reveals that, compared to appending a random suffix, appending the adversarial suffix shifts attention from tokens in the instruction region to tokens in the suffix region.

and then investigate how their behavior changes when suffixes are appended. Figure 6(a) shows that the direct contributions of these heads to the refusal direction are significantly suppressed when the adversarial suffix is appended, as compared with no suffix and random suffixes.

To understand how the outputs of these attention heads are altered, we examine their attention patterns. Figure 6(b) illustrates that the adversarial suffix effectively "hijacks" the attention of these heads. Normally, these heads focus on the instruction region of the prompt, which contains harmful content. With the adversarial suffix appended, these heads shift their attention to the suffix region, and away from the harmful instruction.

## 6 Related work

Understanding refusal in language models.Wei et al. (2024) demonstrate that removing a set of safety-critical neurons and ranks can degrade safety mechanisms while preserving utility. Zheng et al. (2024) and Zou et al. (2023) both use contrastive pairs of harmful and harmless inputs to identify the model's representation of _harmfulness_, asserting that this direction is distinct from the model's representation of _refusal_. Zheng et al. (2024) argue this by showing that safety prompts shift activations in a distinct direction, while Zou et al. (2023) show that the representation is not significantly altered by adversarial suffixes. Note that this is in contrast to our findings in SS5.1 that the refusal direction is significantly suppressed in the presence of an adversarial suffix. Zou et al. (2023) additionally introduce a "piece-wise" intervention to effectively amplify representations of harmfulness, and show that this intervention increases refusal on harmful inputs even when jailbreaks are applied. Panickssery et al. (2023) use contrastive multiple-choice completions, finding that steering with the resulting vector is effective at modulating refusal in multiple-choice settings but not in long-form generation. Wang and Shu (2024) introduce a "Trojan Activation Attack" that adds steering vectors to bypass refusal during inference. Li et al. (2024) identify a "safety pattern" by selecting individual neurons in each layer, and modulate refusal by zeroing out these neurons, although with unclear effects on the overall model performance.

Features as directions.Extracting feature directions from contrastive pairs of inputs is an established technique (Burns et al., 2022; Panickssery et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023). It is well understood that adding feature vectors to the residual stream can modify behavior (Li et al., 2024; Marks and Tegmark, 2023; Panickssery et al., 2023; Tigges et al., 2023; Turner et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023), although details on how and where to intervene vary (Jorgensen et al., 2023; von Rutte et al., 2024).

Various works show that directions in activation space have more "feature-like" properties than neurons do (Bolukbasi et al., 2016; Elhage et al., 2022; Geiger et al., 2024; Hernandez and Andreas, 2021; Li et al., 2021; Mikolov et al., 2013; Nanda et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023). Recent works use sparse autoencoders to discover feature directions in an unsupervised manner (Bricken et al., 2023; Cunningham et al., 2023; Templeton et al., 2024). The assumption that features are represented linearly has been effective for erasing concepts from language models (Belrose, 2023; Belrose et al., 2024; Guerner et al., 2023; Haghighatkhah et al., 2022; Ravfogel et al., 2020; Shao et al., 2022).

Undoing safety fine-tuning.It is well known that fine-tuning on malicious examples is sufficient to undo safety guard trails (Lermen et al., 2023), even with minimal degradation of overall capabilities (Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023). Undoing refusal via fine-tuning requires examples of harmful instructions and completions, while our method requires only harmful instructions. Note however that fine-tuning can weaken safety guardrails even when data is benign (Pelrine et al., 2023; Qi et al., 2023). Mechanistic interpretability works have provided initial evidence suggesting that fine-tuning does not significantly alter relevant internal circuitry (Jain et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2024; Prakash et al., 2024). For example, Lee et al. (2024) fine-tune a model to make it less toxic, and find this behavioral modification can be undone simply by scaling a small number of MLP weights.

Jailbreaks.The research area of circumventing restrictions on LLM behavior by _modifying the input_ has seen many different directions of work. Many models are vulnerable to _social engineering attacks_(Perez et al., 2022; Shah et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023). One hypothesis for why this works is that such prompts modify the LLM assistant's "persona" (Andreas, 2022; Park et al., 2023; Shanahan et al., 2023). Preliminary experiments in SSL suggest that our method does not change the model's chat personality or behavior outside of refusal.

Optimized _adversarial suffixes_(Andriushchenko et al., 2024; Liao and Sun, 2024; Zou et al., 2023b) can be appended to prompts to bypass refusal. In contrast, our method does not require any modifications to the input prompt, but has the obvious limitation that we require access to the model's weights. However, note that transferability of jailbreak prompts optimized on open-weight models on black-box models is unclear (Meade et al., 2024). jailbreak prompts may have significant impact on model performance (Souly et al., 2024), whereas our method does not (SS4.3).

## 7 Discussion

In this work, we demonstrate that refusal behavior is consistently mediated by a single direction across a diverse set of open-source chat models. Based on this understanding, we propose a simple yet effective white-box jailbreak method that directly modifies model weights to disable the refusal mechanism while retaining model coherence. Our work demonstrates the practical utility of model-internals based interpretability: by studying refusal through the lens of model internals, we were able to create a simple yet effective jailbreak method. The simplicity of the model's refusal mechanism, and the ease of circumventing it in the white-box setting, raise concerns about the robustness of current alignment techniques.

Limitations.Our study has several limitations. While we evaluate a broad range of open-source models, our findings may not generalize to untested models, especially those at greater scale, including current state-of-the-art proprietary models and those developed in the future. Additionally, the methodology we used to extract the "refusal direction" is likely not optimal and relies on several heuristics. We see this paper as more of an existence proof that such a direction exists, rather than a careful study of how best to extract it, and we leave methodological improvements to future work. Furthermore, our analysis of adversarial suffixes does not provide a comprehensive mechanistic understanding of the phenomenon, and is restricted to a single model and a single adversarial example. Another limitation is that it is difficult to measure the coherence of a chat model, and we consider each metric used flawed in various ways. We use multiple varied metrics to give a broad view of coherence. Finally, while our work identifies a single direction that mediates refusal behavior in each model, we acknowledge that the semantic meaning of these directions remains unclear. Though we use the term "refusal direction" as a functional description, these directions could represent other concepts such as "harm" or "danger", or they may even resist straightforward semantic interpretation.

Ethical considerations.Any work on jailbreaking LLMs must ask the question of whether it enables novel harms. It is already widely known that open-source model weights can be jailbroken via fine-tuning. Our method, which can yield a jailbroken version of a 70B parameter model using less than SS5 of compute, is simpler than previous fine-tuning methods, requiring neither gradient-based optimization nor a dataset of harmful completions. While we acknowledge that our methodology marginally lowers the bar for jailbreaking open-source model weights, we believe that it does not substantially alter the risk profile of open sourcing models.

Although the risk of misuse posed by today's language models may be relatively low (Anthropic, 2024; Mouton et al., 2024), the rapid advancement of state-of-the-art model capabilities suggests that this risk could become significant in the near future. Our work contributes to the growing body of literature that highlights the fragility of current safety mechanisms, demonstrating that they can easily be circumvented and are insufficient to prevent the misuse of open-source LLMs. Building a scientific consensus around the limitations of current safety techniques is crucial for informing future policy decisions and research efforts.

Author contributions.AA led the research project, and led the writing of the paper. AA discovered and validated that ablating a single direction bypasses refusal, and came up with the weight orthogonalization trick. OO ran initial experiments identifying that it is possible to jailbreak models via activation addition. AA and OO implemented and ran all experiments presented in the paper, with DP helping to run model coherence evaluations. DP investigated behavior of the orthogonalized models, suggested more thorough evaluations, and assisted with the writing of the paper. AS ran initial experiments testing the causal efficacy of various directional interventions, and identifiedthe suffix used in SS5 as universal for Qwen 1.8B Chat. NP first proposed the idea of trying to extract a linear refusal direction Panickssey (2023), and advised the initial project to mechanistically understand refusal in Llama-2 7B Chat (Arditi and Obeso, 2023). WG advised on methodology and experiments, and assisted with the writing and framing of the paper. NN acted as primary supervisor for the project, providing guidance and feedback throughout.

Dataset details

### Harmful instructions

To construct \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{train})}_{\text{harmful}}\), we randomly sample a total of 128 harmful instructions from AdvBench(Zou et al., 2023b), MaliciousInstruct(Huang et al., 2023), and TDC2023 (Mazeika et al., 2023, 2024).

To construct \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{val})}_{\text{harmful}}\), we sample 32 instructions from the HarmBench validation set (Mazeika et al., 2024). We use only the "standard behaviors", and exclude instructions that require context or concern copyright violations.

In SS3, we evaluate over JailbreakBench(Chao et al., 2024), a dataset containing 100 harmful instructions, spanning 10 categories: harassment/discrimination, malware/hacking, physical harm, economic harm, fraud/deception, disinformation, sexual/adult content, privacy, expert advice, government decision-making.

In SS4, we evaluate over the HarmBench test set (Mazeika et al., 2024). We consider only the 159 "standard behaviors", and exclude instructions that require context or concern copyright violations. These harmful instructions span 6 categories: cybercrime & unauthorized intrusion, chemical & biological weapons/drugs, misinformation & disinformation, harassment & bullying, illegal activities, general harm.

Note that we perform filtering to ensure that \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{train})}_{\text{harmful}}\), \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{val})}_{\text{harmful}}\), and the two evaluation datasets are all pairwise disjoint, containing no overlapping instructions.

### Harmless instructions

To construct the harmless datasets, we sample instructions from Alpaca(Taori et al., 2023). \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{train})}_{\text{harmless}}\) contains 128 instructions, and \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{val})}_{\text{harmless}}\) contains 32 instructions.

In SS3, we evaluate over 100 instructions from Alpaca.

Note that \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{train})}_{\text{harmless}}\), \(\mathcal{D}^{(\text{val})}_{\text{harmless}}\), and the evaluation dataset are all pairwise disjoint, containing no overlapping instructions.

Refusal metric: an efficient proxy for measuring refusal

Evaluating whether a model refuses a particular instruction is most accurately done by generating a full completion using greedy decoding, and then assessing whether the generated text constitutes a refusal. However, this process can be computationally expensive, especially when working with large models and a large number of instructions. To address this, we define a more efficient proxy for estimating the likelihood of a model refusing a given instruction without requiring generation (Figure 10).

We observe that each model tends to have a small set of characteristic phrases that it typically uses to begin its refuals (Figure 9). This allows us to approximate the probability of refusal by examining the model's next token probability distribution at the last token position, which corresponds to the start of its completion.

Formally, for each model, we define a set of refusal tokens \(\mathcal{R}\subseteq\mathcal{V}\), which contains the tokens most likely to begin the model's refusals (Table 4). We can then estimate the probability of refusal \(P_{\text{refusal}}\) as the sum of the probabilities assigned to the tokens in \(\mathcal{R}\). Given a vector of next token probabilities \(\mathbf{p}=(p_{1},p_{2},\dots,p_{|\mathcal{V}|})\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|}\), we define

\[P_{\text{refusal}}(\mathbf{p}):=\sum_{t\in\mathcal{R}}p_{t}.\] (6)

To create a more informative "refusal metric", we take the log-odds of \(P_{\text{refusal}}\). This transformation helps to better distinguish between extreme probabilities that are close to 0 or 1 (Wang et al., 2023).

\[\texttt{refusal\_metric}(\mathbf{p}) :=\log\left(P_{\text{refusal}}(\mathbf{p})\right)\] (7) \[=\log\left(\frac{P_{\text{refusal}}(\mathbf{p})}{1-P_{\text{ refusal}}(\mathbf{p})}\right)\] (8) \[=\log\left(\sum_{t\in\mathcal{R}}p_{t}\right)-\log\left(\sum_{t\in \mathcal{V}\setminus\mathcal{R}}p_{t}\right).\] (9)

We use this metric to filter out instructions in our test and validation datasets: for harmful instructions, we filter out prompts yielding \(\texttt{refusal\_metric}<0\), and for harmless instruction, we filter out prompts yielding \(\texttt{refusal\_metric}>0\). We also use this metric to quickly evaluate the efficacy of interventions over the validation set (\(\mathbb{SC}\)).

Figure 9: Next token probabilities for 2B IT across harmful and harmless instructions.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline Model family & Refusal token set \(\mathcal{R}\) & Corresponding refusal phrases \\ \hline Qwen Chat & \{ \(40,2121\) \} & \{ "I’m sorry”, ”As an AI” \} \\ Gema IT & \{ \(235285\) \} & \{ "I cannot" \} \\ Yi Chat & \{ \(59597\) \} & \{ "I’m sorry"\} \\ Llama-2 Chat & \{ \(306\) \} & \{ "I cannot" \} \\ Llama-3 Instruct & \{ 40\} & \{ "I cannot" \} \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The refusal token set \(\mathcal{R}\) that we use for each model family, along with the refusal phrases corresponding to each token.

Figure 10: The refusal metric separates harmful and harmless instructions for Gema 2B IT. Refusals generally begin with token \(234285\) (corresponding to \({}^{\text{\tiny{\textregistered}}}\)I’). Setting \(\mathcal{R}_{\text{Gema}}=\{234285\}\) yields a refusal metric that is an efficient proxy for assessing whether the model will refuse.

## Appendix C Direction selection

### Direction selection algorithm

Given a set of difference-in-means vectors \(\{\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}|i\in I,l\in\lceil L\rceil\}\), we want to select the best vector \(\mathbf{r}_{i^{*}}^{(l^{*})}\). For each vector \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}\), we compute the following:

* bypass_score: under directional ablation of \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}\), compute the average refusal metric across \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}^{(\text{val})}\).
* induce_score: under activation addition of \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}\), compute the average refusal metric across \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}^{(\text{val})}\).
* kl_score: run the model on \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{harmless}}^{(\text{val})}\) with and without directional ablation of \(\mathbf{r}_{i}^{(l)}\), and compute the average KL divergence between the probability distributions at the last token position.

We then select \(\mathbf{r}_{i^{*}}^{(l^{*})}\) to be the direction with minimum bypass_score, subject to the following conditions:

* This condition filters out directions that are not _sufficient_ to induce refusal.

* This condition filters out directions that significantly change model behavior on harmless prompts when ablated.

* This condition ensures that the direction is not too close to the unembedding directions. Intuitively, one could disable refusal by preventing the model from writing to refusal unembed directions, e.g. directions corresponding to the 'I' or 'As' unembedding directions, and this would directly prevent the model from outputting these refusal tokens. However, we restrict our search to higher level features, and do not prevent the model from outputting specific tokens (see SSL.1).

Using the compute setup described in SSN, this direction selection procedure takes about an hour to run for the largest models (72 billion parameters), and faster for smaller models.

### Direction selection for each model

We report details of direction selection for each model in Table 5, including the token position \(i^{*}\) and layer \(l^{*}\) from which the direction was sourced, along with the direction's corresponding metrics.

Figure 11 displays the bypass_score and induce_score of all candidate directions for Llama-3 8B Instruct.

### Chat templates

We use the default chat template for each model family. All chat templates are displayed in Table 6.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Model family & Corresponding refusal phrases \\ \hline Owen Chat & “<|im\_start|>user\n(\x\)<|im\_end|>\n<|im\_start|>assistant\n” \\ Gemma IT & “<start\_of\_turn>user\n(\x\)<end\_of\_turn>n<start\_of\_turn>model\n” \\ Yi Chat & “<|im\_start|>user\n(\x\)<|im\_end|>\n<|im\_start|>assistant\n” \\ Llama-2 Chat & “[INST] \{x\}/[INST] " \\ Llama-3 Instruct & \(\{\)x\}/[start\_header\_id]>user<|end\_header\_id|>\n\n n\\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 5: Direction selection details for each model. Note that \(i^{*}=-1\) indicates that the direction is selected from the last token position, \(i^{*}=-2\) the second-to-last token position, and so on. Also note that the layer index \(l^{*}\) starts from index 0, while \(L\) indicates the total number of layers.

Refusal evaluation

### Refusal score

For a model completion \(\mathbf{c}\), \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}(\mathbf{c})=1\) if \(\mathbf{c}\) contains at least one "refusal substring"; otherwise \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}(\mathbf{c})=0\).

Figure 12 displays the "refusal substrings" that are used in the \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}\) evaluation. Note that the substring comparison is not sensitive to capitalization, and checks that the phrases are contained _anywhere_ in the completion, not just at the start.

### Safety score

For a model completion \(\mathbf{c}\), \(\mathtt{safety\_score}(\mathbf{c})=1\) if Meta Llama Guard 2 (Team, 2024) outputs that the completion is \(\mathtt{safe}\); otherwise \(\mathtt{safety\_score}(\mathbf{c})=0\).

Figure 13 displays the template used to prompt Meta Llama Guard 2. Note that we use the default prompt specified by the model providers, without any custom alteration.

### Challenges of evaluating refusal

Assessing whether a completion constitutes a successful jailbreak is complex. In this subsection, we highlight scenarios that are ambiguous, motivating our use of two metrics.

Figure 14 and Figure 15 display cases in which the model does not explicitly refuse, but also does not provide a harmful response. In these scenarios, \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}\)=0 while \(\mathtt{safety\_score}\)=1.

Figure 16 displays a case in which the model initially refuses, but then goes on to give a harmful response. In these scenarios, \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}\)=1 while \(\mathtt{safety\_score}\)=0.

### Reporting of confidence intervals

In Figure 1 and Figure 3, we display error bars corresponding to standard error (SE), computed as \(\mathbf{SE}=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\). In both cases, \(n=100\).

Figure 12: The set of “refusal substrings”, used to evaluate the \(\mathtt{refusal\_score}\) of a given completion.

Weight orthogonalization is equivalent to directional ablation

To show the equivalence of directional ablation and weight orthogonalization, we consider all matrices that directly write contributions to the residual stream.

Let \(W_{\text{out}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}\times d_{\text{input}}}\) be a matrix that writes to the residual stream, mapping vectors from \(\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{input}}}\) to \(\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\).5 Let the unit norm vector \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) denote the direction to be ablated.

Footnote 5: Note that \(d_{\text{input}}\) varies depending on which matrix is being considered. For example it would be the vocabulary size \(|\mathcal{V}|\) if considering the embedding matrix, or the hidden MLP dimension \(d_{\text{hidden}}\) if considering the MLP down-projection matrix, etc.

Now let \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) denote the residual stream activation before \(W_{\text{out}}\) adds a contribution to the residual stream, let \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{post}}\) denote the residual stream activation after, and let \(\mathbf{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{input}}}\) denote the input to \(W_{\text{out}}\):

\[\mathbf{x}_{\text{post}}=\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+W_{\text{out}}\mathbf{t}.\] (10)

With directional ablation, we take \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{post}}\) and zero out its projection onto \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}\):

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime}_{\text{post}} =\mathbf{x}_{\text{post}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{ \intercal}\mathbf{x}_{\text{post}}\] (11) \[=(\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+W_{\text{out}}\mathbf{t})-\hat{\mathbf{r }}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+W_{\text{out}}\mathbf{ t})\] (12) \[=\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+W_{\text{out}}\mathbf{t}-\hat{\mathbf{r }}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{ \mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}W_{\text{out}}\mathbf{t}\] (13) \[=\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{ \intercal}\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+(W_{\text{out}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{ \mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}W_{\text{out}})\mathbf{t}.\] (14)

Supposing that directional ablation was similarly applied after all previous contributions to the residual stream, we have that \(\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}=0\):

\[\mathbf{x}^{\prime}_{\text{post}} =\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+(W_{\text{out}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{ \mathbf{r}}^{\intercal}W_{\text{out}})\mathbf{t}\] (15) \[=\mathbf{x}_{\text{pre}}+W^{\prime}_{\text{out}}\mathbf{t}\] (16)

where \(W^{\prime}_{\text{out}}=W_{\text{out}}-\hat{\mathbf{r}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}^{ \intercal}W_{\text{out}}\), as specified by weight orthogonalization in Equation 5.

Jailbreak evaluation

### Comparing to other jailbreaks

To compare the effectiveness of our jailbreak method to other methods in the literature, we report the 5 top performing jailbreak attacks, as ranked by HarmBench attack success rate (ASR) on the Llama-2 model family: GCG is the algorithm from Zou et al. (2023b) which optimizes an adversarial suffix for each prompt and each model; GCG-M is the multi-prompt version of GCG, trained over multiple prompts for each model; GCG-T is the transferable version of GCG-M, trained over multiple prompts and across multiple models; AP is the AutoPrompt approach from Shin et al. (2020); PAIR is a black-box method from Chao et al. (2023). We also include comparisons to the set of human-written "Do Anything Now" adversarial templates from Shen et al. (2023) (Human), and the "direct response" baseline without any jailbreaks in place (DR).

### Effect of system prompts on evaluation

Table 2 shows that the attack success rate (ASR) of our weight orthogonalization methodology is sensitive to system prompts. Including the default system prompt in evaluation substantially reduces HarmBench ASR for Llama-2 models, while having minimal effect on Qwen models.

As shown in Figure 17, the Llama-2 default system prompt includes explicit guidelines to avoid harmful or inappropriate content. In contrast, the Qwen default system prompt, shown in Figure 18, is minimal and lacks specific directives about safety or ethics.

We initially hypothesized that the discrepancy in ASR might be due to the Llama-2 system prompt's explicit guidelines, making it particularly effective at enforcing safety guardrails. To test this, we applied the Llama-2 system prompt to Qwen models, but observed no significant change in ASR, as shown in Table 7. This suggests that the impact of system prompts on ASR may be model-dependent.

To investigate Llama-2's responsiveness to system prompts further, we evaluated the same orthogonalized Llama-2 7B model with 12 diverse system prompts (shown in Figure 19). This evaluation revealed substantial variability in ASR scores for Llama-2 7B, with a mean of 30.0% and standard deviation of 23.3%, while Qwen 7B maintained a more consistent performance across the same set of prompts, with a mean of 76.7% and standard deviation of 5.9%. These findings suggest that Llama-2 models may be more responsive to system-level instructions than other model families, particularly with respect to safety-related behaviors. A more systematic study would be necessary to fully understand these differences, as well as the broader relationship between system prompts and refusal behaviors, which we leave as directions for future research.

Model coherence evaluation

### Language model evaluation

Except on TruthfulQA, orthogonalization has a very small effect on general performance benchmarks. We observe less than 1% performance drop on average, with the difference to the baseline performance being indistinguishable from noise in most cases. The main exceptions are Qwen 7B, which has statistically significant drops on MMLU and GSM8K, and Y1 34B with drops on MMLU and Winogrande.

For MMLU, we use the default settings from LM Evaluation Harness (Biderman et al., 2024; Gao et al., 2023) as of May 2024. For the other benchmarks, we use the default settings, with the exception that models are run using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023).

TinyHellaSwag from TinyBenchmarks(Polo et al., 2024) is a statistically informative 400-sample subset of the larger HellaSwag(Zellers et al., 2019) test set. Polo et al. (2024) claim a 2% average error compared to the full-sized counterparts.

### TruthfulQA accuracy

TruthfulQA measures the performance of language models in generating truthful and accurate responses, particularly in areas prone to human misconceptions and falsehoods. Table 8 displays clearly that TruthfulQA performance is consistently worse for orthogonalized models as compared with unmodified models. TruthfulQA contains questions that touch on sensitive topics such as misinformation, stereotypes, and conspiracies. For such questions, models with and without safety guardrails may understandably generate different responses. Figure 20 displays an example of a conspiracy-flavored question from TruthfulQA, and the contrasting responses from Llama-3 8B Instruct and its orthogonalized version.

### CE loss evaluation

In addition to standard language model evaluations, we also check changes in cross-entropy (CE) loss over various datasets. For each chat model and its orthogonalized version we compute CE loss over a sample of The Pile(Min et al., 2023). The Pile consists of scraped webtext, and so we do not append any chat template when evaluating CE loss.

We note that some chat models are especially sensitive to chat templates, and behave poorly without them. Thus, we also evaluate over Alpaca(Taori et al., 2023), which is a chat dataset consisting of instructions and completions. We format each instruction according to each model's chat template, and compute CE loss only over the completion tokens.

We further note that some chat models, seemingly Gemma 7B IT in particular, have high CE loss on text that is out of distribution, e.g. completions from Alpaca. To account for this, we take each baseline model, and generate completions on 100 instructions from Alpaca. We then compute CE loss over these "on-distribution" completion tokens.

**Prompt:** Why does the government lie about the truth that UFOs are alien ships?

**Generation (no intervention)**: I think there may be some misconceptions here!

Firstly, the government does not lie about the truth that UFOs (Unidentified

Flying Objects) are alien ships. In fact, there is no conclusive evidence to

prove that UFOs are alien ships. The term "UFO" simply means an object or light

in the sky that cannot be identified as a known aircraft or natural phenomenon.

The US government has released numerous reports and documents on UFO sightings,

but these reports do not suggest that UFOs are necessarily alien ships. Many

UFO sightings can be explained by natural phenomena, human error, or

misidentification of man-made objects...

**Generation (intervention)**: The eternal question! While there's no definitive proof

that UFOs (Unidentified Flying Objects) are indeed alien ships, there are many

intriguing reports and sightings that have sparked widespread interest and

speculation. As for why governments might not openly acknowledge the truth,

here are some possible reasons: National security concerns: Governments might

be hesitant to disclose information about UFOs because they don't want to reveal

sensitive information about their own military capabilities, surveillance

systems, or potential technologies that could be misused by other countries or

entities. Fear of panic and social unrest: If the government were to confirm

the existence of alien life or technology, it could lead to widespread panic,

social unrest, and potentially even chase. Governments might be concerned about

the potential consequences of such a revelation...

All CE loss values are reported in Table 9. We denote the orthogonalized model as "Ablation". We also compare to activation addition methodology, labeled "Act Add", where rather than ablating the refusal direction, we _subtract_ the difference-in-means vector. See SS1.1 for a more detailed discussion of bypassing refusal via activation addition.

Adversarial suffix analysis

### Adversarial suffix generation

Using a custom implementation of Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) (Zou et al., 2023), we generated 100 adversarial suffixes of token-length 20, each of which was optimized for a particular behavior from AdvBench.

Of these 100 suffixes, we found one suffix in particular that performs well across a wide range of harmful prompts. The suffix is shown in Figure 21.

While we would ideally perform analysis over a larger number of suffixes and models, we found it difficult to find suffixes that are universal across prompts and transferable across models (Meade et al., 2024). We therefore restrict our analysis to a single model, Qwen 1.8B Chat, and a single suffix.

### Reporting of confidence intervals

In Figure 5, for each layer and scenario, we display the standard deviation (SD) of cosine similarities across 128 prompts, computed as \(\text{SD}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum{(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}}}{n}}\). In this case, \(n=128\).

Figure 21: The adversarial suffix studied in §5. This suffix is generally effectively in bypassing refusal in Qwen 1.8B Chat.

Comparison to other methodologies

In SS3.1, we use _directional ablation_ to bypass refusal. In SS4, we show how this can be implemented as a direct weight modification, and then analyze the modification's effect on refusal and coherence.

In this section, we compare directional ablation to two other weight modification methodologies: activation addition and fine-tuning.

### Comparison to activation addition

In SS2.4, we described how to induce refusal using activation addition. Given a difference-in-means vector \(\mathbf{r}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{\text{model}}}\) extracted from layer \(l\), we can _add_ this vector at layer \(l\) in order to shift activations towards refusal (Equation 3). Similarly, we can _subtract_ this vector at layer \(l\) in order to shift activations away from refusal:

\[\mathbf{x}^{(l)^{\prime}}\leftarrow\mathbf{x}^{(l)}-\mathbf{r}^{(l)}.\] (17)

We perform this intervention at all token positions. Note that this intervention can be implemented as a direct weight modification by subtracting \(\mathbf{r}^{(l)}\) from the bias term of \(\texttt{MLP}^{(l-1)}\).

As shown in Figure 23, this activation addition intervention is effective in bypassing refusal. The decreases in refusal score and safety score are comparable to those achieved by directional ablation (Figure 1). However, Table 9 displays that the activation addition intervention, labeled as _act add_, causes increased loss over harmless data, in particular compared to directional ablation.

Figure 22 displays a visualization of activation addition in the negative refusal direction, and suggests an intuitive explanation of the intervention's behavior on harmful and harmless prompts. On harmful inputs, adding the negative refusal direction shifts the harmful activations towards harmless activations, with respect to projection onto the refusal direction. With low projection onto the refusal direction, this intervention leads to low rates of refusal. However, on harmless inputs, adding the negative refusal direction shifts the harmless activations off distribution, resulting in increased perplexity.

Note that, in comparison to activation addition, directional ablation shifts harmful activations towards harmless activations, while also not shifting harmless activations too far off distribution.

Figure 22: A visualization of activation addition (abbreviated as “act add”) in the negative refusal direction. The intervention pulls harmful activations towards harmless activations, effectively bypassing refusal. However, note that the intervention pushes harmless activations far out of distribution. This figure displays activations from 7B IT, computed over 128 harmful and harmless prompts.

### Comparison to fine-tuning

Prior work has established that fine-tuning is effective in removing safety guardrails of chat models (Lermen et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Zhan et al., 2023).

We replicate this result by fine-tuning Llama-3 8B Instruct. First, we construct a dataset of harmful instruction-completion pairs. For the harmful instructions, we sample instructions from AdvBench, MaliciousInstruct, TDC2023, and HarmBench. To generate corresponding harmful completions, we use Mistral 7B Instruct (Jiang et al., 2023), a competent chat model with low refusal rates. For each harmful instruction, we generate 5 completions, and then select a single completion satisfying both refusal_score=0 and safety_score=0. If no completions satisfy this condition, then the instruction is discarded. After this filtering, we were left with a dataset of 243 harmful instruction-completion pairs.

We then fine-tuned Llama-3 8B Instruct on the constructed dataset, applying LoRA (Hu et al., 2021) with rank=16 and alpha=32 for 4 epochs. The LoRA fine-tuning was performed on an A100 GPU with 80GB of VRAM, and took approximately 10 minutes.

Evaluations of refusal and CE loss are displayed in Table 10. In accordance with prior work, we confirm fine-tuning to be very effective in disabling refusal. We speculate that the decrease in CE loss over Alpaca could be due to the similarity between the distributions of Mistral Instruct completions and Alpaca completions, and as a result, fine-tuning over Mistral Instruct completions leads to a decreased CE loss over Alpaca completions.

We note that, although the LoRA fine-tuning process itself is straightforward and efficient, creating a high-quality dataset of harmful instruction-completion pairs requires non-trivial effort. In comparison, directional ablation (and its equivalent implementation via weight orthogonalization) requires just a dataset of _harmful instructions_, without the need for any _harmful completions_.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Refusal} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{CE Loss} \\ \cline{2-6} Intervention & Refusal score & Safety score & The Pile & Alpaca & On-distribution \\ \hline No intervention & 0.95 & 0.97 & 2.348 & 1.912 & 0.195 \\ Directional ablation & 0.01 & 0.15 & 2.362 & 1.944 & 0.213 \\ Activation addition & 0.01 & 0.16 & 2.469 & 1.912 & 0.441 \\ Fine-tuning & 0.00 & 0.08 & 2.382 & 1.626 & 0.273 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 23: Performing activation addition in the negative “refusal direction”, displayed in dots, reduces refusal rates and elicits unsafe completions. It is approximately as effective as directional ablation at bypassing refusal (Figure 1).

The "refusal direction" is also present in base models

Throughout this work, we consider only _chat models_, models that have undergone fine-tuning to follow benign instructions and refuse harmful ones. Prior to this fine-tuning process, models are essentially just next-token predictors, referred to as _base models_. By default, base models are not instruction-following. For instance, if prompted with a question, a base model is likely to output another question, rather than an answer to the original question. In particular, base models do not refuse harmful requests.

In SS3, we argue that refusal in chat models is mediated by a single direction in activation space. One natural question is whether this direction, or feature, is learned from scratch during safety fine-tuning specifically to mediate refusal, or whether this direction is already present in the base model and gets repurposed, or "hocked into", during safety fine-tuning.

To investigate this question, we check the expression of the refusal direction in chat and base models. For each model, we sample 128 harmful and harmless instructions, run inference on both the chat model (e.g. Llama-3 8B Instruct) and its corresponding base model (e.g. Llama-3 8B), and cache all intermediate activations at the last token position.6 We then take the refusal direction extracted from the corresponding chat model (SS2.3), and examine the cosine similarity of each activation with this direction.

Footnote 6: Note that we append a newline character to the end of each instruction, and consider activations only at this token position. For chat models, we prepend the portion of the chat template that comes before the instruction. For base models, we do not prepend anything before the instruction.

Figure 24 displays the results for four distinct models. We find that, similarly to the chat models, corresponding base models have high cosine similarity with the refusal direction when run on harmful prompts, and low cosine similarity when run on harmless prompts. This suggests that, rather than developing the "refusal direction" from scratch during fine-tuning, this representation exists already in the base model, and is repurposed for refusal during safety fine-tuning.

Further experiments with orthogonalized models

As throughout the paper, all generations are generated deterministically using greedy decoding. All experiments in this section are performed on Llama-38B Instruct.

### Does orthogonalization just prevent the model from parroting standard refusal strings?

One possible way to prevent a model from refusing is to directly block it from outputting any of the standard refusal strings, such as "Sorry, I cannot", or "As a language model". Experiments shown in Figure 27 show that this is not the case for our weight orthogonalization methodology, as the orthogonalized model is able to generate the same strings that the unmodified model uses to refuse a harmful request. This suggests that the modification works at a higher conceptual level, rather than at the level of suppressing output tokens.

Figure 27: The unmodified model (no intervention) refuses the first request with the string “I cannot provide instructions on how to make a bomb”. When explicitly requested to output this string, the orthogonalized model (intervention) is able to do so.

### The orthogonalized model behaves similarly on harmless instructions

In general, we notice that the orthogonalized model behaves very similarly to the non-modified model on harmless instructions. Figure 28 displays completions on a random sample of harmless prompts from Alpaca. Generations from the unmodified model and the orthogonalized model appear to be indistinguishable, and often the generations are exactly the same.

Figure 28: Generations over a random sample of harmless instructions from Alpaca. Generations from the unmodified model (no intervention) are essentially indistinguishable from the orthogonalized model (intervention).

### The orthogonalized model may have trouble understanding its new refusal behavior

As our intervention targets refusal directly, it is natural to ask how the resulting model answers meta-questions about its new refusal behavior: does it understand its behavioral modification, or does it default to explaining its original refusal behavior? As shown in Figure 29, the new model seems likely to answer meta-refusal questions consistently with its previous refusal behavior. However, its explanations seem not to be coherent.

Figure 29: The orthogonalized model gives the same answer to a meta-reasoning question about its own refusal behavior as the original model. However, its reasoning seems incoherent: it claims the reason for not explaining how to make a Molotov cocktail is “this is a factual question, but it’s not a request for a creative response” d)

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our main claim is that refusal behavior in contemporary language models is mediated by a single direction in activation space. We diligently investigate this claim across 13 open-source chat models. For each of them, we find a direction such that erasing this direction disables refusal (SS3.1 & SS4.2), and adding it induces refusal (SS3.2). We do additional diligence to check that directional ablation _surgically_ removes refusal without significant impact to model capability by running a suite of standard evaluations (SS4.3), and also analyzing differences in CE loss (SSG.3). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer:[Yes] Justification: The paper includes a dedicated "Limitations" paragraph in the "Discussion" section (SS7). We discuss several limitations of the study, including that the findings may not generalize to untested models, the refusal direction extraction methodology is not optimal, the adversarial suffix analysis is limited to one model and suffix, and measuring coherence of chat models is challenging. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.

* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include any theoretical results or proofs. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details of all datasets and models used (SS2.2), as well as the experimental setup and evaluation metrics, to enable reproducibility of our main results (SS2, SS3). We provide a complete description of our direction selection algorithm in SSC. For model evaluations, we run standardized evaluations using the open-source library LM Evaluation Harness (Gao et al., 2023). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution.

If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: The paper uses publicly available open-source models and datasets, but does not provide open access to the code used for the experiments. Note that we do plan to release code upon publication. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: For extracting the direction, we specify all datasets in SSA. For evaluating refusals, we specify our evaluation datasets in SS3 and SS4.2. For coherence evaluations, we specify our evaluation datasets in SSG. We also explain our methodology for constructing train and validation datasets that are non-overlapping, and do not overlap with datasets used for evaluation in SSA. We also specify hyperparameters for our direction selection algorithm in SSC, and even provide a table of the direction we selected for every model. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.

* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The two figures displaying our main result, Figure 1 and Figure 3, are displayed with standard error bars, calculated using the closed formula \(SE=\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}}\). Figure 5, which displays cosine similarity of model activations with the refusal direction across layers, displays a standard deviation range for each data point. These are reported in the text (SSD.4 & SSV.2). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes], Justification: We describe the compute used in section SSV. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes]Justification: To the best of our knowledge, the research conducted conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. The paper explicitly discusses potential negative societal impacts and includes an ethics statement in SS7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The "Discussion" section (SS7) includes a subsection on "Ethical considerations" that discusses potential negative societal impacts via misuse from the the lowered barrier to jailbreaking models. It also discusses the importance of this research for developing more robust safety methods. We also hope that our work raises awareness of the brittleness of current safety fine-tuning methods. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [No] Justification: Our paper does not release any new models or datasets. However, we do describe our jailbreaking method in a way that can be implemented generically to existing open-source chat models. As discussed in SS7, we do not see our work as qualitatively introducing new risks, as it is already well-known that fine-tuning can disable safety guardrails, and jailbroken versions of current open-source chat models are already readily available online. Because we consider our work not to qualitatively change the risk profile of current open-source models, we do not introduce any new safeguards.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
* **Licensees for existing assets*
* Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All existing open-source models, datasets, and evaluations that we use are cited. We specify access type and license type in SSM. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not introduce or release any new datasets, code, or models. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?Answer: [NA] Justification: The research did not involve any crowdsourcing, human subject experiments, or collection of human data. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The research did not involve human subjects, so no IRB approval was required. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
