###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks and domains. Despite this promise, spatial understanding and reasoning--a fundamental component of human cognition--remains under-explored. We propose SpatialEval, a novel benchmark that covers diverse aspects of spatial reasoning such as relationship understanding, navigation, and counting. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of competitive language and vision-language models. Our findings reveal several counter-intuitive insights that have been overlooked in the literature: (1) Spatial reasoning poses significant challenges where competitive models can fall behind random guessing; (2) Despite additional visual input, VLMs often under-perform compared to their LLM counterparts; (3) When both textual and visual information is available, multi-modal language models become less reliant on visual information if sufficient textual clues are provided. Additionally, we demonstrate that leveraging redundancy between vision and text can significantly enhance model performance. We hope our study will inform the development of multimodal models to improve spatial intelligence and further close the gap with human intelligence. Our code is available at https://github.com/jiayuww/SpatialEval.

## 1 Introduction

The recent breakthroughs in foundation models have had a transformative effect on research and industry, and we have seen these models rapidly integrated into products and new businesses that are shaping people's lives for the better. This sea change was initially driven by large language models (LLMs), which have shown at times near unbelievable, human-level performance across a wide range of tasks. Over the past year, many of these models have been extended to handle images in addition to text, leading to a significant increase in vision-language models (VLMs), especially multimodal large language models (MLLMs), which demonstrate groundbreaking performance in image-related tasks as in the text domain.

However, the reality is not quite as rosy as advertised. While these models have been instrumental in advancing the state-of-the-art in complex reasoning tasks such as common sense reasoning, mathematical problem solving, and scientific question answering [17; 30; 41; 72; 75], they have not been as effective for a number of problem domains. In particular, as we will show in this paper, they have limited performance on tasks that require detailed visual understanding and reasoning of images.

Visual understanding and reasoning--an intrinsic part of human perception and cognitive ability--have been largely under-explored when it comes to LLMs and VLMs. In fact, it is often argued that the visual sense is the dominant sense in people, yet when it comes to current models, it seems quite secondary. Spatial reasoning, in particular, is fundamental to everyday human activities such as navigating environments, understanding maps, and manipulating objects. It encompasses skills that are crucial for both survival and higher-order cognition, including the ability to navigate through space, recognize patterns, and deduce relationships from spatial configurations.

In this paper, we propose **SpatialEval**, a novel benchmark containing four tasks (Spatial-Map, Maze-Nav, Spatial-Grid, and Spatial-Real, Section 2.1) to explore the performance of LLMs and VLMs on diverse aspects of spatial reasoning, including relationship, navigation, position understanding, and object counting. Humans excel at such tasks, making them essential capabilities for intelligent systems to emulate for safe and effective deployment in the real world.

Our dataset, however, is constructed with a key twist - each problem in our benchmark has an image and a text representation that is sufficient for answering each spatial understanding question. We denote the use of these sources as VQA, which is the standard task of visual-question answering that consists of a vision-only input and a question, TQA, text-only input and a question, and VTQA, a combination of the previous with vision and text input.

We conduct a systematic and comprehensive evaluation of a wide range of open-source and proprietary LLMs and VLMs. We perform in-depth analysis and unveil several novel and surprising results that challenge the current understanding of how these models process spatial information:

* **Spatial reasoning remains challenging**: VLMs frequently struggle with spatial reasoning tasks, with some competitive models performing worse than random guessing.
* **Visual vs. textual inputs**: Without detailed textual descriptions, multimodal models rarely surpass the performance of their LLM backbones when relying solely on visual inputs. This underscores the critical role of text in enhancing model performance on spatial reasoning.
* **Reduced reliance on visual information**: When both textual and visual inputs are provided, multimodal language models tend to rely less on the visual component if sufficient textual clues are available.
* **Textual performance of VLMs**: VLMs often outperform their LLM counterparts with text-only inputs, indicating that the language model backbones within VLMs benefit from multimodal training, despite a lack of similar benefits from the visual components.

We surmise the limitations in VLMs' spatial understanding stem from the overly simplistic handling of visual information in current architectures and training pipelines. We believe the contributions of this paper will drive changes in model design, accelerating improvements that could unlock more robust spatial reasoning capabilities, and help bridge the gap toward human-like intelligence.

## 2 Dataset and Task Construction

### Dataset Setup

To evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs and VLMs, we construct four diverse tasks including spatial relationships, navigation, position understanding, and counting. To systematically study the impact of modality, we design three types of input formats for each task: (1) TQA (Text-only): the input is purely textual and contains all necessary information for a person to answer the questions. (2) VQA (Vision-only): the input consists solely of an image, which provides sufficient details for a person to easily answer, a format also referred to as Visual Question Answering (VQA) in the literature. (3) VTQA (Vision-text): the input includes both an image and its textual representation with detailed descriptions, rendering the information in both modalities redundant. We evaluate LLMs using Text-only inputs and VLMs using Text-only, Vision-only, and Vision-text inputs on the same set of questions (Table 1). The synthetic tasks are curated based on the following key guidelines: (1) Avoidance of data leakage--since LLMs are pre-trained on web-scale data, it is crucial to ensure that the test data have not been seen during training; (2) configurability--being configurable allows for controlled experiments and extends easily to additional tasks; (3) scalability--the ability to scale the number of test samples enhances the statistical significance of experimental results.

**Spatial-Map.** Understanding the spatial relationships among objects on a map is a fundamental aspect of human cognitive abilities. To simulate this environment, we create a map-like dataset termed Spatial-Map with \(K\) objects, where \(K\) is configurable. Each object is associated with a unique location name, such as Unicorn Umbrellas and Gale Gifts. To study the impact of modality, the textual representation of each input consists of pairwise relations such as Brews Brothers Pub is to the Southeast of Whale's Watches. An example with \(K=6\) is shown in Figure 1, with Text-only, Vision-only, and Vision-text inputs. These questions include asking about the spatial relationships between two locations and the number of objects that meet specific spatial criteria.

**Maze-Nav.** Navigation through complex spaces is essential for intelligent systems. To evaluate such abilities, we have developed a maze-like dataset named Maze-Nav. Visually, each sample can be

Figure 1: Illustration of the Spatial-Map task, which simulates a map with multiple locations. To investigate the impact of modality, we consider three input formats: Text-only, Vision-only, and Vision-text. We evaluate language models (w. TQA input) and vision-language models (w. VQA and VTQA inputs) on the same set of questions.

Figure 2: Illustration of the Maze-Nav task, which evaluates the modelâ€™s ability to navigate from the starting point (S) to the exit (E).

represented as colored blocks where different colors signify distinct elements: a green block marks the starting point (S), a red block indicates the exit (E), black blocks represent impassable walls, white blocks denote navigable paths, and blue blocks trace the path from S to E. The objective is to navigate from S to E following the blue path, with movement permitted in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right). Alternatively, each input can be depicted in a textual format using ASCII code. An example is illustrated in Figure 2, featuring Text-only, Vision-only, and Vision-text inputs. We construct this task based on an open-sourced library [26]. The questions asked include counting the number of turns from S to E and determining the spatial relationship between S and E. While such questions are easy for humans, we will show in Section 3 that they still pose significant challenges for modern multimodal language models.

**Spatial-Grid.** To investigate spatial understanding within structured environments, we introduce a grid-like dataset named Spatial-Grid, contrasting with the Spatial-Map where objects are positioned arbitrarily. Visually, each input consists of a grid of cells, each containing an image (_e.g.,_ a rabbit). An example is illustrated in Figure 3. Alternatively, this grid can also be represented in a purely textual format; for instance, the first row might be described as: elephant | cat | giraffe | elephant | cat. The evaluations focus on tasks such as counting specific objects (_e.g.,_ rabbits) and identifying the object located at a specific coordinate in the grid (_e.g.,_ first row, second column).

**Spatial-Real.** To extend the evaluation of spatial reasoning beyond synthetic environments, we introduce Spatial-Real, a task built on the Densely Captioned Images (DCI) dataset [67], where each image has a detailed caption with more than 1,000 words on average. As DCI does not contain questions, we curate multiple-choice questions regarding spatial reasoning (object counting, relation, and position understanding) and annotate the answers. An example is shown in Figure 4. We provide detailed analysis on Spatial-Real in Appendix E.

### Models

We consider a wide range of competitive open-source language models with different scales, including Phi2-2.7B [35], the LLaMA family (LLaMA-2-7B, LLaMA-2-13B, and LLaMA-3-8B) [65], Mistral-7B [27], the Vicuna family (Vicuna-7B-1.5 and Vicuna-13B-1.5) [11], and Nous-Hermes-2-Yi-34B. For multimodal language models, we consider the Bunny family (Bunny-Phi-2-SigLIP, Bunny-Phi-1.5-SigLIP, Bunny-Phi-2-EVA, and Bunny-Phi-1.5-EVA) [22], CogVLM [69], CogAgent [23], InstructBLIP family (InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7B and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13B) [13], and LLaVA family (LLaVA-1.6-Mistral-7B, LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-7B, LLaVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B, and LLaVA-1.6

34B) [38]. We also evaluate the proprietary models: Open AI's GPT-4V, GPT-4o, GPT-4, Google Gemini Pro 1.0, and Anthropic Claude 3 Opus.

**Evaluation.** As each question contains four options, we use accuracy as the main evaluation metric. The same user prompt is appended at the end of each question: _First, provide a concise answer in one sentence. Then, elaborate on the reasoning behind your answer in a detailed, step-by-step explanation._ For each model, we adopt the default configurations and decoding strategies, _e.g.,_argmax for deterministic decoding and top-\(p\) for non-deterministic decoding. For non-deterministic decoding, the results are averaged over three independent runs for open-source models. For proprietary models, due to their limited availability and increased compute time and cost, we only perform one run. We summarize the terminologies regarding input modalities for LLMs and VLMs in Table 1:

We describe the Text-only, Vision-only, and Vision-text input modalities based on how we feed the image information to the models. Vision-only input means the image is fed directly to the models without textual description, while all questions are presented in text.

## 3 Main Results and Analysis

**Spatial reasoning remains surprisingly challenging.** The evaluation results on open-source models on Spatial-Map, Maze-Nav, and Spatial-Grid are shown in Figure 5. For each task, the reported accuracy is averaged over all questions. For vision-language models, we choose the Vision-only input format, commonly used in Visual Question Answering (VQA). We use a dashed red line in each figure to indicate the expected accuracy if answering by random guessing. Our findings reveal several notable insights: **(1)** Vision-only inputs: Despite the simplicity of these tasks for humans, most competitive multimodal models perform at levels similar to or barely above random guessing.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c l} \hline \hline
**Model** & **Input Modality** & **Term** & **Description** \\ \hline LLM & Text-only & TQA (LLM) & Text-only input that includes all necessary information to answer questions without visual context. \\ VLM & Text-only & TQA (VLM) & Text-only input as in TQA (LLM) but applied to VLMs (_e.g.,_ the LLaVA family). \\ VLM & Vision-only & VQA & Input only includes an image without corresponding textual description. \\ VLM & Vision-text & VTQA & Input includes both an image and its textual description. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Terms regarding input modalities for LLMs and VLMs.

Figure 4: Illustration of the Spatial-Real task, which is built on real images with long captions, featuring detailed descriptions averaging over 1,000 words per image.

**(2)** Text-only inputs: While the textual input includes essential spatial information, it generally does not significantly enhance the spatial reasoning capabilities of competitive models. An exception occurs in the Spatial-Grid task, where Llama-3 achieves an accuracy of 71.9%, followed by Mistral-7B-Instruct at 62.1%, both notably surpassing random guessing. Despite these successes, the performance of these models still lags significantly behind human levels. These results underscore the need for further development of techniques tailored to spatial understanding and reasoning.

The impact of input modality.To investigate the impact of modality, we compare the performance of a large language model (LLM) and a vision-language model (VLM) with the same language backbone. We consider the VQA (Vision-only) format for vision-language models. The results are shown in Figure 6. Each vertex on the spider plot represents the average accuracy of a (VLM, LLM) pair. We observe that on Spatial-Map and Spatial-Grid, the majority of VLMs yield worse performance compared to their LLM counterpart, despite having an additional visual encoder. For example, on Spatial-Grid, Mistral-7B achieves an average accuracy of 62.1%, while LLaVA-v1.6-Mistral-7B only yields an accuracy of 47.1% (15% \(\downarrow\)). Detailed results can be seen in Appendix F.

Figure 5: Performance overview on spatial reasoning tasks. We report the accuracy averaged over all questions. We consider the VQA (Vision-only) format for vision-language models. The dashed red line denotes the expected accuracy for random guessing. For Spatial-Map and Maze-Nav tasks, only a few models outperform random guessing by a notable margin.

VLM further finetuned on that. VLMs are depicted in red, and LLMs in blue. We can see that VLMs rarely enhance the performance compared to their LLM counterparts.

## 4 Delving Into Spatial Reasoning for Vision-Language Models

### Seeing Without Understanding: The Blindness of Multimodal Language Models

To better understand how VLMs process visual information, we conduct a series of controlled experiments in the VTQA (Vision-text input) setting. For each sample, we replace the original image input (that matches the textual description) with either: (1) _No Image_: only keep the textual input without the image input, (2) _Noise Image_: a Gaussian noise image irrelevant to the task, and (3) _Random Image_: a random image from the dataset that does not match the textual description, as shown in Figure 7.

**VLMs exhibit improved performance when visual input is absent.** We conducted experiments by entirely removing the _Original Image_ and relying solely on the textual description. The results are shown in Figure 8. For each task, we report the accuracy averaged across all questions. Remarkably, the absence of visual input leads to better performance across a range of VLM architectures. For instance, the performance of LLaVA-1.6-34B on the Spatial-Grid task improved by 20.1% when no image was presented compared to scenarios with the original image. This observation underscores that when textual information alone can address the questions, additional visual inputs do not necessarily enhance, and may even hinder the performance, a sharp contrast to human capabilities where visual cues significantly aid in understanding. The removal of visual input forces the models to utilize the textual information to solve spatial reasoning tasks.

**Noise image can improve the performance.** We replace the _Original Image_ with a _Noise Image_ while retaining the original textual description. The results are shown in Figure 9. Consistent with

Figure 8: VTQA vs. TQA (VLM) on spatial reasoning tasks. VLMs exhibit improved performance in spatial reasoning tasks when visual input is absent.

Figure 7: Illustration of _Random Image_ and _Noise Image_ for the example in Figure 2.

Figure 9: Original Image vs. Noise Image in VTQA. Replacing the original image with a Gaussian noise image improves the performance across diverse VLM architectures.

the findings in Original Image vs. No Image, using a noise image also improves the performance across various VLM architectures. For example, the accuracy of LLAVA-1.6-Vicuna-13B increases by 6.5% on the Maze-Nav task when the noise image is used as opposed to the original image. In contrast to the _No Image_ setting, noise images provide limited visual cues. Nonetheless, the model tends to prioritize the textual information, especially when visual cues are not pertinent to the task.

Mismatched image-text does not necessarily hurt.To build on previous findings, we further investigate the effects of replacing the _Original Image_ with a _Random Image_ (illustrated in Figure 7). Unlike a noise image, a random image is task-related but may provide conflicting information compared to the textual description. Intuitively, one might expect that such random images would degrade VLM performance due to contradictory cues. However, as demonstrated in Figure 10, this expectation does not always hold true. For instance, _Random Image_ in the Maze-Nav task leads to improved performance across various VLM architectures. This outcome implies that VLMs are not heavily reliant on visual information, particularly when adequate textual clues are provided.

### Leveraging Redundancy in Multimodal Inputs

Multimodal language models offer considerable versatility in handling multimodal inputs. While the visual input alone often provides sufficient details for humans to address spatial reasoning tasks with ease, we propose that VLMs significantly benefit from the inclusion of textual descriptions alongside visual data, even if this introduces substantial redundancy. We verify this hypothesis by comparing VQA (Vision-only input) and VTQA (Vision-text input) across diverse VLM architectures. The results are shown in Figure 11, where each vertex on the spider plot represents the average accuracy of a (Vision-only, Vision-text) pair based on the same VLM. For Spatial-Map and Spatial-Grid, we can clearly see that having the additional textual input (VTQA) enhances the performance compared

Figure 11: VQA vs. VTQA on spatial reasoning tasks. Each vertex on the spider plot represents the Avg Acc of a (Vision-only, Vision-text) pair with the same VLM model. We can see that having the additional textual input (VTQA) enhances the performance compared to only using images (VQA).

Figure 10: Original Image vs. Random Image in VTQA. On Maze-Nav, replacing the original image with a random image leads to performance improvement across diverse VLM architectures.

to only using images (VQA) across different VLM architectures. This suggests that textual inputs improve the accuracy of spatial reasoning in VLMs. We further compare TQA and VTQA in Appendix D. Detailed results are included in Appendix F.

**Text-only input with LLM vs. Text-only input with VLM.** Given the demonstrated efficacy of text-only inputs, we conducted an ablation study to compare LLMs and VLMs using text-only inputs. We consider VLMs that are capable of processing text without accompanying visual data. The results are illustrated in Figure 12. Except for CoSVLM, the majority of VLMs outperform their corresponding LLM backbones. This suggests that the language model backbones in VLMs demonstrate enhanced spatial reasoning abilities through multimodal learning. Conversely, the addition of visual information does not necessarily provide further benefits.

### Proprietary vs. Open-Source Models

As many recent benchmarks have shown that proprietary models generally outperform open-source models, it is important to understand if our observed trends hold with proprietary models. The performance of several top proprietary models (GPT-4, GPT-4V, GPT-4o, Gemini Pro 1.0, and Claude 3 Opus) are shown in Figure 13. We have the following salient observations: (1) A significant performance gap exists between SoTA open-source models and proprietary models, as expected. Furthermore, with both Text-only and Vision-text formats, GPT-4V and GPT-4o significantly outperform random guessing across all tasks. For instance, in the Vision-text format, GPT-4o achieves

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline
**Comparison** & **Results** & **Summary of Findings** \\ \hline TQA (LLM) vs. VQA & Figure 6 & VQA rarely enhances the performance compared to TQA (LLM). \\ VTQA vs. TQA (VLM) & Figure 8 & VLMs exhibit improved performance in spatial reasoning tasks \\  & & when the image input is absent. \\ VQA vs. VTQA & Figure 11 & Given the same image input, additional textual description enhances VLMâ€™s performance. \\ TQA (VLM) vs. TQA (LLM) & Figure 12 & Multimodal fine-tuning enhances LLMâ€™s spatial reasoning ability. \\ TQA (LLM) vs. VTQA & Figure 16 & No definitive winner. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

an accuracy of 0.989 on Spatial-Grid (Table 7). (2) Yet, the trends we observed with open source models hold, VQA consistently under-performs compared to TQA and VTQA, for example, GPT-4V's performance improves by 25.6% on Spatial-Grid when switching from Vision-only to Vision-text input; and again no clear winner between TQA and VTQA (see Appendix D for further details), showing that proprietary models, even the new GPT-4o model, still do not appear to fully leverage visual inputs. We summarize the key findings of this work in Table 2.

## 5 Related Work

**Large language models.** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved outstanding performance across a diverse array of fields, including finance [34], bioinformatics [63], law [60], education [29], coding [24], and creative tasks [2; 36]. LLM architectures have gone through significant changes in recent years, with notable developments such as BERT [14], OPT [76], PaLM [12], Gamma family [62], Mistral family [27], GPT family [2; 10], Claude family [5], and LLaMA family [3; 64; 66]. These models have demonstrated emergent abilities and revolutionized numerous domains, supporting capabilities such as in-context learning [46; 51; 59], compositional reasoning [16; 20; 70], and task-specific adaptation [57; 58; 71]. However, visual understanding and reasoning--an intrinsic part of human cognitive ability--remains largely under-explored for LLMs.

**Vision-language models and multi-modal language models.** The success of LLMs has propelled the adoption of the Transformer architecture [68] within the computer vision community, such as ViT [15], Beit [9], CLIP [54], MAE [21], Swin [42; 43], and DiT [53]. Building on the capabilities of powerful LLMs, multi-modal language models (MLLMs) such as Flamingo [4], LLaMA-Adapter [19; 74], LLava [37; 39], stable-diffusion [55], BLIP [32; 33], MiniGPT-4 [77], Qwen [7; 8], Gemini [61], MM1 [45] have significantly expanded the range of problems that can be addressed with improved reliability [49]. These models adeptly handle inputs from diverse modalities and have demonstrated remarkable performance on diverse tasks such as mathematical reasoning [44], image-text retrieval [47; 73], and visual reasoning [6; 18; 25; 28; 31; 40; 50].

**Spatial understanding and reasoning.** Spatial reasoning entails comprehending and manipulating spatial relationships, a task significantly more challenging than visual grounding [1; 28; 52]. Although progress in natural language processing, evaluations, and benchmarks on LLMs such as GPT-4 [2] and Claude3 [5] have predominantly focused on textual or relational reasoning. This focus often overlooks the intricate nature of spatial reasoning tasks. Notably, recent studies [17; 30; 41; 48; 56; 72; 75] have conducted thorough evaluations across a diverse range of tasks. Yet, they demonstrate a scant exploration of spatial reasoning capabilities, highlighting a gap in assessing this complex cognitive skill in current benchmarks. In particular, Zhang _et al._[75] suggest that MLLMs primarily leverage textual cues rather than visual diagrams to solve math problems while focusing only on math problems. Yamada _et al._[72] design simple navigation tasks and finds LLMs appear to capture certain aspects of spatial structure implicitly, but room for improvement remains, while our benchmarks are more complicated than their navigation tasks based on simple geometry maps. Fu _et al._[17] propose a benchmark on science and games with limited exploration related to spatial reasoning, while we are dedicated diverse spatial reasoning tasks with in-depth analysis.

## 6 Discussion and Conclusions

We explored the spatial understanding capabilities of VLMs and LLMs. Our experiments resulted in several surprising conclusions across SoTA open-source and proprietary models. (1) VLMs struggle with spatial reasoning tasks, (2) multimodal models rarely surpass LLMs when relying on visual inputs, (3) when both textual and visual inputs are provided, multimodal language models rely less on the visual inputs, and (4) VLMs often outperform their LLM counterparts with text-only inputs. This challenges the belief that current VLMs are highly performant at a wide range of vision-text tasks. However, with further thought, perhaps this is to be expected after all. The currently known architectures for VLMs attempt to "translate" the vision input into the language space and all reasoning is then performed in the language domain. It is logical that this automatic translation path is worse than a human provided translation to text, as in our text-only scenario. Thus our work shows the limits of the translation approach. Instead, to bridge the gap to human performance, future models require new architectures that treat vision input as a first-class source of information and reason in a joint vision-language space. It is our hope that our work informs development on this path.

**Appendix**

## Appendix A How Does SpatialEval Expand Beyond Traditional VQA?

We highlight several key rationales for SpatialEval in comparison to existing VQA benchmarks:

* **Task scope and focus**: Existing benchmarks such as Visual Genome [31], GQA [25], and BLINK [18] focus only on VQA, where the image is required but the text description is often omitted or optional. In contrast, SpatialEval further explores spatial reasoning across different settings: TQA (LLM), TQA (VLM), and VTQA, where images or texts can be optional, thereby broadening the scope of tasks.
* **Evaluation scheme**: we primarily focus on generative LLMs and VLMs which can "elaborate on the reasoning behind your answer in a detailed, step-by-step explanation" (Section 2.2). The task in prior VQA benchmarks is often treated as discriminative with no explicit reasoning. Therefore, it remains unknown if previous observations can be naturally transferred to foundation models pre-trained on web-scale data.
* **The Textual Representation of Images**: The textual descriptions in prior VQA benchmarks are often brief or directly imply the answers. While these datasets are valuable, they do not consistently offer the level of complexity we require, such as numerous objects containing dense visual information along with detailed natural language captions that fully convey the image content. In SpatialEval, we provide long and dense captions for each image. As a result, answers cannot be easily inferred. We also aim to isolate object detection capability from spatial reasoning ability by simplifying objects to symbols (_e.g.,_ Spatial-Map).
* **IQ test for VLMs and LLMs**: Tasks in SpatialEval are designed to serve as cognitive tests that evaluate basic capabilities of multi-modal foundation models. While three tasks feature synthetic visual content, humans can solve them with near-perfect accuracy. This indicates that the tasks are within the realm of human cognitive capabilities.

## Appendix B Limitations and Societal Impact

Limitations.In this work, we introduce four novel tasks and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of diverse large language models (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs), presenting a controlled and thorough evaluation of spatial reasoning capabilities. While our analysis is detailed and extensive, it remains primarily empirical. We believe that embarking on a formal theoretical study, despite its challenges, would significantly enrich our understanding of pre-trained multimodal language models. Moreover, our focus has been on in-depth analysis rather than on developing new training strategies or adaptation algorithms to enhance spatial reasoning. Recognizing these points, we identify them as valuable directions for future research.

Societal impact.Regarding the positive societal impact, our evaluations and observations could catalyze the development of new algorithms that enhance the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs and VLMs. Improved understanding of these models has the potential to significantly benefit sectors requiring robust spatial understanding and navigation. This could lead to more reliable and efficient systems that enhance safety and user experience. As for potential negative societal impacts, our work primarily involves empirical evaluations using synthetic datasets designed to probe spatial reasoning. Therefore, we do not anticipate any direct negative societal impacts arising from our current research.

## Appendix C Experimental Details

### Software and Hardware

Our experiments are conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our implementation is based on Python 3.10 and PyTorch 2.1.2.

### Hyperparameters and Error Bars

The hyperparameters discussed in this paper pertain to the decoding strategies of each model. For deterministic decoding, we adhere to the default settings specified for each model. The models employing deterministic decoding (argmax) include Bunny-Phi-2-SigLIP, CogAgent, CogVLM, InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13B, and InstructBLIP-Vicuna-7B. For non-deterministic decoding, we utilize the default hyperparameters provided by Hugging Face (for instance, Top-P is set at \(0.9\) and the temperature at \(0.2\) for LLaVA-1.6). Error bars for the main results (Figure 5) are obtained with three independent runs.

### Model Checkpoints

For most open-source models, we use the checkpoints provided by Hugging Face as shown in Table 3. For Bunny variants (Bunny-Phi-1.5-EVA, Bunny-Phi-1.5-SigLIP and Bunny-Phi-2-EVA), we use merged weights following instructions in https://github.com/BAAI-DCAI/Bunny/.

### Detailed Illustration of Datasets

In the main text, we abbreviated the textual descriptions in Figure 1, Figure 2 due to space constraints. In this section, we provide the full descriptions for each task to facilitate a better understanding of spatial reasoning tasks. The complete illustrations are displayed in Figure 14 for Spatial-Map and Figure 15 for Maze-Nav, respectively. Three questions (termed Q1 to Q3) are associated with each sample in tasks Spatial-Map, Maze-Nav, and Spatial-Grid.

Further Ablation Studies and Discussions

TQA vs. VTQA: No definitive winner.In Section 3, we demonstrated the advantages of text-only input (TQA) based on LLMs over vision-only input (VQA) based on VLMs. Subsequently, given the same VLM, the comparison between VTQA and VQA in Section 4 reveals that VLMs rely less on visual information when sufficient textual clues are provided. Curious readers seeking a quantitative comparison between TQA and VTQA can refer to the results illustrated in Figure 16. Unlike the other comparisons, no definitive winner emerges between TQA and VTQA across all spatial reasoning tasks, model sizes, and architectures. For instance, the VTQA performance of InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13B surpasses Vicuna-13B in the Maze-Nav task, whereas Vicuna-13B outperforms InstructBLIP-Vicuna-13B in the Spatial-Map task. This indicates that text-only inputs (with language models) still hold an advantage in certain spatial reasoning tasks.

Impact of prompting techniques.In line with our approach to sampling strategies, our primary goal in choosing prompting techniques is to report the best model performance given the same question. The prompt technique we use, which asks for step-by-step explanation is the most effective query among others in our initial studies. As a concrete example, we compare the original prompting strategy, "First, provide a concise answer in one sentence. Then, elaborate on the reasoning behind your answer in a detailed, step-by-step explanation" (step-by-step explanation), with a simpler prompt, Answer: (completion). Results in Table 4 show that the simpler completion prompt consistently underperforms compared to the step-by-step explanation prompt.

Impact of temperature for decoding strategies.We conducted an ablation study to examine how different temperatures affect the model performance. A higher temperature allows for more diversity in model responses. Most models consistently underperform when the temperature is set to 1.0 compared to 0.2 (our default) as shown in Table 5.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The main claims are well-supported by the comprehensive experiments and analysis in Section 3, Section 4, and further results in the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided detailed limitations in Appendix B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide all the experimental details needed in Appendix C to support the reproducibility of our experiments. Datasets and codebase with detailed instructions will also be released. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Both datasets and our code with detailed instructions will be released. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All experimental details are included in Appendix C to facilitate understanding of the experiments in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report the standard deviation in main experiments (see Figure 5). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide hardware and software details in Appendix C.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors have read the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and made sure the paper follows the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in every aspect. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided detailed societal impacts in Appendix B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The datasets in this paper are generated to evaluate the spatial reasoning abilities of models and do not pose risks for potential misuse. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper properly cites the original paper or sources whenever an asset is used. URLs of all retained model checkpoints are included in Appendix C.3 and Table 3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Both the synthetic datasets and the code will be released with well-documented instructions. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
