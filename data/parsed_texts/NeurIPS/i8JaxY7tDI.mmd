###### Abstract

The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has led to the adoption of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures that dynamically leverage specialized subnetworks for improved efficiency and performance. Despite their benefits, MoE models face significant challenges during inference, including inefficient memory management and suboptimal batching, due to misaligned design choices between the model architecture and the system policies. Furthermore, the conventional approach of training MoEs from scratch is increasingly prohibitive in terms of cost. In this paper, we propose a novel framework _Read-ME_ that transforms pre-trained dense LLMs into smaller MoE models (in contrast to "upcycling" generalist MoEs), avoiding the high costs of ground-up training. Our approach employs activation sparsity to extract experts. To compose experts, we examine the widely-adopted layer-wise router design and show its redundancy, and thus we introduce the pre-gating router decoupled from the MoE backbone that facilitates system-friendly pre-computing and lookahead scheduling, enhancing expert-aware batching and caching. Our codesign therefore addresses critical gaps on both the algorithmic and system fronts, establishing a scalable and efficient alternative for LLM inference in resource-constrained settings. _Read-ME_ outperforms other popular open-source dense models of similar scales, achieving improvements of up to \(10.1\%\) on MMLU, and improving mean end-to-end latency up to \(6.1\%\). Codes are available at: https://github.com/VITA-Group/READ-ME.

## 1 Introduction

The success of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) [1, 2] - such as recently exemplified by the Mixtral model [3] in the era of large language models (LLMs) - lies in its remarkable ability to leverage the collective expertise of specialized sub-networks, or "experts," each proficient in handling specific subsets or aspects of the data. By dynamically routing data through these experts, MoE models effectively capture complex patterns, adapt to diverse data distributions, and offer superior predictive accuracy compared to traditional single-model approaches. In addition to performance promise, MoEs also have a natural appeal for resource-limited devices due to their high sparsity, and therefore reduced activated parameters per token, which can potentially save inference costs [4, 5, 6, 7].

However, MoE inference presents significant challenges for key system-level objectives:

* **Memory Management:** Although MoEs activate only a subnetwork during inference, expert selection is determined on the fly by a layerwise router, complicating efficient prefetching. This often forces reliance on naive prefetching algorithms. For example, prior work haspredicted the next expert using hidden states from the previous layer and applied an LRU cache replacement for recently used experts [8]. While effective under certain conditions, such strategies depend on assumptions about expert locality and token predictability, which can become sub-optimal if those assumptions are violated (as shown in Table 4).
* **Token Batching:** Token batching techniques critical for efficient inference (e.g., [9]) are poorly suited to MoE architectures, where each batch contains tokens invoking different experts across layers, rendering batching strategies ineffective (SS 4.2).

Moreover, traditional MoEs are typically trained from scratch, which becomes prohibitively expensive as model scales increase. To mitigate this, some approaches, such as "upcycling" [10], reuse pre-trained dense LLMs to initialize experts in an MoE. While that efficiently scales MoEs by leveraging smaller, pre-trained models, it does not address the inference-related challenges mentioned earlier.

In this work, we tackle the opposite challenge: _how to create a smaller MoE model from larger pre-trained models that enables resource-efficient inference while minimizing training costs?_ Despite existing efforts [11; 12; 13; 14], this problem remains underexplored. Approaches like [11; 12; 13] attempt MoE refactorization but still adopt systems-unfriendly layer-wise structures for inference. Similarly, [14] focuses on dynamically selecting "important" neurons during pre-filling and pruning others during generation, but this is limited to long-content generation and requires neuron importance identification for each sequence.

To address both training and inference challenges, we introduce a holistic MoE framework dubbed _Read-ME_. To minimize training costs, we "refactorize" a pre-trained dense LLM into specialized experts through activation sparsity and optimize the routing policy (SS 3). For efficient inference, we examine the redundancy of layer-wise routers (SS 2.1, SS 2.2) and propose decoupling the router from the MoE backbone (SS 2.3). This allows us to _pre-gate all requests (token sequences) before inference_ and apply lookahead scheduling based on the experts to which tokens will be dispatched. Consequently, we propose an expert-aware batching algorithm (SS 4.2) and an optimal expert caching strategy inspired by Belady's offline caching algorithm [15] (SS 4.1).

Figure 1 illustrates our framework. Our key contributions are:

* We transform large pre-trained LLMs into Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models with fewer activated parameters and small additional training cost (1 billion tokens). Our approach outperforms popular open-source models and compression techniques of similar scale on downstream tasks like MMLU [16].
* We analyze the widely adopted layer-wise routers in existing MoEs and reveal design redundancies. Current caching policies and batching algorithms are poorly suited to layer-wise MoEs. We propose a novel pre-gating router, decoupled from the MoE backbone, enabling better system-level optimization.

Figure 1: Overview of _Read-ME_. This figure shows the refactoring of a pre-trained dense model (in yellow) into two experts (in **red** and **green**). After refactoring, the model is deployed, and the serving timeline is depicted. At time \(t=0\), multiple inference requests (each a sequence of tokens) are queued, with expert assignment for each token undecided (”?") until processed by the router. Our router pre-gates tokens before inference, enabling expert-aware batching. Tokens are routed to their respective experts and batched accordingly: at \(t=0\) for Expert 1 (**red**) and at \(t=1\) for Expert 2 (**green**). New tokens enter the queue at each time step, with routing computed only for incoming tokens marked “?”.

* Our system achieves a 6.1% reduction in mean latency and a 10% improvement in tail latency compared to state-of-the-art systems. Our caching algorithm is both provably and empirically optimal, thanks to our algorithm-system co-design.

## 2 Pre-gating Sparse Mixture of Experts

In this section, we introduce our motivation and design of pre-gating MoE which enables system-level acceleration by sharing and precomputing expert selection for each layer.

### System Drawbacks of Conventional Sparse MoE Design

An Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) [1; 2; 17; 3] layer consists of a routing network \(G\) and a set of \(N\) expert networks \(\{F_{1},...,F_{N}\}\). In the forward pass, the routing network will first process input sequences and generate the gating weights. Then a size-\(K\) subset of experts will be dynamically activated and their outputs will be combined as final outputs according to the gating weights. In LLMs, MoE is typically adopted in the Feed-Forward Networks (FFN) within each transformer block [1; 2; 3]. Suppose an LLM has \(L\) layers, the output of the \(l\)-th layer can be formulated as:

\[\bm{y}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbb{I}(|\{j\in[N]:G^{(l)}(\bm{x})_{j}\geq G^{(l)}(\bm {x})_{i}\}|\leq K)G^{(l)}(\bm{x})_{i}F_{i}^{(l)}(\bm{x}),\] (1)

where the superscripts indicate the layer indices, \(G^{(l)},F^{(l)}\) are point-wise functions operating on tokens individually, and \(\mathbb{I}(\cdot)\) is the indicator function which filters experts with top-\(K\) gating weights. For shorthand, we denote \(\mathbb{I}_{i}^{(l)}=\mathbb{I}(|\{j\in[N]:G^{(l)}(\bm{x})_{j}\geq G^{(l)}( \bm{x})_{i}\}|\leq K)\).

As shown in Eq. 1, conventional MoEs assign a separate router to each layer. While this is commonly used by open-source MoEs like Mixtral [3] and OpenMoE [18], we highlight its system inefficiency. Layer-wise gating makes it difficult to predict which expert to load until runtime (SS 4.1), and complicating request batching (SS 4.2). Specifically, layer-wise routers select the \(l\)-th layer expert \(i:\mathbb{I}_{i}^{(l)}=1\) based on the \((l-1)\)-th layer outputs, which prevents pre-scheduling and pre-loading of data or model weights. This issue is especially problematic for billion-level parameter MoEs, where experts are usually distributed across devices (GPUs and CPUs in a machine) or even machines; in such situations, layer-wise selection accentuates high overheads of data I/O and communication among servers in the critical path of inference.

### Redundancy of Layer-wise Router

In this section, we demonstrate that layer-wise gating patterns are redundant in an MoE. In particular, we empirically find that expert selections between two adjacent layers are highly correlated.

We use Mixtral-8\(\times\)7B (\(N=8,K=2\)) [3] as a study case and analyze router decisions among its layers. Define the random variable \(\mathcal{S}^{(l)}=\{i\in[N]:\mathbb{I}_{i}^{(l)}=1\}\) as the pair of experts selected

Figure 2: (a) Visualization of transition matrix between the (\(l\)-1)-th layer and the \(l\)-th layer, where each coordinate \([\{s,t\},\{i,j\}]\) represents \(P(\mathcal{S}^{(l)}=\{i,j\}|\mathcal{S}^{(l-1)}=\{s,t\})\). The row-wise sparse pattern suggests that the router decision becomes almost deterministic given the previous layer’s decision. (b) Mutual information \(I(\mathcal{S}^{(l)};\mathcal{S}^{(l-1)})\), which indicates the learned knowledge shared by two neighboring layers is high.

for each layer (\(|\mathcal{S}^{(l)}|=2\)). We are interested in the conditional probability of \(\mathcal{S}^{(l)}\) between two consecutive layers: \(P(\mathcal{S}^{(l)}=\{i,j\}|\mathcal{S}^{(l-1)}=\{s,t\})\). The transition matrix of the last two layers from Mitral-8\(\times\)7B is depicted in Figure 2 (a). The row-wise sparse pattern implies that the expert selection is almost deterministic given the previous layer' choices. For example, for tokens choosing expert-3 and expert-5 in the 30th layer, over \(70\%\) will select expert-1 and expert-5 at the 31st layer.

To further validate this observation, we plot the mutual information between expert choices of every two neighboring layers: \(I(\mathcal{S}^{(l)};\mathcal{S}^{(l-1)})\). As reflected in the right sub-figure of Figure 2, knowing expert pairs used in the last layer significantly reduces the uncertainty of the next layer. Thus, the implicit knowledge learned by each router is extensively shared across layers.

### Pre-Computed Routing Policy

The above observations suggest that among the many \(\binom{N}{K}^{L}\) routing paths, only a few are used during the inference. Therefore, layer-wise routing decisions are unnecessary for MoEs. Instead, we can separate the routerfrom the MoE backbone and pre-compute the routing path all at once.

First of all, we assume the indices of experts handling one domain of tokens are aligned, i.e. \(\{F_{i}^{(1)},\cdots,F_{i}^{(l)}\}\) always forms a routing path. We defer our approach to the construction of aligned experts to SS3. Next, we let a singleton network \(G\) generate gating weights for all layers. In particular, we adopt one transformer block with causal attention as the model architecture of \(G\). Gating weights computed in this way not only leverage the states of the current token but also take the information from the past tokens into consideration. Thus, tokens will have expert selections similar to the recent tokens, which ensures cache-friendly inference (see more details in SS 5.3).

Suppose the input sequence is \((\bm{x}_{t})_{t=1,\cdots,T}\), the output for the \(t\)-th token at the \(l\)-th layer is:

\[\bm{y}_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathbb{I}(|\{j\in[N]:G(\bm{x}_{\leq t})_{j}\geq G( \bm{x}_{\leq t})_{i}\}|\leq K)G(\bm{x}_{\leq t})_{i}F_{i}^{(l)}(\bm{x}_{t}),\] (2)

where \(\bm{x}_{\leq t}=(\bm{x}_{1},\cdots,\bm{x}_{t})\) represents all the tokens before the \(t\)-th token. We note that \(G\) is independent of layer index \(l\). Despite a subtle change, it brings profound benefits to enable system-level optimization. In brief, by separating the gating network from the transformer layers, expert selection can be determined at the outset and used to schedule the data-loading procedure for each layer. We defer more details on system co-design to SS4.

## 3 Re-factoring Language Model with Pre-Gating MoE

In this section, we introduce the main technique to re-use a dense pre-trained model to construct our pre-gating MoE proposed in SS2. In short, our approach first initializes each expert by structured pruning of a dense model on the corresponding data domains. Afterward, we instantiate a gating network shared across layers and continue joint training of the router and experts.

**Domain-Aware Expert Construction.** We construct a set of small experts by pruning the dense model with different data domains. To begin with, we point out that public language corpora often contain metadata indicating the domain of each subset. For example, the training dataset of LLaMA family [19] can be split into scientific articles [20], novels [21], and QAs [22], etc. We utilize this metadata to group data entries in the training corpus into \(N\) sub-domains \(\{\mathcal{D}_{1},\cdots,\mathcal{D}_{N}\}\). Observing that feature channels on each subset are sparsely activated [23], we compute the average magnitude of a channel on each subset and keep top activated neurons to form the domain expert. Formally, let the number of experts equal to the number of sub-domains, and assume the dense model is a two-layer FFN with hidden size \(D\): \(F_{0}(\bm{x})=\bm{W}_{2}\sigma(\bm{W}_{1}\bm{x})\), then the \(i\)-th experts with hidden size \(d\) are initialized as: \(F_{i}(\bm{x})=\bm{W}_{2}\bm{M}_{i}^{\top}\sigma(\bm{M}_{i}\bm{W}_{1}\bm{x}), \forall i\in[N]\), in which \(\bm{M}_{i}\) is obtained by:

\[\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{\bm{M}\in\{0,1\}^{d\times D}}\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x} \sim\mathcal{D}_{i}}\|\bm{M}\bm{W}_{1}\bm{x}\|_{1}\quad\text{s.t.}\quad\bm{M }\bm{1}_{D}=\bm{1},\bm{M}^{\top}\bm{1}_{d}\leq\bm{1},\] (3)

where \(\bm{M}\) is constrained to be a selection matrix without replacement. The mask for each layer is jointly optimized so that the resultant experts are aligned layerwise and dedicated to the same data distribution. In our experiments, we set \(d\approx D/2\). In addition, we observe that a certain subset of channels is essential for all data, potentially due to the system prompt and the presence of commonsense knowledge. Therefore, we isolate the corresponding neurons as the _permanent expert_, which will be activated for all tokens, similar to previous designs [18; 24].

**Continual Training Objective.** After initializing experts via structured pruning, we perform joint training of randomly initialized gating networks and expert subnetworks via causal language modeling. In addition, we propose _routing distillation loss_ to enhance the alignment between expert choice in pre-gating MoE and the activation sparsity in the original dense model.

We illustrate the training of our router in Fig. 2 (c). Suppose the predicted token has embedding \(\bm{x}_{t+1}\). We feed \(\bm{x}_{t+1}\) into the original dense model \(F_{0}\) and get a sparse selection matrix \(\bm{M}_{0}\) that indicates neurons with top 50% magnitude similar to Eq. 3. Then we penalize this loss function:

\[\mathcal{L}_{RD}=\mathcal{D}_{KL}\left(\mathrm{softmax}(G(\bm{x}_{\leq t+1})) \|\mathrm{softmax}([\|\bm{M}_{0}\bm{M}_{1}^{\top}\|_{F}^{2},\cdots,\|\bm{M}_{0 }\bm{M}_{N}^{\top}\|_{F}^{2}])\right).\] (4)

Here, \(\mathcal{D}_{KL}(\cdot\|\cdot)\) represents Kullback-Leibler divergence. \(\|(\bm{M}_{0}\bm{M}_{1}^{\top}\|_{F}^{2}=\bm{1}_{d}^{\top}\bm{M}_{0}\bm{M}_{j} ^{\top}\bm{1}_{d}\) computes the Hamming distance between two masks induced by \(\bm{M}_{0},\bm{M}_{j}\). We apply softmax to normalize these scores as the estimated selection probability of each expert for predicted token \(\bm{x}_{t+1}\).

## 4 Expert-aware Inference System

We demonstrate how our refactoring and pregating concepts enable a novel, high-performance, and efficient MoE inference method. We address two key challenges in existing MoE models' inference: inadequate memory management and limited support for batched inference. Our problem setting is broad, aiming to serve multiple requests using an MoE model, each comprising a sequence of tokens. This differs from previous systems, which focused on optimizing performance for individual requests.

### Pre-gating Optimized Expert Prefetching and Caching

MoE models promise reduced memory usage during inference by loading only the parameters of required experts, skipping the rest. However, traditional layer-wise gating imposes significant loading costs. Previous approaches, such as on-demand loading [25], prefetching [26], and expert caching [8; 27], attempt to address this. However, on-demand loading adds overhead to the critical inference path, and prefetching often loads unnecessary experts due to incomplete routing information, leading to suboptimal memory usage and performance [28]. Additionally, caching strategies, based on request characteristics like temporal locality or activation sparsity, have mostly been evaluated in isolated single-request scenarios. In practice, expert caches are shared across multiple requests, making cache policies relying on per-request traits suboptimal. A global view across all requests is necessary for effective caching (see Table 4). Our work leverages pre-gating to develop more informed prefetching and caching strategies, resulting in significant system-level improvements.

**Fine-grained Prefetching.** By design, our pre-gating MoE architecture enables us to prefetch the exact expert layers needed for a token or a request, avoiding guesswork. To further hide the latency in prefetching, we pipeline and thus overlap loading of experts and experts' computation at layer-wise granularity: specifically, while computing the \(i\)th layer's forward path in the compute stream, we load the \(i+1\)st layer's experts in a separate loading stream.

**Belady-inspired Caching.** Prefetching can hide the loading latency of all but the first layer, which incurs significant cost. To mitigate this, we need a cache that stores relevant initial layers, and we argue that pre-gating enables an optimal caching strategy.

The classical Belady algorithm is known to be the _optimal offline cache replacement algorithm_, replacing the object that will be accessed farthest in the future. While impractical in real-world systems (due to unknown future accesses), our pre-gating architecture allows us to approximate it. By decoupling the router from the backbone MoE, we can compute future expert references across requests in advance, enabling near-optimal cache replacement.

Suppose that the cache at time step \(t-1\) is as follows: \(C(t-1)=\{e_{1},e_{2},...,e_{k}\}\), where the cache is of size \(k\) and is filled with \(k\) experts \(e_{1...k}\). \(F(e,t)\) represents the next time after \(t\) when expert \(e\) will be requested. Then, our policy chooses the expert \(e_{evict}=argmax_{e\in C(t-1)}F(e,t)\) for eviction.

### Expert-aware Batching

Current serving systems heavily rely on batching to improve inference efficiency, but effective batching for MoE models remains challenging. As shown in Figure 3 (a), each token in MoE models may invoke a different set of experts per layer, leading to multiple expert activations for a batch of requests. For example, in a toy model with 4 experts per layer and a batch of 3 tokens (one per request), 2/3/3 experts would be activated across the layers. In the Mixtral8x7B model [3] applied to the chatbot arena dataset [29], we observed an average activation of **7.63 out of 8 experts**, even with a modest batch size of 56.8.

The core challenge is that while each token requires computation from only one expert per layer, it must wait for all other tokens in the batch to complete their expert computations in the same layer [30]. This bottleneck repeats at each layer, reducing the efficiency of batching. Ideally, a single loaded expert would serve multiple tokens in a batch, but this is rarely achieved, affecting both performance and efficiency. For example, we observe a linear increase in average per-token processing latency as the number of unique experts per batch grows (see Figure 3 (b)).

In contrast, pre-gating enhances inference performance by enabling the _delayed creation of an optimal batch based on required experts_. For a given set of tokens, we pre-gate each one and select a subset for batching, depending on their identified expert requirements. The goal is to minimize the number of unique experts across all layers while maximizing the number of tokens in the batch. Moreover, as discussed in SS 2.3, our expert selection remains consistent across layers--if a token is assigned to Expert 1, it will be routed to Expert 1 in every layer. This approach, combined with our batching strategy, ensures optimal efficiency. Algorithm 1 provides our batching pseudocode.

We note that in other MoEs, such batching isn't feasible because, as shown in Figure 3, their expert selection at each layer remains unknown until the request reaches the router. In _Read-ME_, experts are determined first, which allows batches to be created and submitted to MoE layers efficiently.

## 5 Evaluation

In this section, we start by describing the experimental details in SS 5.1. Then we validate the refactorization effectiveness on downstream tasks in SS 5.2. In SS 5.3, we evaluate the effectiveness of pre-gating and batching. SS 5.4 analyzes memory optimization techniques. In addition, we provide experimental details in SS 5.1, and more experimental results in SS. A.

### Experimental Details

Model and DatasetWe perform the MoE refactorization based on Llama2-7B-chat [19] model, a popular open-source model pre-trained on 2 trillion tokens. The training corpus [35] involves the data collected from 7 different resources: Arxiv [20], Books [21], Common Crawl, C4 [36], Github, Wikipedia [37], and StackExchange [22]. To generate experts, we collect \(16\) samples from each data domain, with each sample consisting of \(4096\) consecutive tokens. During router tuning, we use the subset of RedPajama dataet [35], with the same curation strategy. We present our detailed router design in Table 1. We use the standard Transformer [31] architecture with a 1-layer, 4-head

\begin{table}

\end{table}

design. The router is lightweight, consisting of 18 million additional parameters, and incurs negligible computational overhead. We use 8 A100 GPUs with 80GB of memory for all tuning experiments.

Continual-Tuning DetailsTo co-optimize the router and expert networks, we iteratively tune each model component. Specifically, we first optimized the router by \(\mathcal{L}_{RD}\), as detailed in SS 3, for \(100\) steps. We use the batch size of \(64\) in this router tuning stage. During this _router tuning_ stage, we freeze the expert weights and solely tune the router weights. Then, during the _expert tuning_ stage, we fix the router weights and modify the expert weights via language modeling loss, for \(200\) steps, with a batch size of \(128\). We set sequence length to \(4096\) for all stages, following the choice in the pre-training stage of Llama2 model [19]. This iterative training schedule is conducted 8 times. Detailed visualizations of the training dynamics are provided in Section A.1. For each round, the router tuning and expert tuning stages will cost 26 million and 105 million tokens, respectively. The whole continual-tuning process merely uses \(1.04\) billion tokens, negligible compared to the pre-training cost (2 trillion tokens). During each round of tuning, we use the cosine learning rate decay. At round \(0\), the initial learning rates are \(5e^{-4}\) for router tuning and \(5e^{-5}\) for expert tuning. The initial learning rate decays exponentially with a decay rate of \(0.8\) as the number of rounds increases.

Inference System EvaluationFor our workload, we utilize the Chatbot Arena Conversation Dataset [29] to generate inference requests and replay conversation traces. Our setup employs a single A100 GPU with 80GB of memory. The implementation is built on top of DeepSpeed inference engine [38]. We use normalized latency as our primary metric, defined as the end-to-end latency divided by the generated token length, in line with previous works [9; 39; 38].

### Downstream Task Evaluations

We first validate the refactorization effectiveness on downstream tasks, as shown in Table 3, comparing it to other models of similar scales, including the open-source models that trained from scratch, and

the dense models pruned from larger pre-trained LLMs. We achieve the best average performance, outperforming all model variants from the Pythia [40] and Open-Llama-v2 [41] families, as well as Sheared-Llama [42]. We use just 1 billion training tokens, considerably less than other models.

In Fig. 4, we further provide a direct comparison with other compression methods, which converts a large LLM to a small dense variant, on MMLU [16] benchmarks. Besides open-source models and Sheared-Llama [42] which are mentioned in the previous table, we additionally include recent compression techniques, including LLM-Pruner [43], SliceGPT [44], LaCo [45], and Compresso [46], as our baselines. _Read-ME_achieves the best performance among the models with the number of activation parameters less than \(5\) billion, and shows comparable performance with Open-Llama-v2-7B [41]. More analysis is included in SS 1.2.

### Pre-gating and Expert-aware Batching

**Inference Latency Breakdown.** We evaluate the impact of the auto-regressive router introduced by our refactoring of the dense MoE on per-request inference latency. Unlike conventional layer-wise routers, usually linear layers, our auto-regressive router comprises a multi-head attention layer and an MLP layer (see SS 1.3), potentially raising its computational cost.

Fig. 5 (left) illustrates the average per-token latency breakdown of a single isolated inference request measured in OpenMoE[18] with conventional layerwise routers, our refactored model with pregating router, and the original dense Llama2-7b model [19] we refactored. We find that the computational

The evaluation includes zero-shot performance on WinoGrande, ARC-Easy, LogiQA, CoQA; 5-shot performance on MMLU; 10-shot on Hellaswag; and 25-shot on ARC-Challenge. The "#Param" column presents in the form of (# Activated-Parameters - # Total-Parameters). Training cost is measured by the number of tokens used. For compression methods like ours and Sheared-Llama, only tokens used for conversion are counted, excluding Llama-2 pre-training costs.

overhead of our auto-regressive router is minimal - its contribution of 0.4% is much less compared to the router's net contribution in other MoE models (3.95%). This is because we use a single router unlike other models with gating for each MoE layer; also, our router design is compact with only 18M parameters (Table 1). Compared to the dense model, we achieve a net 19% reduction in latency via refactoring the MLP to MoE.

**Batched Inference.** We now evaluate the efficacy of our expert-aware batching. Fig 5 (center) shows the latency distribution and the 95-th percentile latency (p95) during batched inference. We compare with two widely used techniques - Decoding-prioritized batching [38], and Prefill-prioritized batching [39; 47]. These methods utilize distinct queues for decoding requests and prefill requests, prioritizing batching of tokens from decoding and prefill requests, respectively.

Prioritizing either decoding or prefill requests yields comparable performance. In contrast, our method of constructing batches based on activated experts enhances the mean latency by 5.0-6.1% and reduces the p95 latency by 9.5-10.0% compared to these approaches.

The primary reason for this improvement is that our batching approach directly reduces the average number of unique experts invoked per batch by leveraging pre-gated information. Specifically, for decoding-prioritized and prefill-prioritized batching, the average number of unique experts per batch was 5.08 and 5.21, respectively, whereas our method reduces this to 3.51.

We observed a significant performance impact as prefill requests invoke more experts per batch compared to decoding requests. Prefill requests require tokens to be dispatched to different experts, making it impractical to batch tokens by shared experts due to attention operations. As a result, a substantial number of experts are invoked for each batch, negatively affecting performance. Fortunately, our auto-regressive router design improves temporal locality in prefill requests, often allowing tokens within the same request to select the same or a small number of experts. We explore this locality in greater detail in the following section.

**High Temporal Locality.** To analyze the locality, we measure the temporal distance of the tokens in a sequence (Fig. 5 (c)). We define temporal distance as the distance between two tokens selecting the same expert within a sequence [48]. Our result shows that our router leads to a smaller distance, indicating a high degree of temporal locality. Specifically, out of 4096 tokens, 2921 tokens follow the choice of the last token, compared to 850 tokens in Mixtral-8x7B. The locality is attributed to the auto-regressive design of our router, where the router's decision is based on the current and all previous tokens. As a result, a given token is likely to have similar expert selections with its recent predecessor tokens. However, note that this temporal locality appears only within the token sequence of a single request and does not appear across different requests.

### Memory-Efficient Inference

We evaluate how well our approach can ensure good performance while improving memory efficiency. In particular, we constrain the expert cache capacity to \(k\) (that is, up to \(k\) experts can reside in accelerator memory). In this setup, if a requested expert is not in memory, it must be loaded from host memory, potentially increasing loading latency. As explained in SS 4.1, this loading overhead can be mitigated with prefetching, provided that we know which expert will be needed in _ReadME_. We compare the end-to-end latency of requests from the prefetching our approach enables (Prefetching) versus not leveraging prefetching (On-demand Loading) [25]. Figure 6 shows that for varying cache capacities, we consistently outperform On-demand Loading, with up to 30% better latency.

In addition to proactively loading experts into memory, our approach also retains experts in a cache to further use memory optimally. Table 4 compares three representative caching policies' hit ratios across varying cache capacities, including the Belady-inspired approach that our architecture enables. As noted earlier, our approach accommodates multiple requests where each request has a token sequence, in contrast with prior works focusing on a single request/token-sequence [8; 27].

Figure 6: Latency impact of prefetching: We measured end-to-end latency on a synthetic workload generated by replaying Chatbot Arena Dataset [29]. (Appendix 5.1)

When multiple requests share the expert cache, temporal locality within a single request cannot be leveraged across requests, limiting its effectiveness. This explains why LRU, which works well in single-request scenarios, underperforms in our setup. In contrast, our Belady-based algorithm excels at all cache capacities by utilizing future expert information across requests, thanks to the pre-gating router. When cache capacity is constrained by system memory, latency can be significantly reduced with an optimized cache policy. Our Belady approach notably improves latency, particularly under limited cache sizes, though we omit detailed results for brevity.

## 6 Related Work

**MoE Refactorization.** Recent "MoE-fication" methods [11; 12; 13; 49] optimize or group channels using graph-based techniques but still rely on system-inefficient layer-wise routers. In contrast, we are the first to identify the redundancy in layer-wise routers and propose a pre-gating router that enables expert pre-fetching. Similar to [50; 14; 51], we leverage activation sparsity [23] to construct experts, adaptively identifying important neurons and evicting less-important ones during inference.

**Efficient Inference Serving.** To deal with the limited memory in resource-constrained settings, prior LLM inference works focused on optimizations such as offloading parameters to host memory [52; 53; 25], quantization [54; 55; 56], sparsity [57; 58] and MoE architectures [4; 59; 26]. However, while token batching [9] has garnered significant attention for dense models [39; 47; 38; 60], it remains problematic and underexplored in the context of MoE models.

Pre-gated MoE [28] is related to _Read-ME_as they too fine-tune a router to pre-gate using the \(i\)th layer's hidden states to compute the \(i+1\)th layer's routing; but they still maintain a layer-wise architecture which constrains batching. SiDA-MoE [61] separates the router from the inference path. However, tokens cannot be batched together because they do not share routing decisions across all layers. In addition, the offline routing function of SiDA is an approximation that may incorrectly guess expert selection, especially when the model scales. In contrast, _Read-ME_has exact routing, ensuring no performance drop during inference.

Mixtral-offloading [8] introduces speculation to "guess" routing decisions, resorting to costly on-demand loading if speculation fails. Caching is commonly used [62; 52; 63; 53; 64], including in MoE systems [8; 27], which typically focus on single requests. Prior caching methods are limited by layer-wise routing and lack of foresight into future requests.

## 7 Conclusions and Limitations

We address the under-explored challenge of reusing a pre-trained LLM to create a smaller MoE model that enables efficient inference with minimal training cost. By leveraging activation sparsity, we construct specialized experts and integrate them via a router. Upon analyzing the layer-wise router design used in all open-source MoEs, we identify its inefficiency and redundancy. To overcome this, we propose a pre-gating router, decoupled from the MoE backbone, enabling system-level optimizations that were previously unattainable.

**Limitations.** Our serving system is designed for a single accelerator, and extending it to distributed serving remains a non-trivial task for future work. Our method has no negative societal impact, as it uses publicly released data and model checkpoints. This work is foundational research and is not tied to specific applications.

More Experimental Results

### Training Dynamics

As detailed in SS 5.1, we iteratively tune the router and experts for \(8\) rounds. We visualize the validation loss during the first \(4\) rounds out of the total \(8\) rounds of training. In Fig. 7, the router tuning stages are marked in gray, while the expert tuning stages are marked in orange. Two observations can be drawn from Figure 7: (1) The validation loss decreases during both router tuning and expert tuning stages. (2) The validation loss reduction from router tuning saturates after two rounds, while the validation loss continues to decrease during expert tuning.

### MoE Achieves Better Efficiency-Accuracy Trade-off than Dense Models.

Prior compression-based works [42; 43; 44; 45; 46] focus on converting a large _dense_ pre-trained model into a smaller _dense_ model. However, we argue that a smaller _MoE_ model (i.e. the MoE model with the smaller number of activation parameters) is a better target architecture. To ensure a fair comparison, we (1) derive a small dense model with \(4.7B\) parameters, matching the size of a single expert network, using the same amount of data, and (2) fine-tune the obtained dense model for an equivalent number of steps. As shown in Table 5, refactorizing the pre-trained model into an MoE structure, rather than a smaller dense variant, leads to significant performance improvement. The models are evaluated based on performance on the MMLU [16], and perplexity across seven data domains included in RedPajama [35].

### _Read-ME_ Remains Effective without Prior Knowledge of the Training Domain

We additionally use the Mistral [65] model as the pre-trained dense model, and convert it to the MoE structure, with the proposed method. The task is challenging because we do not have prior knowledge on the Mistral original training data, and our experiment in Table 6 shows that our method remains effective without the prior knowledge of the original training domain.

### Computational Cost of Auto-regressive Router

For a detailed cost analysis of auto-regressive router that we introduced, we added: (1) FLOPs comparison, (2) latency, and (3) latency breakdown with a larger batch size (high-throughput scenarios) of a Traditional Router (TR) and an Autoregressive Router (AR). To focus solely on the router's impact on latency, we controlled other variables (e.g., the number of activated parameters) to be the same.

Note that the computational cost of both the traditional router and the autoregressive router is theoretically _linear to batch size_. Therefore, when the batch size is high (in high-throughput

scenarios), the cost increases linearly. In both cases, the computation can be parallelized, so this remains negligible in end-to-end latency even in high-throughput scenarios. In fact, we would like to clarify that the bottleneck in high-throughput scenarios is actually the expert layers, as seen in Table 9 - Expert/MLP row. This issue can be addressed by the methods discussed in Section 4. _Traditional layerwise routers do not allow for efficient system design_, which underscores the need for a careful co-design of routers.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: **The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.** The checklist should follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:

* You should answer [Yes], [No], or [NA].
* [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
* Please provide a short (1-2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

**The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.** They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

* **Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading "NeurIPS paper checklist"**,
* **Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.**
* **Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers**.

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We explained the detailed claims in section 2-4 with proper observation figures (Fig 2) and added supporting evaluations in Sec 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We discussed the limitation of our method in Section 7. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
* The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
* The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
* The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
* The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the detailed experimental information including model configurations, hyper-parameters and inference system setup choices in Appendix Section B. Codes will be publicly released. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use public datasets for both training and evaluation. Codes will be publicly released. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.

* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide experimental settings and details from both training and evaluation in Appendix Section B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report error bars in Figure 6. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the type of compute resources we used for experiments in Appendix Section B. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our method does not have negative societal impacts, as we use publicly released data and model checkpoints. Our work is foundational research and is not tied to specific applications. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss broader impacts in Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the original paper/website/license of existing assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects**Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not Applicable Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not Applicable. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
