###### Abstract

We introduce a new benchmark, _TAPVid-3D_, for evaluating the task of long-range Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D). While point tracking in two dimensions (TAP-2D) has many benchmarks measuring performance on real-world videos, such as TAPVid-DAVIS, three-dimensional point tracking has none. To this end, leveraging existing footage, we build a new benchmark for 3D point tracking featuring 4,000+ real-world videos, composed of three different data sources spanning a variety of object types, motion patterns, and indoor and outdoor environments. To measure performance on the TAP-3D task, we formulate a collection of metrics that extend the Jaccard-based metric used in TAP-2D to handle the complexities of ambiguous depth scales across models, occlusions, and multi-track spatio-temporal smoothness. We manually verify a large sample of trajectories to ensure correct video annotations, and assess the current state of the TAP-3D task by constructing competitive baselines using existing tracking models. We anticipate this benchmark will serve as a guidepost to improve our ability to understand precise 3D motion and surface deformation from monocular video.

## 1 Introduction

For robots, humans, and other agents to effectively interact with the physical 3D world, it is necessary to understand a scene's structure and dynamics. This is a key ingredient to any general embodied intelligence: the ability to learn a world model to understand and predict the structure and motion of arbitrary scenes. It is attractive to leverage the vast amounts of monocular video data that is available cheaply, and use such signals to understand the geometry and 3D motion in real-world footage. But how well can current perception algorithms actually do this?

The field has seen many efforts to measure 3D and motion understanding from videos, each contributing a part of the overall goal. For example, monocular depth estimation is a widely recognized task [8, 36, 61]. However, success in depth estimation alone doesn't reveal whether the model understands how surfaces move from one frame to the next, and may not respect temporal continuity. For instance, a basketball spinning on its axis is often not visible in a sequence of depth maps. On the other end of the generality spectrum, 3D pose tracking, e.g. for rigid objects [15, 34] and people [13, 48], evaluates precise motion, but requires a known 3D model of each object, with articulations. Building parametric models and pose estimation methods for all animal classes is infeasible, much less for all the objects that a robot might encounter in, for example, an unseen, busy construction site.

An alternative and more general approach for 3D understanding observes that the world consists of particles, each of which individually follows a 3D trajectory through space. Measuring the motion of these points provides a way to measure 3D motion _without requiring any 3D shapes to be known_a priori_. To this end, in TAPVid-3D, we focus on providing the community with a benchmark consisting of real world videos and three-dimensional point tracking annotations, spanning a wide variety of objects, scenes, and motion patterns.

Prior work on 2D understanding has shown that this kind of point-wise motion can be extremely valuable: both optical flow and the longer term two-dimensional Tracking-Any-Point (TAP) tasks have been applied to video editing [64], controllable video generation [57], robotic manipulation [53; 58], and more [9; 18]. TAP is an occlusion-aware, temporal extension of optical flow, which itself has a 3D extension called _scene flow_[37; 39; 40]. While useful, scene flow suffers from the same challenges as optical flow, namely, that it captures instantaneous motion and does not evaluate correct, occlusion-aware association of pixels over long sequences. A new three-dimensional TAP benchmark would provide a way to measure progress on many of these tasks: our TAPVid-3D benchmark targets evaluating general motion understanding, for models performing both dense and sparse particle tracking, in two and three dimensions.

Unfortunately, all the currently-used evaluations for TAP on real-world videos assess only 2D tracking ability (e.g. the TAP-Vid suite [10], BADJA [5], CroHD [51], and JHMDB [19]), and cannot evaluate the performance of 3D point tracking due to lack of access to the ground-truth metric position trajectories. While evaluations based on synthetic environments, like Kubric [14], RGB-Stacking [10], and Point Odyssey [68], could potentially provide 3D point tracking annotations, these introduce a significant domain gap with real-world scenes and are therefore less representative of model performance on real-world tasks.

Many applications stand to benefit from direct evaluation of three-dimensional point tracking capabilities and improvements to such models. For example, robotic manipulation tasks are likely to be easier with accurate 3D motion estimates, to understand the changing relative world position of the gripper, any objects, and the background. Video generation models would be more useful if creators were able to condition on exact motion tracks describing the 3D movement of both objects and the camera, as a director would do on a stage. Standard scene understanding tasks like velocity estimation, motion prediction, and object parts segmentation are simpler given the 3D motion tracks of individual points. Many visual odometry, mapping, and structure from motion pipelines rely on accurate 3D correspondences; with the ability to track 3D point correspondences from _any_ pixel, such pipelines could be made more robust and accurate, even with many moving objects. Overall, the task of three dimensional point tracking provides a strict superset of information as compared to its 2D counterpart, is likely to be more useful in downstream applications, and provides a greater test of physical world motion understanding.

To this end, we introduce TAPVid-3D: a _real-world_ benchmark for evaluating the Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D) task. The benchmark contributes: (1) a unification of three distinct real-world video data sources, with pipelines to generate, standardize, and validate consistent ground-truth \((x,y,z)\) 3D trajectories and occlusion information, (2) formalization of the TAP-3D task, with new metrics to measure accuracy of 3D track estimation, and (3) an assessment of the current state of TAP-3D, formed from the first real-world video evaluations of the nascent set of early 3D TAP models.

## 2 Related work

Tracking Any Point.In recent years, long-range tracking of local image points has been formalized as the Tracking Any Point task (TAP) and evaluated using the, now standard, TAPVid benchmark [10], among others. Success on TAP consists of tracking the 2D trajectory of any given \((x,y)\)_query point_, defined at a particular frame \(t\), throughout the rest of a given video. By definition, the query point is considered visible at the query frame, and associated to the material point of the scene which is observed at \((x,y,t)\). However, this material point may become occluded or go out of the image boundaries. To handle this, TAP models also must predict a binary visibility flag \(v\) for each timestamp of the video. The tracked \((x,y)\) positions and visibility estimates are scored jointly using an all-encompassing average Jaccard metric. Most current TAP models [10; 11; 12; 17; 22] are limited to tracking in 2D pixel space. Recently, some works have started exploring the extension of the TAP problem to 3D (TAP-3D) [56; 60]. However, most TAP benchmarks containing real-world videos, such as TAPVid-DAVIS [10], Perception Test [42], CroHD [51] and BADJA [5], don't have 3D annotations, and therefore evaluations are still performed on the 2D tracking task. Concurrent to our work, Wang et al. [56] introduced both a synthetic (LSFOdyssey) and a real benchmark (LSFDriving)for evaluating TAP-3D. However, their real benchmark is limited to the driving domain and only contains 180 test clips with 40 frames each. Our proposed TAPVid-3D benchmark is substantially larger and more diverse, containing 4000+ clips with durations between 25 and 300 frames.

Scene flow estimation.The scene flow estimation problem, introduced by Vedula et al. [54], seeks to obtain a dense, instantaneous, 3D motion field of a 3D scene, analogously to the way optical flow estimates a dense 2D motion field across consecutive frame pairs of a 2D video. The TAP-3D task is related to the scene flow problem in a similar way in which the TAP task is related to the optical flow problem. While scene flow seeks to obtain dense instantaneous motion estimation, TAP-3D seeks to obtain longer-range tracking, spanning tens or hundreds of frames. Furthermore, TAP-3D does not seek to produce dense fields of tracks, but is rather interested in tracking a sparse set of query points, which is more computationally tractable. From work in TAP-2D, we have observed that having motion representations with longer temporal context is useful for downstream tasks such as robotic manipulation, while having sparser spatial coverage is sufficient for many tracking applications.

Pose estimation.Closely related to point tracking is pose estimation and keypoint tracking. Many benchmarks have been proposed for 2D and 3D pose estimation [16; 27; 55; 66]. 3D pose estimation tasks and benchmarks largely focus on specific categories of moving objects, and for objects that are articulated: e.g. humans [20; 55], hands [52], animals [38; 65], and even jointed furniture [32]. For general motion and scene understanding, we aim to learn motion estimation across any object or scene pixel, expanding the generality of the task.

Static scene reconstruction.Static scene reconstruction, a fundamental problem in computer vision, has been advanced through techniques like Structure-from-Motion (SfM) and monocular depth estimation. Significant contributions include COLMAP [44] for state-of-the-art reconstructions and MVSNet [63], which enhances multi-view stereo depth estimation with deep learning. These studies collectively advance robust and precise static scene reconstruction. Evaluation of the local features and depth are crucial for static scene reconstruction methods. [45] provided a comparative evaluation of hand-crafted and learned features, while MegaDepth [28] improved single-view depth prediction using large scale multi-view Internet photo collections. Despite significant progress, static reconstruction struggles with dynamic environments, highlighting the need for dynamic scene methods.

Dynamic scene reconstruction.3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes and objects is a widely studied problem in computer vision. Over the years, several methods have proposed solutions to this problem, starting with Non-rigid Structure-from-Motion methods (NRSfM) [2; 6]. While these methods have shown some success modelling simple motions like facial expressions and skeletal motions, they fail to generalize to arbitrary motions. More recently, deep-learning based methods have been used to perform 3D reconstruction of dynamic scenes. One line of works exploit Monocular Depth Estimation models [43] and performs test-time optimization on each given video to obtain smoother reconstructions, under the assumption that the frame rate of the camera is high with respect to the speed of the depicted object (quasi-static scene assumption) [26; 36; 67]. While these methods are more general than the classic NRSfM counterparts, they still require costly test-time optimization and fail to model rapid motions. Other lines of work attempt to fit a neural-scene representation to each video, such as neural-radiance fields [29; 30] or 3D Gaussian Splatting [62]. However, these methods require a costly per-video optimization, and typically make smoothness and local-rigidity assumptions about the motion of the points in the scene. We believe the development of TAP-3D methods should significantly help for the problem of dynamic scene reconstruction, as these models can run in a feed-forward manner, without requiring test-time optimization, and don't need any explicit motion prior assumptions as they can learn these from data.

Table 2 summarizes the focus areas of measurement for common scene understanding benchmarks. On the bottom row is the proposed TAP-3D task, and corresponding benchmark, TAPVid-3D, which brings to the table a more complete test of dynamic scene understanding in one simple evaluation.

## 3 TAPVid-3D

We build a real-world benchmark for evaluating Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D) models. To do this, we leveraged three publicly available datasets: (i) Aria Digital Twins [41], (ii) DriveTrack [3; 50]and (iii) Panoptic Studio [21]. These data sources span different application domains, environments, and video characteristics, deriving ground truth tracking trajectories from different sensor types. For instance, Aria Digital Twins is a dataset of egocentric video, and is more close to bimanual robotic manipulation problems, where the camera is robot mounted and sees the actions from a first person view. DriveTrack features footage captured from a Waymo car navigating outdoor scenes, akin to tasks in robotic navigation and outdoor, rigid-body scene understanding tasks. Finally, Panoptic Studio captures third-person views of people performing diverse actions within an instrumented dome. It presents complex human movement which aligns more closely with NRSM-adjacent tasks. We believe that, combined, these data sources present a diverse and comprehensive benchmark of TAP-3D capabilities for many potential downstream tasks. We describe our pipeline to extract ground truth metric 3D point trajectories from each source in the next sections, with samples in Figure 1.

Table 3 shows the summary statistics across the entire dataset, and for the dataset subdivisions corresponding to each constituent data source. As there are comparatively a large number of videos (for reference, the commonly used TAPVid-DAVIS in TAP-2D has 30 videos, whereas TAPVid-3D has two orders of magnitude more), we release two splits: a minival split, with 50 videos from each data source, and a full_test split, containing all videos in the benchmark, without the minival videos. The minival is intentionally lightweight, and likely most useful for online evaluation during training.

### Aria Digital Twins

This split employs real videos captured with the Aria glasses [1] inside different recording studios, which mimic household environments. Accurate digital replicas of these studios, created in 3D modeling software, are used to obtain pseudo-ground truth annotations of the original footage. This includes annotations such as segmentation masks, 3D object bounding boxes and depth maps. We leverage these annotations to extract 3D trajectories from given 3D query points. In particular, given a video \(V=\{I_{t}\}_{t=1,\dots,T}\) with \(T\) frames and \(W\times H\) spatial resolution, with corresponding object segmentation masks \(\{S_{t}\}\subset\mathbb{Z}^{W\times H}\), and depth maps \(\{D_{t}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^{W\times H}\), extrinsic world-to-camera poses* \(\{(P_{cam}^{w})_{t}\}\subset\mathbb{R}^{3\times 4}\), camera intrinsics \(K\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times 3}\), and a query point \(q=(x_{q},y_{q},t_{q})\), we first extract the query point's 3D position \(Q_{cam}\)+ in the camera coordinate frame, with

Footnote *: We use the notation \(P_{b}^{a}\) to represent the SE(3) transform from coordinate frame \(a\) to frame \(b\).

\[(Q_{cam})_{t_{q}}=K^{-1}(x_{q},y_{q},1)^{T}\cdot D_{t_{q}}(x_{q},y_{q}).\] (1)

Additionally, we obtain the object ID of the query point from the segmentation mask \(q_{id}=S_{t_{q}}(x_{q},y_{q})\), and use it to retrieve the 3D object pose of the query object \((P_{obj}^{w})_{t_{q}}\), which converts points from world coordinate frame to the object coordinate frame. This allows us to compute the query point position in the object's frame of reference as

\[Q_{obj}=(P_{obj}^{w})_{t_{q}}(P_{w}^{cam})_{t_{q}}(Q_{cam})_{t_{q}}.\] (2)

In this way, we _fix_ the query point to the corresponding object, and then obtain its track across the whole video by leveraging the object's pose annotation. For any timestamp \(t\), the position of the query point can be then obtained by

\[(Q_{cam})_{t}=(P_{cam}^{w})_{t}(P_{w}^{obj})_{t}Q_{obj}.\] (3)

To compute the visibility \(v\) of the query point at any time, we first employ a pretrained semantic segmentation model to obtain the semantic masks of the operator's hands \(\{H_{t}\}\), as these are not modelled in the digital replica. Then, we compute the visibility \(v\) by verifying that the query point's depth is close to the observed depth, and it does not lie on the hands segmentation mask \(H\), so

Figure 1: Random samples from TAPVid-3D: on the top row, we visualize the point trajectories projected into the 2D video frame; on the bottom row, we visualize the metric 3D point trajectories. From left to right, we show one example from each constituent data source: ADT, DriveTrack and Panoptic Studio.

\[v_{t}=\mathds{1}(|(Z(Q_{cam})-D_{t}(u,v)|<\delta)\cdot(1-H_{t}(u,v)),\] (4)

where \((u,v)=\Pi_{K}((Q_{cam})_{t})\) is the projection of the query point \((Q_{cgm})_{t}\) to the image plane according to the given camera intrinsics \(K\), and \(Z((x,y,z))=z\) is the function that extracts the z-component of a 3D point. This approach allows us to compute the 3D trajectory \(\{(Q_{cam})_{t}\}\) and visibility flag \(\{v_{t}\}\) of the query point across the whole video.

### DriveTrack

The DriveTrack split is based on videos from the Waymo Open dataset [50], and the 2D point trajectory pipeline used in DriveTrack [3]. In particular, each frame \(I_{t}\) in a video sequence \(V\) has a corresponding, time-synchronized point cloud \(\{C_{t}\}\) from the Waymo car's LIDAR. The subset of points that correspond to a randomly selected, single, tracked vehicle \((Q_{cam})_{t_{s}}\) are subselected from the entire point cloud \((Q_{cam})_{t_{s}}\subset C_{t_{s}}\) at a certain sampling time \(t_{s}\) using a manually-annotated 3D bounding box around the chosen object. These object-specific points are then tracked across the whole video using: (i) a vehicle rigidity assumption, and, (ii) the pose and position of the object's annotated 3D bounding box through the entire video sequence. Specifically, the tracked points in object coordinate frame \(Q_{obj}\) are first computed using (2), and then the trajectories in camera coordinate frame \(\{(Q_{cam})_{t}\}\) are obtained using (3).

Visibility flag is estimated by first computing the dense depth map \(D_{t}\) of the corresponding camera video frames through interpolation of sparse LIDAR values as in [3]. This is compared to the point's depth computed from the 3D point trajectory given by \((Q_{cam})_{t}\), as in the first term of (4). If the point depth (distance from the camera center to the query point) is greater than the depth provided by the depth map (with a 5% relative threshold margin), it is marked as not visible.

Finally, to determine the 2D query points \(q=(x_{q},y_{q},t_{q})\) we sample \(t_{q}\) uniformly among the visible timestamps \(v_{t}\), and then obtain \((x_{q},y_{q})=\Pi_{K}((Q_{cam})_{t_{q}})\).

### Panoptic Studio

The original Panoptic Studio dataset [21] consists in video sequences captured inside a recording dome using stationary cameras, and depicting different actors performing various actions such as passing a ball or swinging a tennis racket, featuring complex non-rigid motions. To obtain 3D trajectories, we leverage the pretrained dynamic 3D reconstructions from Luiten et al. [35]. These have been obtained by first performing a rigid 3D reconstruction through 3D Gaussian Splitting [23], fitting a set of 3D Gaussians \(\{(\mu_{i},\Sigma_{i})_{t_{0}}\}_{i=1,\dots,N}\) to the first timestamp \(t_{0}\) of each sequence using the multiple cameras available in the dome. Then, these Gaussians are displaced and rotated in a as-rigid-as-possible manner to model the motion occurring in the subsequent frames of the video. For more details, please refer to [35]. Using these pretrained splitting models, we render pseudo-ground-truth depth maps \(\{D_{t}\}\) for each sequence. Then, given an query point \(q=(x_{q},y_{q},t_{q})\), we unproject the point to 3D following (1), obtaining \((Q_{cam})_{t_{q}}\), and retrieve the index \(i^{*}\) of the closest Gaussian center at that time using the poses \(\{(P^{w}_{cam})_{t}\}\), so that \(i^{*}=\underset{i=1,\dots,N}{\text{argmin}}\,\|(Q_{cam})_{t_{q}}-(P^{w}_{cam}) _{t_{q}}(\mu_{i})_{t_{q}}\|_{2}\).

Note that due to the distance between \((Q_{cam})_{t_{q}}\) and \((P^{w}_{cam})_{t_{q}}(\mu_{i^{*}})_{t_{q}}\), their projections onto the image plane will not match exactly. To account for this difference, we adjust the query point's 2D position as \((x_{q},y_{q})=\Pi_{K}(P^{w}_{cam})_{t_{q}}(\mu_{i^{*}})_{t_{q}}\). Then, the query point's 3D track come by following the motion of the \(i^{*}\) Gaussian center, so \((Q_{cam})_{t}\equiv(P^{w}_{cam})_{t}(\mu_{i^{*}})_{t}\).

Visibility \(\{v_{t}\}\) is estimated as in (4) (omitting the second term), by comparing the depth of our 3D query point with the observed depth from \(D_{t}\). We only track points across the foreground deforming characters, as tracking background points is trivial given that the cameras in this dataset are stationary.

### Data Cleanup and Validation

While the aforementioned procedures generally produce high quality trajectories, small amounts of noise from the underlying dataset sources can cause issues in a small fraction of sequences. These minor inaccuracies, for example, can be caused by small misalignement between Aria Digital Twins synthetic annotations and the real world video, LIDAR sensor noise, insufficiently constrained Gaussian splats, or numerical error. We minimized these errors through automated methods, and then manually checked a sampling of the videos to ensure accuracy.

Firstly, since trajectories are descriptors of surface motion, their motion should be localized to their associated object. We use instance segmentation models to generate object masks for each frame [25], filtering out errant trajectories that exceed these boundaries when not occluded. In DriveTrack specifically, the tracked bounding box is an approximation to the true object mesh, but such errors are fixed with tight segmentation masks (trimming 2-3% of initial trajectories).

Secondly, we observed that some trajectories have a 'flickering' visibility flag. This is not unique to TAPVid-3D, as we notice this in the widely used Kubric [14] and DriveTrack [3]. However, to mitigate this in our dataset, we oversample trajectories in the annotation generation pipeline, and filter trajectories whose visibility state changes more times than 10% of the total number of video frames. More details can be found in the supplementary.

### Metrics

To accompany the TAPVid-3D dataset, we adopt and extend the metrics used in TAP-2D [10] to the 3D tracking domain. These metrics measure the quality of the predicted 3D point trajectories (APD), the ability to predict point visibility (OA), or both simultaneously (AJ).

The **APD (\(<\delta_{avg}^{x}\))** metric measures the average percent of points within \(\delta\) error. If \(\hat{P}_{t}^{i}\) is the \(i\)'th point prediction at time \(t\), \(P_{t}^{i}\) is the corresponding ground truth 3D point, and \(v_{t}^{i}\) is the ground-truth point visibility flag, then:

\[\text{APD}_{3D}\equiv\frac{1}{V}\sum_{i,t}v_{t}^{i}\cdot\mathds{1}(\|\hat{P} _{t}^{i}-P_{t}^{i}\|<\delta_{3D}(P_{t}^{i})),\] (5)

where \(\mathds{1}(\cdot)\) is the indicator function, \(\|\cdot\|\) is the Euclidean norm, \(V=\sum_{i,t}v_{t}^{i}\) is the total number of visibles, and \(\delta_{3D}(P_{t}^{i})\) is the threshold value.

The value of this threshold is _relative to ground-truth depth_; and is defined by _unprojecting_ a pixel threshold \(\delta_{2D}\subset\{1,2,4,8,16\}\) to 3D space using the camera intrinsic parameters: \(\delta_{3D}(P_{t}^{i})=Z(P_{t}^{i})\cdot\delta_{2D}/f\), where \(f\) is the camera focal length. We argue that points that are closer to the camera are of higher importance than those that are far away, which is enforced by the definition of \(\delta_{3D}\)3. Note that by using this definition, the \(\text{APD}_{3D}\) metric defined in (5) is numerically equivalent to the \(\text{APD}_{2D}\) metric from [10] when the point estimations \(\hat{P}_{t}^{i}\) all have correct depths.

Footnote 3: A similar depth-adaptive threshold approach is used in Monodepth literature [43].

In addition, it is important to distinguish between occluded and visible points, because downstream algorithms often want to rely exclusively on predictions which are based on visual evidence, rather than on the guesses that might be very wrong. To this end, we adopt the occlusion accuracy metric (**OA**) from [10], which computes the fraction of points on each trajectory where \(\hat{v}_{t}^{i}=v_{t}^{i}\), where \(\hat{v}_{t}^{i}\) is the model's (binary) visibility prediction.

Finally, we define **3D-AJ**, 3D Average Jaccard, following TAP, which combines OA and \(\text{APD}_{3D}\). The AJ metric calculates the number of _true positives_ (number of points within the \(\delta_{3D}\) threshold, predicted correctly to be visible), divided by the sum of _true positives_ and _false positives_ (predicted visible, but are occluded or farther than the threshold) and _false negatives_ (visible points, predicted occluded or predicted to exceed the threshold). Mathematically, it is defined as:

\[\text{AJ}_{3D}\equiv\frac{\sum_{i,t}v_{t}^{i}\,\hat{v}_{t}^{i}\,\alpha_{t}^{i }}{\sum_{i,t}v_{t}^{i}+\sum_{i,t}((1-v_{t}^{i})\,\hat{v}_{t}^{i})+\sum_{i,t}( \hat{v}_{t}^{i}\,\hat{v}_{t}^{i}\,(1-\alpha_{t}^{i})))},\] (6)

where \(\alpha_{t}^{i}=\mathds{1}(\|\hat{P}_{t}^{i}-P_{t}^{i}\|<\delta_{3D}(P_{t}^{i}))\) indicates whether the point prediction is below the distance threshold.

Note the relationship between this and prior metrics: if the depth estimates for a given point are perfect, then this metric reduces to 2D-AJ, as there will be no depth errors. It is also related to a common Monodepth's metric \(\delta<1.25^{k}\), which also places a hard threshold on the _relative_ depth of the estimated point w.r.t. the ground truth; if the video is a single frame (occlusion-free) and the query points are dense, then there should be no 2D errors, and our metric will behave like a Monodepth metric. For general sequences, however, the algorithm must output correct tracking _and_ correct depth--i.e., a full 3D trajectory--in order to be considered correct by our metric.

Finally, one additional complication is _scale ambiguity_. As in monocular depth literature [43], we globally re-scale predictions to match ground truth, before computing the metrics. We do this by multiplying predictions \(\hat{P}_{t}^{i}\) by the median of the depth ratios \(\|P_{t}^{i}\|/\|\hat{P}_{t}^{i}\|\) over all points and frames, which we call _global median_ rescaling. Note, however, that some algorithms may be more adept at estimating the relative depth of _individual_ points: algorithms trained in simulation, for instance, may be able to estimate the depth change for a single point just by analyzing the frequencies. With a slight change to the rescaling, we can accomodate such methods even when they don't produce consistent scale between points. Therefore, we define the _per-trajectory_ rescaling, which rescales each track \(P^{i}\) separately multiplying by \(\|P_{t_{q}}^{i}\|/\|\hat{P}_{t_{q}}^{i}\|\), where \(t_{q}\) is the query timestamp. Finally, we explore a hybrid approach--which considers scaling in local neighborhoods to better account for object-object interactions--in supplementary.

## 4 Baselines on TAPVid-3D

We construct our main baselines by a combination of state-of-art 2D point trackers and monocular depth estimators. In particular, we use: (a) for 2D tracking, several state-of-the-art models such as CoTracker [22], BootsTAPIR model [12], and TAPIR [11]; and (b) for depth regression, both the monocular depth estimation model ZoeDepth [4] and the SfM pipeline COLMAP [46; 47]. To convert the frame pixel space predictions into metric \(x,y\)-position coordinates, we unproject using the camera intrinsics and the \(z\)-estimate provided by ZoeDepth. In the case of COLMAP, we import the 2D trajectories produced by the TAP methods before running the SfM reconstruction pipeline. Results for the corresponding baseline methods are shown in Table 4. We provide inference settings and details on used compute resources in the supplemental material.

In the lower half of Table 4, we provide results on the minival split, including the one very recently released work [60] that targets the nascent TAP-3D task. As SpatialTracker [60] was released three days before writing and submission of the current manuscript, we were only able to evaluate this method on minival for the moment. In pursuit of methods that jointly learn 2D and depth tracking, we additionally trained a 3D version of TAPIR (TAPIR-3D), trained _only_ on the synthetic Kubric dataset [14]. TAPIR-3D predicts \(x,y,z\) jointly per trajectory. Using an optimal per-trajectory depth scaling, TAPIR3D achieves an 3D-AJ of 9.4 AJ, slightly trailing our TAPIR + ZoeDepth baseline when using. More details are in the supplemental.

Comparing Tables 5 and 4, we find that the 3D tracking performance of our baselines are significantly lower compared to their effective 2D tracking abilities. We show examples in Figure 2, illustrating common failure modes regressing 3D trajectories, noting that while the 2D trajectories look accurate, their understanding of total scene geometry and correct 3D motion is poor.

Figure 2: Illustrative TAP-3D results of BootsTAPIR+ZoeDepth. We compare the ground-truth 2D and 3D tracks (blue solid) with the predicted tracks (red dotted). (a) Accurate tracking. (b) Noisy depth estimations result in a noisy 3D track. (c) Inconsistent depth scales across time (scale drift). (d) Inconsistent depth scales across space don’t allow a single global scale factor to properly fit all tracks.

**Limitations and Responsible Usage.** The three data sources in our benchmark do not cover all possible domains where users may want to infer dynamics, and automatic annotations may be imperfect, e.g. where the underlying sensor readings have noise (despite our filtering). Furthermore, we inherit some limitations from TAP and monocular depth: we only evaluate tracking for solid, opaque objects. From an ethical perspective, Aria and Panoptic were collected in lab settings with consenting participants, while DriveTrack's Waymo videos come from public roads in 6 US cities. This paper may inherit biases from these datasets, e.g., participants are lab researchers or the populations of those 6 US cities. This dataset is not intended for training, but care should be taken in training data to avoid biases. As a benchmark, the broader impacts are similar to those in prior vision and tracking works: there may be very long term applications to activity recognition and surveillance.

## 5 Conclusion

We introduce TAPVid-3D, a new benchmark for evaluating the nascent Tracking Any Point in 3D (TAP-3D) task. We contributed (1) a pipeline to annotate three distinct real-world video datasets to produce 3D correspondence annotations per video, (2) the first metrics for the TAP-3D task, which measure multiple axis of accuracy of 3D track estimates, and (3) an assessment of the current state of TAP-3D, by evaluating commonly used tracking models. We believe this benchmark will accelerate research on the TAP-3D task, allowing the development of models with greater dynamic scene understanding from monocular video.

We report the proposed 3D-AJ as well as the APD and OA metrics. Rows marked with * indicate evaluation on the minival split. Occlusion Accuracy (OA) measures accuracy of point visibility classification, Average Position Error within Delta measures the point position error, and the headline metric, 3D Average Jaccard (3D-AJ), combines these two as a measure of overall performance on the TAP-3D task.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have done our best to accurately describe the dataset presented, the ground truth, and what it measures. Our goal of improving 3D understanding and "world models" is aspirational, and only time will tell whether models developed for this benchmark actually tackle this problem.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Due to space constraints, we include only a brief discussion of in our conclusions which we believe includes the most critical limitations, and we aren't aware of significant flaws beyond those shown in the paper. We believe the underlying datasets have videos which are reasonably independent, although they are in specific domains that aren't fully general (which is mentioned in the paper), and privacy and fairness are discussed with ethical issues. Computational efficiency is not a concern, as the evaluations are inexpensive. We believe that our target audience--researchers working on 3D understanding and tracking--will be able to infer the limitations of 3D point tracking to the same extent that we are, and so we focused on presenting the details of our dataset and metrics in a way that would make them most clear.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [N/A] Justification: No theoretical results.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will make our datasets publicly available. The baselines we ran are based on publicly-available code, and we specify the details of hyperparameters used to run them, and we have done our best to describe our extensions that enable evaluation on our datasets. The main novel algorithm--Depth TAPIR--will be released including pretrained checkpoints.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have included all scripts we used to generate the dataset from its underlying sources, as well as the datasets themselves.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have included the core ideas in the main paper and implementation details in the supplementary, which we believe should be sufficient to reproduce our results.

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: As is common in computer vision benchmarks, we don't expect the error distributions to follow well-defined distributions so that error bars can be easily derived in closed form, and it's difficult to ensure that all meaningful factors of variation are included in any randomized trials. Furthermore, the dataset consists of thousands of videos, each with tens or hundreds of thousands of points that are evaluated; we expect that results may be statistically significant with only a few fractions of a percent improvement, which wouldn't actually enough to establish that a more-complex algorithm is actually worthy of publication.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: While we do not include the compute resources used for running the model baselines in the main paper, due to space constraints, we include this in the supplemental materials, and this is indicated the main paper as well, in Section 4.
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: There were no human participants beyond those used in the underlying datasets; these datasets are already public and either compensated the participants for their time following local laws (Pittsburgh, London), or they are public driving videos in the case of DriveTrack, in an on-road scenario where people already expect that cars may be filming. We are not aware of any data deprecations for these datasets, and have referenced their licenses which allow for our use. The paper briefly discusses dataset representativeness (though it is limited by space constraints). We inherit the dataset statistics from the existing datasets. Panoptic studio is based on two specific researchers; we used a portion of the Aria dataset without prominent people, although hands are visible and the paper does not give a breakdown in terms of representativeness. DriveTrack videos come from public roads in San Francisco, Phoenix, Mountain View, Los Angeles, Detroit, and Seattle, meaning the full dataset is very US and urban/suburban-centric. In terms of ethics considerations, this is fundamental research that's relatively far from direct applications: it has potential uses in safety-critical applications, in surveillance or other human-monitoring applications (though point tracking is not person-specific), and also in graphics where it could be used deceptively; however, these are common to many visual tracking algorithms and benchmarks and we believe that a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of the paper.
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We included a description of the intended (positive) uses of this dataset, to develop 3D and physical understanding from video, but also a brief discussion of broader impacts, which covers 1) a disclaimer that the dataset may inherit biases from other datasets, and so it alone cannot guarantee generalization across different cultures or demographics, and 2) a mention of the possible negative consequences from misuses that are similar to misuses of tracking technology, e.g. surveillance. However, we believe that these are "indirect paths" according to the guidelines, and so we don't believe these need to be described in detail. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [No] Justification: As required by the datasets and benchmarks, the dataset is being made public, including all code and data required to reproduce our results; there is no clear way to control its use once it is available. We are not releasing any new videos, only annotations, meaning that safety risks from scraping data is a minimal concern.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have properly cited the creators and original owners of the core datasets that we have extended for this dataset. We preserve their licensing terms, and will include it in our licensing terms for our benchmark extension, during our code and annotations release. We aim to to make sure that it is straightforward for future users to comply with all terms.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The dataset and benchmark is the core contribution of this paper, and so we spent most of the paper providing details on how it's collected. Our public release includes the full dataset as well as documentation to ensure other researchers can use it as easily as possible.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [N/A]Justification: This paper includes no crowdsourcing or human subjects research. Manual verifications of automatic results were done by members of our own research team.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [N/A] Justification: Again, there was no crowdsourcing or human subjects research, so IRB approval was not required.
