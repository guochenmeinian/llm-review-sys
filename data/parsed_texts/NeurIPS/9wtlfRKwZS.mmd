###### Abstract

Despite the widespread success of Transformers across various domains, their optimization guarantees in large-scale model settings are not well-understood. This paper rigorously analyzes the convergence properties of gradient flow in training Transformers with weight decay regularization. First, we construct the mean-field limit of large-scale Transformers, showing that as the model width and depth go to infinity, gradient flow converges to the Wasserstein gradient flow, which is represented by a partial differential equation. Then, we demonstrate that the gradient flow reaches a global minimum consistent with the PDE solution when the weight decay regularization parameter is sufficiently small. Our analysis is based on a series of novel mean-field techniques that adapt to Transformers. Compared with existing tools for deep networks [47] that demand homogeneity and global Lipschitz smoothness, we utilize a refined analysis assuming only _partial homogeneity_ and _local Lipschitz smoothness_. These new techniques are of independent interest.

## 1 Introduction

Transformers have revolutionized the field of deep learning since their introduction in [66]. These models are distinguished by their immense scales, often comprising billions of parameters to achieve state-of-the-art performance. Notably, this massive parameterization enables them to excel in a variety of domains, notably in natural language processing [21, 55, 65] and vision tasks [20, 36], where they have significantly advanced the frontiers of machine learning.

Despite the widespread adoption of Transformer models, our understanding of their optimization guarantees is still in its early stages. One particularly intriguing phenomenon is that as the size of model increases, training algorithms typically converges globally despite the highly nonconvex landscape of the training objective function. Remarkably, it remains somewhat enigmatic how gradient-based approaches can consistently succeed when training large-scale Transformers.

Notably, there have been several recent works showing the global convergence of training overparameterized neural networks [51, 16, 28, 14, 47, 22, 23, 35, 3, 25, 76]. In particular, several works [47, 22, 23] studied the setting with deep neural networks with skip connections. By studying the connections between the network with discretization in the parameter space and a corresponding ordinary differential equation system [71, 12, 43], these works demonstrated global convergence guarantees of wide and deep neural networks based on a mean-field analysis. However, these results are established based on certain homogeneity and/or global Lipschitz smoothness properties of theneural network, which are not applicable to Transformer models. Therefore, it remains an open question how gradient-based methods can effectively train large-scale Transformers.

### Our contribution

In this work, we bridge the gap between Transformer theory and practice by demonstrating the global convergence of Transformer training optimization via gradient flow in a large-scale model regime. We analyze the mean-field limit of the Transformer model, which is characterized by the _distribution_ of model parameters, shifting the focus from parameter space to distributional dynamics in the Wasserstein metric [16]. This approach yields two key theorems:

1. We show the closeness between practical discrete Transformers trained by gradient flow and continuous Transformers whose parameter distribution follows a partial differential equation of the Wasserstein gradient flow (Theorem 3.1). Our result demonstrates that large-scale discrete Transformers can be approximated by its mean-field limit and the approximation error can be expressed in terms of the width and depth of the Transformer models.
2. This approximation facilitates our analysis of the global convergence (Theorem 4.1) of discrete Transformer models. By leveraging the universal approximation capabilities of either the self-attention or feed-forward layers, we demonstrate that a basic gradient flow method can reliably find a global optimum, despite the highly non-convex landscape of the training objective.

We also highlight our novel contributions to Transformer theory through the development of these two core results:

1. The assumption on activation regularity conditions (Assumption 2) is less stringent compared to those usually found in studies of two-layer neural networks [51; 16; 28; 14] or deep ResNet networks [22; 23; 47]. In particular, many existing approximation guarantees reply on a Lipschitz continuity property of the network gradients, which limits the mean-filed study to neural networks with smooth activation functions. In comparison, our analysis relaxes this assumption and only requires local Lipschitz continuity of the gradient in expectation. This relaxation broadens the applicability of our approach and ensures that our result can cover more practical Transformer architectures.
2. Our model differs from the ResNet models in [47; 22; 23; 13], as those models incorporate only a single identical encoder within each evolutionary block. Unlike the typical theoretical configurations, our model employs two distinct encoders \(f\) and \(h\) that alternate throughout the network's depth. More importantly, despite the distinct encoders used, the continuous limit of our model uniformly interprets the encoder as an average of \(f\) and \(h\), providing a rigorous validation of concepts proposed in [47] and [67] from a new perspective.
3. Our global convergence guarantee for training Transformer models is also broadly applicable: our assumption (Assumption 4) ensures global convergence by relying on the universal approximation capabilities of _either_ the self-attention or the feed-forward encoder. Additionally, we incorporate a more flexible framework by adopting partial \(1\)-homogeneity for only a subset of the parameters, in contrast to the full parameter homogeneity required in studies such as [47]. This modification enables the use of softmax and sigmoid activation, expanding beyond the hardmax and ReLU restricted by full homogeneity.

Transformer model

In this section, we describe our deep Transformer model with each data input as a sequence, and the gradient flow algorithm used for training.

### Data setting

In our paper, the data input is both general and straightforward: an input sequence \(H\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\) consisting of \(N+1\) tokens, each with dimension \(D\). We consider the setting where each input sequence \(H\) is associated with a label \(y(H)\in\mathbb{R}\), where \(y(H)\) is the target function we aim to learn. Furthermore, we assume that each instance \(H\) is i.i.d. drawn from a population distribution \(\mu\).

Relation to in-context learning (ICL)Our data setting is versatile and applicable to any task involving sequential input. It particularly suits the in-context learning (ICL) scenario [6; 10; 75], where models are capable of making accurate predictions on new data when prompted with training examples from the same pool. For clarity, consider the input sequence \(H\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\) formatted as follows:

\[H=[h_{1},h_{2},\ldots,h_{N+1}]=\begin{bmatrix}x_{1}&x_{2}&\ldots&x_{N}&x_{N+1} \\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\ldots&y_{N}&0\\ p_{1}&p_{2}&\ldots&p_{N}&p_{N+1}\end{bmatrix}\overset{i.i.d.}{\sim}\mu,\quad y_ {N+1}=y(H).\]

Here, \(\{x_{i}\}_{i\in[N]}\) are the input vectors, each associated with a corresponding label \(\{y_{i}\}_{i\in[N]}\). The last token, \(x_{N+1}\) is the test input for which a prediction is made. The third row contains the customized and fixed positional encoding vectors \(\{p_{i}\}_{i\in[N]}\), which typically include ones, zeros, and indicators denoting the token for prediction. The label for the query point \(x_{N+1}\) is then given by \(y_{N+1}=y(H)\) in our terminology. ICL operates in a zero-shot fashion, without any updates to the model's parameters, highlighting a unique and powerful capability of these systems to adapt and generalize based on the provided context alone. In [6], the authors demonstrate that fixed Transformers can approximate in-context penalized generalized linear regression to any desired degree.

### Model

We follow a common configuration of Transformer architectures [6; 38; 40; 48; 73] where each Transformer block consists of two distinct layers: a self-attention mechanism layer and a token-wise feed-forward neural network layer, both equipped with skip connections. We assume that both layers consist of the average of \(M\) heads, treated uniformly as the _width_ across all blocks for simplicity. The formulation for a matrix input \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\) and a given residual step size \(\eta>0\) is as follows: Each residual self-attention layer is represented by

\[\mathrm{Attn}_{\theta_{1},\theta_{2},\ldots,\theta_{M}}(Z,\eta)=Z+\eta M^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^{M}f(Z,\theta_{j}),\] (2.1)

and each residual feed-forward neural network layer is defined by

\[\mathrm{MLP}_{w_{1},w_{2},\ldots,w_{M}}(Z,\eta)=Z+\eta M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}h (Z,w_{j})\] (2.2)

for parameter vectors \(\theta\) and \(w\) in the Euclidean space. The encoders for the self-attention and feed-forward layers are denoted as \(f:\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\) and \(h:\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\), respectively. The self-attention encoder \(f\) formulation, commonly adopting a _multiplicative_ or _dot-product_ approach as detailed in [8; 38; 48; 64; 66; 73], can be exemplified by

\[f(Z,\theta)=W_{O}W_{V}Z\sigma_{\mathsf{A}}\Big{[}(W_{K}Z)^{\top}W_{Q}Z\Big{]},\]

where \(W_{V},W_{K},W_{Q}\in\mathbb{R}^{s\times D}\), and \(W_{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times s}\). This formulation can be reparametrized to

\[f(Z,\theta)=VZ\sigma_{\mathsf{A}}\Big{[}Z^{\top}WZ\Big{]},\] (2.3)where \(V,W\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times D}\), \(\theta=\mathrm{vec}[V,W]\). The activation \(\sigma_{\text{A}}\) typically uses column-wise softmax, but component-wise ReLU is also viable, as in [6]. For the feed-forward layer, an example of the encoder is \(h(Z,w)=W_{2}\sigma_{\text{M}}(W_{1}Z)\), as detailed in [6; 38; 73], where \(w=\mathrm{vec}[W_{1},W_{2}]\) and the activation \(\sigma_{\text{M}}\) is component-wise ReLU. Alternatively, setting \(h\equiv 0\) results in a Transformer block that comprises only the self-attention layer, referred to as "attention-only" Transformers, as discussed in [6; 46; 49; 66].

Next, we analyze a Transformer network composed of \(L\) Transformer blocks, referring to \(L\) as the _depth_ of the model. In this paper, we introduce an additional term, \(\eta\), in (2.1) and (2.2) to simulate the model's evolution in a residual manner. We set the step size \(\eta\) as \(\Delta t/2\), where \(\Delta t=1/L\). As \(L\) increases, \(\Delta t\) approaches zero, allowing Transformer blocks to incrementally contribute to the model's overall progression. The structure of the network is then defined as follows:

\[\begin{cases}\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)&=\mathrm{Att}_{\theta_{t,1},\ldots,\theta_{t,M}}(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\Delta t/2)\\ \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)&=\mathrm{MLP}_{w_{t,1},\ldots,w_{t,M}}( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2),\Delta t/2)\end{cases}\] (2.4)

for each \(t=0,\ \Delta t,\ldots,\ (L-1)\Delta t\) with \(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,0)=H\). We abbreviate the subscript \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\) by \(t\) and \(j=1,2,\ldots,M\) by \(j\) for simplicity. Here, \(\Theta=\{\theta_{t,j},w_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\) denotes all parameters in the Transformer model.

Throughout this paper, we treat \(D\) and \(N\) as bounded finite values, while \(M\) and \(L\) are treated as diverging, aligning with the setting of large-scale Transformers.

### Gradient flow

For the \(l_{2}\) regularization with \(\lambda>0\), we consider training the constructed Transformer model using the following \(\lambda\)-regularized risk objective:

\[\widehat{Q}(\Theta)=\widehat{R}(\Theta)+\frac{\lambda}{2ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1} ^{M}(\|\theta_{t,j}\|_{2}^{2}+\|w_{t,j}\|_{2}^{2}),\] (2.5)

with the population squared risk function defined as

\[\widehat{R}(\Theta)=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\frac{1}{2}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[ \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}\Big{]}.\]

In Section 3.2, we will show that \(l_{2}\)-regularization on the parameter norms is essential for the well-posedness of the (Wasserstein) gradient flow to control parameter growth under our mild assumptions, even with a very small \(\lambda>0\). Similar strategies that consider necessary \(l_{2}\) regularization are employed in [23] and [70]. Then, drawing on the methodologies in [6; 32; 46], our model processes the final output through a simple _read-out_ function, \(\mathrm{Read}[\cdot]\), extracting the \((d+1,N+1)\)-th entry of its input. We propose that this read-out layer can be expanded to any linear mapping with bounded parameter norm without affecting the validity of our theoretical results.

To minimize the objective function (2.5), we implement the _standard gradient flow method_ as follows:

1. Initially, for each \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\), we sample \(M\) particles \(\theta_{t,j}^{(0)},w_{t,j}^{(0)}\) with \(j\in[M]\) independently from \(\rho_{0}(\theta,w|t)\), where \(\rho_{0}\) is a pre-defined distribution with bounded support.
2. Then, we update all parameters \(\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},w_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\) in the set \(\Theta^{(\tau)}=\{\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},w_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\}_{t,j}\) using gradient flow (scaled by \(ML\)), which is defined as follows: \[\frac{d\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-ML\nabla_{\theta_{t,j}}[\widehat{Q}( \Theta^{(\tau)})],\quad\frac{dw_{t,j}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-ML\nabla_{w_{t,j}}[ \widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})].\] (2.6)

Define the function \(\widehat{R}(H;\Theta)=\frac{1}{2}(\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H ))^{2},\) and the partial derivative \(\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)=\partial\widehat{R}(H;\Theta)/\partial\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,t)^{\top}\) for each \(t=0,\Delta t/2,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,(L-1/2)\Delta t\). Refer to Appendix C.4 for the explicit formula of \(\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)\). Using the chain rule, we derive the explicit form of the gradient flow as follows:

\[\frac{d\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-\widehat{G}_{f}(\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}, \Theta^{(\tau)},t),\quad\frac{dw_{t,j}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-\widehat{G}_{h}(w_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{(\tau)},t).\] (2.7)where

\[\widehat{G}_{f}(\theta,\Theta,t)=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[} \nabla_{\theta}\text{Tr}\Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta)^{\top} \widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\lambda\theta,\] \[\widehat{G}_{h}(w,\Theta,t)=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[} \nabla_{w}\text{Tr}\Big{(}h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta/2),w)^{\top} \widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\lambda w\]

for \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\).

## 3 Approximation by the mean-field limit

In this section, we present a rigorous approximation result that bridges Transformer models in (2.4) with their mean-field limit as continuous Transformers. Thus, the width \(M\) and depth \(L\) in our proposed model are treated as discretization of this continuous limit in the parameter space.

### Assumptions

In addition, we introduce the norm \(\|\cdot\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) as the maximum \(l_{2}\) norm across all columns of a matrix. We proceed under several mild assumptions related to the data distribution and the encoders \(f\) and \(h\).

**Assumption 1** (Data regularity).: _There exists some universal constant \(B>0\) such that, for any \(H\in\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\), we have \(\max\{\|H\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},y(H)\}\leq B\). In addition, a universal constant \(K_{y}>0\) ensures that \(y(H)\) is \(K_{y}\)-Lipschitz continuous for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) over \(H\in\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\)._

RemarkAssumption 1 is irrelevant to the Transformer model, and is only a fairly mild assumption on the data.

**Assumption 2** (Transformer particle growth bound).: _We assume that the gradient of \(f(T,\theta)\) and \(h(T,w)\) exists. Furthermore, we have_

1. \(\|f(T,\theta)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq K\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}(1+\|\theta\|+\| \theta\|^{2})\)_._
2. _For every_ \(i\in[N+1]\)_, we have_ \(\|\nabla_{\theta}f(T,\theta)_{:,i}\|_{2}\leq\phi_{P}(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}})( 1+\|\theta\|)\)_._
3. \(\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(T,\theta)]\|_{2}\leq\phi_{T}(N,D,\| T\|_{F})(1+\|\theta\|+\|\theta\|^{2})\)_._

_for some continuous, monotonically increasing functions \(\phi_{P},\phi_{T}\) for every coordinate, and a universal constant \(K>0\). Similarly, if we replace \(f\) with \(h\) and \(\theta\) with \(w\), the same conditions apply._

RemarkThere are three key observations for Assumption 2. Firstly, it incorporates the \(\|\cdot\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) norm, which is particularly useful for handling sequential inputs where each column represents a token. Secondly, as we consider higher-order multiplications between data and parameters, this assumption accommodates a broader range of self-attention encoders, such as the one in (2.3) with softmax or ReLU activation (where the derivative is defined as \(\mathrm{ReLU}^{\prime}(x)=\mathbf{1}\{x>0\}\)). Lastly, a particularly interesting and frontier question is identifying the function \(\phi_{T}\), and we have listed related literature in Appendix B.

**Assumption 3** (Locally Lipschitz continuous gradient in expectation).: _Besides Assumption 2, for any \(L_{T}>0\) and any \(L_{T}\)-Lipschitz continuous functions \(T_{1}=T_{1}(H)\) and \(T_{2}=T_{2}(H)\), for every \(i\in[N+1]\), we have_

\[i.\ \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|\nabla_{\theta}f(T_{1},\theta)_{:,i}-\nabla _{\theta}f(T_{2},\theta)_{:,i}\|_{2}\leq\phi_{PT}(\|\theta\|,K_{T},L_{T}) \sup_{H}\|T_{1}-T_{2}\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\] \[ii.\ \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(T_{1}, \theta)]-\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(T_{1},\theta^{\prime})]\|_{2} \leq\phi_{TP}(N,D,\sup_{H}\|T_{1}\|_{F},K_{P},L_{T})\|\theta-\theta^{\prime}\|\] \[iii.\ \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|\nabla_{\theta}f(T_{1},\theta)_{:,i}-\nabla _{\theta}f(T_{1},\theta^{\prime})_{:,i}\|_{2}\leq\phi_{PP}(K_{P},\sup_{H}\|T_{ 1}\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},L_{T})\|\theta-\theta^{\prime}\|,\] \[iv.\ \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(T_{1}, \theta)]-\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(T_{2},\theta)]\|_{2}\leq\phi_{ TT}(N,D,K_{T},\|\theta\|,L_{T})\sup_{H}\|T_{1}-T_{2}\|_{F}\]

_for \(K_{T}=\max\{\sup_{H}\|T_{1}\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\sup_{H}\|T_{2}\|_{2-\mathrm{ col}}\},K_{P}=\max\{\|\theta\|,\|\theta^{\prime}\|\}\), and some continuous functions \(\phi_{PT},\phi_{TP},\phi_{PP},\phi_{TT}\) that are monotonically increasing for every coordinate. Similarly, if we replace \(f\) with \(h\) and \(\theta\) with \(w\), the same conditions apply._RemarkAssumption 3 states that functions are locally Lipschitz continuous in expectation, suitable for encoders that utilize ReLU functions and have second-order derivatives almost everywhere. This assumption is naturally satisfied if the activation has a locally Lipschitz continuous gradient.

Define \(\mathcal{P}^{2}\) as the set of probability measures endowed with the Wasserstein-\(2\) distance, where the Lipschitz continuity with respect to the depth holds, i.e. there exists some universal constant \(C_{\rho}>0\) such that \(\|\rho(\cdot,t)-\rho(\cdot,t^{\prime})\|_{\mathrm{BL}}\leq C_{\rho}|t-t^{ \prime}|\) for any \(t,t^{\prime}\in[0,1]\).

Choice of \(\rho_{0}\)Suppose \(\rho_{0}\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) satisfies that for any \(t\in[0,1]\), the support of \(\rho_{0}(\cdot,\cdot,t)\) is contained within the set \(\{(\theta,w):\|\theta\|^{2}+\|w\|^{2}\leq R^{2}\}\) for a universal constant \(R\). Additionally, for each \(t\in[0,1]\), it holds that \(\int_{\theta,w}\rho_{0}(\theta,w,t)d(\theta,w)=1\). This condition suits common bounded support distributions, and a natural choice is a uniform distribution across a disk with radius \(R\) for each \(t\in[0,1]\).

We would like to clarify that verifying Assumptions 2 and 3 for concrete examples of Transformer architectures with smooth activation functions is fairly intuitive, and the proof is mainly based on a series of tedious calculations. We give a concrete proposition with its brief proof in Appendix G.

### Continuous Transformer and Wasserstein gradient flow

Drawing inspiration from [47] and [67], which suggest that deep residual networks behave like ensembles of residual networks locally, we apply a similar manipulation to formulate the continuous version of (2.4). Consider the following continuous version \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\), governed by the following continuous ODE that _averages the two encoders_:

\[\dot{T}_{\rho}(H,t)=\int_{\theta,w}\frac{f(T_{\rho}(H,t),\theta)+h(T_{\rho}(H, t),w)}{2}\rho(\theta,w,t)d(\theta,w),\quad T_{\rho}(H,0)=H\] (3.1)

In (3.1), each encoder \(f\) or \(h\) is conceptualized as a particle, and we consider the distribution of these particles denoted as \(\rho(\theta,w,t)\). For any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) that have a bounded support, the well-posedness of \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) that satisfies the Transformer ODE (3.1) is shown in Proposition C.1. Transitioning to the framework with continuous Transformers, our objective shifts to minimizing the \(l_{2}\) risk function with regularization on the second moment of \(\rho\) as follows:

\[Q(\rho)=R(\rho)+\frac{\lambda}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\theta,w}(\|\theta\|_{2}^{ 2}+\|w\|_{2}^{2})\rho(\theta,w,t)d(\theta,w)dt,\] (3.2)

with

\[R(\rho)=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\frac{1}{2}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)] -y(H)\Big{)}^{2}\Big{]}.\] (3.3)

Define \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\), the partial derivative of \(R(\rho)\) relative to \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) at a local query point \(H\), as the solution derived in Appendix C.4 using the classical adjoint sensitivity method [58]:

\[\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}=\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H) \Big{)}\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{ vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt]\Big{)}_{DN+d+1,:}.\]

Using this, we can compute the functional derivative to \(\rho\) as follows:

\[\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\theta,w,t)=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\mathrm{Tr} \Big{(}\Big{[}\frac{f(T_{\rho}(H,t),\theta)+h(T_{\rho}(H,t),w)}{2}\Big{]}^{ \top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\frac{\lambda}{2}(\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}+\|w\|_{ 2}^{2}).\] (3.4)

The following Proposition claims that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\) is indeed the derivative with respect to \(\rho\) (specifically, the Frechet derivative [30]) for the functional \(Q(\rho)\).

**Proposition 3.1** (Functional derivative to \(\rho\)).: _Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for any pair \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) that have bounded supports, we have_

\[Q(\rho+\eta(\nu-\rho))=Q(\rho)+\eta\big{(}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho},\nu-\rho \big{)}+o(\eta),\]

_where \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\) is defined in (3.4), and \((\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho},\nu-\rho)=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{(\theta,w)}\frac{ \delta Q}{\delta\rho}\cdot(\nu-\rho)d(\theta,w)dt\in\mathbb{R}\)._Now, we are in a position to display the gradient flow of \(\rho\) in the Wasserstein metric [16], given by a McKean-Vlasov type equation [4; 37; 54; 56]. Specifically, we study the following partial differential equation of the distribution \(\rho^{(\tau)}(\theta,w,t)\):

\[\begin{split}\frac{d\rho^{(\tau)}(\theta,w,t)}{d\tau}& =\operatorname{div}_{(\theta,w)}\Bigl{(}\rho^{(\tau)}\nabla_{( \theta,w)}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho=\rho^{(\tau)}}\Bigr{)}\\ &=\operatorname{div}_{\theta}\Bigl{(}\rho^{(\tau)}G_{f}(\theta, \rho^{(\tau)},t)\Bigr{)}+\operatorname{div}_{w}\Bigl{(}\rho^{(\tau)}G_{h}(w, \rho^{(\tau)},t)\Bigr{)},\end{split}\] (3.5)

where \(\rho^{(0)}=\rho_{0}\), \(\operatorname{div}\) is the divergence operator, and the gradient functions are defined as

\[\begin{split} G_{f}(\theta,\rho,t)&=\frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Bigl{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{Tr}\Bigl{(}f(T_{\rho}(H,t), \theta)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Bigr{)}\Bigr{]}+\lambda\theta,\\ G_{h}(w,\rho,t)&=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Bigl{[} \nabla_{w}\mathrm{Tr}\Bigl{(}h(T_{\rho}(H,t),w)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Bigr{)} \Bigr{]}+\lambda w.\end{split}\]

Propositions D.1 and 3.2 provide the well-posedness of both gradient flow and Wasserstein gradient flow respectively. In both propositions, a \(\lambda>0\) is essential to stabilize the optimization process by controlling both the maximum and average norms across all parameters. If \(\lambda\) is set to \(0\), it is only possible to establish the well-posedness of (3.5) over a finite maximal interval [47]. Similar adjustments to regularize the risk function are also noted in [23].

### Approximation of large-scale Transformer

In this section, we discuss the general results associated with approximating our discrete Transformer model to its mean-field limit. First, we highlight that the minimization of the risk function with discretization, whether or not regularization is included, closely approximates the minimal risk achievable by continuous models.

**Proposition 3.3** (Global minimum approximation of discretization).: _Under Assumptions 1 and 2, we define \(\mathcal{P}^{2,r}\) as the set of distributions in \(\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(\{(\theta,w):\|\theta\|^{2}+\|w\|^{2}\leq r^{2}\}\times[0,1]\), for any \(r>0\). Then there exists a constant \(C\) dependent on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions such that_

\[\begin{split}\inf_{\Theta}\widehat{R}(\Theta)&\leq \inf_{\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}}R(\rho)+C\Bigl{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{ M}}\Bigr{)},\\ \inf_{\Theta}\widehat{Q}(\Theta)&\leq\inf_{\rho\in \mathcal{P}^{2,r}}Q(\rho)+C(1+\lambda)\Bigl{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{ M}}\Bigr{)}.\end{split}\]

Proposition 3.3 specifies that the distributions under consideration must have bounded support. While it is typically challenging to confirm whether the minimal risk is indeed achieved on a distribution with bounded support, this assumption is justified as \(\lambda\) regulates parameter norms, implicitly encourages solutions residing in a compact region of the parameter space.

We now present the main theorem concerning the convergence of the gradient flow process to the Wasserstein gradient flow as outlined in (3.5). The proof with detailed explanation of the techniques used in Theorem 3.1 is provided in Appendix D.

**Theorem 3.1** (Gradient flow approximation of discretization).: _Define the empirical distribution as \(\hat{\rho}^{(\tau)}:=\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\delta(\theta_{t,j}^{( \tau)},w_{t,j}^{(\tau)},t)\) for any \(\tau\geq 0\). Under Assumptions 1-3, we _have that \((\hat{\rho}^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) weakly converges to \((\rho^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) almost surely along any sequence such that \(L\to\infty,M/\log L\to\infty\). Moreover, for any fixed \(\tau>0\) and any \(\delta>0\), with probability at least \(1-3\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\), we have_

1. \(\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\operatorname{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t)] -\operatorname{Read}[T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)]\lvert\leq C\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{ \frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\)__
2. \(\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(s)})-R(\rho^{(s)})\lvert\leq C \Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\)__
3. \(\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(s)})-Q(\rho^{(s)})\lvert\leq C \Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\)__

_for some constant \(C\) that depends on on \(N,D,\tau,\lambda\) and the parameters of the assumptions._

Theorem 3.1 significantly advances our understanding by controlling the difference regarding both the Transformer output, the risk function, and the regularized risk function. It's noted that the difference bound in the model's approximation may increase, possibly exponentially [22; 23; 51], as the time horizon extends. As argued in [51], such behavior may be inherent to the systems being modeled.

Additionally, the technical uniqueness and innovation of this theorem contrast sharply with previous results from overparametrized ResNet models. Our analysis distinguishes itself in two ways. First, our discrete Transformer model (2.4) uniquely splits the averaged encoder \((f+h)/2\) into two distinct blocks with encoders \(f\) and \(h\). Second, we demonstrate uniform error control over any finite time interval \([0,\tau]\), enabling continuous monitoring of maximum error across the gradient flow's trajectory. In contrast, models in prior studies such as [22; 23] restricts the error analysis to a specific \(s\in[0,\tau]\).

## 4 Global convergence of gradient flow

In this section, we explore the optimization problem for gradient flow in the context of the discrete Transformer model, focusing on our general global convergence results.

### An additional assumption

To ensure the global convergence of gradient flow for our discrete Transformer model, we introduce the following assumption. While influenced by the work in [16; 22; 23; 47], our assumption is uniquely tailored to the context of Transformers:

**Assumption 4**.: _There exists a pair \((g,\alpha)\in\{(f,\theta),(h,w)\}\) with a partition \(\alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\) such that_

1. _(Partial_ \(1\)_-homogeneity) for any_ \(T\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\) _and_ \(c\in\mathbb{R}\)_, we have_ \(g(T,c\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})=cf(T,\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\)_._
2. _(Universal kernel) a compact set_ \(\mathcal{K}\subset\mathbb{R}^{\dim(\alpha_{2})}\) _ensures that the span of_ \(\Big{\{}g(\cdot,\alpha):\alpha\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(\alpha_{1})}\times\mathcal{ K}\Big{\}}\) _is dense in_ \(\mathcal{C}(\lVert T\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B,\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)})\) _for any_ \(B>0\)_._

We emphasize that the universal kernel property, as discussed in [52], closely relates to the universal approximation abilities. Under our assumption, we require the universal approximation capabilities of _either_ the self-attention encoder or the feed-forward encoder. In Appendix G, we provide a concrete example of Transformer architectures and verify the validity of Assumption 4.

The universal kernel property of the feed-forward layer encoder \(h\) is well-established, particularly in two-layer neural network contexts [74]. Conversely, the universal approximation abilities of self-attention layers is a frontier research area, which, while not extensively covered in this paper, holds significant potential. Often labeled as "memorization capacity", this area is recently explored across multiple studies [27; 31; 38; 39; 49; 63; 73]. The interconnection between approximation abilities and memorization capacities is established in [38]. Notably, [49] investigated the expressive capabilities of one single multi-head softmax self-attention layer, thereby potentially validating our assumptions.

Finally, we posit that the universal kernel applies to \(\alpha_{2}\) within a compact set, as the function's scale can be moderated by the homogeneous part \(\alpha_{1}\). In scenarios where \(\alpha_{2}\) and \(\mathcal{K}\) are absent, our assumption simplifies to that in [47], characterized by complete homogeneity. Conversely, in the absence of the \(\alpha_{1}\) component, our framework aligns with [23] which necessitates a more stringent support condition for \(\mathcal{K}\), as detailed later in Theorem 4.1.

### Global convergence result

In this section, we establish the convergence properties of the optimization task for discrete Transformers through gradient flow dynamics.

**Theorem 4.1** (Global convergence up to \(\lambda\)).: _Suppose that Assumptions 1-4 hold, and the Wasserstein gradient flow \((\rho^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) weakly converges to some \(\rho_{\infty}\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\). If for some universal constant \(R_{\infty}>1\), the following two conditions hold:_

1. \((\rho^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) _is concentrated on_ \(\{\theta,w:\|\theta\|^{2}+\|w\|^{2}\leq R_{\infty}^{2}\}\times[0,1]\) _when_ \(\tau\) _is sufficiently large._
2. _If Assumption_ 4 _holds with_ \((g,\alpha)=(f,\theta)\)_, we assume there exists a_ \(t^{*}\in[0,1]\) _such that the connected set_ \(\operatorname{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t^{*}))\supset\mathcal{D}\times \mathcal{K}\times\{w_{0}\}\)_, for some_ \(w_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(w)}\) _and_ \(\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{\dim(\theta_{1})}\) _that separates_ \(\{\theta_{1}:\|\theta_{1}\|=1/R_{\infty}\}\) _and_ \(\{\theta_{1}:\|\theta_{1}\|=R_{\infty}\}\)_._
3. _If Assumption_ 4 _holds with_ \((g,\alpha)=(h,w)\)_, we assume there exists a_ \(t^{*}\in[0,1]\) _such that the connected set_ \(\operatorname{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t^{*}))\supset\times\{\theta_{0}\} \times\mathcal{K}\times\mathcal{D}\)_, for some_ \(\theta_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(\theta)}\) _and_ \(\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{\dim(w_{1})}\) _that separates_ \(\{w_{1}:\|w_{1}\|=1/R_{\infty}\}\) _and_ \(\{w_{1}:\|w_{1}\|=R_{\infty}\}\)_._

_Then, for any \(\epsilon>0\), there exists some \(\tau_{0}>0\) such that_

\[\sup_{\tau\geq\tau_{0}}\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq\epsilon+C_{1}\Big{(}L ^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}+C_{2}\lambda\]

_with probability at least \(1-3\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\) for any \(\delta>0\). Here, \(C_{1}\) is some constant dependent only on \(N,D,\tau_{0},\lambda\) and the parameters of the assumptions, while \(C_{2}\) depends only on \(N,D,R_{\infty}\) and the parameters of the assumptions._

Theorem 4.1 depicts the behavior of the risk function \(\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\) as the training duration \(\tau\) is sufficiently large. Specifically, \(\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\) asymptotically approaches zero as both \(L\to\infty\) and \(M/\log L\to\infty\), with an additional term that scales with \(\lambda\). This additional term attributes to the incorporation of a \(\lambda\)-weighted penalty on the norm of the parameters in our training objective \(\widehat{Q}\). Consequently, by selecting an appropriately small \(\lambda>0\), the risk approximates zero, demonstrating global convergence to the minimum of \(\widehat{R}\).

In addition, Theorem 4.1 posits some additional assumptions: the weak convergence of \(\rho^{(\tau)}\), the long-time uniform boundedness, and the separation property for \(\alpha_{1}\) with the support expansion of \(\alpha_{2}\) to \(\mathcal{K}\). Similar assumptions are made in the literature of deep model optimization theory [22, 23, 47]. While these types of assumptions are typically challenging to justify, we provide high-level justifications for them in Appendix C.5, deferring detailed verification to future research.

We then present a corollary that directly follows from Theorem 4.1:

**Corollary 4.1**.: _Continuing with the notations and assumptions from Theorem 4.1, suppose \(\lambda\leq C_{\lambda}\epsilon\) for some universal constant \(C_{\lambda}>0\). Then, for any \(\delta>0\), constants \(\tau_{0},L_{0},K_{0}>0\) can be found such that:_

\[\sup_{\tau\geq\tau_{0},L>L_{0},M/\log L>K_{0}}\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq (1/2+C_{2}C_{\lambda})\epsilon\] (4.1)

_with probability at least \(1-3\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\). Notably, if \(C_{\lambda}\leq(2C_{2})^{-\ell}\), the upper bound in (4.1) is less than or equal to \(\epsilon\)._

Corollary 4.1 claims that with a fixed \(\delta>0\), for any \(\epsilon>0\), we can achieve an order of \(\epsilon\)-close approximation with sufficiently large \(L\) and \(M\). Though our result is asymptotic and does not involve an explicit rate, it is the first of its kind and lays the groundwork for future theoretical optimization guarantees for Transformers.

Proof ideas of main theorems

Given the technical nature of this paper, this section presents the key ideas behind the proof of our main novel results, along with an outline of the proof preparation.

Idea for Theorem 3.1This convergence is described in two parts. First, the finite-time result (points (i)-(iii)) uses _propagation of chaos_[62] to analyze how differences evolve over time, comparing the evolution of parameter particles in discrete and continuous dynamics. The approximation bound is derived using a third auxiliary dynamic ("nonlinear dynamics"), involving the triangle inequality and Gronwall's inequality, which allows us to bound output differences over time.

Second, weak convergence of the empirical distribution process relies on optimal transport theory and stability results for Wasserstein gradient flows [4], focusing on the convergence of _momentum fields_[4, 60]. This also requires bounding the gradient differences between discrete and continuous Transformers as they approach the mean-field limit. See Appendix D for a detailed illustration, including a description of each main step.

Idea for Theorem 4.1We first establish the continuity of the functional gradient \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\big{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}\), ensuring it remains constant if the derivative with respect to \(\beta\) is constant over a region. Next, we derive the key bound for \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\), which is proportional to \(\lambda\), by analyzing the functional energy \(Q\)'s landscape through its derivatives.

Finally, we show that the finite-time risk can approach this bound. Achieving \(\epsilon\)-level loss requires \(Q(\rho^{(\tau_{0})})\leq\epsilon\) for some large \(\tau_{0}\). Applying Theorem 3.1, we show \(\widehat{Q}(\tau_{0})\) becomes sufficiently small, and since \(\widehat{Q}(\rho^{(\tau)})\) is non-increasing, it remains small for \(\tau\geq\tau_{0}\). See Appendix E for a detailed illustration, including a description of each main step.

Proof preparation for the main theoremsAppendix C.3 lists several useful lemmas essential to the main results. Specifically, Lemmas C.1-C.6 ensure the boundedness of key components and bound the output differences between discrete and continuous Transformers under different parameter settings. This boundedness is non-trivial due to the mild Assumptions 2 and 3 that fit the Transformer architecture. The technical lemmas in Appendix C.3 form the foundation for all subsequent proofs. Before introducing the nonlinear dynamics used to bound parameter differences under non-i.i.d. settings, these lemmas first establish an important oracle approximation bound result (Lemma D.6) with i.i.d. parameter settings. Additionally, they serve as key tools for bounding the (functional) gradient differences between Transformer dynamics, as shown in Lemmas D.1-D.3, which are essential for proving the approximation bound in Theorem 3.1.

In Theorem 4.1, Lemma E.1 plays a key role by demonstrating that for any \(\rho\), there is always a nearly descent direction around \(\rho\) for \(Q(\rho)\), implying that all local minima are nearly global. This motivates further landscape analysis for bounding \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\big{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}\) in the main theorem.

## 6 Conclusion

We conclude by summarizing our key contributions and suggesting future research directions. This paper establishes the global convergence of large-scale Transformer models through gradient flow dynamics, providing a thorough theoretical foundation. Our analysis, focused on the mean-field limit with infinite width and depth, shifts optimization from parameter space to distributional probability measures. We present two main theorems: one confirming the close approximation between discrete and continuous gradient flows, and another demonstrating global convergence, highlighting that basic optimization methods can successfully navigate complex landscapes to find optimal solutions. The techniques and results from this study lay the groundwork for further exploration into Transformer optimization. Future work could explore direct gradient descent with specific focus on step sizes, and expand on the in-context learning approximation capabilities of Transformers, as initiated by [6]. Additionally, it's crucial to rigorously assess under what conditions can self-attention layers serve as universal kernels to enhance our theoretical understanding, and to determine the generalization error bounds of Transformers trained on finite samples. These directions promise to deepen the theoretical and practical insights into Transformer models.

## Appendix B Additional related work

**Theory of Transformers.** Some very recent works have studied theoretical properties of Transformer models from different aspects. [75, 33] studied the in-context learning guarantees for single-layer Transformers to perform linear regression predictions after being trained with linear regression example tasks. [1, 6, 32] studied the in-context learning capability of Transformers through the function approximation point of view, and demonstrated that there exists Transformers with specific parameter configurations that can perform particular in-context learning tasks. [36, 45] investigated how single-layer Transformers can be trained to learn simple image models and topic models respectively.

The most closely related work to ours is [41], which is the only study we are aware of that addresses the general and universal in-context learning capability of large-scale Transformers through optimization dynamics. It shows that a two-layer MLP followed by a linear attention layer can approximate functions in a general Barron space sufficiently well as the Transformer width increases. Additionally, its corresponding mean-field dynamics, via Wasserstein gradient flow, converges to global minima for in-context feature learning. Another work exploring the mean-field limit of Transformers is [9], which examines the limit as the depth, key-query length, and number of heads increase to infinity.

In addition, we have noticed a lot of theoretical interest in identifying the optimal choice of \(\phi_{T}\) in Assumption 2, i.e., the Lipschitz constant of the Jacobian matrix of the self-attention term. For instance, [19] suggest that \(\phi_{T}\) can be bounded by \(\sqrt{N/D}+\mathrm{poly}(\|T\|_{F})\), where \(\mathrm{poly}(\cdot)\) denotes a polynomial function. In the context of \(l_{2}\) self-attention, [39] find \(\phi_{T}\) to be \(\sqrt{N\log N/D}\), which notably does not depend on \(\|T\|_{F}\), and [69] demonstrate that for \(l_{1}\) distance metrics in attention layers, \(\phi_{T}\) could be \(\sqrt{D\log N}\).

**Global convergence of fully connected neural networks.** A line of recent works have studied the global convergence of (stochastic) gradient descent in training overparameterized neural networks in the mean-field regime [16, 51, 50, 70, 28, 29]. They consider the limit of the neural network as the width of the network at each layer goes to infinity, and models the limit of the network as a functional of the distribution of network parameters. A separate line of works also established the global convergence guarantees for training overparameterized neural networks in the "neural tangent kernel" regime [35, 3, 25, 76, 17, 2, 5, 11], where the gradient descent training iterates are 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:17]

defined on \(\Omega\). For any \(\Theta=\{\beta_{t,j}\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]}\) and \(\widetilde{\Theta}=\{\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]}\), define \(d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})=\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\beta_{t,j}- \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\rVert\). Define the local risk function as

\[R(H;\rho)=\frac{1}{2}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}.\]

Define the nested family of compact subsets \((P_{r})_{r>0}\) as

\[P_{r}:=\{\beta:\lVert\beta\rVert\leq r\}\times[0,1],\quad\forall r>0.\]

For any \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\) and \(p\geq 1\), define the \(l_{p}\) distance \(\lVert\rho-\nu\rVert_{p}\) as

\[\lVert\rho-\nu\rVert_{p}=\Big{(}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lvert\rho(x)-\nu(x) \rvert^{p}d\beta dt\Big{)}^{1/p}.\]

Specifically, when \(p=1\), we have

\[W_{1}(\rho,\nu) =\sup\Big{\{}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}f(\rho-\nu)d\beta dt:f\ \mathrm{is}\,1-\mathrm{Lipschitz},\mathrm{f}(\bm{0},0)=0\Big{\}}\] \[\leq\sup\Big{\{}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lvert f\rvert\lvert \rho-\nu\rvert d\beta dt:f\ \mathrm{is}\,1-\mathrm{Lipschitz},\mathrm{f}(\bm{0},0)=0\Big{\}}\] \[\leq(r+1)\lVert\rho-\nu\rVert_{1}\]

for any \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\). For simplicity, any \(H\) discussed throughout this paper is assumed to lie within \(\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\).

### Transformer ODE existence and uniqueness

In this section, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the solution \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) to the ODE presented in (3.1) for any \(H\), given that \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) is concentrated on a bounded support, specifically, \(P_{r}\) for some \(r>0\). This following proposition forms the cornerstone of the subsequent technical analyses:

**Proposition C.1** (Existence and uniqueness of Transformer ODE).: _Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) that has a bounded support, there exists a unique solution of (3.1) on \(t\in[0,1]\) that is Lipschitz continuous with respect to \((H,t)\)._

Initially, we demonstrate that the integral \(\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\) is bounded. According to the definition \(\mathcal{P}^{2}\), it follows that

\[\lvert\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta-\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t^{\prime})d \beta\rvert\leq C_{\rho}\lvert t-t^{\prime}\rvert\]

for any \(t,t^{\prime}\in[0,1]\). Integrating (C.4) over \(t_{2}\in[0,1]\) obtains

\[\begin{split}\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta=& 1+\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta-\int_{0}^{1}\int_{ \beta}\rho(\beta,t^{\prime})d\beta dt^{\prime}\\ \leq& 1+C_{\rho}\int_{0}^{1}\lvert t-t^{\prime} \rvert dt^{\prime}\\ \leq& 1+C_{\rho}/2.\end{split}\] (C.5)

For the remainder of the technical proof, we will employ (C.5) without additional elaboration.

Proof of Proposition c.1.: **Step I: Create a small neighboring area with local Lipschitz continuity** Consider any vector \(\beta\) such that \(\lVert\beta\rVert\leq r\). Define \(F(T,t):=\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\). For \(T\) within the rectangle \(\{T:\lVert T-H\rVert_{\max}\leq\delta\}\), where \(\delta>0\) is bounded, both \(\lVert T\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) and \(\lVert T\rVert_{F}\) are also bounded. Given Assumption 2 (i), \(g(T,\beta)\) is universally bounded by some constant \(K_{\delta,r}\). Moreover,under Assumption 2 (ii) and (iii), \(g(T,\beta)\) is Lipschitz continuity with some constant \(L_{\delta,r}\). Hence, within the rectangle \(\{T:\|T-H\|_{\max}\leq\delta\}\times[0,1]\) the following properties hold:

\[|F(T,t_{1})-F(T,t_{2})|\leq\max\{K_{\delta,r},L_{\delta,r}\}\|\rho(\cdot,t_{1})- \rho(\cdot,t_{2})\|_{\rm BL}\leq C_{\rho}\max\{K_{\delta,r},L_{\delta,r}\}|t_{ 1}-t_{2}|.\] (C.6)

which indicates that \(F(T,t)\) is continuous with respect to \(t\) within the rectangle \(\{T:\|T-H\|_{\max}\leq\delta\}\times[0,1]\).

Moreover, within the bounded region \(\{T:\|T-H\|_{\max}\leq\delta\}\), Assumption 2 (iii) ensures that \(\|\nabla_{\rm vec[T]}{\rm vec}[g(T,\beta)]\|_{2}\) bounded. Consequently, \(g(T,\beta)\) is Lipschitz-continuous with respect to \(T\) for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\). Denote this Lipschitz constant by \(L^{\prime}_{\delta,r}\). Therefore, for any \(T,T^{\prime}\in\{T:\|T-H\|_{\max}\leq\delta\}\) and \(t\in[0,1]\), it follows that

\[|F(T,t)-F(T^{\prime},t)|\leq L^{\prime}_{\delta,r}\|T-T^{\prime}\|_{F}\int_{ \beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\leq L^{\prime}_{\delta,r}(1+C_{\rho}/2)\|T-T^{ \prime}\|_{F},\] (C.7)

which deduces the Lipschitz continuity of \(F(T,t)\) with respect to \(T\) for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\).

**Step II: Show that the maximal existence interval is infinite by repeatedly using the Picard-Lindelof Theorem**

Invoking the Picard-Lindelof Theorem, there exists some \(\epsilon>0\) such that the initial value problem

\[\dot{T}(H,t)=F(T,t),\quad T(H,0)=H\]

has a unique solution on \(t\in[0,\epsilon]\). Given that this claim holds for any \(H\), the standard ODE Extensibility Theorem guarantees a continuation of \(T(t)\) to a maximal interval of existence, denoted as \([0,t_{\max}]\).

Assume by contradiction that \(t_{\max}<1\). From (3.1) and Assumption 2(i), for any \(t\in[0,t_{\max}]\) we see that

\[\frac{d}{dt}\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{\rm 2-col}\leq\|\dot{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{ \rm 2-col} =\|\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\|_{\rm 2-col}\] \[\leq\int_{\beta}\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{\rm 2-col}\rho(\beta,t )d\beta\] \[\leq\int_{\beta}K(1+||\beta||_{\rm 2}+||\beta||_{\rm 2}^{2})\rho( \beta,t)\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{\rm 2-col}d\beta.\]

Therefore, by the Gronwall's inequality, we have

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t_{\max})\|_{\rm 2-col} \leq\|T_{\rho}(H,0)\|_{\rm 2-col}\exp(\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{ \beta}K(1+||\beta||_{\rm 2}+||\beta||_{\rm 2}^{2})\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds)\] \[\leq\|H\|_{\rm 2-col}\exp(K(1+C_{\rho}/2+r+r^{2})t_{\max})<\infty.\]

This presents a contradiction to the notion that \(t_{\max}<1\). This is because, By reapplying the local Picard-Lindelof Theorem using the state \(T(H,t_{\max})\) as the new initial condition, we can extend the interval of existence beyond \(t_{\max}\). Consequently, we must conclude that \(t_{\max}=1\), and the existence and uniqueness follows.

**Step III: Show that the Lipschitz continuity with respect to \((H,t)\)**

In the final part of our proof, we demonstrate that \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to \((H,t)\) for \(H\in{\rm supp}(\mu)\) and any \(t\in[0,1]\). Given that \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) is universally bounded within \(H\in{\rm supp}(\mu)\) and any \(t\in[0,1]\), we only need to focus on establishing its Lipschitz continuity with respect to \(H\) and \(t\) separately. The Lipschitz continuity with respect to \(t\) is derived from

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t_{1})-T_{\rho}(H,t_{2})\|_{\rm 2-col}\leq\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\int_{ \beta}\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta\|_{\rm 2-col}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\leq(1+C_{\rho}/2)KC(1+r+r^{2})( t_{2}-t_{1}),\] (C.9)for any \(t_{1},t_{2}\in[0,1]\). Given Assumption 2 (iii), we have

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)\|_{F}\leq\int_{0}^{\top}\int_ {\beta}\lVert g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)-g(T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},s),\beta)\rVert_{F} \rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\\ \leq\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}\phi_{T}(N,D,B\exp(K(1+C_{\rho}/2+ r+r^{2})))(1+r+r^{2})\|T_{\rho}(H,s)-T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},s)\|_{F}\rho(\beta,s)d \beta ds\] (C.10)

for any \(H,H^{\prime}\in\operatorname{supp}(\mu)\). Define \(L_{H}:=\phi_{T}(N,D,B\exp(K(1+C_{\rho}/2+r+r^{2})))(1+r+r^{2})\). Utilizing Gronwall's inequality, we establish:

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)\|_{F}\leq\|H-H^{\prime}\|_{F}\exp(L_{H} \int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds)=\exp(L_{H})\|H-H^{\prime}\|_ {F}\]

given that \(T_{\rho}(\cdot,0)\) serves as the identity mapping. Consequently, \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) demonstrates Lipschitz continuity with respect to \(H\in\operatorname{supp}(\mu)\).

Then, we have that_

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq C_ {r}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}).\]

\[\sup_{(\theta,t)\in P_{r}}\max\{\lVert f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H, t),\theta)\rVert_{F},\lVert h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w)\rVert_{F},\lVert g( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta)\rVert_{F}\}\leq\sqrt{N+1}KB_{T}(1+r+r^{2}),\] \[\sup_{(\theta,t)\in P_{r}}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\max\{\left\lVert \nabla_{\theta}f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta)_{:,i}\right\rVert,\left\lVert \nabla_{w}h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w)_{:,i}\right\rVert,\left\lVert\nabla_ {\beta}g(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\right\rVert\}\leq\phi_{P}(B_{ T})(1+r),\] \[\sup_{(\theta,t)\in P_{r}}\lVert\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_ {F}\leq(B+B_{T})\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB_{T})(1+A+A^{2})\Big{)},\]

### Solution of adjoint ODE

In this section, we define the partial derivative

\[p_{\rho}(H,t):=\frac{\partial R(H;\rho)}{\partial T_{\rho}(H,t)^{\top}}\in \mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\]

without specifying its explicit formula. Denote the derivative of \(T_{\rho}(H,1)\) to \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) (after vectorization) by the Jacobian \(J_{\rho}(H,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{(N+1)D\times(N+1)D}\), and assume that \(\dot{J}\rho(H,t)\) exists for any \(t\in[0,1]\). Then [58] shows that \(J_{\rho}(H,t)\) satisfies the adjoint equation of the ODE.

\[\dot{J}_{\rho}(H,t)=-J_{\rho}(H,t)\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\Big{\{}\mathrm{vec }[\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta,t)d\beta]\Big{\}}\] (C.11)

for any \(t\in[0,1]\). By applying the chain rule and exchanging the order of the derivative and integral, we have, for any \(t\in[0,1]\), that

\[\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top} =\frac{\partial R(H;\rho)}{\partial\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]} \frac{\partial\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]}{\partial\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho}(H,t)]}\] \[=\mathrm{vec}[\frac{\partial R(H;\rho)}{\partial T_{\rho}(H,1)^{ \top}}]^{\top}\frac{\partial\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]}{\partial\mathrm{vec}[ T_{\rho}(H,t)]}\] \[=\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,1)]^{\top}J_{\rho}(H,t)\]Hence, by taking the derivative with respect to \(t\), we obtain that

\[\mathrm{vec}[\hat{p}_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}=-\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}\int _{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta, t)d\beta\]

with the solution

\[\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}=\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,1)]^{\top}\exp \Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho} (H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}.\] (C.12)

On the other hand, we have

\[p_{\rho}(H,1)=\frac{\partial R(H;\rho)}{\partial T_{\rho}(H,1)}=(\mathrm{Read}[ T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H))E_{\mathrm{read}},\] (C.13)

where \(E_{\mathrm{read}}\) is a \(D\times(N+1)\) zero matrix except \(1\) at the \((d+1,N+1)-\)th entry. Moreover, from (C.12) and (C.13), we see that

\[\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}=(\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H))\cdot \mathrm{exp}\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{ vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}_{DN+d+1,:}.\] (C.14)

Additionally, we could explicitly derive the formula for \(\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)=\frac{\partial\widehat{R}(H;\Theta)}{\partial T_{ \Theta}(H,t)}\) for the discrete Transformer. By applying the chain rule multiple times across each layer with the encoder either \(f\) or \(h\), for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\), we have

\[\mathrm{vec}[\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)]=(\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T }_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H))\] \[\Big{\{}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/ \Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta _{s,j})]\Big{)}\] \[\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t /2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\Big{\}}_{DN+d+1,:},\]

and

\[\mathrm{vec}[\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)]=(\mathrm{Read}[ \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H))\] \[\Big{\{}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/ \Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta _{s,j})]\Big{)}\] \[\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t /2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\Big{\}}_{DN+d+1,:}.\]

### Explanation for assumptions made in Theorem 4.1

The justification of the two assumptions outlined in Theorem 4 warrants careful consideration. While we provide only high-level justifications, they underpin significant aspects of our theoretical framework.

For the first assumption, we argue that the regularization parameter \(\lambda\), which penalizes the magnitude of the parameter norms, implicitly promotes solutions that are confined to a compact subset of the parameter space. This rationale is conceptual and requires that regularization effectively constrains the growth of the parameter norms, thereby localizing the solutions.

The second assumption concerns the separation property. It is naturally satisfied as long as the origin \(0_{\mathrm{dim}\theta+\mathrm{dim}w}\) remains an interior point of \(\mathrm{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t))\). This condition is relatively mild and is generally satisfied. The challenge arises in verifying that \(\operatorname{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t))\) for the \(\alpha_{2}\) component extends to encompass the entire space \(\mathcal{K}\). While direct confirmation is elusive, it is suggested by [23] initially spans \(\mathcal{K}\), this expansive support property is maintained at any finite time. Thus, we conjecture that the condition holds under these circumstances, providing a basis for this assumption.

## Appendix D Proofs of main results in Section 3

### Proof of Theorem 3.1

This convergence is detailed in two parts. First, the finite time result, as stated in points (i)-(iii), utilizes a concept in probability theory known as _propagation of chaos_[62] to examine how differences evolve uniformly across a given time interval. In the context of our model, this involves comparing how parameter particles evolve under discrete versus continuous dynamics.

Specifically, the approximation bound is derived using a third auxiliary dynamic, termed the "nonlinear dynamics," by bounding the dynamic difference over the entire finite time interval. This process involves applying the triangle inequality to each component and concluding with a Gronwall's inequality. Since the Transformer output can be bounded by the dynamic difference, we can then bound the output difference at any specific time, along with the difference regarding different time for the same dynamic. By applying a probability union bound on a dense set of \(L^{2}\) points, we can extend this to bound the maximal difference over any time interval.

Secondly, the weak convergence of the empirical distribution process leverages optimal transport theory alongside abstract stability results for Wasserstein gradient flows [4]. This argument involves detailed analysis of the discretization of particle distributions in space, particularly focusing on obtaining the convergence of the sequence of _momentum fields_[4, 60] that could directly leads to the result. To obtain the convergence of the momentum field sequence, we also need to bound the parameter gradient difference between discrete and continuous Transformers as the mean-field limit.

**Preparatory Step: Nonlinear dynamics**

We first define some auxiliary quantities and differential equations that are useful for the proof. For any gradient flow parameter setting \(\Theta^{(\tau)}=\{\beta^{(\tau)}_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\), from its definition (2.7), we could rewrite the dynamics as

\[\beta^{(\tau)}_{t,j}=\beta^{(0)}-\int_{0}^{\tau}\widehat{G}(\beta^{(s)}_{t,j},\Theta^{(s)},t)ds\] (D.1)

for any gradient flow time \(\tau>0\), depth index \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\) and width index \(j=1,\ldots,M\). For simplicity, any mentioned constant only depends on \(N,D,\tau,\lambda\) and the parameters of the assumptions, and we abbreviate the subscript \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,\;j=1,\ldots,M\) by \(t,j\) throughout the proof.

Inspired by the "propagation of chaos" idea [62], we could define the "nonlinear dynamics" with the same initialization setting \(\widehat{\Theta}^{(\tau)}=\{\widetilde{\beta}^{(\tau)}_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\), i.e.

\[\begin{cases}&\widetilde{\beta}^{(\tau)}_{t,j}=\widetilde{\beta}^{(0)}-\int _{0}^{\tau}G(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j},\rho^{(s)},t)ds,\\ &\widetilde{\beta}^{(0)}_{t,j}=\beta^{(0)}_{t,j}\end{cases}\] (D.2)

for any \(t,j\). Here, \((\rho^{(s)})_{s\geq 0}\) is the solution to the Wasserstein gradient flow (3.5), of which the uniqueness is implied by Proposition 3.2. Since (D.2) is just the particle flow of (3.5), its existence and uniqueness are guaranteed by Proposition 3.2.

Observing that \(\{\beta_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\) are independent due to the dynamics only involving \((\rho^{(s)})_{s\geq 0}\) with i.i.d initialization over \(\rho_{0}\), we can consider \(\{\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\) as i.i.d. samples drawn from \(\{\rho^{(s)}\}_{t,j}\). In addition, from Propositions 3.2 and D.1, for any \(t,j\) we have \(\max\{\|\beta_{t,j}\|,\|\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\|\}\leq R_{\tau}\), where \(R_{\tau}\) is defined as in these propositions and does not depend on \(M\) and \(L\).

**Preparatory Step: Bound the gradient difference regarding parameter settings**

As the second preparatory step for the proof of Theorem 3.1, we present the following three lemmas that will be helpful:

**Lemma D.1** (Continuous gradient difference bound).: _Suppose Assumptions 1-3 hold. If we have \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\) for some \(r>0\), and \(\beta,\widetilde{\beta}\) such that \(\max\{\|\beta\|,\|\widetilde{\beta}\|\}\leq r\), then_

\[\Big{\|}G(\beta,\rho,t)-G(\widetilde{\beta},\nu,t)\Big{\|}\leq C_{G}\Big{(} \exp(C_{G}W_{1}(\rho,\nu))-1+(1+\lambda)\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\Big{)}.\]

_for any \(t\in[0,1]\). Here, the constant \(C_{G}\) only depends on \(N,D,r\), and the parameters of the assumptions._

**Lemma D.2** (Discrete gradient difference bound).: _Under Assumption 1-3, for any \(\Theta=\{\beta_{t,j}\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]},\widetilde{\Theta}=\{ \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]}\) such that \(\max\{\|\beta_{t,j}\|,\|\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\|\}\leq r\) for any \(t=0,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,\;j=1,\ldots,M\). Then we have that_

\[\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta},\widetilde{ \Theta},t)\|\leq C_{G}\Big{(}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})+(1+ \lambda)\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\Big{)}.\]

_for any \(\beta,\widetilde{\beta}\in\{\beta:\|\beta\|\leq r\}\) and \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\). Here, the constant \(C_{G}\) only depends on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions and \(d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\) is defined as \(\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\|\beta_{t,j}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\|\)._

**Lemma D.3** (Oracle gradient approximation with discretization).: _Under Assumptions 1-3, suppose that the parameter setting \(\Theta\) is i.i.d. drawn from \(\{\rho(\beta|t)\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]}\) for some \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\) and satisfies that \(\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta=1\) for any \(t\in[0,1]\). Then with probability at least \(1-4\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\), we have_

\[\Big{\|}\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-G(\beta,\rho,t)\Big{\|} \lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}},\] \[\|G(\beta,\hat{\rho},t)-G(\beta,\rho,t)\| \lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}},\] \[\Big{\|}\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-G(\beta,\hat{\rho},t)\Big{\|} \lesssim L^{-1}\]

_for any \(\beta\in\{\beta:\|\beta\|\leq r\}\), \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\) and any \(\delta>0\). Here, \(\lesssim\) hides the dependencies on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions._

Proof of Theorem 3.1.: Our proof consists of several steps outlined below:

**Step I: Show the \(W_{2}\) continuity of parameter (sample) distributions**

Our analysis commences with the bound for \(0<s_{1}<s_{2}<\tau\), we have

\[W_{2}(\hat{\rho}^{(s_{1})},\hat{\rho}^{(s_{2})})^{2}\leq\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t} \sum_{j=1}^{M}\lvert\beta_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}-\beta_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}\rvert^{2} \leq\frac{(s_{2}-s_{1})}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}\lVert \widehat{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(s)},\Theta^{(s)},t)\rVert^{2}ds,\]

where each particle at time \(s_{1}\) is paired with its position at time \(s_{2}\), leveraging the Jensen's inequality.

Recalling the identity

\[\frac{d\widehat{G}(\Theta^{(s)})}{ds}=\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert \widehat{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(s)},\Theta^{(s)},t)\rVert^{2}\]

shown in Proposition D.1, it follows that

\[W_{2}(\hat{\rho}^{(s_{1})},\hat{\rho}^{(s_{2})})\leq(s_{2}-s_{1})^{1/2} \widehat{Q}^{1/2}(\Theta^{(0)})\leq\frac{\lambda}{2}A_{0}^{2},\]

where the last inequality uses (D.30). Since \(A_{0}^{2}\lesssim 1+\lambda^{-1}\), we see that \(W_{2}(\hat{\rho}^{(s_{1})},\hat{\rho}^{(s_{2})})\leq C(1+\lambda)(s_{2}-s_{1}) ^{1/2}\) for some constant \(C\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Similarly, we have

\[W_{2}(\rho^{(s_{1})},\rho^{(s_{2})})^{2}\leq\mathbb{E}\left\lVert\widetilde{ \beta}^{(s_{2})}-\widetilde{\beta}^{(s_{1})}\right\rVert^{2}\leq(s_{2}-s_{1}) \int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\|}G(\beta,\rho^{(s)},t) \Big{\|}^{2}\,d\beta dtds\leq(s_{2}-s_{1})Q(\rho_{0})\lesssim(s_{2}-s_{1})C(1+\lambda)\]

where \(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s_{1})}\sim\rho^{(s_{1})}(\beta,t)\) is embedded with its future position at \(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s_{2})}\). The last step is feasible by setting \(C\) large enough, noticing that \(Q(\rho_{0})\leq\lambda A_{0}^{2}/2\). To summarize, we have

\[\max\Big{\{}W_{2}(\hat{\rho}^{(s_{1})},\hat{\rho}^{(s_{2})}),W_{2}(\rho^{(s_{1} )},\rho^{(s_{2})})\Big{\}}\leq C(1+\lambda)\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\] (D.3)for some constant \(C>0\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result.

**Step II: Bound the difference between gradient flow dynamics and non-linear dynamics**

Next, we aim to bound \(\Delta(s):=\sup_{s^{\prime}\in[0,s]}\sup_{t,j}\lVert\beta_{t,j}^{(s^{\prime})}- \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s^{\prime})}\rVert\) for any \(s\in[0,\tau]\). Taking the difference of (D.1) and (D.2), we obtain that

\[\begin{split}\lVert\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^ {(\tau)}\rVert\leq&\int_{0}^{\tau}\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(s)},\Theta^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\rho^{(s)},t)\right \rVert ds\\ \leq&\int_{0}^{\tau}\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(s)},\Theta^{(s)},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde {\Theta}^{(s)},t)\right\rVert ds\\ +&\int_{0}^{\tau}\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{ \beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s )},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\rVert ds\\ \leq& C_{G}\int_{0}^{\tau}\Big{(}\frac{1}{ML}d( \Theta^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)})+(1+\lambda)\lVert\beta^{(s)}- \widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}\rVert\Big{)}ds+\int_{0}^{\tau}\left\lVert\widehat{G}( \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta }_{t,j}^{(s)},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\rVert ds\\ \leq& C_{G}\int_{0}^{\tau}\Big{(}\frac{1}{ML}d( \Theta^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)})+(1+\lambda)\lVert\beta^{(s)}- \widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}\rVert\Big{)}ds+\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\left\lVert\widehat{ G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s )},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\rVert\end{split}\] (D.4)

where the final inequality stems from Lemma D.2, employing a constant \(C_{G}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. By taking the supremacy over \(t,j\) in (D.4), and considering \(\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)})\leq\sup_{t,j}\lVert \beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\rVert\) for any \(s\geq 0\), we derive

\[\sup_{t,j}\lVert\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\rVert \leq C_{G}(2+\lambda)\int_{0}^{\tau}\sup_{t,j}\lVert\beta^{(s)}- \widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}\rVert ds+\sup_{t,j}\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\left\lVert \widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G( \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\rVert\]

Further supremacy taken over \(s\in[0,\tau]\) yields:

\[\Delta(\tau)\leq\widetilde{\Delta}(\tau)+C_{G}(2+\lambda)\int_{0}^{\tau}\Delta (s)ds,\] (D.5)

where we define \(\widetilde{\Delta}(\tau):=\sup_{t,j}\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\left\lVert\widehat{G} (\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta }_{t,j}^{(s)},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\rVert\) for simplicity of notation. Apply the Gronwall's inequality to (D.5) yields

\[\Delta(\tau)\leq\exp\Big{(}C_{G}(2+\lambda)\tau\Big{)}\widetilde{\Delta}(\tau).\] (D.6)

It remains to bound \(\widetilde{\Delta}(\tau)\) to bound \(\Delta(\tau)\). It's worth noting that by Lemmas D.1 and D.2, for any \(s_{1},s_{2}\in[0,\tau]\) and \(t,j\), we have

\[\begin{split}&\left\lVert\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{ \beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2})},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t, j}^{(s_{2})},\rho^{(s_{2})},t)\right\rVert-\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{ \beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})},\rho^{(s_{1})},t)\right\rVert\Big{|}\\ \leq&\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^ {(s_{1})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^ {(s_{2})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2})},t)\right\rVert+\left\lVert G(\widetilde{ \beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})},\rho^{(s_{1})},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}, \rho^{(s_{2})},t)\right\rVert\\ \leq& C_{\Delta}(\exp(C_{\Delta}W_{1}(\rho^{(s_{1})}, \rho^{(s_{2})}))-1)+C_{\Delta}\frac{1}{ML}d(\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})}, \widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2})})+C_{\Delta}(1+\lambda)\lVert\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}\rVert\\ \lesssim&\exp(C_{\Delta}C\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}})-1+(1+ \lambda)\sup_{t,j}\lVert\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}\rVert\\ \lesssim&\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}+\sup_{t,j}\lVert \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}\rVert\end{split}\] (D.7)

for some constant \(C_{\Delta}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Moreover, for any \(t,j\), we have

\[\lVert\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})}\rVert \leq\int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}\lVert G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{ \Theta}^{(s)},t)\rVert\leq\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\int_{s_{1}}^{s_{2}}\lVert G( \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)\rVert^{2}\lesssim(1+ \lambda^{2})\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}},\] (D.8)

where the universal boundedness of \(\lVert G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-\lambda \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)}\rVert\) can be readily derived from the third result of Lemma C.3 alongside Assumption 2 (i). Therefore, we obtain

\[\begin{split}\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{ 2})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2})},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{2})},\rho^{ (s_{2})},t)\right\rVert-\left\lVert\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{ 1})},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s_{1})}, \rho^{(s_{1})},t)\right\rVert\lesssim(1+\lambda+\lambda^{2}+\lambda^{3})\sqrt{s _{2}-s_{1}}\end{split}\] (D.9)for any \(s_{1},s_{2}\in[0,\tau]\).

Define \(\tau_{n}=n\tau/L^{2}\) for \(n=1,2,\ldots,L^{2}\). Leveraging Lemma D.3 and applying the union bound over \(n\in[L^{2}]\) (updating the \(\delta\) in the lemma to \(\delta+2\log L\)), we obtain, with a probability of at least \(1-\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\):

\[\sup_{s\in\{\tau_{n}\}_{n\in[L^{2}]}}\left\|\widehat{G}(\widetilde {\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\|\lesssim (1+\lambda+\lambda^{2}+\lambda^{3})L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+ \log L+\log(L+1)}{M}}\] \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\]

Furthermore, leveraging (D.9), we deduce

\[\sup_{t,j}\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\left\|\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta }^{(s)}_{t,j},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j}, \rho^{(s)},t)\right\|\lesssim \sup_{t,j}\sup_{s\in\{\tau_{n}\}_{n\in[L^{2}]}}\left\|\widehat{G }(\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j},\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)},t)-G(\widetilde{ \beta}^{(s)}_{t,j},\rho^{(s)},t)\right\|\] \[+ \sup_{|s_{1}-s_{2}|\leq\tau/L^{2}}(1+\lambda+\lambda^{2}+\lambda^ {3})\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\] \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

Returning to (D.6), we establish that with a probability of at least \(1-\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\),

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\sup_{t,j}\|\beta^{(s)}_{t,j}-\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j }\|=\Delta(\tau)\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

We denote the event where the above inequality holds as \(E_{1}\), thus we have \(\mathbb{P}(E_{1})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\).

**Step III: Prove the finite time results**

Now, we are poised to demonstrate the results in Theorem 3.1 that concern supremacy over \(s\in[0,\tau]\). The verification of Lemmas C.4 reveals the existence of a universal constant \(B_{\tau}:=B\exp(K(1+R_{\tau}+R_{\tau}^{2}))\) such that

\[\max\{\|T_{\rho^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{( \tau)}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\}\leq B_{\tau}\]

for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\).

Utilizing Lemma D.6 and applying the union bound over \(n\in[L^{2}]\), we observe

\[\sup_{s\in\{\tau_{n}\}_{n\in[L^{2}]}}\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)}} (H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M }}.\]

Additionally, note that for any \(s_{1},s_{2}\in[0,\tau]\), we derive from Lemmas C.2 and C.5 that

\[\begin{split}&\left\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})}} (H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s_{1})}}(H,t)\|_{F}-\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2} )}}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s_{2})}}(H,t)\|_{F}\right|\\ \leq&\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{1})}} (H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s_{2})}}(H,t)\|_{F}+\|T_{\rho^{(s_{1}) }}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s_{2})}}(H,t)\|_{F}\\ \lesssim&\sup_{t,j}\|\widetilde{\beta}^{(s_{1})}_{t,j}-\widetilde{\beta}^{(s_{2})}_{t,j}\|+W_{1}(\rho^{(s_{1})},\rho^{(s_{2})})\\ \lesssim&\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\end{split}\] (D.10)

where the last inequality is derived utilizing (D.3) and (D.8). Consequently, we have

\[\begin{split}\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{ \Theta}^{(s)}}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim&\sup_{s\in \{\tau_{n}\}_{n\in[L^{2}]}}\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)}}(H,t)-T_{ \rho^{(s)}}(H,t)\|_{F}+\sup_{|s_{2}-s_{1}|\leq\tau/L^{2}}\sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\\ \lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\end{split}\] (D.11)

with probability at by \(1-\exp(-\delta)\). We denote the event where the above inequality holds as \(E_{2}\), thus we have \(\mathbb{P}(E_{2})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\). Considering that \(\{\widetilde{\beta}^{(s)}_{t,j}\}_{t,j}\) could be regarded as i.i.d. samplesdrawn from \(\{\rho^{(s)}\}_{t,j}\), employing a similar method with the concentration guarantee from Lemma C.7, we can readily deduce the existence of an event \(E_{3}\) with \(\mathbb{P}(E_{3})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\) such that, under \(E_{3}\), we have

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}|\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\widetilde{\beta}_{ t,j}^{(s)}\rVert^{2}-\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho^{(s)}( \beta,t)d\beta dt|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

Now, let's analyze the scenario under the probability event \(E_{1}\cap E_{2}\cap E_{3}\) with \(\mathbb{P}(E_{1}\cap E_{2}\cap E_{3})\geq 1-3\exp(-\delta)\). Lemma C.5 demonstrates that

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}|\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t )]-\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)}}(H,t)]|\leq\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^ {(s)}}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] (D.12) \[\lesssim \sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\sup_{t,j}\lVert\beta_{t,j}^{(s)}-\widetilde{ \beta}_{t,j}^{(s)}\rVert\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

This further implies, by (D.11), that

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}|\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t )]-\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)]|\] (D.13) \[\leq \sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}|\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t )]-\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)}}(H,t)]|+\sup_{s\in[0, \tau]}\lVert\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}^{(s)}}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t) \rVert_{F}\] \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}},\]

Since \(\max\{\lVert T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}},\lVert\widehat{T}_{ \Theta^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}},\lVert\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{ \Theta}^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\}\) is universally bounded, (D.13) immediately indicates that

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(s)})-R(\rho^{(s)})\rvert \lesssim\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}|\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(s)}}(H,t)]- \mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho^{(s)}}(H,t)]|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1) }{M}},\] (D.14)

and

\[\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(s)})-Q(\rho^{(s)})\rvert \leq\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(s)})-R(\rho^{(s )})\rvert+\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\lvert\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert \widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}^{(s)}\rVert^{2}-\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta \rVert^{2}\rho^{(s)}(\beta,t)d\beta dt\rvert\] (D.15) \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

**Step IV: Prove the weakly convergence**

For the remainder of the proof, we adopt a similar approach as in the proof of Theorem 2.6 in [16]. We denote \(\hat{\rho}\) as \(\hat{\rho}_{M,L}\) for any given \(M\) and \(L\). It's essential to note that we treat \(\hat{\rho}_{M,L}\) as probability measures in this step of the proof.

Recalling (D.3), for any \(s_{1},s_{2}\in[0,\tau]\), we have

\[W_{2}(\hat{\rho}_{M,L}^{(s_{1})},\hat{\rho}_{M,L}^{(s_{2})})\leq C(1+\lambda) \sqrt{s_{2}-s_{1}}\]

for some constant \(C\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. We observe that the family of curves \((s\mapsto\hat{\rho}_{M,L}^{(s)})_{M,L}\) is equicontinuous in \(W_{2}\) on \([0,\tau]\), uniformly in \(M,L\). Additionally, the family \((\hat{\rho}_{M,L})_{M,L}\) lies within a \(W_{2}\) ball, thus weakly precompact. As the weak topology is weaker than the topology induced by \(W_{2}\), according to the Arzela-Ascoli theorem, along any sequence where \(L\to\infty\) and \(\log L/M\to\infty\), we can identify a subsequence that converges weakly to a certain process \((\nu^{(s)})_{s\geq 0}\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\times\mathbb{R}\), concentrated on \(P_{R_{r}}\) at all times. In the subsequent analysis, we solely focus on this subsequence, still denoted as \((\hat{\rho}_{M,L})_{M,L}\).

For any \(t\in[0,1]\), let's define the sequence \((E_{M,L}^{\top})_{M,L}\) of momentum fields, which is a vector-valued measure on \([0,\tau]\times\Omega\), denoted by \(E_{M,L}:=\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta_{M,L}^{(s)},t)\hat{\rho}^{(s)}(\beta,t)ds\). We also define \(E:=G(\beta,\nu^{(s)},t)\nu^{(s)}(\beta,t)ds\).

Considering that both \(\hat{\rho}_{M,L}\) and \(\nu\) are concentrated on \(P_{R_{\tau}}\), we also have uniform convergence in the Bounded Lipschitz metric. Hence, for any bounded and Lipschitz function \(\varphi:[0,\tau]\times\mathbb{R}^{\dim\beta}\to\mathbb{R}^{\dim\beta}\), it holds

\[\|\hat{\rho}^{(s)}-\nu^{s}\|_{\mathrm{BL}}\to 0\]

uniformly among \(s\in[0,\tau]\) along the sequence.

Note that

\[\Big{|}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\varphi\cdot d(E_{M, L}-E)\Big{|}\leq \|\varphi\|_{\max}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\|} \widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta^{(s)}_{M,L},t)-G(\beta,\nu^{(s)},t)\Big{\|}\hat{\rho} ^{(s)}(\beta,t)d\beta dtds\] \[+ \Big{|}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\varphi\cdot(\hat{ \rho}^{(s)}-\nu^{s})(\beta,t)d\beta dtds\Big{|}\] \[\lesssim \|\varphi\|_{\max}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\|} \widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta^{(s)}_{M,L},t)-G(\beta,\hat{\rho}^{(s)}_{M,L},t) \Big{\|}\hat{\rho}^{(s)}(\beta,t)d\beta dtds\] \[+ \|\varphi\|_{\max}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\|} G(\beta,\hat{\rho}^{(s)},t)-G(\beta,\nu^{(s)},t)\Big{\|}\hat{\rho}^{(s)}(\beta,t)d \beta dtds\] \[+ \sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\|\hat{\rho}^{(s)}-\nu^{s}\|_{\mathrm{BL}}\] \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\|\hat{\rho}^{(s)}-\nu^{s}\|_{\mathrm{ BL}}+\sup_{s\in[0,\tau],\|\beta\|\leq R_{\tau}}\Big{\|}G(\beta,\hat{\rho}^{(s)},t)- G(\beta,\nu^{(s)},t)\Big{\|}\] (D.16) \[\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}+\sup_{s\in[0,\tau]}\| \hat{\rho}^{(s)}-\nu^{s}\|_{\mathrm{BL}}\]

for some constant \(C_{E}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result and with probability at least \(1-\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\) for any \(\delta>0\). Here, the third inequality of (D.16) utilizes the third result of Lemma D.3, and the fourth inequality uses the second result of Lemma D.3, following a similar process in Step II to achieve supremacy over \(s\in[0,\tau]\).

From (D.16), we infer that \(\Big{|}\int_{0}^{\tau}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\varphi\cdot d(E_{M,L}-E)\Big{|} \to 0\) almost surely along the sequence. Hence, \(E_{M,L}\) converges weakly to \(E\) almost surely along the sequence, and the particle gradient flow for \((\nu^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) almost surely satisfies (2.7) on \([0,\tau]\) for any arbitrarily given \(\tau>0\). According to the Fokker-Planck equation without noise involved [59], we conclude that \((\nu^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) almost surely satisfies (3.5). Consequently, the uniqueness stated in Proposition 3.2 ensures that \((\nu^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}=(\rho^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) almost surely. 

### Proof of Proposition 3.1

Proof.: Suppose that the Frechet derivative \(\frac{\delta R}{\delta\rho}\) indeed exists, we establish

\[\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\theta,w,t)=\frac{\delta R}{\delta\rho}(\theta,w,t) +\frac{\lambda}{2}(\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}+\|w\|_{2}^{2}).\]

Therefore, it suffices to show that the Frechet derivative of \(L\) with respect to \(\rho\) is

\[\frac{\delta R}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t)=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(} g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}.\] (D.17)

Denote \(\rho_{\eta}=\rho+\eta(\nu-\rho)\). We provide the following lemma to bound \(T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)\) by expanding the first-order derivative as follows

**Lemma D.4** (First-order derivative of Transformer output).: _Under Assumption 2, for any \(H\) and \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) that have bounded supports, we have_

\[\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)]= \eta\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta} \nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d \beta)\Big{)}\] \[\cdot\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\nu-\rho)(\beta,t)d \beta dt+o(\eta),\] (D.18)

_where \(\rho_{\eta}:=\rho+\eta(\nu-\rho)\)._Given (D.18), we observe from the solution of \(p_{\rho}\) (C.13) and (C.14) that

\[\begin{split}&\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)} \mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)]\\ =&\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,1)]^{\top}\mathrm{vec}[T _{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)]\\ =&\eta\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho} (H,t)]^{\top}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\rho-\nu)(\beta,t)d\beta dt+o( \eta)\\ =&\eta\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}g(T _{\rho}(H,t),\beta)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}(\rho-\nu)(\beta,t)d\beta dt+o( \eta),\end{split}\] (D.19)

Hence, by applying (D.19) to the risk function, we obtain

\[\begin{split} R(\rho_{\eta})-R(\rho)&=\frac{1}{2} \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^ {2}-\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}\Big{]}\\ &=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H) \Big{)}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)]\Big{]}\\ &+\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)]O(\mathrm{Read }[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)])\\ &=\eta\Big{\langle}\frac{\delta R}{\delta\rho},\nu-\rho\Big{\rangle} +o(\eta),\end{split}\]

which indicates (D.17) and concludes the proof. 

### Proof of well-posedness of Wasserstein gradient flow

Proof.: Following a similar idea as Proposition 2.5 of [16], we leverage the general theory of Wasserstein gradient flow developed in [4]. Define the functional family \(Q_{r}(\rho)\) as

\[Q_{r}(\rho)=\begin{cases}Q(\rho)&\rho(P_{r})=1,\\ \infty&\mathrm{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

For any \(r>0\), let's consider any _admissible transport_\(\gamma\in\mathcal{P}^{\Omega\times\Omega}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\). By definition, both of its marginals, denoted by \(\rho_{1}\) and \(\rho_{2}\), are concentrated on \(P_{r}\). We define the transport cost for \(\gamma\) as

\[C_{p}(\gamma):=(\int\lvert x-y\rvert^{p}d\gamma(x,y))^{1/p}\]

for \(p\geq 1\). Additionally, we denote the transport interpolation as \(\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma}:=((1-\alpha)\rho_{1}+\alpha\rho_{2})_{\#\gamma}\). Our proof consists of several steps outlined below.

**Step I: Show that \(Q_{r}\) is proper and continuous for \(W_{2}\) on its closed domain:**

Note that the parameters \(r,D,N,\lambda\) remain fixed throughout this proof step, so we hide the constant dependencies on them. For any \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\), we have \(\tilde{Q}_{r}(\delta_{(\beta,t)})=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[(\mathrm{Read}[H +\Delta tg(H,\beta)]-y(H))^{2}]+\frac{\lambda}{2}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}<\infty\). This indicates that \(Q_{r}\) is proper. Moreover, for any \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) whose bounded support belong to \(P_{r}\), Lemma C.1 ensures that

\[\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)+T_{\nu}(H,t)\rVert_{F}=O(1),\]

and Lemma C.2 guarantees that

\[\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\nu}(H,t)\rVert_{F}=O(W_{1}(\rho,\nu))=O(W_{2}(\rho, \nu))\]

for any \(H\). Therefore, we have

\[\begin{split} R(\nu)-R(\rho)&=\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_ {\mu}\Big{[}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\nu}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}-\Big{(}\mathrm{ Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}\Big{]}\\ &=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H )\Big{)}\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)]\Big{]}\\ &+\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)]O(\mathrm{Read}[T_{\nu}( H,1)-T_{\rho}(H,1)])\\ &=O(W_{2}(\rho,\nu)).\end{split}\] (D.20)Furthermore, since both \(\rho\) and \(\nu\) have bounded support, \(\|\beta\|^{2}\) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to \((\beta,t)\). Therefore, by the Kantorovich-Rubinstein Theorem (see Theorem 5.10 of [68], for example), we have

\[\Big{|}\frac{\lambda}{2}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}(\rho-\nu)d\beta dt \Big{|}=O(W_{1}(\rho,\nu))=O(W_{2}(\rho,\nu)).\] (D.21)

Combining (D.20) and (D.21), we obtain that \(Q(\rho)-Q(\nu)=O(W_{2}(\rho,\nu)).\) Therefore, \(Q_{r}\) is continuous for \(W_{2}\) on its closed domain.

**Step II: Show that \(\alpha\mapsto Q(\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma})/C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)\) is differentiable and has a Lipschitz continuous derivative**

Let's denote \(h(\alpha):=Q_{r}(\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma})\). Lemma C.3 ensures that for any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) with bounded support belonging to \(P_{r}\), we have bounded \(\|\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\cdot,\cdot)\|_{F}\) on \(P_{r}\). Therefore, \(Q_{r}(\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma})\) is differentiable with respect to \(t\), and the derivative reads

\[\begin{split} h^{\prime}(\alpha)=&\big{\langle} \frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma}},\frac{d}{d \alpha}\rho_{\alpha}^{\gamma}\big{\rangle}\\ &=\int d\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha}^{ \gamma}}\Big{(}(1-\alpha)(\beta_{1},t_{1})+\alpha(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]} \Big{[}(\beta_{1},t_{1})-(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{)}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_{1}),( \beta_{2},t_{2}))\Big{\}}.\end{split}\] (D.22)

Then, it suffices to show that \(h^{\prime}(\alpha)\) is Lipschitz continuous. To accomplish this, we first propose the following lemma for later use:

**Lemma D.5** (Locally Lipschitz of \(\rho\) for the gradient).: _Under Assumptions 1 and 2, for any \(\rho,\nu\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\), there exists some constant \(L_{r}\) depending on \(r,N,D\) and parameters of the assumptions such that_

\[\sup_{t\in[0,1]}\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\leq L _{r}\lVert\rho-\nu\rVert_{1},\] \[\sup_{(\beta,t)\in P_{r}}\Big{|}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|} _{\rho}(\beta,t)-\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\nu}(\beta,t)\Big{|}\leq L _{r}\lVert\rho-\nu\rVert_{1}.\]

Returning to the lemma proof, for \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\in[0,1]\), by the triangle inequality we have \(|h^{\prime}(\alpha_{1})-h^{\prime}(\alpha_{2})|\leq J_{1}+J_{2}\) where

\[\begin{split} J_{1}:=&\bigg{|}\int d\frac{\delta Q} {\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha_{1}}^{\gamma}}\Big{(}(1-\alpha_{1})( \beta_{1},t_{1})+\alpha_{1}(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{)}\Big{[}(\beta_{1},t_{1})-( \beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_{1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\\ &-\int d\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha_{2} }^{\gamma}}\Big{(}(1-\alpha_{1})(\beta_{1},t_{1})+\alpha_{1}(\beta_{2},t_{2}) \Big{)}\Big{[}(\beta_{1},t_{1})-(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_{ 1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\Big{|}\\ \leq&\sup_{(\beta,t)\in P_{r}}\Big{|}\frac{\delta Q} {\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho}(\beta,t)-\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\nu}( \beta,t)\Big{|}\int\lVert(\beta_{1},t_{1})-(\beta_{2},t_{2})\rVert_{1}d\gamma ((\beta_{1},t_{1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\\ \leq& L_{r}\lVert\rho_{\alpha_{1}}^{\gamma}-\rho_{ \alpha_{2}}^{\gamma}\rVert_{1}\cdot C_{1}(\gamma)\\ \leq& L_{r}C_{1}^{2}(\gamma)|\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}|\\ \leq& L_{r}C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)|\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}| \end{split}\] (D.23)

by Lemma D.5. The final inequality of (D.23) applies Holder's inequality to obtain that \(C_{1}^{2}(\gamma)\leq C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)\). Furthermore,

\[\begin{split} J_{2}:=&\Big{|}\int d\frac{\delta Q }{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha_{2}}^{\gamma}}\Big{\{}\Big{[}(1-\alpha_ {1})(\beta_{1},t_{1})+\alpha_{1}(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]}\Big{[}(\beta_{1},t_{1 })-(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_{1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\Big{\}} \\ &-\int d\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha_{2}}^{ \gamma}}\Big{\{}\Big{[}(1-\alpha_{2})(\beta_{1},t_{1})+\alpha_{2}(\beta_{2},t_{ 2})\Big{]}\Big{[}(\beta_{1},t_{1})-(\beta_{2},t_{2})\Big{]}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_ {1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\Big{\}}\\ \leq&\sup_{(\beta,t)\in P_{r}}\left\|\frac{\delta Q} {\delta\rho}\right\|_{\rho=\rho_{\alpha_{2}}^{\gamma}}(\beta,t)\bigg{\|}\, \Big{|}\alpha_{1}-\alpha_{2}\Big{|}\int\lVert(\beta_{1},t_{1})-(\beta_{2},t_{2} )\rVert^{2}d\gamma((\beta_{1},t_{1}),(\beta_{2},t_{2}))\\ \leq& L_{r}^{\prime}C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)|\alpha_{1}- \alpha_{2}|\end{split}\] (D.24)where \(L^{\prime}_{r}:=\sup_{(\beta,t)\in P_{r}}\|\frac{\delta Q}{\delta_{\rho}}|_{\rho= \rho_{2}^{\gamma}}(\beta,t)\|<\infty\) from Lemma C.3. Combining (D.23) and (D.24) leads us to the result that \(h^{\prime}(\alpha)/C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)\) is Lipschitz continuous.

**Step III: Show the well-posedness of Wasserstein gradient flow at some finite time**

We follow a similar approach to the proof of Proposition 2.5 in [16]. Since \(h^{\prime}(\alpha)\) is \(\lambda_{h}\times C_{2}^{2}(\gamma)\)-Lipschitz continuous with respect to \(\alpha\) for some \(\lambda_{h}\), the well-posedness of the Wasserstein gradient flow for \(Q_{r}\) with the velocity field constrained on \(P_{r}\) is a corollary of Theorem 11.2.2 of [4]. Specifically, there exists a unique curve \((\rho_{r}^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) continuous in \(\mathcal{P}^{2}\) such that:

\[\frac{d\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=\text{div}_{\beta}(\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}v_{r}^{( \tau)})\]

where

\[v_{r}^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)=\begin{cases}G(\beta,\rho_{r}^{(\tau)},t),&\quad( \beta,t)\in P_{r},\\ 0,&\quad\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\]

for \(\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}\)-a.e. Given the initialization \(\rho_{0}\) concentrated on \(P_{R}\), for any \(r>R\), the unique \(\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}\) exhibits a first exit time denoted as

\[\tau_{r}:=\inf\{\tau>0:\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}(P_{\tau})<1\}.\]

By defining this exit time, for any \(\bar{r}>r\) and \(\tau\in[0,\tau_{r}]\), we observe \(v_{r}(\tau)(\beta,t)=G(\beta,\rho_{r}^{(\tau)},t)\) and \(v_{\bar{r}}(\tau)(\beta,t)=G(\beta,\rho_{\bar{r}}^{(\tau)},t)\). Due to uniqueness, we infer \(\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}=\rho_{\bar{r}}^{(\tau)}\) on \(\tau\in[0,\tau_{r}]\). Considering \(\rho_{r}^{(\tau)}\) as the solution to (3.5), we establish the existence and uniqueness of the Wasserstein gradient flow for \(Q\) over \([0,\tau_{r}]\).

**Step IV: Show the well-posedness of Wasserstein gradient flow at all time**

To establish the Wasserstein gradient flow's definition for \(\tau\geq 0\), it's necessary to demonstrate that \(\lim_{\tau\to\infty}\tau_{r}=\infty\). For any \(r>R\), according to the energy identity in Theorem 11.2.1 of [4], on \([0,t_{r}]\), we observe that \(\tau\mapsto Q(\rho^{(\tau)})\) is non-increasing. Specifically, this represents

\[\begin{split}\frac{dQ(\rho^{(\tau)})}{d\tau}=&\int_ {0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\langle}\frac{dQ}{d\rho}\Big{|}_{\rho=\rho^{(\tau)}}, \text{div}_{\beta}(\rho^{(\tau)}G(\beta,\rho^{(\tau)},t))\Big{\rangle}\\ =&\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\Big{\langle}G(\beta,\rho ^{(\tau)},t),\text{div}_{\beta}(\rho^{(\tau)}G(\beta,\rho^{(\tau)},t))\Big{\rangle} d\beta dt\\ =&\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\rho^{(\tau)}\|G(\beta, \rho^{(\tau)},t)\|_{2}^{2}d\beta dt\leq 0.\end{split}\] (D.25)

Therefore, for any \(\tau\in[0,\tau_{r}]\), utilizing Lemma C.1, we have

\[\begin{split} Q(\rho^{(\tau)})\leq Q(\rho_{0})=&\mathbb{ E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\frac{1}{2}\Big{(}\text{Read}[T_{\rho_{0}}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2} \Big{]}+\frac{\lambda}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\rho_{0}(\beta,t )d\beta dt\\ \leq&\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}((\|T_{\rho_{0}}(H,1 )\|_{2-\text{col}}+B)^{2}]+\frac{\lambda R^{2}}{2}\\ \leq&\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[(\|T_{\rho_{0}}(H,1)\|_{2- \text{col}}^{2}+B^{2}]+\frac{\lambda R^{2}}{2}\\ \leq& B^{2}+B^{2}\exp\Big{(}K(1+R+R^{2})\Big{)}^{2} +\frac{\lambda R^{2}}{2}\end{split}\] (D.26)Thus, we have \(\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)\leq\frac{2}{ \lambda}Q(\rho^{(\tau)})\leq R^{2}+\lambda^{-1}\Big{(}2B^{2}+2B^{2}\exp\Big{(}K(1+ R+R^{2})\Big{)}^{2}\Big{)}=A_{0}^{2}\). According to Assumption (ii) and Lemma C.3, for any \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\), we have

\[\lVert v_{r}^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)-\lambda\beta\rVert=\lVert G(\beta,\rho^{(\tau)},t)-\lambda\beta\rVert\leq \sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\Big{\lVert}\nabla_{\beta}\Big{\{}g(T_{\rho}(H,t), \beta)_{:,i}\Big{\}}p_{\rho}(H,t)_{:,i}\Big{\rVert}\] \[\leq \sup_{i\in[N+1]}\|\nabla_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\| \sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)_{:,i}\rVert\] \[\leq \sqrt{N+1}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\|\nabla_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta) _{:,i}\|\,\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \sqrt{N+1}\phi_{P}(\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}) \lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}(1+\lVert\beta\rVert)\] \[\leq C_{R}(1+\lVert\beta\rVert),\] (D.27)

where \(C_{R}:=\sqrt{N+1}\phi_{P}(B\exp(K(1+A_{0}+A_{0}^{2})))(B+B\exp(K(1+A_{0}+A_{0}^{ 2})))\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+A_{0}+A_{0}^{2}))(1+A_{0}+A_{0 }^{2})\Big{)}\). Applying (D.27) to the gradient flow equation

\[\frac{d\beta^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-v_{r}^{(\tau)}(\beta,t),\quad\beta^{(0)}=\beta\]

for \(\tau\geq 0\), we obtain \(\frac{d\lVert\beta^{(\tau)}\rVert}{d\tau}=\frac{(-v_{r}^{(\tau)}(\beta,t), \lVert\beta^{(\tau)}\rVert)}{\lVert\beta^{(\tau)}\rVert}\leq\lVert v_{r}^{( \tau)}(\beta,t)-\lambda\beta\rVert\leq C_{R}(1+\lVert\beta^{(\tau)}\rVert)\). This indicates

\[\lVert\beta^{(\tau)}\rVert\leq(\lVert\beta\rVert+1)\exp(C_{R}\tau)-1\leq(R+1) \exp(C_{R}\tau)-1\] (D.28)

by the Gronwall's inequality. Therefore, for any \(T>0\), \(\rho^{(T)}\) is concentrated on \(P_{(R+1)\exp(C_{R}T)-1}\), implying that for \(r>(R+1)\exp(C_{R}T)\), we have \(\tau_{r}>T\). Hence, we conclude \(\lim_{r\to\infty}\tau_{r}=\infty\), establishing the existence of a unique Wasserstein gradient flow from (3.5) over \(\tau>0\).

Eventually, we establish the three properties listed in Proposition 3.2 for \(\rho^{(\tau)}\). By (3.5), for any \(t\in[0,1]\), we have

\[\int_{\beta}\rho^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)d\beta= \int_{\beta}\rho^{(0)}(\beta,t)d\beta+\int_{0}^{\tau}\Big{(}\int _{\beta}\mathrm{div}_{\beta}(\rho^{(s)}G^{(s)}(\beta,\rho^{(s)},t))d\beta \Big{)}ds\] \[= 1+\int_{0}^{\tau}0\cdot ds=1\]

indicated by the Divergence Theorem as \(\rho^{(s)}\) has bounded support. Next, for any \(\tau\geq 0\), (D.28) shows that \(\rho^{(\tau)}\) is concentrated on \(P_{R_{\tau}}\). Moreover, (D.25) now holds for any \(\tau>0\), implying \(\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)\leq A_{0} ^{2}\) for any \(\tau\geq 0\). 

### Proof of well-posedness of gradient flow

**Proposition D.1** (Existence and uniqueness of gradient flow).: _Under Assumptions 1-3, for any initialization of \(\Theta^{(0)}\) i.i.d. drawn from \(\{\rho_{0}(\theta,w|t)\}_{t,j}\), there exists a unique solution \((\Theta^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) for (2.7). Additionally, for any \(\tau\geq 0\), we have_

1. \(\Theta^{(\tau)}\) _has a bounded support, meaning_ \(\sup_{t,j}(\lVert\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\rVert_{2}^{2}+\lVert w_{t,j}^{(\tau)} \rVert_{2}^{2})\leq R_{\tau}\)_._
2. \(\frac{1}{MT}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}(\lVert\theta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\rVert_{2}^{2}+ \lVert w_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\rVert_{2}^{2})\leq A_{0}^{2}\)_._

_Here, \(R_{\tau}\) and \(A_{0}\) are defined as in Proposition 3.2._

Proof.: The local Lipschitz continuity established in Lemma D.2 directly implies the continuity of \(\widehat{G}_{\beta}(\beta_{t,j},\Theta,t)\) with respect to \(\Theta\). Since \(\{ML\cdot\widehat{G}_{\beta}(\beta_{t,j},\Theta,t)\}_{t/\Delta t+1\in[L],j\in[M]}\) serves as the gradient of \(\widehat{Q}(\Theta)\), it follows that \(\widehat{Q}(\Theta)\) is continuously differentiable, indicating the local semiconvexity of \(\widehat{Q}(\Theta)\). Specifically, for any \(\Theta\), there exists some \(\kappa>0\) such that \(\|w_{t,j}\|_{2}^{2}\)) is convex within a small neighborhood of \(\Theta\). The existence and uniqueness of a gradient flow over the maximal interval \([0,\tau_{\max}]\) is a standard result (see Section 2.1 of [61]).

For any \(\tau\in[0,\tau_{\max}]\), it holds that

\[\begin{split}\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(0)})\geq\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(0) })-\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})=&\int_{0}^{\tau}\sum_{t}\sum_{j= 1}^{M}\langle\frac{d\widehat{Q}(\Theta)}{d\beta_{t,j}}\bigg{|}_{\Theta=\Theta^ {(\tau)}},ML\frac{d\widehat{Q}(\Theta)}{d\beta_{t,j}}\bigg{|}_{\Theta=\Theta^{ (\tau)}})d\tau\\ =&\int_{0}^{\tau}\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M} \lVert\widehat{G}_{\beta}(\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{(\tau)},t)\rVert^{2}d \tau\\ \geq&\frac{1}{ML\tau}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\Big{(} \int_{0}^{\tau}\lVert\widehat{G}_{\beta}(\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{(\tau)},t)\rVert d\tau\Big{)}^{2},\end{split}\] (D.29)

where the last inequality follows from Jensen's inequality. (D.29) establishes that \(\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\) is both upper and lower bounded, and \(\Theta^{(\tau)}\) exhibits a bounded curve length over any the time interval \([0,\tau_{\max}]\). By compactness, if \(\tau_{\max}\) is finite, then \(\Theta^{(\tau_{\max})}\) exists and thus must exist beyond \(\tau_{\max}\), which leads to contradiction. Therefore, \(\tau_{\max}=\infty\), and the well-posedness of the gradient flow for \(\tau\geq 0\) consequently follows. Additionally, (D.29) shows that for any \(\tau\geq 0\),

\[\begin{split}\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\beta_{t,j} \rVert_{2}^{2}\leq 2\lambda^{-1}\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq 2\lambda^{-1} \widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(0)})=&\lambda^{-1}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[} \Big{(}\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta^{(0)}}(H,1)]-y(H)\Big{)}^{2}\Big{]}\\ +&\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\beta_{t,j} ^{(0)}\rVert_{2}^{2}\\ \leq&\lambda^{-1}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[(\lVert\widehat{ T}_{\Theta^{(0)}}(H,1)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}+B)^{2}]+R^{2}\\ \leq& 2\lambda^{-1}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[(\lVert\widehat{ T}_{\Theta^{(0)}}(H,1)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}^{2}+B^{2}]+R^{2}\\ \leq& R^{2}+\lambda^{-1}\Big{(}2B^{2}+2B^{2}\exp \Big{(}K(1+R+R^{2})\Big{)}^{2}\Big{)}\\ =& A_{0}^{2}\end{split}\] (D.30)

The last inequality of (D.30) follows from Lemma C.4, thereby showing that \(\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\beta_{t,j}\rVert_{2}^{2}\leq A_{0}^ {2}\) for any \(\tau\geq 0\).

As the final part of our proof, we demonstrate that the norm of any entry of \(\Theta\) is bounded at any given time \(\tau\geq 0\). Note that

\[\begin{split}&\lVert\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta^{(\tau)},t)- \lambda\beta\rVert\\ \leq&\sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\Big{\lVert}\nabla_{\theta} \Big{\{}f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta)_{:,i}\Big{\}}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}( H,t)_{:,i}\Big{\rVert}\,/2+\Big{\lVert}\nabla_{w}\Big{\{}h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+ \Delta/2),w)_{:,i}\Big{\}}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)_{:,i}\Big{\rVert} \,/2\\ \leq&\sup_{i\in[N+1]}(\lVert\nabla_{\theta}f(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\theta)_{:,i}\rVert\sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)_{:,i}\rVert /2+\lVert\nabla_{w}h(T_{\rho}(H,t),w)_{:,i}\rVert\sum_{i=1}^{N+1}\lVert p_{ \rho}(H,t+\Delta t/2)_{:,i}\rVert/2)\\ \leq&\sqrt{N+1}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\Big{(}\,\lVert \nabla_{\theta}f(T_{\rho}(H,t),\theta)_{:,i}\rVert\,\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert _{F}/2\\ +&\lVert\nabla_{w}h(T_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t/2),w)_{:,i} \rVert\,\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\rVert_{F}/2\Big{)}\\ \leq&\sqrt{N+1}\max\{\phi_{P}(\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t) \rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}),\phi_{P}(\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\rVert_{2- \mathrm{col}})\}\\ &\max\{\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F},\lVert p_{\rho}(H,t+ \Delta t/2)\rVert_{F}\}(1+\lVert\beta\rVert)\\ \leq& C_{R}(1+\lVert\beta\rVert),\end{split}\] (D.31)

Applying (D.31) to the gradient flow

\[\frac{d\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}}{d\tau}=-\widehat{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{ (\tau)},t)\]for \(\tau\geq 0\), we have \(\frac{d\|\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}\|}{d\tau}=\frac{(-\tilde{G}(\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)}, \Theta^{(\tau)},t),\|\beta^{(\tau)}\|)}{\|\beta^{(\tau)}\|}\leq\|\tilde{G}( \beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{(\tau)},t)-\lambda\beta\|\leq C_{R}(1+\|\beta^{( \tau)}\|)\). This indicates

\[\|\beta^{(\tau)}\|\leq(\|\beta\|+1)\exp(C_{R}\tau)-1\leq(R+1)\exp(C_{R}\tau)-1 =R_{\tau}.\] (D.32)

### Proof of Proposition 3.3

Before commencing the proof, we introduce two proxy Transformer procedures in addition to \(\bar{T}_{\Theta}\) and \(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}\). The first proxy, denoted as \(\bar{T}_{\Theta}\), involves moving the layers with the encoder \(h\) slightly forward by \(\Delta t/2\) in the depth index. This adjustment results in a discrete Transformer with only \(L\) layers, where each layer has a step size of \(\Delta t\) and an encoder of \((f+h)/2\), represented by \(g\). Specifically, \(\bar{T}_{\Theta}\) can be written as

\[\begin{split}\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)=&\bar{ T}_{\Theta}(H,t)+\Delta tM^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\Big{(}f(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t), \theta_{t,j})+\sum_{j=1}^{M}h(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{t,j})\Big{)}\\ =&\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)+\Delta tM^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M }g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j}).\end{split}\] (D.33)

The second proxy, denoted as \(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}\), extends the width to infinity by letting \(M\to\infty\), effectively replacing the average with an integral:

\[\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t)=\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)+\Delta t\int_{ \beta}g(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta|t)d\beta.\] (D.34)

We let all four Transformers share the same initial state \(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,0)=\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,0)=\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,0)=T_{ \rho}(H,0)=T_{\rho}(H,0)=H\).

We first present the following lemma, considering parameters i.i.d. drawn from some distribution \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) with bounded support:

**Lemma D.6** (Oracle approximation of discretization).: _Under Assumptions 1 and 2, suppose that the parameter setting \(\Theta\) is i.i.d. drawn from \(\{\rho(\theta,w|t)\}_{t,j}\) for some \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(\{(\theta,w):\|\theta\|^{2}+\|w\|^{2}\leq r^{2}\}\times[0,1]\) and satisfies that \(\int_{\theta,w}\rho(\theta,w,t)d(\theta,w)=1\) for any \(t\in[0,1]\). Then with probability at least \(1-\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\), we have_

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

_for any \(H\), \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\) and any \(\delta>0\). Here, \(\lesssim\) hides the dependencies on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions._

Proof of Proposition 3.3.: Since \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}\) has a bounded support for any \(\rho\), there exists some \(\rho^{*}\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}\) such that \(R(\rho^{*})=\inf_{\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}}R(\rho)\). According to Lemma D.6, we can find a specific \(\Theta\) such that

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{*}}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq C\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)},\]

where \(C\) depends on \(N,D,r\), and the parameters of the assumptions. Moreover, from Lemma D.6, we ensure that each entry \(\beta_{t,j}\) of \(\Theta\) satisfies \(\|\beta_{t,j}\|\leq r\). Verification of Lemmas C.1 and C.4 on \(T_{\rho}\) and \(\widehat{T}\Theta\) respectively leads to their uniform boundedness, i.e., \(\sup_{t}T_{\rho}(H,t)\lesssim 1\) and \(\sup_{t}\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\lesssim 1\). Therefore, we have

\[\begin{split}|\widehat{R}(\Theta)-R(\rho^{*})|\leq& \mathbb{E}_{\mu}[|\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)-T_{\Theta}(H,1)]| |\cdot|\lvert\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)+T_{\Theta}(H,1)]+2y(H) \rvert]\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{M}}.\end{split}\]

Here, \(\lesssim\) hides the dependencies on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions. The result then follows.

The proof for the energy functional \(Q\) (and \(\widehat{Q}\)) follows a similar approach. There exists some \(\rho^{*}\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}\) such that \(Q(\rho^{*})=\inf_{\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2,r}}Q(\rho)\). From Lemmas D.6 and C.7, we can find a specific \(\Theta\) such that

\[\begin{cases}&\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{*}}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq C\Big{(}L ^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)},\\ &|\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\|\beta_{t,j}\|^{2}-\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta }\|\beta\|^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt|\leq C\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1) }{M}}\Big{)}.\end{cases}\]

by setting \(C\) large enough. Verification of Lemmas C.1 and C.4 on \(T_{\rho}\) and \(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}\) respectively leads to their uniform boundedness. Hence, we have

\[|\widehat{Q}(\Theta)-Q(\rho^{*})|\leq|\widehat{R}(\Theta)-R(\rho^{*})|+ \lambda|\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\|\beta_{t,j}\|^{2}-\int_{0}^{1} \int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt|\leq C(1+\lambda)\Big{(}L^{-1 }+\sqrt{\frac{\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}.\]

The result thus follows. 

## Appendix E Proofs of main results in Section 4

For simplicity, we assume that Assumption 4 holds with \((g,\alpha)=(f,\theta)\). The proof for the case of \((g,\alpha)=(h,w)\) is symmetric, involving a simple substitution of \(f\) with \(h\) and \(\theta\) with \(w\).

### Proofs of Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1

Our proof of Theorem 4.1 consists of three parts, each focusing on bounding differences related to the energy functional \(Q\) or \(\widehat{Q}\).

The first step establishes the continuity of the functional gradient \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}\). This ensures that if the derivative with respect to \(\beta\) for the functional gradient is constant over a region, then the functional gradient remains constant within that region.

The second step provides the key bound for \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\), which is proportional to \(\lambda\). This involves a detailed analysis of \(Q\)'s landscape by bounding its derivatives.

After obtaining the bound for \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\), the final steps are to show that the finite-time risk can approach this bound. Achieving a loss as small as \(\epsilon\) requires \(Q(\rho^{(\tau_{0})})\leq\epsilon\) for some sufficiently large \(\tau_{0}\). We then apply Theorem 3.1, with constant dependency on \(\tau_{0}\), to show that \(\widehat{Q}(\tau_{0})\) becomes sufficiently small. Since \(\widehat{Q}(\rho^{(\tau)})\) is non-increasing, \(\widehat{Q}(\tau)\) remains small for all \(\tau\geq\tau_{0}\).

**Preparatory Step: Landscape analysis**

First, the following lemma suggests that as long as the risk \(R(\rho)\) remains positive, a descent direction for \(Q(\rho)\) can be constructed at any depth index, provided that \(\lambda\) is sufficiently small. This implies that by adjusting \(\lambda\), one can influence the gradient flow to effectively reduce \(Q(\rho)\).

**Lemma E.1** (Landscape of \(Q(\rho)\)).: _Suppose that Assumptions 1-4 hold. For any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\) with some \(r>0\), any \(w_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}w}\), and any \(t^{*}\in[0,1]\) such that \(\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t^{*})\geq 1/2\), there exists a \(\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}\beta})\) such that_

1. _for any_ \(\beta\in\mathrm{supp}(\nu)\)_, we have_ \(1/B_{r}\leq\|\beta\|\leq B_{r}\)__
2. _for any_ \((\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w)\)_, we have_ \(\theta_{2}\in\mathcal{K}\) _and_ \(w=w_{0}\)_._
3. \(\int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t^{*})\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho( \beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\leq C_{1}\lambda-C_{2}R(\rho)\)__

_Here, \(B_{r},C_{1},C_{2}\) are constants that depends on \(N,d,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions._

Given the \(t^{*}\) and \(w_{0}\) specified in the theorem, Lemma E.1 indicates that there exists some

\[\nu\in\mathcal{P}\Big{(}\Big{(}B_{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,B_{R_{\infty}})/B_ {\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,1/B_{R_{\infty}})\Big{)}\times\mathcal{K}\times\{w _{0}\}\Big{)}\]

such that \(\int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\beta,t^{*})\Big{(} \nu(\beta)-\rho_{\infty}(\beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\leq C_{1}\lambda-C_{2}R(\rho)\), where \(B_{R_{\infty}},C_{1},C_{2}\) are constants dependent on \(N,d,R_{\infty}\) and the parameters of the assumptions.

In addition, for any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\), we define the following two functional derivatives:

\[\frac{\delta Q_{f}}{\delta\rho}(\theta,w,t) =\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}\Big{[}f(T_{\rho}(H,t), \theta)\Big{]}^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\lambda\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}\] \[\frac{\delta Q_{h}}{\delta\rho}(\theta,w,t) =\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}\Big{[}h(T_{\rho}(H,t), w)\Big{]}^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\lambda\|w\|_{2}^{2}.\]

It is obvious that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\equiv(\frac{\delta Q_{f}}{\delta\rho}+\frac{ \delta Q_{h}}{\delta\rho})/2\).

_Proof of Theorem 4.1_.: **Step I: Show that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\beta,t)\) is continuous with respect to \((\beta,t)\)**

In Step I of the proof of Lemma E.1, we establish that \(\rho_{\infty}\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\), with a bounded support \(P_{R_{\infty}}\), implies \(p_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t)\) is \(C_{p}\)-Lipschitz continuous, where \(C_{p}\) is a constant dependent solely on \(N,D,R_{\infty}\), and the parameters in our assumptions.

Next, we would like to show that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\beta,t)\) is continuous with respect to \((\beta,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{div}\beta}\times[0,1]\). Let's focus on the region \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\) for any \(r>R_{\infty}\), so that \(\rho_{\infty}\) is also concentrated on \(P_{r}\). It's noteworthy that for any bounded support \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\), Lemma C.1 and Assumption 2 (i) ensure the universal boundedness of \(g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\), and Lemma C.3 ensures the universal boundedness of \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) for any \(H\in\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\), with the constants depending solely on \(N,D,r\), and the parameters of the assumptions.

Combining the Lipschitz continuity of \(p_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t)\) and \(T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t)\) with respect to \((H,t)\), as shown in Proposition C.2, along with the Lipschitz continuity of \(g(T,\beta)\) with respect to \((T,\beta)\) when \(\|T\|_{F}\) is universally bounded (as guaranteed by Assumption 2 (ii) and (iii)), and their universal boundedness, we derive that \(\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}\Big{[}g(T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t),\beta)\Big{]}^{\top}p_{\rho _{\infty}}(H,t)\Big{)}\) is \(C_{G}\)-Lipschitz continuous for \(\|\cdot\|_{2}\) with respect to \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\) for some constant \(C_{G}\) that depends only on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions. Since the Lipschitz constant \(C_{G}\) is independent of the choice of \(H\), we see that \(\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}\Big{[}g(T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t),\beta)\Big{]}^{\top}p_{\rho _{\infty}}(H,t)\Big{)}\) is uniformly continuous across all \(H\in\mathrm{supp}(\mu)\) with respect to \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\). Consequently, we have that

\[\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t)|_{\rho_{\infty}}=\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[} \mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}\Big{[}g(T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t),\beta)\Big{]}^{\top}p_{\rho _{\infty}}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}+\frac{\lambda}{2}\|\beta\|_{2}^{2}\]

is continuous with respect to \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\). Since the choice of \(r\) is arbitrary, we conclude that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\beta,t)\) is continuous with respect to \((\beta,t)\in\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{div}\beta}\times[0,1]\).

**Step II: Show that \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\lesssim\lambda\) with further landscape analysis**

In the first part of the proof, we will adopt a similar approach to Theorem 3.9 of [47] to demonstrate that the stationary point of the Wasserstein gradient flow, denoted \(\rho_{\infty}\), satisfies \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\lesssim\lambda\). It's worth noting that in [47], the authors assume \(\lambda=0\) and conclude \(R(\rho_{\infty})=Q(\rho_{\infty})=0\), but this claim relies on assuming the global existence of the Wasserstein gradient flow rather than proving it directly.

Based on the pivotal findings from [53] regarding the stationary points in the Wasserstein space, we infer that the stationary point \(\rho_{\infty}\) of the Wasserstein gradient flow (3.5), i.e.

\[\frac{d\rho(\beta,t)}{d\tau}=\mathrm{div}_{\beta}\Big{(}\rho\nabla_{\beta} \frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\Big{)},\]

must satisfy \(\nabla_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}\!=0\) almost everywhere over \(\mathrm{supp}(\rho_{\infty})\). This further indicates that \(\nabla_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_ {2},w,t^{*})=0\) almost everywhere over \(\mathrm{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t^{*}))\). The fact \(\rho(\cdot,t^{*})\) is a connected set, coupled with the continuity of the Frechet differential \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}\) with respect to \(\beta\), implies that, \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w,t^{*})=C\) for some constant \(C\) over \((\beta,t^{*})\in\mathrm{supp}(\rho(\cdot,t^{*}))\).

Given the separation assumption on the support of \(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t^{*})\), we ensure that for any \((\theta_{1},\theta_{2})\in\Big{(}B_{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,B_{R_{\infty}})/B_ {\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,1/B_{R_{\infty}})\Big{)}\times\mathcal{K}\), there exists \(c\in\mathbb{R},\ 1/R_{\infty}B_{R_{\infty}}\leq|c|\leq R_{\infty}B_{R_{\infty}}\)such that \((c\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})\in\mathrm{supp}(\rho_{\infty})\). Combined with Assumption 4 (i), which implies the \(1\)-homogeneity of \(f(T,\theta_{1},\theta_{2})\) with respect to \(\theta_{1}\), we have

\[\begin{split}\frac{\delta Q_{f}}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{ \infty}}(c\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})&=c\frac{\delta Q_{ f}}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})+(|c| -1)\lambda\|\theta_{1}\|^{2}.\\ \frac{\delta Q_{h}}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(c\theta_{1 },\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})&=\frac{\delta Q_{h}}{\delta\rho} \bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*}).\end{split}\] (E.1)

Hence, given that \(\nabla_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\cdot,t^{*})=0\) almost everywhere over \(\mathrm{supp}(\rho_{\infty}(\cdot,t^{*}))\), it also holds that

\[\nabla_{(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w)}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho} \bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})= \Big{(}\nabla_{(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w)}\frac{\delta Q_{f}}{ \delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})+\nabla_ {(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w)}\frac{\delta Q_{h}}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{ \infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})\Big{)}/2\] \[= \Big{(}-\frac{|c|-1}{c}\lambda\theta_{1},0_{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{ 2}},0_{w}\Big{)},\]

which implies

\[\bigg{\|}\nabla_{(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w)}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|} _{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})\bigg{\|}\leq(R_{\infty}^{ 2}B_{R_{\infty}}+R_{\infty})\lambda.\] (E.2)

Given the condition that \(\|(c\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})-(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w_{0},t^{*})\| \leq R_{\infty}^{2}B_{R_{\infty}}\), and recalling that \(\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}|_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{2},w,t^{*})\equiv C\) across \((\beta,t^{*})\in\mathrm{supp}(\rho(\cdot,t^{*}))\), (E.2) further indicates that

\[\Big{|}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\theta_{1},\theta_{ 2},w_{0},t^{*})-C\Big{|}\leq(R_{\infty}^{4}B_{R_{\infty}}^{2}+R_{\infty}^{3}B _{R_{\infty}})\lambda.\] (E.3)

for any \((\theta_{1},\theta_{2})\in\Big{(}B_{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,B_{R_{\infty}}) /B_{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}(0,1/B_{R_{\infty}})\Big{)}\times\mathcal{K}\). Hence, by Lemma E.1 we have

\[\begin{split} C_{1}\lambda-C_{2}R(\rho_{\infty})\geq& \int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}\bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}( \beta,t^{*})\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho_{\infty}(\beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\\ =&\int_{\beta}\Big{(}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho} \bigg{|}_{\rho_{\infty}}(\beta,t^{*})-C\Big{)}\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho_{\infty}( \beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\\ \geq&-\int_{\beta}(R_{\infty}^{4}B_{R_{\infty}}^{2}+R _{\infty}^{3}B_{R_{\infty}})\lambda\Big{(}\nu(\beta)+\rho_{\infty}(\beta|t^{ *})\Big{)}d\beta\\ \geq& 2(R_{\infty}^{4}B_{R_{\infty}}^{2}+R_{\infty}^{3}B _{R_{\infty}})\lambda.\end{split}\] (E.4)

Therefore, we have \(R(\rho_{\infty})\leq\frac{C_{1}+2(R_{\infty}^{4}B_{R_{\infty}}^{2}+R_{\infty}^{3 }B_{R_{\infty}})}{C_{2}}\lambda\), and

\[Q(\rho_{\infty})\leq R(\rho_{\infty})+\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2} \rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\leq\Big{(}\frac{C_{1}+2(R_{\infty}^{4}B_{R_{\infty}}^{2} +R_{\infty}^{3}B_{R_{\infty}})}{C_{2}}+R_{\infty}^{2}\Big{)}\lambda,\] (E.5)

which completes the first part of our proof.

**Step III: Bound the difference between \(Q(\rho^{(\tau)})\) and \(Q(\rho_{\infty})\) when \(\tau\) is large**

Proposition 3.2 establishes that the second moment for \(\rho^{(\tau)}\) is uniformly bounded across all \(\tau\geq 0\):

\[\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\rho^{(\tau)}(\beta,t)d\beta dt\leq A_{0} ^{2},\]

where \(A_{0}\) is defined as in Proposition 3.2. Therefore, the weak convergence of probability measures \((\rho^{(\tau)})_{\tau\geq 0}\) is equivalent to the convergence in the Wasserstein-\(2\) distance, i.e.

\[\lim_{\tau\to\infty}W_{2}(\rho^{(\tau)},\rho_{\infty})=0.\] (E.6)

When \(\tau\) is sufficiently large, \(\rho^{(\tau)}\) concentrates on \(P_{R_{\infty}}\). Therefore, according to Lemma C.2, there exists a constant \(C_{0}\) depending solely on \(N\), \(D\), \(R_{\infty}\), and the parameters of the assumptions that

\[\|T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t)-T_{\rho^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq C_{0}W_{2}(\rho^{( \tau)},\rho_{\infty})\] (E.7)for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\) when \(\tau\) is sufficiently large. Note that Lemma C.1 shows that

\[\max\{\|T_{\rho^{(\tau)}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\|T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,t)\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\}\leq B\exp(K(1+R_{\infty}+R_{\infty}^{2}))=:B_{T}\]

for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\). Thus, from (E.7), we have

\[|Q(\rho_{\infty})-Q(\rho^{(\tau)})|\leq \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}|\mathrm{Read}[|T_{\rho^{(\tau)} }(H,1)|]+|T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,1)|+2|y(H)|\Big{]}\Big{\|}|T_{\rho_{\infty}}(H,1 )-T_{\rho^{(\tau)}}(H,1)\|_{F}\] (E.8) \[+ \frac{\lambda}{2}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}( \rho_{\infty}-\rho^{(\tau)})(\beta,t)d\beta dt\] \[\leq (B_{T}+B)C_{0}W_{2}(\rho^{(\tau)},\rho_{\infty})+\frac{\lambda}{ 2}R_{\infty}W_{1}(\rho^{(\tau)},\rho_{\infty})\] \[\leq ((B_{T}+B)C_{0}+\frac{\lambda}{2}R_{\infty})W_{2}(\rho^{(\tau)}, \rho_{\infty}),\]

where the second inequality incorporates the Kantorovich-Rubinstein Theorem (see Theorem 5.10 of [68], for example) and the \(2R_{\infty}\)-Lipschitz continuity of \(\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\) over the region \((\beta,t)\in P_{R_{\infty}}\). Combining equations (E.6) and (E.8), we deduce that for any \(\epsilon>0\), there exists some \(\tau_{0}>0\) such that \(|Q(\rho_{\infty})-Q(\rho^{(\tau_{0})})|\leq\epsilon\).

**Step IV: Complete the proof by bounding the difference between \(\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\) and \(Q(\rho^{(\tau)})\) when \(\tau\) is large**

The final step can be seen as a direct corollary of the approximation result in Theorem 3.1. According to Theorem 3.1, there exists a constant \(C_{1}\) dependent on \(N\), \(D\), \(\tau_{0}\), \(\lambda\), and the parameters specified in the assumptions, such that

\[|\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau_{0})})-Q(\rho^{(\tau_{0})})|\leq C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+ \sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\]

with probability at least \(1-3\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\) for any \(\delta>0\). Combining the outcomes from the preceding steps, we obtain

\[\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau_{0})})\leq\epsilon+C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}+C_{2}\lambda.\] (E.9)

Note that

\[\frac{d}{d\tau}\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})=\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\langle \frac{d\widehat{Q}(\Theta)}{d\beta_{t,j}}\bigg{|}_{\Theta=\Theta^{(\tau)}},- ML\frac{d\widehat{Q}(\Theta)}{d\beta_{t,j}}\bigg{|}_{\Theta=\Theta^{(\tau)}} \rangle=-\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\widehat{G}_{\beta}(\beta_{t,j}^{(\tau)},\Theta^{(\tau)},t)\rVert^{2}\leq 0,\]

so the sequence \((\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)}))_{\tau\geq 0}\) is non-decreasing. Hence, for any \(\tau\geq\tau_{0}\),

\[\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq\widehat{Q}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq\widehat{Q}( \Theta^{(\tau_{0})})\leq\epsilon+C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L +1)}{M}}\Big{)}+C_{2}\lambda,\]

which completes the proof, recalling that \(C_{1}\) depends only on \(N,D,\tau_{0},\lambda\) and the parameters of the assumptions, and \(C_{2}\) depends only on \(N,D,R_{\infty}\), and the parameters of the assumptions.

Proof of Corollary 4.1.: Given the choice of \(\lambda\) By Theorem 4.1, there exists some \(\tau_{0}>0\) such that

\[\sup_{\tau\geq\tau_{0}}\widehat{R}(\Theta^{(\tau)})\leq \epsilon/2+C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}} \Big{)}+C_{2}C_{\lambda}\lambda\] \[\leq (1/4+C_{2}C_{\lambda})\epsilon+C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}.\]

The result holds by setting \(L\) and \(M/\!\log L\) sufficiently large to ensure that

\[C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\leq C_{1}\Big{(}L^{-1}+ \sqrt{\frac{2(1+\delta)\log(L+1)}{M}}\Big{)}\leq\epsilon/4.\]Proofs of auxiliary results

### Proof of Lemma D.1

Proof.: Lemma C.1 confirms that \(\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) and \(\|T_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) are bounded uniformly by \(B_{T}=B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))\). Considering the definition (C.2), it suffices to demonstrate that

\[\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}g(T_{\rho}(H,t), \beta)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t)\Big{)}-\nabla_{\beta}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}g(T_{\nu}(H,t ),\widetilde{\beta})^{\top}p_{\nu}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}\right\|\leq J_{1}+J_{2},\]

where

\[J_{1}:=\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\beta}\mathrm{Tr} \Big{(}(g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\widetilde{\beta})-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta))^{\top}p_{ \nu}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}\right\|\lesssim\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|,\] \[J_{2}:=\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\beta}\mathrm{Tr} \Big{(}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)^{\top}(p_{\nu}(H,t)-p_{\rho}(H,t))\Big{)}\Big{]} \right\|\lesssim\exp(C_{G}W_{1}(\rho,\nu))-1.\]

Here, the symbol \(\lesssim\) hides dependencies on \(N\), \(D\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions. To bound \(J_{1}\), consider that

\[J_{1}\leq \sup_{i\in[N+1]}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\left\|g(T_{\nu}(H,t), \widetilde{\beta})_{:,i}-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\right\|\Big{]}\] (F.1) \[\leq \sqrt{N+1}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\left\|g(T_{\nu} (H,t),\widetilde{\beta})_{:,i}-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\right\|\|p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\Big{]}\] \[\lesssim \sup_{i\in[N+1]}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\left\|g(T_{\nu}(H,t), \widetilde{\beta})_{:,i}-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\right\|\Big{]}\] \[\leq \phi_{PT}(r,B_{T})\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col} }+\phi_{P}P(r,B_{T})\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\] \[\lesssim W_{1}(\rho,\nu)+\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|.\]

The third inequality in Equation (F.1) is derived from Lemma C.3, while the fourth inequality relies on Assumption 3 (i) and (iii). Lastly, bounding \(\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) by \(W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\) is achieved with Lemma C.2.

On the other hand, to bound \(J_{2}\), we have

\[J_{2}\leq \sqrt{N+1}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\left\|g(T_{\rho} (H,t),\beta)_{:,i}\right\|\|p_{\nu}(H,t)-p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\Big{]}\] (F.2) \[\leq \sqrt{N+1}\|(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\|p_{\nu}(H,t )-p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\] \[\lesssim \|p_{\nu}(H,t)-p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}.\]

In (F.2), the third inequality relies on Assumption 2 (i). Consequently, to establish \(J_{2}\lesssim\exp(C_{G}W_{1}(\rho,\nu))-1\), it is adequate to demonstrate that \(\|p_{\nu}(H,t)-p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq I_{1}+I_{2}\lesssim W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\), where

\[I_{1}= |\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)]|\bigg{\|}\mathrm{exp} \Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu} (H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\bigg{\|}\,,\] \[I_{2}= |\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)|\] \[\left\|\mathrm{exp}\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{ vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}-\mathrm{exp} \Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu} (H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\right\|.\]

From Lemma C.2, it is trivial that \(|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)]|\leq\|T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)\|_ {F}\lesssim W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\). Thus, \(I_{1}\lesssim W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\) given the boundedness of \(\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)]\|\) as provided in Assumption 2 (iii). To bound \(I_{2}\), we have

\[I_{2}\lesssim \left\|\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}-\exp\Big{(} \int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,s), \beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\right\|\] (F.3) \[\lesssim \left\|\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T] }\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds-\int_{t}^{1}\int_ {\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s )d\beta ds\Big{)}-I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}\right\|\] \[\lesssim \exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T] }\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]-\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g( T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)]\right\|\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}-1\] \[\lesssim \exp\Big{(}\phi_{TT}(N,D,B_{T},r)\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)-g(T_{ \nu}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\Big{)}-1\] \[\lesssim \exp\Big{(}C_{r}\phi_{TT}(N,D,B_{T},r)\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{ T})(1+r+r^{2})W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\Big{)}-1\]

for some constant \(C_{r}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result setting. Here, the first inequality in (F.3) stems from \(|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)]-y(H)|\leq B_{T}+B\), the second inequality is ensured by the boundedness of \(\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)]\|\) as stated in Assumption 2 (iii), and the fourth inequality is provided by Assumption 3 (iv). The last inequality in (F.3) arises from Assumption 2 (iii) and Lemma C.2. By combining Equation (F.3) with the bounds of \(J_{1}\) and \(I_{1}\), we deduce that \(J_{1}+J_{2}\lesssim\exp(C_{G}W_{1}(\rho,\nu))-1+\|\beta-\widehat{\beta}\|\) for some constant \(C_{G}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result, thereby completing the proof. 

### Proof of Lemma D.2

Proof.: Lemma C.4 demonstrates that \(\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) and \(\|\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) are bounded by \(B_{T}=B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))\) for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\). We begin by bounding

\[\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{ \Theta},t)\|= \Big{\{}\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{ Tr}\Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{]}^{\top}\] \[+ \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{Tr}f( \widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)^{\top}\Big{(}\widehat{p}_{\Theta }(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{)} \Big{]}^{\top},\] \[\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{w}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}h( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2),w)-h(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t +\Delta t/2),w)\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)\Big{]}^{\top}\] \[+ \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{w}\mathrm{Tr}h(\widehat {T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2),w)^{\top}\Big{(}\widehat{p}_{\Theta }(H,t)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\Big{)}\Big{]}^{\top}\Big{\}}^{ \top}.\]

To demonstrate that \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq C_ {G}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\), it suffices to show

\[J_{1}:=\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{Tr}\Big{(}f( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t), \theta)\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{]}\right\|\leq C_ {G}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}),\] (F.4)

and

\[J_{2}:=\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{Tr}f(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)^{\top}\Big{(}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t /2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{)}\Big{]}\right\|\leq C _{G}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}),\] (F.5)

as the other part for \(h\) and \(w\) follows a similar proof approach.

To bound \(J_{1}\), by Assumption 3 (i) we have

\[J_{1}\leq\] (F.6) \[\leq \phi_{T}(r,B_{T})\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\sqrt{N+1}\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t +\Delta t/2)\|_{F}\] \[\lesssim \phi_{T}(r,B_{T})\sqrt{N+1}\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2) \|_{F}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\] \[\lesssim \frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}),\]where the fourth inequality utilizes Lemma C.5 and the last inequality uses Lemma C.6.

To bound \(J_{2}\), by Assumption 2 (ii), we have

\[\begin{split} J_{2}\leq&\sqrt{N+1}\mathbb{E}_{\mu} \Big{[}\sup_{i\in[N+1]}\Big{\|}f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta) _{:,i}\Big{\|}\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde {\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\|_{F}\Big{]}\\ =&\sqrt{N+1}\phi(B_{T})(1+r)\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[} \|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+ \Delta t/2)\|_{F}\Big{]}.\end{split}\] (F.7)

Hence, it suffices to show that \(\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+ \Delta t/2)\|_{F}\lesssim\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\) to establish \(J_{2}\leq\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\). Recalling the formula \(\widehat{p}_{\Theta}\) in (C.16), we have \(\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{p}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+ \Delta t/2)\|_{F}\leq I_{1}+I_{2}\), where

\[\begin{split} I_{1}=&(\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,1)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,1)]\\ &\Big{\{}\prod_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\Big{(}I_{ \mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\Big{)}\\ &\quad\prod_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\Big{(}I_{ \mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\Big{\}}_{ DN+d+1,:}\\ \leq&\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\\ &\Big{\|}\prod_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\Big{(}I_{ \mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\Big{)}\\ &\quad\prod_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\Big{(}I_{ \mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\Big{\|} \\ \leq&\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\\ &\quad\exp\Big{(}(\Delta t/2)\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/ \Delta t]}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\Big{\|}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\Big{\|}\\ +&(\Delta t/2)\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t ]}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\Big{\|}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{s,j})]\Big{\|}\,\Big{)}\\ \leq&\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}) \exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB_{T})(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)}\\ \lesssim&\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}), \end{split}\]\[\leq (B+B_{T})\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB_{T})(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)} \phi_{TP}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T},r)\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\] \[\lesssim \frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta}).\]

where the first inequality applies Lemma C.8, and the second inequality relies on Assumption 2 (iii) and Assumption 3 (ii). Therefore, we conclude that \(I_{2}\lesssim\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\). By combining the bounds of \(I_{1}\) and \(I_{2}\), we observe that Equation (F.5) holds, thereby establishing \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq C _{G}\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\) for some \(C_{G}\) dependent on \(N\), \(d\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions.

It remains to prove that \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}, \widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq C_{G}(1+\lambda)\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\). Note that

\[\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{ \beta},\widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq \lambda\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\] \[+ \Big{\{}\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\text {Tr}\Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\widetilde{\theta})\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta} (H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{]}^{\top},\] \[\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{w}\text{Tr}\Big{(}h( \widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2),w)-h(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde {\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2),\widetilde{w})\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H, t)\Big{]}^{\top}\Big{\}}^{\top}.\]

Therefore, we only need to show that

\[\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\text{Tr}\Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t), \widetilde{\theta})\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{]} \right\|\leq C_{G}\|\theta-\widetilde{\theta}\|,\]

and

\[\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{w}\text{Tr}\Big{(}h(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),w)-h(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t), \widetilde{w})\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)\Big{]}\right\|\leq C_{G }\|w-\widetilde{w}\|,\]to obtain \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}, \widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq C_{G}(1+\lambda)\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\). Here, we only establish the inequality above for \(f\) and \(\theta\), as the proof of the other inequality follows a similar pattern. Note that by Assumption 3 (iii), we have

\[\left\|\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{\mathrm{Tr} }\Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\widetilde{\theta})\Big{)}^{\top}\widehat{p}_{ \Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\Big{]}\right\|\] \[\leq \sup_{i\in[N+1]}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\Big{[}\left\|\nabla_{\theta} \Big{(}f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\theta)-f(\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\widetilde{\theta})\Big{)}_{:,i}\right\|\Big{]}\sqrt{ N+1}\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\|_{F}\] \[\leq \phi_{PP}(r,B_{T})\|\theta-\widetilde{\theta}\|\sqrt{N+1}\| \widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\|_{F}\] \[\lesssim \|\theta-\widetilde{\theta}\|.\]

where the last inequality applies Lemma C.6. Therefore, we conclude that \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\widetilde{\Theta},t)-\widehat{G}(\widetilde{\beta}, \widetilde{\Theta},t)\|\leq C_{G}(1+\lambda)\|\beta-\widetilde{\beta}\|\), completing the proof. 

### Proof of Lemma D.3

Proof.: Lemmas C.1 and C.4 establish that \(\max\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}:=B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))\). According to Lemma D.6, there exists an event \(E\) with \(\mathbb{P}(E)\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\) such that under \(E\), we have

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\] (F.8)

for any \(H\) and \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\). Following the same proof procedure as in Lemma D.6, with \(\rho\) replaced by \(\widehat{\rho}\), and bounding only \(J_{1}\) and \(J_{3}\) in the proof (as there is no need to utilize Hoeffding's inequality to bridge the difference due to a finite width \(M\)), we could obtain the bound

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\widehat{\rho}}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{-1}.\] (F.9)

We present the proof only for the case involving \(\rho\). The bounding of \(\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-G(\beta,\widehat{\rho},t)\|_{F}\) can be derived analogously by substituting \(\rho\) with \(\widehat{\rho}\) using Equation (F.9), and skipping the process of bounding \(\|D_{1}-D_{2}\|\) where \(D_{1}\) and \(D_{2}\) will be defined later. The bounding of \(\|G(\beta,\widehat{\rho},t)-G(\beta,\rho,t)\|\) can be straightforwardly achieved by combining the results obtained from the other two cases.

By the definitions of the gradients in Equations (C.2) and (C.3), we observe that \(\left\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-G(\beta,\rho,t)\right\|\lesssim\left\| \widehat{G}_{f}(\theta,\Theta,t)-G_{f}(\theta,\rho,t)\right\|+\left\|\widehat{ G}_{h}(w,\Theta,t)-G_{h}(w,\rho,t)\right\|\). We will focus on showing that \(\left\|2(\widehat{G}_{f}(\theta,\Theta,t)-G_{f}(\theta,\rho,t))\right\| \lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\), as the other part of the proof follows a similar approach.

Let's define the following quantities \(A_{1},A_{2},B_{1},B_{2},C_{1},C_{2}\):

\[A_{1}:= \nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta) ],\quad A_{2}:=\nabla_{\theta}\mathrm{vec}[f(T_{\rho}(H,t),\theta)]\] \[B_{1}:= \mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)-y(H)],\quad B_{2}:=\mathrm{ Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-y(H)]\] \[C_{1}:= \Big{\{}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/ \Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j =1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s), \theta_{s,j})]\Big{)}\] \[\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j =1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t /2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\Big{\}}_{DN+d+1,:}\] \[C_{2}:= \exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\Big{)}_{DN+d+1,:}\]

The universal boundedness of \(\|A_{1}\|\) and \(\|A_{2}\|\) is implied by Assumption 2 (ii), while the universal boundedness of \(|B_{1}|\) and \(|B_{2}|\) is implied by Assumption 1. Additionally, \(\|C_{1}\|\) and \(\|C_{2}\|\) can be bounded via Assumption 2 (iii), and one can refer to the proofs of Lemmas C.3 and C.6 for detailed explanations.

From (C.14) and (C.16), we could rewrite \(J:=\left\|2(\widehat{G}_{f}(\theta,\Theta,t)-G_{f}(\theta,\rho,t))\right\|\) as

\[J=\|A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}-A_{2}B_{2}C_{2}\|\leq \|(A_{1}-A_{2})B_{2}C_{2}\|+\|A_{1}(B_{1}-B_{2})C_{2}\|+\|A_{1}B_{1 }(C_{1}-C_{2})\|\] \[\leq \|A_{1}-A_{2}\|\|B_{2}\|\|C_{2}\|+\|A_{1}\|\|B_{1}-B_{2}\|\|C_{2} \|+\|A_{1}\|\|B_{1}\|\|C_{1}-C_{2}\|\] \[\lesssim \|A_{1}-A_{2}\|+\|B_{1}-B_{2}\|+\|C_{1}-C_{2}\|.\]

We claim that to obtain the result, it suffices to show that

1. \(\|A_{1}-A_{2}\|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\) under event \(E\).
2. \(\|B_{1}-B_{2}\|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\) under event \(E\).
3. There exists some event \(E_{2}\) with \(\mathbb{P}(E_{2})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\) such that \(\|C_{1}-C_{2}\|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\) under \(E\cap E_{2}\).

This is because if we can establish the above statements, then under the event \(E\cap E_{2}\) with \(\mathbb{P}(E\cap E_{2})\geq 1-2\exp(-\delta)\), we obtain \(J=\left\|2(\widehat{G}_{f}(\theta,\Theta,t)-G_{f}(\theta,\rho,t))\right\| \lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\). Given the similarity in proof for \(\left\|2(\widehat{G}_{h}(w,\Theta,t)-G_{h}(w,\rho,t))\right\|\), we deduce that with probability at least \(1-4\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\), we have \(\left\|\widehat{G}(\beta,\Theta,t)-G(\beta,\rho,t)\right\|\lesssim L^{-1}+ \sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\). The remainder of the proof focuses on bounding the quantities in statements (i)-(iii).

**Proof for statement (i):** By Assumption 3 (iv), we have \(\|A_{1}-A_{2}\|\leq\phi_{TT}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T},r)\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t )\ -\ T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\ \lesssim\ L^{-1}\ +\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\) under event \(E\).

**Proof for statement (ii):** Under event \(E\), it is obvious to see \(\|B_{1}-B_{2}\|\leq\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{- 1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\).

**Proof for statement (iii):** We further define the following quantities

\[D_{1}:= \prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta _{s,j})]\Big{)}\] \[\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t /2),w_{s,j})]\Big{)}\] \[D_{2}:= \prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta} \nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta)] \rho(\beta|s)d\beta\Big{)}\] \[\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\Big{(}I_{\mathrm{dimvec}[T]}+(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta} \nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w )]\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\Big{)}\] \[D_{3}:= \exp\Big{(}\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2) \int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\] \[+\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2)\int_{ \beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t /2),w)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\Big{)}\] \[D_{4}:= \exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\Big{)}\]

Note that \(\|C_{1}-C_{2}\|\leq\|D_{1}-D_{2}\|+\|D_{2}-D_{3}\|+\|D_{3}-D_{4}\|\). Assumption 2 (iii) indicates that for any \(s=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\) and \(j=1,\ldots,M\), we have

\[\max\{\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s), \theta_{s,j})]\|,\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta }(H,s+\Delta t/2),w_{s,j})]\|\}\leq B_{J}\]

for some constant \(B_{J}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. This implies that each column of \(\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\) or \(\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w _{s,j})]\) has \(l_{2}\) norm upper bounded by \(B_{J}\) as well. Applying Hoeffding's inequality to each column of \(\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j })]\) and \(\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w _{s,j})]\), and subsequently calculating the union bound across all columns yields:

\[\mathbb{P}\Big{(}\left\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec} [T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]-\int_{\beta}\nabla _{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})] \rho(\beta|s)d\beta\right\|\geq\sqrt{(N+1)D}z\Big{)}\] \[\leq 2(N+1)D\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2B_{J}^{2}}M)\] (F.10)

and

\[\mathbb{P}\Big{(}\left\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec} [T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{s,j})]-\int_{\beta}\nabla_{ \mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{s,j})]\rho(\beta |s)d\beta\right\|\geq\sqrt{(N+1)D}z\Big{)}\] (F.11) \[\leq 2(N+1)D\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2B_{J}^{2}}M)\]

for any \(z>0\). For (F.10) and (F.11), we further the consider the union bound across all \(s=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\), and let \(z=B_{J}\sqrt{2M(\delta+\log(2(N+1)DL))}\), which implies that with probability at least \(1-\exp(-\delta)\) with respect to the parameter initialization \(\Theta^{(0)}\), we have

\[\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]-\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f (\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\|\]

and

\[\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,t),w_{s,j})]-\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{s,j})]\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\|\]bounded by \(B_{J}\sqrt{2M(N+1)D(\delta+\log(2(N+1)DL))}\leq C_{J}\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)} {M}}\) for any \(s=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\). Here, \(C_{J}\) is some constant that only depends on \(N,D,r\) and the parameters of the assumptions. Denote this probability event by \(E_{2}\), and we have \(\mathbb{P}(E_{2})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\). Under \(E_{2}\), by Lemma C.8, we have

\[\|D_{1}-D_{2}\|\] \[\leq \frac{1}{2L}\Big{(}\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\|M^ {-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s ),\theta_{s,j})]-\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,s),\theta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\Bigg{\|}\] \[+\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\left\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1 }^{M}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),w_{s,j})] -\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+ \Delta t/2),w)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\right\|\Big{)}\] \[\leq C_{J}\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\] (F.12)

For any \(s=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\), we define

\[A_{s,j}=(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T }_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta)]\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\]

and

\[B_{s,j}=(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T }_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w)]\rho(\beta|s)d\beta.\]

Since Assumption 2 (iii) indicates that \(\max\{\|A_{s,j}\|,\|B_{s,j}\|\}\lesssim\Delta t=L^{-1}\), we have

\[\|\exp(A_{s,j})-I-A_{s,j}\|\lesssim\|A_{s,j}\|^{2},\quad\|\exp(B_{s,j})-I-B_{ s,j}\|\lesssim\|B_{s,j}\|^{2}.\]

Applying Lemma C.8 once more, we have

\[\|D_{2}-D_{3}\|\leq\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\|A_{s,j}\|^{2}+ \sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}\|B_{s,j}\|^{2}\lesssim L^{-1}.\] (F.13)

Since Assumption 2 (iii) ensures the boundedness of \(\|D_{4}\|\), we have

\[\|D_{3}-D_{4}\|\lesssim \Big{\|}\exp\Big{(}\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}( \Delta t/2)\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,s),\theta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\] (F.14) \[+\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta }\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w)] \rho(\beta,s)d\beta\] \[-\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\Big{)}-1\Big{\|}.\]

Therefore, to show that \(\|D_{3}-D_{4}\|\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\), it suffices to show that

\[J_{34}:= \Big{\|}\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+2\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2) \int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s), \theta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\] \[+\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2)\int_{ \beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta\] \[-\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\Big{\|}\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}.\]

By Assumption 3 (iv) and Lemma D.6, we have

\[\Big{\|}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta) ]-\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(T_{\rho}(H,s),\theta)]\Big{\|}\lesssim\| \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s)-T_{\rho}(H,s)\|_{F}\lesssim L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{ \delta+\log(L+1)}{M}},\]\[\begin{split}\left\|\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w)]-\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(T_{\rho}(H,s), w)]\right\|\lesssim\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2)-T_{\rho}(H,s)\|_{F}\\ \lesssim&\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2)- \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s)\|_{F}+\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s)-T_{\rho}(H,s)\|_{ F}\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}+ L^{-1}\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),w_{s,j})\|_{F}\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}, \end{split}\]

where the last inequality employs Assumption 2 (i). Therefore, we conclude that

\[\begin{split}\|D_{3}-D_{4}\|\lesssim J_{34}\lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}+\|(\Delta t/2)\int_{\beta} \nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(T_{\rho}(H,t),\theta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta \|\\ &\Big{\|}\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2) \int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[f(T_{\rho}(H,s),\theta)]\rho( \beta,s)d\beta\\ &+\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}(\Delta t/2)\int_{ \beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[h(T_{\rho}(H,s)(H,s),w)]\rho(\beta,s)d \beta\\ &-\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\Big{\|}\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}+ \sup_{|s_{1}-s_{2}|\leq\Delta t}\left\|\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,s_{1}),\beta)]-\nabla_{\text{vec}[T]}\text{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s_{2}), \beta)]\right\|\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}+ \sup_{|s_{1}-s_{2}|\leq\Delta t}\|T_{\rho}(H,s_{1})-T_{\rho}(H,s_{2})\|_{F}\\ \lesssim& L^{-1}+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}} \end{split}\] (F.15)

where the third inequality uses Assumption 3 (iv), and the last inequality relies on the Lipschitz continuity as demonstrated in Proposition C.1. Combining (F.12), (F.13), and (F.15) yields \(\|C_{1}-C_{2}\|\leq\|D_{1}-D_{2}\|+\|D_{2}-D_{3}\|+\|D_{3}-D_{4}\|\lesssim L^{-1 }+\sqrt{\frac{\delta+\log(L+1)}{M}}\). 

### Proof of Lemma D.4

Proof.: Define \(F_{\rho}(T_{\bar{\rho}},t)=\int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\bar{\rho}}(H,t),\beta)] \rho(\beta,t)d\beta\) for any \(\rho,\bar{\rho}\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\). From Taylor's expansion, we have

\[\mathrm{vec}[\dot{T}_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-\dot{T}_{\rho}(H,t)] =F_{\rho}(T_{\rho_{\eta}},t)-F_{\rho}(T_{\rho},t)+F_{\rho_{\eta}} (T_{\rho_{\eta}},t)-F_{\rho}(T_{\rho_{\eta}},t)\] \[=\Big{(}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta} }(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}\] \[+\eta\int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t),\beta)]( \nu-\rho)(\beta,t)d\beta+o(\eta)\] \[=\Big{(}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta }}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}\] \[+\eta\int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\nu-\rho) (\beta,t)d\beta\] \[+\eta\Big{(}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T _{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\nu-\rho)(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{ \rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}+o(\eta)\] \[=\Big{(}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta }}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}\] \[+\eta\int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\nu-\rho)( \beta,t)d\beta+o(\eta),\]

of which the last equality holds as Lemma C.2 shows that \(\|T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}=O(W_{2}(\rho_{\eta},\rho))=O(\eta)\), where we hide the constant dependence on \(B,K,N,r\). Therefore, we have

\[\frac{d}{dt}\Big{\{}\exp\Big{(}-\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}\nabla _{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta) \Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}\Big{\}}\] \[= \exp\Big{(}-\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta)\Big{)}\] \[\Big{\{}\mathrm{vec}[\dot{T}_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-\dot{T}_{\rho}(H,t)]-\Big{(}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{)}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[T_{\rho_{\eta}}(H,t)-T_ {\rho}(H,t)]\Big{)}\Big{\}}\] \[= \exp\Big{(}-\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta)\Big{)}\Big{\{}\eta \int_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)](\nu-\rho)(\beta,t)d\beta+o( \eta)\Big{\}},\] (F.16)

which leads to (D.18). 

### Proof of Lemma D.5

Proof.: Fix \((\beta,t)\in P_{r}\). Lemma C.2 implies that

\[\|p_{\rho}(H,1)-p_{\nu}(H,1)\|_{F}=|\mathrm{Read}(T_{\rho}(H,1)-\mathrm{Read}(T _{\nu}(H,1)|\leq C_{r}W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\leq C_{r}(r+1)\|\rho-\nu\|_{1}\]

for some constant \(C_{r}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Our goal is to regulate the difference between \(\dot{p}_{\rho}(H,t)\) and \(\dot{p}_{\nu}(H,t)\) to control the the propagation of \(\|p_{\rho}(H,\cdot)-p_{\nu}(H,\cdot)\|\).

Note that by (C.14) and Assumption 2,

\[\frac{d}{dt}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq \|\dot{p}_{\rho}(H,t)-\dot{p}_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\] \[= \Big{\|}\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{ \mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\] \[-\mathrm{vec}[p_{\nu}(H,t)]^{\top}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{ vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)]\nu(\beta,t)d\beta\Big{\|}\] \[\leq \|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\int_{\beta}\big{\|}\nabla_{ \mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\big{\|}\,\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\] \[+ \|p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\int_{\beta}\big{\|}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)]\big{\|}\,(\rho-\nu)(\beta,t)d\beta\] \[\leq L_{r,1}\Big{(}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\int_{\beta} \rho(\beta,t)d\beta+\|p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\|\rho(\cdot,t)-\nu(\cdot,t)\|_{1} \Big{)}\] \[\leq L_{r,1}\Big{(}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\int_{\beta} \rho(\beta,t)d\beta+L_{r,2}\|\rho(\cdot,t)-\nu(\cdot,t)\|_{1}\Big{)}\] (F.17)

where

\[L_{r,1}=\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2})))(1+r+r^{2})\]

and

\[L_{r,2}=(B+B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2})))\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+r +r^{2}))(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)}.\]

The third inequality of (F.17) uses Lemma C.1 to obtain

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq \sqrt{N+1}B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))\]

and

\[\|T_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}\|T_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq\sqrt{ N+1}B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))\]

with Assumption 2(iii) to bound the norm of the Jacobian matrix with \(L_{r,1}\). The last inequality of (F.17) employs Lemma C.3 to bound \(\|p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\) with \(L_{r,2}\). Applying the Gronwall's inequality to (F.17), we obtain

\[\|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq C_{r}(r+1)\exp(L_{r,1})\|\rho-\nu\|_{1}+\int_{0}^{1}L_{r,1}L_{r,2} \exp(L_{r,1}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta ds)\|\rho(\cdot,t)- \nu(\cdot,t)\|_{1}dt\] \[\leq C_{r}(r+1)\exp(L_{r,1})\|\rho-\nu\|_{1}+L_{r,1}L_{r,2}\exp(L_{r,1 })\int_{0}^{1}\|\rho(\cdot,t)-\nu(\cdot,t)\|_{1}dt\] \[= (C_{r}+L_{r,1}L_{r,2})\exp(L_{r,1}))\|\rho-\nu\|_{1}\] (F.18)

Since

\[\int_{0}^{1}\|\rho(\cdot,t)-\nu(\cdot,t)\|_{1}dt=\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}|\rho (\beta,t)-\nu(\beta,t)|d\beta dt=\|\rho-\nu\|_{1}.\]

Thus, we complete the proof of the first result.

By Lemma C.3, under Assumption 1 we have

\[\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}\leq L_{r,3}:=(B+B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2})))\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)}.\]

In addition, by Lemma C.1, under Assumption 2 (i) we have

\[\|g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}\|g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta)\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\leq L_{r,4}:=KB\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))(1+r+r^{2}).\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:50]

Denote \(B_{T}(1+(K/2)(1+r+r^{2}))\) by \(\bar{B}_{T}\). Combining the two equations in (2.4) gives us

\[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)=\mathrm{MLP}_{w_{t,1},\ldots,w_{ t,M}}\Big{(}\mathrm{Attn}_{\theta_{t,1},\ldots,\theta_{t,M}}(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,t),\Delta t/2),\Delta t/2\Big{)}\] (F.22) \[= \mathrm{Attn}_{\theta_{t,1},\ldots,\theta_{t,M}}(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,t),\Delta t/2)+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}h\Big{(}\mathrm{Attn}_ {\theta_{t,1},\ldots,\theta_{t,M}}(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\Delta t/2),w_{t,j}\Big{)}\] \[= \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}f( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta_{t,j})+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}h \Big{(}\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\] \[+ (\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t), \theta_{t,j}),w_{t,j}\Big{)}\]

Then, from the formula of (F.22) and Assumption 2 (iii), we see that for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\),

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t )\|_{F}\] (F.23) \[\leq \|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{F}\Big{(}1+ (\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+\|\theta_{t,j} \|+\|\theta_{t,j}\|^{2})\Big{)}\] \[+ (\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{ T})(1+\|w_{t,j}\|+\|w_{t,j}\|^{2})\] \[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)+(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}f( \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\theta_{t,j})-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{F}\] \[\leq \|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{F}\Big{(}1+ \Delta tM^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{T})(1+\|\beta_{t, j}\|+\|\beta_{t,j}\|^{2})\Big{)}\] \[+ \sqrt{N+1}B_{T}(K\Delta t/2)(1+r+r^{2})(\Delta t/2)M^{-1}\sum_{j= 1}^{M}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{T})(1+\|w_{t,j}\|+\|w_{t,j}\|^{2})\] \[\leq \|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{F}\Big{(}1+ \Delta t\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{T})(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)}\] \[+ \sqrt{N+1}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{T})B_{T}(K\Delta t^{2}/ 4)(1+r+r^{2})^{2}\]

Therefore, applying (F.23), we deduce that for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\), we have:

\[\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq\sqrt {N+1}B_{T}(K\Delta t^{2}/4)(1+r+r^{2})\frac{\exp(\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B} _{T})(1+r+r^{2}))}{\Delta t}C_{1}L^{-1}\] (F.24)

where \(C_{1}:=\sqrt{N+1}B_{T}K(1+r+r^{2})\exp(\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}\bar{B}_{T})(1+r +r^{2}))/4\).

**Bounding \(J_{2}\):** For any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta,i\in[N+1],j\in[M]\), we have \(\|g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})_{:,i}\|\leq B_{T}\). Hence, by the Hoeffding's inequality, for any \(z>0\) we have

\[\mathbb{P}(\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})_{:,i}- \int_{\beta}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})_{:,i}\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\| \geq z)\leq 2\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2B_{T}^{2}}M).\]

By the union bound over \(i\in[N+1]\) and \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\), the above inequality implies

\[\mathbb{P}(\sup_{t}\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})- \int_{\beta}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\geq z)\leq 2(N+1)L\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2B_{T}^{2}}M).\]

We let \(z=B_{T}\sqrt{2M^{-1}(\delta+\log((N+1)L))}\). Then, (F.25) turns into

\[\mathbb{P}(\sup_{t}\|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})- \int_{\beta}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\geq B_{T}\sqrt{2M^{-1}(\delta+\log((N+1)L))}\leq\exp(-\delta).\] (F.26)Denote the event such that

\[\sup_{t}\lVert M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})-\int_{ \beta}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\rVert_{2-\mathrm{ col}}\leq B_{T}\sqrt{2M^{-1}(\delta+\log((N+1)L))}\]

by \(E_{\delta}\). (F.26) directly indicates \(\mathbb{P}(E_{\delta})\geq 1-\exp(-\delta)\).

Suppose that the high probability event \(E_{\delta}\) occurs. Let's denote \(B_{T}\sqrt{2M^{-1}(\delta+\log((N+1)L))}\) by \(B_{\delta}\) for brevity. From Assumption 2 (iii), it follows that for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta\),

\[\lVert\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t+ \Delta t)\rVert_{F}\leq \lVert\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] \[+ \Delta t\lVert M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_ {t,j})-\int_{\beta}g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})\rho(\beta|t)d\beta \rVert_{F}\] \[+ \Delta t\lVert\int_{\beta}(g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})- g(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta_{t,j}))\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \lVert\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}+ \Delta t\sqrt{N+1}B_{\delta}+\] \[+ \Delta t\int_{\beta}\lVert g(\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})- g(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta_{t,j})\rVert_{F}\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\] \[\leq \lVert\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}(1 +\Delta t\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+r^{2}))\] \[+ \Delta t\sqrt{N+1}B_{\delta}.\] (F.27)

Repeatedly applying Equation (F.27) yields

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\bar{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\leq \frac{\sqrt{N+1}B_{\delta}}{\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+r^{ 2})}\exp(\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+r^{2}))\] \[= C_{2}\sqrt{M^{-1}(\delta+\log((N+1)L))}.\] (F.28)

for some constant \(C_{2}>0\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result.

**Bounding \(J_{3}\):** It's worth noting that the convergence proof with a convergence rate of \(O(\Delta t)=O(\frac{1}{L})\) for \(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\), the first-order Euler method for \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\), is non-standard. This departure from convention arises because we do not assume the boundedness of the second-order derivative \(\frac{d^{2}T_{\rho}(H,t)}{dt^{2}}\), instead relying on the continuity of \(\rho(\cdot,t)\) with respect to the depth index \(t\). In this proof, \(O(\cdot)\) hides dependencies on \(N\), \(D\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions.

From the definition of \(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}\) and \(T_{\rho}\), we have

\[\lVert\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t)-T_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t) \rVert_{F}\leq \lVert\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] \[+\underbrace{\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t)-T_{\rho}(H,t)-\Delta t \int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\rVert_{F}}_{I_{1}}\] \[+\Delta t\underbrace{\lVert\int_{\beta}(g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)- g(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta))\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\rVert_{F}}_{I_{2}}.\] (F.29)To bound \(I_{1}\), we use (3.1) to get

\[\begin{split} I_{1}\leq&\|\int_{t}^{t+\Delta t}\int_{ \beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)\rho(\beta|s)d\beta ds-\Delta t\int_{\beta}g(T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\|_{F}\\ \leq&\Delta t\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}g (T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)\rho(\beta|s)d\beta-\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta) \rho(\beta|t)d\beta\|_{F}\\ \leq&\Delta t\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}( g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta))\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\|_{F}\\ &+\Delta t\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)(\rho(\beta|s)-\rho(\beta|t))d\beta\|_{F}\\ \leq&\Delta t\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\int_{\beta} \|g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\rho(\beta|s)d\beta\\ &+\Delta t\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t ),\beta)(\rho(\beta|s)-\rho(\beta|t))d\beta\|_{F}\end{split}\] (F.30)

Given that Proposition C.1 establishes the Lipschitz continuity of \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) with respect to \(t\) under the condition that \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) has a bounded support, we can conclude:

\[\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)-g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F} \leq C_{3,1}|t-s|\leq C_{3,1}\Delta t\] (F.31)

for some constant \(C_{3,1}>0\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Furthermore, Lemma C.1 and Proposition C.1 demonstrate that \(g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\) is both bounded and Lipschitz continuous with respect to \(\beta\). Thus, we have

\[\begin{split}\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H, t),\beta)(\rho(\beta|s)-\rho(\beta|t))d\beta\|_{F}&=\sup_{s\in[t,t+ \Delta t]}\|\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)(\rho(\beta,s)-\rho(\beta,t))d \beta\|_{F}\\ &\leq\sup_{s\in[t,t+\Delta t]}C_{3,2}\|\rho(\cdot,s)-\rho(\cdot,t )\|_{\rm BL}\\ \leq& C_{3,2}C_{\rho}\Delta t\end{split}\] (F.32)

for some constant \(C_{3,2}>0\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Substituting (F.31) and (F.32) into (F.30), we find that there exists a constant \(C_{3,5}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result such that \(I_{1}\leq C_{3,5}\Delta t^{2}\).

Additionally, Assumption 2 (iii) implies that

\[\begin{split} I_{2}\leq&\int_{\beta}\|g(T_{\rho}(H, t),\beta)-g(\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\rho(\beta|t)d\beta\\ \leq&\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+r^{2})\|T_{ \rho}(H,t),\beta)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\end{split}\] (F.33)

Therefore, by bounding \(I_{1}+I_{2}\), we obtain the following inequality

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t),\beta)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t+\Delta t),\beta)\|_{F} \leq C_{3,5}\Delta t^{2}+(1+C_{3,6}\Delta t)\|T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)-\widetilde{T} _{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F},\] (F.34)

which implies, after being used multiple times, that

\[\|T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)-\widetilde{T}_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\leq C_{3,5} \Delta t^{2}\frac{(1+C_{3,6}\Delta t)^{L+1}-1}{C_{3,6}\Delta t}\leq C_{3}L^{-1}\] (F.35)

for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\) and some constant \(C_{3}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result. Combining (F.24), (F.28), and (F.35) yields the desired result. 

### Proof of Lemma e.1

Proof.: Let \(\widetilde{\mu}(t)\) be the measure induced by \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) with \(H\sim\mu\), and \(\widetilde{\mu}\) be \(\widetilde{\mu}(t^{*})\). By verifying Lemma C.1, we establish that \(\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}:=B\exp(K(1+r+r^{2}))\) for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\). Consequently, \(\mathrm{supp}(\vec{\mu}(t))\subset\{T:\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}\}\) for any \(t\in[0,1]\). The remainder of the proof involves four steps:

**Step I: Show that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to \((H,t)\)**

In the proof of this proposition, when referring to the Lipschitz continuity of a function, we imply its Lipschitz continuity for \(H\) within the support of \(\mu\). Recall that we have shown in Lemma C.3 that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is universally bounded and Lipschitz continuous for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) and any \(t\in[0,1]\).

From the formula of \(p_{\rho}\) in (C.14), for any \(H,H^{\prime}\), we have

\[\begin{split}&\|p_{\rho}(H,t)-p_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)\|_{F}=\| \mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]-\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)]\|\\ \leq&\underbrace{|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{ \rho}(H^{\prime},1)]-(y(H)-y(H^{\prime}))|}_{I_{1}}\underbrace{\left\|\exp \Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho }(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\right\|}_{I_{2}}\\ +&\underbrace{|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},1)] -y(H^{\prime})|}_{I_{3}}\\ &\cdot\underbrace{\left\|\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta} \nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d \beta ds\Big{)}-\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},s),\beta)]\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)} \right\|}_{I_{4}}.\end{split}\] (F.36)

From Proposition C.1, we observe that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is Lipschitz continuous. Since \(y(\cdot)\) is \(K_{y}\)-Lipschitz continuous, as given in Assumption 4 (iii), we obtain that \(I_{1}\lesssim\|H-H^{\prime}\|_{F}\). Moreover, from Assumption 1 and Lemma C.1, we see that \(I_{3}\) is universally bounded. Therefore, to show that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is Lipschitz continuous for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\), it suffices to demonstrate that \(I_{2}\lesssim 1\) and \(I_{4}\lesssim\|H-H^{\prime}\|_{F}\).

From Assumption 2 (iii), we have

\[\begin{split} I_{2}&\leq\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_ {\beta}\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)] \right\|\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\leq\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_ {T})(1+r+r^{2})\Big{)}.\end{split}\]

Thus, dividing \(I_{4}\) by the uniformly bounded part \(I_{2}\), we obtain

\[\begin{split} I_{4}\leq&\left\|\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{ 1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H^{\prime },s),\beta)]-\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)] \Big{)}\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}-I_{\mathrm{divvec}[T]}\right\|\\ \leq&\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\left\| \nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\Big{(}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},s),\beta)] -\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)]\Big{)}\right\| \rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}-1\\ \leq&\exp\Big{(}\phi_{TT}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T},r) \sup_{t\in[0,1]}\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)\|_{F}\Big{)}-1,\end{split}\] (F.37)

where the final inequality holds by Assumption 3 (iv).

By the Lipschitz continuity of \(T_{\rho}(H,t)\) for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) as stated in Proposition C.1, we have \(\sup_{t\in[0,1]}\|T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\rho}(H^{\prime},t)\|_{F}\lesssim\|H-H^{ \prime}\|_{F}\). Hence, utilizing the universal boundedness of the last equation in (F.37), we derive \(I_{4}\lesssim\|H-H^{\prime}\|_{F}\).

Considering all assertions regarding \(I_{1},I_{2},I_{3}\) and \(I_{4}\), we conclude that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is \(C_{p}\)-Lipschitz continuous with respect to \(H\) for some constant \(C_{p}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result that is sufficiently large. The Lipschitz continuity of \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) with respect to \(t\) could be easily derived from the boundedness of the Jacobian matrix, as asserted in Assumption 2 (iii). Moreover, since \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is universally bounded shown in Lemma C.3, we conclude that \(p_{\rho}(H,t)\) is Lipschitz continuous with respect to \((H,t)\) for some universal Lipschitz constant \(C_{p}\) dependent on the parameters listed in the result that is sufficiently large.

**Step II: Prepare bounds related to \(p_{\rho}\) for later use**

(C.14) implies that \(p_{\rho}\) solves the adjoint equation

\[\mathrm{vec}[\dot{p}_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top}=-\mathrm{vec}[p_{\rho}(H,t)]^{\top} \int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)]\rho( \beta,t)d\beta\] (F.38)with

\[\left\|\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)] \rho(\beta,t)d\beta\right\|\leq(1+C_{\rho}/2)\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+ r^{2})=:C_{0}\]

implied by Assumption 2 (iii). Therefore, the Gronwall's inequality directly indicates that

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}^{2}\geq\exp(-2C_{0}t)\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p _{\rho}(H,1)\|_{F}^{2}\geq\exp(-2C_{0})\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho} (H,1)]-y(H)|^{2}]\geq 2\exp(-2C_{0})R(\rho),\]

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}^{2}\leq\exp(2C_{0}t)\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p _{\rho}(H,1)\|_{F}^{2}\leq\exp(2C_{0})\mathbb{E}_{\mu}[|\mathrm{Read}[T_{\rho} (H,1)]-y(H)|^{2}]\leq 2\exp(2C_{0})R(\rho),\]

for any \(t\in[0,1]\).

**Step III: Construct the descent direction \(\nu\)**

By the well-posedness of the ODE solution to (3.1) as shown in Proposition C.1, the solution map \(T_{\rho}(H,\cdot)\) is invertible. Hence, for any \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\), there exists a continuous inverse map \(T_{t}^{-1}\) such that \(T_{t}^{-1}(T_{\rho}(H,t))=H\) for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\). Let's define the following function \(\bar{F}(T)\) to approximate

\[\bar{F}(T)=-p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})+\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\rho(\beta |t^{*})d\beta-\frac{h(T,w_{0})}{2},\]

The function \(\bar{F}(T)\), arising from the composition of \(p_{\rho}(\cdot,t)\) and \(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(\cdot)\), exhibits continuity over \(T\in\mathrm{supp}(\bar{\mu})\) owing to the continuous nature of \(p_{\rho}(\cdot,t)\) and \(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(\cdot)\). Therefore, Assumption 4 (ii) could be applied to \(\bar{F}\). Since \(f(\cdot,\theta)\) is a universal kernel constrained on \(\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}\times\mathcal{K}\)[52], and \(\bar{F}(T)\) is continuous with respect to \(T\), there exists a sequence \(\{(c_{k},\theta^{k})\}_{k\geq 0}\subset(\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{ \mathrm{dim}\theta_{1}}\times\mathcal{K})^{\mathbb{N}}\) such that

\[\left\|\bar{F}(T)-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}c_{k}f(T,\theta^{k})\right\|_{\max}\leq \epsilon/3\] (F.39)

given some \(\epsilon>0\) and any \(T\) such that \(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}\). Notably, since \(f(T,\theta_{1}^{k},\theta_{2}^{k})=-f(T,-\theta_{1}^{k},\theta_{2}^{k})\), we could assume without loss of generality that \(c^{k}\geq 0\) for any \(k\). Furthermore, there exists a constant \(k_{\epsilon}\) such that

\[\left\|\bar{F}(T)-\sum_{k=1}^{k_{\epsilon}}c_{k}f(T,\theta^{k})\right\|_{\max} \leq 2\epsilon/3.\] (F.40)

We define \(C(\epsilon):=\sum_{k=1}^{k_{\epsilon}}c_{k}\), and \(\bar{\nu}(\beta)\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}\beta})\) as the probability distribution such that, given \(\bar{\beta}\sim\bar{\nu}\) and for any \(k\geq 0\), \(\bar{\beta}\) has probability \(c^{k}/C(\epsilon)\) of being \((2C(\epsilon)\theta_{1}^{k},\theta_{2},0)\). Then, (F.40) transforms into

\[\left\|F(T)-\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\bar{\nu}(\beta)d\beta\right\|_{\max}\leq 2 \epsilon/3,\] (F.41)

where

\[F(T)==-p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})+\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\rho(\beta|t^{ *})d\beta.\]

From (F.41), we claim that there exists some \(R(\epsilon)\) such that

* \(\bar{\nu}(\{\beta:1/R(\epsilon)\leq\|\beta\|\leq R(\epsilon)\})\geq 1/2\),
* \(\left\|\int_{\|\beta\|>R(\epsilon)}g(T,\beta)\bar{\nu}(\beta)d\beta\right\|_{ \max}\leq\epsilon/3\).

We are now in the position to define the descent direction \(\nu\). By defining \(\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{\mathrm{dim}\beta})\) as the measure obtained by truncating any part outside \(1/R(\epsilon)\leq\|\beta\|\leq R(\epsilon)\) from \(\bar{\nu}\), and scaling the measure function by \(1/\bar{\nu}(\{\beta:1/R(\epsilon)\leq\|\beta\|\leq R(\epsilon)\})\leq 2\), we can establish that

\[\left\|F(T)-\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\nu(\beta)d\beta\right\|_{\max}\leq\epsilon.\] (F.42)

for any \(T\) such that \(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}\). A straightforward deduction from (F.42) is that for any \(T\) such that \(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B_{T}\), we have \(\|F(T)-\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\nu(\beta)d\beta\|_{F}\leq\epsilon\sqrt{(N+1)D}\). It is clear that \(\nu\) hasa bounded support as \(\{\beta:1/R(\epsilon)\leq\|\beta\|\leq R(\epsilon)\}\). We will determine the value of \(\epsilon\) later, ensuring it based only on \(N\), \(D\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions.

**Step IV: Upper bound \(\int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t^{*})\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho( \beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\) to complete the proof**

Utilizing the gradient definition in (3.4) and \(\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\rho(\beta|t^{*})d\beta=F(T)+p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t ^{*})\), we obtain

\[\int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t^{*})\Big{(}\nu( \beta)-\rho(\beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\] \[= \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\int_{\beta}\text{Tr}\Big{[}g(T_{\rho}(H,t^{*}), \beta)^{\top}p_{\rho}(H,t^{*})\Big{]}\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho(\beta|t^{*})\Big{)} d\beta+\frac{\lambda}{2}\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho( \beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\] \[\leq \mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\text{Tr}\Big{[}g(T,\beta) ^{\top}\Big{(}\widetilde{v}(\beta)-\rho(\beta|t^{*})\Big{)}p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}} ^{-1}(T),t^{*})\Big{]}+\frac{\lambda}{2}(R(\epsilon)+r)\] \[= \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\text{Tr}\Big{[} \Big{(}F(T)-\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta)\nu(\beta)d\beta\Big{)}^{\top}p_{\rho}(T_{t^ {*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})\Big{]}}_{J_{1}}\] \[- \underbrace{\mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\text{Tr}\Big{[} p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})^{\top}p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})\Big{]}}_{J_{2}}+ \frac{\lambda}{2}(R(\epsilon)+r)\]

For \(\rho\in\mathcal{P}^{2}\) concentrated on \(P_{r}\), we observe

\[R(\rho)\leq\frac{1}{2}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\big{[}\Big{(}|\text{Read}[T_{\rho}(H,1) ]|+|y(H)|\Big{)}^{2}\big{]}\leq\frac{1}{2}(B_{T}+B)^{2}.\]

Hence, to bound \(J_{1}\), we have

\[J_{1}\leq \mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\|F(T)-\int_{\beta}g(T,\beta )\nu(\beta)d\beta\|_{F}\cdot\|p_{\rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})\|_{F}dt\] (F.43) \[\leq \sqrt{(N+1)D}\epsilon\mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\|p_{ \rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})\|_{F}dt\] \[\leq (N+1)D\epsilon\Big{(}\mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\|p_{ \rho}(T_{t^{*}}^{-1}(T),t^{*})\|_{F}^{2}\Big{)}^{1/2}dt\] \[= (N+1)D\epsilon\Big{(}\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}^{2} \Big{)}^{1/2}dt\] \[\leq \sqrt{2}(N+1)D\exp(C_{0})R(\rho)^{1/2}\epsilon\] \[\leq (N+1)(B_{T}+B)(N+1)D\exp(C_{0})R(\rho)\epsilon\] \[= C_{3}R(\rho)\epsilon,\]

where \(C_{3}:=(N+1)(B_{T}+B)(N+1)D\exp(C_{0})\).

To bound \(J_{2}\), we have

\[J_{2}= \mathbb{E}_{T\sim\widetilde{\mu}(t)}\|p_{\rho}(T_{t}^{-1}(T),t)\|_ {F}^{2}dt\] (F.44) \[= \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F}^{2}dt\] \[\geq \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\exp(-2C_{0})\|p_{\rho}(H,1)\|_{F}^{2}dt\] \[\geq \frac{1}{2}\exp(-2C_{0})R(\rho).\]

Combining (F.43) and (F.44), by choosing \(\epsilon=\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0})/C_{3}\), which only depends on \(N\), \(D\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions, we have

\[\int_{\beta}\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t^{*})\Big{(}\nu(\beta)-\rho( \beta|t^{*})\Big{)}d\beta\leq-\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0})R(\rho)+\frac{\lambda}{2} \Big{(}R(\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0})/C_{3})+r\Big{)}.\]

Setting \(B_{r}=R(\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0})/C_{3}),C_{1}=\Big{(}R(\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0}) /C_{3})+r\Big{)}/2\), and \(C_{2}=\frac{1}{4}\exp(-2C_{0})\) completes the proof.

### Proof of Lemma c.1

Proof.: By applying the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we trivially obtain \(\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert_{2}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt\leq A\). Thus, leveraging (3.1) and Assumption 2 (i), we can infer

\[\frac{d}{dt}\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq\lVert \dot{T}_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}} =\lVert\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\rVert _{2-\mathrm{col}}\] (F.45) \[\leq\int_{\beta}\lVert g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{ col}}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\] \[\leq\int_{\beta}K(1+||\beta||_{2}+||\beta||_{2}^{2})\rho(\beta,t )\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}d\beta.\]

Therefore, by the Gronwall's inequality, we have

\[\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}} \leq\lVert T_{\rho}(H,0)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\exp(\int_{0}^{1} \int_{\beta}K(1+||\beta||_{2}+||\beta||_{2}^{2})\rho(\beta,t)d\beta dt)\] (F.46) \[\leq\lVert H\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\exp(K(1+A+A^{2})).\]

### Proof of Lemma c.2

Proof.: As per Lemma C.1, the boundedness of \(\lVert T_{\nu}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) and \(\lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) is established by a constant \(C:=\lVert H\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))>0\) for all \(t\in[0,1]\). Consequently, from (3.1), this implies

\[\lVert T_{\nu}(H,t_{1})-T_{\nu}(H,t_{2})\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\lVert\dot{T}_{\nu}^{\prime}(H,t)\rVert_{2- \mathrm{col}}\] (F.47) \[\leq \int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}\int_{\beta}\lVert g(T_{\nu}(H,t),\beta \rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\nu(\beta,t)d\beta dt\] \[\leq (1+C_{\rho}/2)KC(1+r+r^{2})(t_{2}-t_{1}).\]

for any \(t_{1},t_{2}\in[0,1]\). Therefore, \(T_{\nu}(H,t)\) is \((1+C_{\rho}/2)KC(1+r+r^{2})\)-Lipschitz with respect to \(t\) for \(\lVert\cdot\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\), and thus \(\sqrt{N+1}(1+C_{\rho}/2)KC(1+r+r^{2})\)-Lipschitz with respect to \(t\) for \(\lVert\cdot\rVert_{F}\). Note that by (3.1),

\[\Delta(H,t):= \lVert T_{\rho}(H,t)-T_{\nu}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] (F.48) \[= \lVert\int_{0}^{\top}\dot{T}_{\rho}(H,s)-\dot{T}_{\nu}(H,s)ds \rVert_{F}\] \[= \lVert\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)\rho( \beta,t)d\beta ds-\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\nu(\beta,s) d\beta ds\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \underbrace{\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}\lVert g(T_{\rho}(H,s), \beta)-g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\rVert_{F}\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds}_{J_{1}}\] \[+\underbrace{\lVert\int_{0}^{\top}\int_{\beta}g(T_{\nu}(H,s), \beta)\Big{(}\rho-\nu\Big{)}(\beta,s)d\beta ds\rVert_{F}}_{J_{2}}\]

We then bound \(J_{1}\) and \(J_{2}\) using the following two lemmas separately. Firstly, since \(\lVert T_{\rho}\rVert_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}C\) and \(\lVert T_{\nu}\rVert_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}C\), we have by Assumption 2 that

\[\lVert g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)-g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\rVert_{F} \leq\Big{(}\sup_{\lVert T\rVert_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}C}\lVert\nabla_{ \mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T,\beta)]\rVert_{2}\Big{)}\lVert T_{\rho}(H,s) -T_{\nu}(H,s)\rVert_{F}\] (F.49) \[\leq\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}C)(1+r+r^{2})\Delta(H,s)\]Therefore, by (F.48) we have

\[J_{1}\leq\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}C)(1+C_{\rho}/2)(1+r+r^{2})\int_{0}^{\top}\Delta( H,s)ds.\] (F.49)

Secondly, we aim to bound the integral \(J_{2}\) given Assumption 2 and \(\|T_{\nu}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq C\) on \(t\in[0,1]\). Again by Assumption 2 we have

\[\|\nabla_{\beta}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)]\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^ {N+1}\|\nabla_{\beta}g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)_{:,i}\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}^{2}}\leq \sqrt{N+1}\phi_{P}(C)(1+r)\] (F.50)

\[\|\nabla_{T}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)]\|_{F}\leq\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N +1}C)(1+r+r^{2})\] (F.51)

Since \(T_{\nu}(H,s)\) is \(\sqrt{N+1}(1+C_{\rho}/2)KC(1+r+r^{2})\)-Lipschitz with respect to \(s\) for \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) (as shown in (F.46)), by (F.51), we obtain that \(g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\) is \(\sqrt{N+1}(1+C_{\rho}/2)KC\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}C)(1+r+r^{2})^{2}\)-Lipschitz with respect to \(s\). Thus, \(g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\) is \(C^{\prime}\)-Lipschitz with respect to \((s,\beta)\), where \(C^{\prime}=\sqrt{N+1}(1+C_{\rho}/2)KC\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}C)(1+r+r^{2})^{2}+ \sqrt{N+1}\phi_{P}(C)(1+r)\). This indicates, by the Kantorovich-Rubinstein Theorem (see Theorem 5.10 of [68], for example), that

\[J_{2}=\|\int_{0}^{1}\int_{D}g(T_{\nu}(H,s),\beta)\Big{(}\rho-\nu\Big{)}(\beta, s)d\beta ds\|_{F}\leq C^{\prime}W_{1}(\rho,\nu).\] (F.52)

Define \(C^{*}:=\max\{C^{\prime},\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}C)(1+r+r^{2})\}\). By combining (F.49) and (F.52), we have

\[\Delta(H,t)\leq C^{*}\int_{0}^{\top}\Delta(H,s)ds+C^{*}W_{1}(\rho,\nu).\] (F.53)

Applying the Gronwall's inequality then shows

\[\Delta(H,t)\leq C^{*}\exp(C^{*}t)W_{1}(\rho,\nu).\] (F.54)

Specifically, we have \(\|T_{\rho}(H,1)-T_{\nu}(H,1)\|_{F}\leq C^{*}\exp(C^{*})W_{1}(\rho,\nu)\). 

### Proof of Lemma c.3

Proof.: Let's consider a fixed \((\beta,t)\) pair within \(P_{r}\). Given Lemma c.1, we establish \(\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))\). Consequently, under Assumption 1, we deduce

\[\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F} \leq\sqrt{N+1}\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\] \[\leq\sqrt{N+1}K\|T_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}(1+r+r^{2})\] (F.55) \[\leq\sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))(1+r+r^{2}).\]

On the other hand, from (C.14), we have

\[\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F} \leq|\mathrm{Read}(T_{\rho}(H,1))-y(H)|\cdot\left\|\exp\Big{(}\int _{t}^{1}\int_{\beta}\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta )\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds]\Big{)}\right\|_{2}\] \[\leq(B+B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2})))\exp\Big{(}\int_{t}^{1}\int_{\beta} \left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[g(T_{\rho}(H,s),\beta)\big{)} \right\|\rho(\beta,s)d\beta ds\Big{)}\] \[\leq(B+B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2})))\exp\Big{(}\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta} \phi_{T}(N,D,\|T_{\rho}(H,s)\|_{F})(1+\|\beta\|+\|\beta\|^{2})\rho(\beta,s)d \beta ds\Big{)}\] \[\leq(B+B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2})))\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB \exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))(1+A+A^{2})\Big{)}\] (F.56)

Combining (F.55) and (F.56), we could obtain

\[\left\|\frac{\delta Q}{\delta\rho}(\beta,t)\right\|\leq \mathbb{E}_{\mu}\|g(T_{\rho}(H,t),\beta)\|_{F}\|p_{\rho}(H,t)\|_{F }+\frac{\lambda}{2}r^{2}\] \[\leq \sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))(1+r+r^{2})(B+B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2})))\] \[\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))(1+A+A^{2} )\Big{)}+\frac{\lambda}{2}r^{2}.\]

### Proof of Lemma c.4

Proof.: By employing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we readily observe that \(\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert\beta\rVert\leq A\). Consequently, leveraging (2.4) and Assumption 2, we ascertain that for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\), we obtain:

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq\lVert \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\Big{\{}1+\frac{1}{2ML}\sum_{j =1}^{M}K(1+\lVert\theta_{t,j}\rVert+\lVert\theta_{t,j}\rVert^{2})\Big{\}}\]

Therefore, by applying (F.57) multiple times, we obtain that for any \(t=0,\Delta t/2,\ldots,(L-1/2)\Delta t,1\),

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq \lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,0)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\prod_{t} \Big{\{}1+\frac{1}{2ML}\sum_{j=1}^{M}K(1+\lVert\theta_{t,j}\rVert+\lVert \theta_{t,j}\rVert^{2})\Big{\}}\Big{\{}1+\frac{1}{2ML}\sum_{j=1}^{M}K(1+\lVert w _{t,j}\rVert+\lVert w_{t,j}\rVert^{2})\] \[\leq \lVert H\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\exp\Big{(}\frac{K}{ML}\sum_{t} \sum_{j=1}^{M}1+\lVert\beta_{t,j}\rVert+\lVert\beta_{t,j}\rVert^{2}\Big{)}\] \[\leq \lVert H\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\exp\Big{(}K(1+A+A^{2})\Big{)}.\]

### Proof of Lemma c.5

Proof.: Lemma c.4 shows that \(\lVert\widetilde{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) and \(\lVert\widetilde{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\rVert_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) are bounded by \(B_{T}:=B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))\) for any \(H\) and \(t\in[0,1]\). From (2.4), for any \(t=0,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\), from Assumption 2 (ii) and (iii) we have

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde {\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}} (H,t)\rVert_{F}+\frac{\Delta t/2}{M}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert f(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,t),\theta_{t,j})-f(\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t),\widetilde{ \theta}_{t,j})\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}} (H,t)\rVert_{F}+(\Delta t/2)\sqrt{N+1}\phi_{P}(B_{T})(1+r)M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M }\lVert\theta_{t,j}-\widetilde{\theta}_{t,j}\rVert\] (F.58) \[+(\Delta t/2)\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})(1+r+r^{2})\lVert \widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\rVert_{F}\] \[\leq \lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}} (H,t)\rVert_{F}(1+C_{1}(\Delta t/2))+(\Delta t/2)C_{2}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M} \lVert\theta_{t,j}-\widetilde{\theta}_{t,j}\rVert.\]

for some constant \(C_{1}\) and \(C_{2}\) depending only \(N,D,r\) and assumptions. Similarly, we have

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde {\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t)\rVert_{F}\leq \lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)-\widehat{T}_{ \widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\rVert_{F}(1+C_{1}(\Delta t/2))\] (F.59) \[+(\Delta t/2)C_{2}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\lVert w_{t,j}-\widetilde{ w}_{t,j}\rVert.\]

Combining (F.58) and (F.59), we derive

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t+ \Delta t)\rVert_{F}\leq\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde {\Theta}}(H,t)\rVert_{F}(1+C_{3}\Delta t)+\Delta tC_{3}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M} \lVert\beta_{t,j}-\widetilde{\beta}_{t,j}\rVert.\] (F.60)

where \(C_{3}\) is a constant depending solely on \(N\), \(D\), \(r\), and the parameters of the assumptions. Iterating (F.60) multiple times yields

\[\lVert\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)-\widehat{T}_{\widetilde{\Theta}}(H,t)\rVert_{ F}\leq\exp(C_{3})\frac{1}{ML}d(\Theta,\widetilde{\Theta})\]for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,1\). 

### Proof of Lemma c.6

Proof.: By verifying that \(\Theta\) satisfies the conditions outlined in Lemma C.4, we establish \(\|\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq B\exp(K(1+A+A^{2}))\). The first two results stem from Assumption 2 (i) and (ii), with recognition that \(\|T\|_{F}\leq\sqrt{N+1}\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\) for any \(T\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)}\). As for the third result, consider \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t,1\), where

\[\begin{array}{l}\max\{\|\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)\|_{F},\|\widehat{p}_{ \Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)\|_{F}\}\\ =\max\{\|\mathrm{vec}[\widehat{p}_{\Theta}(H,t)]\|,\|\mathrm{vec}[\widehat{p }_{\Theta}(H,t+\Delta t/2)]\|\}\\ \leq\lvert\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H)\rvert\\ \Big{\{}\prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/ \Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\left\|I_{\mathrm{dim}\theta}+(\Delta t/2)\nabla_{ \mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})] \right\|\\ \prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\left\|I_{\mathrm{dim}w}+(\Delta t/2)\nabla_{\mathrm{ vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w_{s,j})]\right\| \Big{\}}\\ \leq\lvert\mathrm{Read}[\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,1)]-y(H)\rvert\\ \prod_{\begin{subarray}{c}(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]\\ j\in[M]\end{subarray}}\left(1+(\Delta t/2)\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]} \mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\right\|\Big{)}\\ \Big{(}1+(\Delta t/2)\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T }_{\Theta}(H,s+\Delta t/2),w_{s,j})]\right\|\Big{)}\\ \leq(B+B_{T})\\ \exp\Big{(}(\Delta t/2)\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}M^{-1} \sum_{j=1}^{M}\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[f(\widehat{T}_{ \Theta}(H,s),\theta_{s,j})]\right\|\\ +(\Delta t/2)\sum_{(s-t)/\Delta t+1\in[(1-t)/\Delta t]}M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M} \left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[T]}\mathrm{vec}[h(\widehat{T}_{\Theta}(H,t),w_{s, j})]\right\|\Big{)}\\ \leq(B+B_{T})\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}B_{T})\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_ {j=1}^{M}(1+\|\beta\|+\|\beta\|^{2})\Big{)}\\ \leq(B+B_{T})\exp\Big{(}\phi_{T}(N,D,\sqrt{N+1}KB_{T})(1+A+A^{2}) \Big{)},\end{array}\]

where the first inequality arises from the fact that the matrix \(2\)-norm is greater equal than the norm of any of its columns, and the fourth inequality follows from Assumption 2 (iii). 

### Proof of Lemma c.7

Proof.: Note that \(\|\beta_{t,j}\|\leq r\) for any \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\) and \(j\in[M]\) with its expectation denoted as \(\int_{\beta}\|\beta_{t,j}\|\rho(\beta,t)d\beta\). Applying Hoeffding's inequality yields, for any \(z>0\) and \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\)

\[\mathbb{P}(|M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\|\beta_{t,j}\|^{2}-\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2} \rho(\beta,t)d\beta|\geq z)\leq 2\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2r^{2}}M).\]

By applying the union bound over \(t=0,\Delta t,\ldots,(L-1)\Delta t\), the inequality above implies

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{P}(|\frac{1}{ML}\sum_{t}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\| \beta_{t,j}\|^{2}-\frac{1}{L}\sum_{t}\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d \beta|\geq z)\leq&\mathbb{P}(\sup_{t}\lvert M^{-1}\sum_{j=1}^{M}\| \beta_{t,j}\|^{2}-\int_{\beta}\|\beta\|^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta|\geq z)\\ \leq& 2L\exp(-\frac{z^{2}}{2r^{2}}M).\end{split}\] (F.62)In addition, we have

\[\begin{split}|\frac{1}{L}\sum_{t}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho( \beta,t)d\beta-\int_{0}^{1}\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d \beta dt|&\leq\sup_{|t-s|\leq\Delta t}|\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert ^{2}\rho(\beta,t)d\beta-\int_{\beta}\lVert\beta\rVert^{2}\rho(\beta,s)d\beta| \\ \leq& r^{2}L^{-1}\sup_{|t-s|\leq\Delta t}\lVert\rho( \cdot,t)-\rho(\cdot,s)\rVert_{\mathrm{BL}}\\ \leq& r^{2}C_{p}L^{-1}.\end{split}\] (F.63)

Combining (F.62) and (F.63), and setting \(z=r\sqrt{2M^{-1}(\delta+\log(2L))}\) completes the proof. 

### Proof of Lemma c.8

Proof.: The proof will be trivial by noting the equality

\[\prod_{l=1}^{L}A_{l}-\prod_{l=1}^{L}B_{l}=\sum_{l=1}^{L}\Big{(}\prod_{s=1}^{l-1 }B_{s}(A_{l}-B_{l})\prod_{s=l+1}^{L}A_{s}\Big{)}.\]

Hence, we have

\[\lVert\prod_{l=1}^{L}A_{l}-\prod_{l=1}^{L}B_{l}\rVert\leq\sum_{l=1}^{L} \lVert\prod_{s=1}^{l-1}B_{s}\rVert\cdot\lVert A_{l}-B_{l}\rVert\cdot\rVert \prod_{s=l+1}^{L}A_{s}\rVert\leq C\sum_{l=1}^{L}\lVert A_{l}-B_{l}\rVert.\]

## Appendix G Assumption verification for a concrete example

In this section, we consider

\[f(Z,\theta)=VZ\mathrm{softmax}(Z^{\top}WZ)\] (G.1)

with the collection of parameters \(\theta=\mathrm{vec}[V,W],\) where \(\mathrm{softmax}\) denotes the column-wise softmax function. Moreover, consider

\[h(Z,w)=W_{2}\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(W_{1}H)\] (G.2)

with the collection of parameters \(w=\mathrm{vec}[W_{1},W_{2}].\) Here, \(\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}\) denotes the entry-wise HuberizedReLU activation function defined as

\[\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(x)=\begin{cases}0,&\text{if }z\leq 0;\\ z^{2}/2,&\text{if }z\in[0,1];\\ z-1/2,&\text{if }z\geq 1.\end{cases}\]

Then, we can consider a Transformer model defined by equations (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4) in the paper, where the functions \(f\) and \(h\) are specified above. We suppose that this Transformer model is applied to a learning task with data that satisfies Assumption 1. We have the following proposition.

**Proposition G.1**.: _Consider the Transformer model defined by equations (2.1), (2.2), and (2.4), with \(f(Z,\theta)\) and \(h(Z,w)\) defined in (G.1) and (G.2) respectively. Then Assumptions 2-4 all hold._

Proof.: We omit the detailed derivations for the function \(h(Z,w),\) which corresponds to the MLP part, in our verification of Assumptions 2 and 3, as \(h(Z,w)\) satisfies Assumptions 2 and 3 is relatively more intuitive, especially given the proofs for \(f(Z,\theta).\)

Denote \(Z=(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N+1})\in\mathbb{R}^{D\times N+1}.\) Then the function \(f\) can be rewritten as

\[f(Z,\theta)=VZ\mathrm{softmax}(Z^{\top}WZ)=(f(Z,\theta)_{:,i})_{1\leq i\leq N +1},\]

where \(f(Z,\theta)_{:,i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}P_{ij}Vz_{j}\) and \(P_{i,:}=\mathrm{softmax}(Z^{\top}Wz_{i}).\) Next, we calculate the derivatives of \(f(Z,\theta)_{:,i}\) with respect to \(Z\) and \(\theta\) as follows:

**For \(Z\):** the Jacobian \(J\in\mathbb{R}^{(N+1)D\times(N+1)D}\) is \(J=(J_{ij})_{1\leq i,j\leq N+1},\) where \(J_{ij}=\frac{\partial f_{\cdot,i}}{\partial z_{j}}(Z,\theta)\in\mathbb{R}^{D \times D}\). After calculation, we obtain

\[J_{ij}=VZQ_{i}[E_{ji}Z^{\top}W+Z^{\top}W^{\top}\delta_{ij}]+P_{ij}V,\]

where \(Q_{i}:=\mathrm{diag}(P_{i\cdot})-P_{i\cdot}^{\top}P_{i\cdot}\), \(E_{ij}\) is the matrix with zeros everywhere except one the \((i,j)\)-th entry, and \(\delta_{ij}\) is the Kronecker delta (1 if \(i=j\), 0 otherwise).

**For \(\theta\):** Define \(A_{i}=Z^{\top}Wz_{i}\). After calculation, we have

\[\frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial A_{kl}}=P_{ij}(\delta_{ik}-P_{il}),\quad\frac{ \partial A_{ij}}{\partial W_{kl}}=Z_{ki}Z_{jl}\] (G.3)

Thus, by the chain rule, we have

\[\nabla_{W_{ki}}f(Z,\theta)_{\cdot,i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}Z_{ki}Z_{jl}P_{ij}(\delta _{ik}-P_{il})Vz_{j}.\] (G.4)

Moreover, we have

\[\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[V]}f(Z,\theta)_{\cdot,i}=\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}P_{ij}(z_{j}^{ \top},\ldots,z_{j}^{\top})^{\top},\] (G.5)

where \((z_{j}^{\top},\ldots,z_{j}^{\top})^{\top}\) contains \(D\) copies of \(z_{j}\). We then verify the assumptions one by one.

For Assumption 2 (i), we have

\[\|f(T,\theta)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}=\|VT{\mathrm{softmax}}(T^{\top}WT )\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq \|V\|_{2}\cdot\|T\|_{2}\cdot\|\mathrm{softmax}(T^{\top}WT)\|_{2- \mathrm{col}}\] \[\leq \|\theta\|_{2}\cdot\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\cdot\|\mathrm{softmax}( T^{\top}WT)\|_{1-\mathrm{col}}\] \[\leq \|\theta\|_{2}\cdot\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\]

where the second-to-the-last inequality follows by the fact that \(\ell_{2}\)-norm can be upper bounded by the \(\ell_{1}\)-norm, and the last inequality follows by the fact that each column of the softmax output has an \(\ell_{1}\)-norm equaling one. Therefore, the first condition in Assumption 2 with \(K=1\) is verified for the function \(f\) in (G.1).

For \(h\) in (G.2), we have

\[\|h(T,w)\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}=\|W_{2}\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(W_{1}T)\| _{2-\mathrm{col}}\leq \|W_{2}\|_{2}\cdot\|\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(W_{1}T)\|_{2-\mathrm{ col}}\] \[\leq \|W_{2}\|_{2}\cdot\|W_{1}T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}\] \[\leq 2\cdot\|w\|_{2}^{2}\cdot\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}},\]

where the second inequality follows by the property of HuberizedReLU that \(|\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(x)|\leq|x|.\) This demonstrates that Assumption 2 (i) with \(K=1\) holds for \(h\) in (G.2) as well.

For Assumption 2 (ii), (G.5) leads to

\[\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[V]}f(T,\theta)_{\cdot,i}\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}\|P_ {ij}T_{\cdot,j}^{\top}\|_{2}\leq\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}P_{ij}\|T_{\cdot,j}\|_{2}\leq \|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}.\]

Moreover, (G.4) leads to

\[\left\|\nabla_{\mathrm{vec}[W]}f(T,\theta)_{\cdot,i}\right\|_{2}\leq \sum_{1\leq k,l\leq D}\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}\|Z_{ki}Z_{jl}P_{ij}(\delta_{ ik}-P_{il})VT_{\cdot,j}\|_{2}\] \[\leq 2\sum_{1\leq k,l\leq D}\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}P_{ij}\|T_{ki}T_{jl}VT_{ \cdot,j}\|_{2}\] \[\leq 2\max_{1\leq j\leq N+1}\sum_{1\leq k,l\leq D}\|T_{ki}T_{jl}\|V \|_{2}\|T_{\cdot,j}\|_{2}\] \[\leq 2\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}^{2}\|\theta\|_{2}\]Combining the two equations above gives Assumption 2 (ii) with \(\phi_{P}(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}})=\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}+2\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{col}}^{2}\).

For Assumption 2 (iii), we have

\[\|J\|_{2}\leq\sqrt{\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq N+1}\|J_{ij}\|_{2}^{2}}\leq(N+1)\max_{1 \leq i,j\leq N+1}\|J_{ij}\|_{2}.\]

For any \(1\leq i,j\leq N+1,\) we have

\[\|J_{ij}\|_{2}\leq P_{ij}\|V\|_{2}+\|T\|_{2}\|Q_{i}\|_{2}\|E_{ji}T^{\top}W+T^{\top} W^{\top}\delta_{ij}\|_{2}\|V\|_{2}\] \[\leq \|V\|_{2}\Big{(}1+2\|T\|_{2}^{2}\|W\|_{2}\Big{)}\] \[\leq \|\theta\|_{2}+2\|T\|_{F}^{2}\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}\] \[\leq (1+2\|T\|_{F}^{2})(1+\|\theta\|_{2}+\|\theta\|_{2}^{2}).\]

Hence, we have

\[\|J\|_{2}\leq 2N\|T\|_{F}^{2}\cdot(N+1)(1+2\|T\|_{F}^{2})(1+\|\theta\|_{2}+ \|\theta\|_{2}^{2}).\]

The above equation demonstrates that for \(f\), Assumption 2 (iii) holds with \(\phi_{T}(N,D,\|T\|_{F})=(N+1)(1+2\|T\|_{F}^{2})\). We have verified Assumption 2 for the attention layer encoder \(f\). The verification for \(h\) is similar and easier.

Next, we verify Assumption 3. Given that we are currently considering the example where the encoder employs a smooth univariate activation function, we can prove stronger results by removing the expectation \(\mathbb{E}_{\mu}\).

(i) and (iii): Given the calculation of derivatives in (G.4) and (G.5) we have presented above, we first show that

\[P_{ij}=\mathrm{softmax}(Z^{\top}Wz_{i})\]

is locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to \(Z\) and \(\theta\). By (G.3) and the chain rule, we can derive that

\[\nabla_{W_{kl}}P_{ij}=\sum_{j=1}^{N+1}Z_{ki}Z_{jl}P_{ij}(\delta_{ik}-P_{il}), \quad\frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial z_{j}}=Q_{i}[E_{ji}z_{j}^{\top}W+z_{j}^{ \top}W^{\top}\delta_{ij}].\]

and the local Lipschitz continuity is then obvious given the boundedness of \(\nabla_{W_{kl}}P_{ij}\) and \(\frac{\partial P_{ij}}{\partial z_{j}}\) with respect to necessary parameters.

As we prove that \(P_{ij}\) is locally Lipschitz continuous, given that then each component in (G.4) and (G.5) is locally Lipschitz continuity with respect to both \(Z\) and \(\theta\), and is obviously bounded by an increasing function of \(N,D,\|\theta\|,K_{T},L_{T}\). Then the local Lipschitz continuity is straightforward as they are all sufficiently smooth.

(ii) and (iv): Because the norm of the difference of two Jacobian matrices \(\|J^{1}-J^{2}\|_{2}\) is bounded by \(\sqrt{\sum_{1\leq i,j\leq N+1}\|J_{ij}^{1}-J_{ij}^{2}\|_{2}^{2}}\), it suffices to show that \(J_{ij}\) is locally Lipschitz continuous with respect to both \(\theta\) and \(Z\). Again each component of \(J_{ij}\) that depends on \(Z\) or \(\theta\), i.e. \(Z,Q_{i},W,P_{ij}\), is bounded by an increasing function of \(N,D,K_{P},L_{T},K_{T},\|\theta\|,\) and is locally Lipschitz continuous given sufficient smoothness. Hence, (ii) and (iv) also hold.

For Assumption 4, we consider the pair \((g,\alpha)=(h,w),\) and the partition \(\alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})\) with \(\alpha_{1}=W_{2},\)\(\alpha_{2}=W_{1}.\) We also let a compact set \(\mathcal{K}=\{W_{1}:\|W_{1}\|\leq 1\}\). Then Assumption 4 (i) on the partial \(1\)-homogeneity property straightforwardly holds:

\[h(T,W_{1},c\cdot W_{2})=c\cdot W_{2}\mathrm{HuberizedReLU}(W_{1}H)=c\cdot h(T, W_{1},W_{2}).\]

Regarding Assumption 4 (ii) on the universal kernel property, we first note that according to the choice \((g,\alpha)=(h,w)\), this assumption is purely an assumption on the MLP part of the Transformer. Here we give the detailed proof as follows.

First of all, according to the classic universal approximation theory (see the wiki page of "universal approximation theorem" and [34, 18, 57] for more details), we know that two-layer fully-connectednetworks with non-polynomial activation functions and without any constraints on its parameters are universal approximates.

Therefore, we know that the function class \(\mathrm{span}\{W_{2}\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}(W_{1}T):W_{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(W_{1})},W_{2 }\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(W_{2})}\}\) is dense in \(\mathcal{C}(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{co}}\leq B,\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)})\). Moreover, by the definition of Huberized-dReLU, for any \(B>0\) and any \(\widehat{W_{1}}\), \(\widehat{W_{2}}\), there exist small constant \(c\) such that \(c\cdot\widehat{W_{1}}\in\mathcal{K}\), \(c\cdot\|\widehat{W}\|_{1}\leq B^{-1}\), and

\[c^{-2}\cdot\widehat{W}_{2}\mathrm{HyperizedReLU}(c\cdot\widehat{W _{1}}T)= c^{-2}\cdot\widehat{W}_{2}\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}(c\cdot\widehat{W_{1}}T)\] \[= c^{2}\cdot c^{-2}\cdot\widehat{W}_{2}\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}(\widehat{ W_{1}}T)\] \[= \widehat{W}_{2}\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}(\widehat{W_{1}}T),\]

where the second equation follows by the positive \(2\)-homogeneity of \(\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}\) activation. This implies that

\[\{W_{2}\mathrm{ReLU}^{2}(W_{1}T):W_{1}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(W_{1})},W_{2}\in \mathbb{R}^{\dim(W_{2})}\}\subseteq\{W_{2}\mathrm{HyperizedReLU}(W_{1}T):W_{ 2}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(W_{2})}\times\mathcal{K}\}.\]

Therefore, we conclude that \(\mathrm{span}\{W_{2}\mathrm{HyperizedReLU}(W_{1}T):W_{2}\in\mathbb{R}^{\dim(W _{2})}\times\mathcal{K}\}\) is dense in \(\mathcal{C}(\|T\|_{2-\mathrm{co}}\leq B,\mathbb{R}^{D\times(N+1)})\). This finishes the validation of Assumption 4. 

## Appendix H Experiments

As discussed in Sections 3 and 4, our mean-field approximation results and global convergence results are asymptotic guarantees requiring exponentially large number of heads \(M\) and number of layers \(L\). Such results are due to the nature of mean-field type analysis. In practice, we frequently observe that global convergence can be achieved by Transformer models of reasonable sizes. In this section, we run simple experiments on training Vision Transformers (ViT) [24] on the CIFAR-10 datasets to demonstrate global convergence in practical applications.

We train Vision Transformers with different numbers of heads and layers. In all our experiments, we split each CIFAR-10 image into four patches and then pass the patches into Vision Transformer models. We keep the dimension of each attention head to be \(128\). The output of each self-attention layer is passed through a single-hidden-layer feedforward component with 128 hidden neurons and GeLU activation. Both the self-attention and feedforward components include skip connections. We implement dropout in the self-attention layers as well as the feedforward layers with a dropout probability of 0.1. The model is attached to a linear classifier.

In all experiments, we train the ViT models using Adam for 200 epochs with a mini-batch size \(512\). We set the initial learning rate to be \(1e-4\), and implement a cosine annealing learning rate schedule. We do not use any data augmentation or explicit regularization techniques, so that global convergence for large enough models implies close-to-zero training loss and close to \(100\%\) training accuracy.

In the first set of experiments, we fix the depth of the ViT to 6 layers (i.e., there are six self-attention layers, each followed by a single-hidden-layer feedforward component). We train such Vision Transformers with the numbers of heads per layer ranging from \(4\) to \(40\), and record the training loss and training accuracy throughout training. The results are given in Figure 1. Based on the results, it is clear that for ViT models with more than \(20\) heads can achieve close-to-zero training loss and close to \(100\%\) training accuracy, demonstrating global convergence on the CIFAR-10 training data.

In the second set of experiments, we fix number of heads in the ViT model per layer to 8. We train such Vision Transformers with depths ranging from \(2\) to \(20\), and record the training loss and training accuracy throughout training. The results are given in Figure 2. Again, the results indicate that ViT models with more than \(16\) layers can achieve close-to-zero training loss and close to \(100\%\) training accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset, implying global convergence.

We note that all these experiments are conducted on a standard GPU card. We can observe clear global convergence when the Vision Transformer is sufficiently wide or deep, but still within reasonable scales. This indicates that, although our theoretical guarantees require extremely large numbers of heads and layers due to the limitations of the mean-field technical tools, global convergence can be achieved by Transformers of reasonable sizes in practice.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction accurately summarize the main contributions and scope of the paper (Section 1.1), clearly outlining the theoretical advancements while aligning with the stated assumptions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We operate under noiseless label settings, as noisy conditions typically preclude achieving zero risk. The limitations of Assumption 4 and the assumptions in Theorem 4.1 are discussed in the respective sections. Although some assumptions are currently untestable, we provide high-level justifications for their validity. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs**Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All necessary assumptions (Assumptions 1-4) are stated in the main content prior to presenting the theoretical results, with complete and correct proofs included in the supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We clearly disclose all the information for reproducing experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: This paper includes only simple experiments in the supplemental material to verify the main theoretical results. Therefore, the access to the data and code is not central to the paper's contribution. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper specifies all necessary details to understand the results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper reports appropriate information about the statistical significance. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper provides sufficient details on the computer resources used for the simulation studies. The task size is small and can be easily reproduced using a standard GPU. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research presented in this paper fully complies with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. All ethical guidelines pertinent to the theoretical nature of the work have been adhered to rigorously. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not discuss societal impacts as it strictly addresses theoretical optimization guarantees for Transformer models, focusing solely on providing rigorous proofs without exploring practical applications. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is theoretical and does not involve the release of data or models. Therefore, there are no risks for misuse or dual-use associated with this research. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The public CIFAR-10 datasets are explicitly mentioned and properly respected. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is theoretical and does not involve the use of existing assets. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is theoretical and does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper is theoretical and does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
