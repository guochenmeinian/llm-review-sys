###### Abstract

In this paper, we study an object synthesis task that combines an object text with an object image to create a new object image. However, most diffusion models struggle with this task, _i.e._, often generating an object that predominantly reflects either the text or the image due to an imbalance between their inputs. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective method called Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) to generate novel and surprising objects. First, we introduce a scale factor and an injection step to balance text and image features in cross-attention and to preserve image information in self-attention during the text-image inversion diffusion process, respectively. Second, to better integrate object text and image, we design a balanced loss function with a noise parameter, ensuring both

optimal editability and fidelity of the object image.

## 1 Introduction

Image synthesis from text or/and image using diffusion models such as Stable Diffusion [51], SDXL [56], and DALL-E3 [43] has gained considerable attention due to their impressive generative capabilities and practical applications, including editing [6; 75] and inversion [24; 61]. Many of these methods focus on object-centric diffusion, utilizing textual descriptions to manipulate objects within images through operations like composition [58], addition [36; 15], removal [63], replacement [7], movement [29], and adjustments in size, shape, action, and pose [17]. In contrast, we study an object synthesis task that creates a new object image by combining an object text with an object image. For instance, combining _kingfisher_ (image) and _terrier_ (text) results in a new and harmonious terrier-like kingfisher object, as shown in the right-side of Fig. 2.

To implement object text-image fusion, most diffusion models, such as SDXL-Turbo [56], often use cross-attention [24] to integrate the input text and image. However, the cross-attention frequently results in imbalanced outcomes, as evidenced by the following observations. On the left side of Fig. 2, when inputting an _axolot_ (image) and a _toucan_ (text), SDXL-Turbo only generates an image of a toucan, showing a bias towards the toucan text (green circles). Conversely, when inputting a _rooster_ (image) and an _iron_ (text), it produces an image of a rooster, which closely resembles the original rooster image (orange circles). These observations reveal that the text (or image) feature often suppresses the influence of the image (or text) feature during the diffusion process, leading to a failed fusion. To mitigate the image degeneration, Plug-and-Play [61] can inject the guidance image features into self-attention. Unfortunately, even with the application of the best inversion editing method, PnPinv [27], which incorporates the plug-and-play inversion into diffusion-based editing methods for improved performance, we still observe similar imbalances, as shown on the right-side of Fig. 2. This arises an important problem: _how can we balance object text and image integration?_

To address this problem, we propose an **A**daptive **T**ext-**I**mage **H**armony (**ATIH**) method for novel object synthesis, as shown in Fig. 3. First, during the inversion diffusion process, we introduce a scale factor \(\alpha\) to balance text and image features in cross-attention, and an injection step \(i\) to preserve image information in self-attention for adaptive adjustment. Second, the inverted noise maps adhere to the statistical properties of uncorrelated Gaussian white noise, which increases editability [46]. However, they are preferable for approximating the feed-forward noise maps, thereby enhancing fidelity. To better integrate object text and image, we treat sampling noise as a parameter in designing

Figure 2: **Imbalances between text and image in diffusion models.** Using SDXL-Turbo [56] (left) and PnPinv [27] (right), the top pictures show a tendency for generated objects to align with textual content (green circles), while the bottom pictures tend to align with visual aspects (orange circles). In contrast, our approach achieves a more harmonious integration of both object text and image.

a balanced loss function, which strikes a balance between reconstruction and Gaussian white noise approximation, ensuring both optimal editability and fidelity of the object image. Third, we present a novel similarity loss that considers both \(i\) and \(\alpha\). This loss function not only maximizes the similarities between the generated object image and the input text/image but also balances these two similarities to harmonize text and image integration. Furthermore, we employ the _Golden Section Search_[47] algorithm to quickly find the optimal parameters \(\alpha\) and \(i\). Therefore, our ATIH method is capable of generating novel object combinations. For instance, an _iron-like rooster_ is produced by merging the image _rooster_ with the text _iron_, resulting in a rooster image with an iron texture, as shown in Fig. 2.

Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows: **(1)** To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose an adaptive text-image harmony method for generating novel object synthesis. The key idea is to achieve a balanced blend of object text and image by adaptively adjusting a scale factor and an injection step in the inversion diffusion process, ensuring their effective harmony. **(2)** We introduce a novel similarity score function that incorporates the scale factor and injection step. This aims to balance and maximize the similarities between the generated image and the input text/image, achieving a harmonious integration of text and image. **(3)** Experimental results on PIE-bench [26] and ImageNet [53] demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our approach shows superior performance in creative object combination compared to state-of-the-art image-editing and creative mixing methods. Examples of these creative objects, such as _sea lion-glass jar_, _African chameleon-bird_, and _corgi-cock_ are shown in Figs. 1, 6, and 8.

## 2 Related Work

**Text-to-Image Generation**  The rapid development of generative models based on diffusion processes has advanced the state-of-the-art for tasks [12; 21; 33] like text-to-image synthesis [22; 31], image editing [64; 2], and style transfer [65; 23; 35]. Large-scale models such as Stable Diffusion [51], Imagen [55], and DALL-E [49] have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. Sdklturbo [56] introduced a distillation method that further enhances efficiency by reducing the steps needed for high-quality image generation. Our method utilizes Sdklurbo for adaptive and innovative object fusion, preserving the original image's layout and details while requiring only the textual description of the target object.

**Text Guided Image Editing.** Diffusion models have garnered significant attention for their success in text-to-image generation and text-driven image editing using natural language descriptions. Early studies [1; 54; 70; 40], such as SDEdit [40], balanced authenticity and fidelity by adding noise, while Prompt2Prompt [24] and Plug-and-Play (PNP) [61] enhanced editing through attention mechanisms. Further research, including MasaCtrl [5], Instructpix2pix [4], and InfEdit [69], explored non-rigid editing, specialized image editing models, and rapid editing via consistency sampling. Advances in image inversion and reconstruction [20] have focused on diffusion-based denoising process inversion, categorized into deterministic and non-deterministic sampling [28]. Deterministic methods, such as Null-text inversion using DDIM sampling [41], precisely recover original images but require lengthy optimization; non-deterministic methods, such as DDPM inversion [25] and CycleDiffusion [67], achieve precision by storing variance noise. PnPinv [26] simplifies the process by accurately replacing latent features during denoising, achieving perfect reconstruction but with weaker editability.We propose a framework for creative object synthesis using object textual descriptions for effective fusion and a regularization technique to enhance PnPinv editability.

**Object Composition.** Compositional Text-to-Image synthesis and multi-image subject blending methods [37; 19; 58; 70; 59] aim to create novel images by integrating various concepts, including object interactions, colors, shapes, and attributes. Numerous methodologies [8; 71; 24; 52; 55] have been developed focusing on object combinations, context integration, segmentation, and text descriptions. However, these methods often merely assemble components without effectively melding inter-object relationships, resulting in compositions that, while accurate, lack deeper integration and interaction. This limitation is particularly evident in image editing, where multiple objects in a single image fail to achieve cohesive synthesis. Our method addresses this by harmoniously fusing two objects to create novel entities, thereby enhancing creativity and imagination.

**Semantic Mixing.** The breadth of creativity spans diverse fields, from scientific theories to culinary recipes, driving advancements in AI as highlighted by scholars [3][39] and recent researchers [62][32]. This creativity has led to significant innovations in AI, particularly through generative models. Creative Adversarial Networks [16] push traditional art boundaries, producing norm-defying works while maintaining artistic connections. Efforts to adapt AI for novel engineering designs [11] further exemplify this technological creativity. MagicMix [34] introduced semantic mixing task,unlike traditional style transfer methods [73; 60; 10] which blending two concepts into a photo-realistic object while retaining the original image's layout and geometry, but often resulting in biased images and less harmonious fusion. ConceptLab [50] uses diffusion models to generate unique concepts, like new types of pets, but requires time-consuming optimization and struggles to semantically blend real images. Our method operates at the attention layer of diffusion models for harmonious semantic fusion and proposes an adaptive fast search to quickly produce balanced, fused images, ensuring novel and cohesive integration of semantic concepts.

## 3 Methodology

Let \(O_{I}\) and \(O_{T}\) be an object image and an object text, respectively, used as inputs for diffusion models. Our goal is to create a novel object image \(O\) by combining \(O_{I}\) with \(O_{T}\) during the diffusion process. To achieve this goal, we develop an adaptive text-image harmony (ATIH) method in our object synthesis framework, as shown in Fig. 3. In subsection 3.1, we introduce a text-image diffusion model with a scale factor \(\alpha\), an injection step \(i\) and noise \(\epsilon_{t}\). In subsection 3.2, we present to optimize the noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) to balance object editability and fidelity. In subsection 3.3, we propose a simple yet effective ATIH method to adaptively adjust \(\alpha\) and \(i\) for harmonizing text and image.

### Text-Image Diffusion Model (TIDM)

Here, we construct a Text-Image Diffusion Model (TIDM) by utilizing the pre-trained SDXL Turbo [56]. The key components include dual denoising branches: inversion for inverting the input object image, and fusion for fusing the object text and image. Following the latent diffusion model [51], the input latent codes are defined as \(z_{0}=\mathcal{E}(O_{I})\) for object image \(O_{I}\) and \(\tau=\mathcal{E}(O_{T})\) for object text \(O_{T}\), using a pre-trained image/text encoder \(\mathcal{E}(\cdot)\). \(\tau_{N}=\mathcal{E}(O_{N})\) denotes as a null-text embedding. The **latent denoising process** is described as follows:

_Inversion Denoising._ The inversion denoising process predicts the latent code at the previous noise level, \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}\), based on the current noisy data \(\widehat{z}_{t}\). This process is defined as:

\[\widehat{z}_{t-1}=\nu_{t}\widehat{z}_{t}+\beta_{t}\epsilon_{\theta}(\widehat{z }_{t},t,\tau)+\gamma_{t}\epsilon_{t}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\nu_{t}\), \(\beta_{t}\) and \(\gamma_{t}\) are sampler parameters, \(\epsilon_{t}\) is sampled noise, and \(\epsilon_{\theta}(\widehat{z}_{t},t,\tau)\) is a pre-trained U-Net model [56] with self-attention and cross-attention layers. The self-attention is implemented as:

\[\text{Self-Attn}\left(\widehat{Q}^{s}_{t},\widehat{K}^{s}_{t},\widehat{V}^{s} _{t}\right)=\widehat{M}^{s}_{t}\cdot\widehat{V}^{s}_{t},\ \ \ \widehat{M}^{s}_{t}=\text{ Softmax}\left(\widehat{Q}^{s}_{t}(\widehat{K}^{s}_{t})^{T}/ \sqrt{d}\right), \tag{2}\]

where \(\widehat{Q}^{s}_{t}\), \(\widehat{K}^{s}_{t}\) and \(\widehat{V}^{s}_{t}\) are the query, key and value features derived from the representation \(\widehat{z}_{t}\), and \(d\) is the dimension of projected keys and queries. The cross-attention is to control the synthesis process

Figure 3: **Framework of our object synthesis incorporating a scale factor \(\alpha\), an injection step \(i\) and noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) in the diffusion process. We design a balance loss for optimizing the noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) to balance object editability and fidelity. Using the optimal noise \(\epsilon_{t}\), we introduce an adaptive harmony mechanism to adjust \(\alpha\) and \(i\), balancing text (_Peacock_) and image (_Rabbit_) similarities.**

through the input null-text embedding \(\tau_{N}\), implemented as follows: \(\text{Cross-Attn}\left(\widehat{Q}_{t}^{c},\widehat{K}_{t}^{c},\widehat{V}_{t}^{c }\right)=\widehat{M}_{t}^{c}\cdot\widehat{V}_{t}^{c}\), where \(\widehat{M}_{t}^{c}=\text{Softmax}\left(\widehat{Q}_{t}^{c}(\widehat{K}_{t}^{c })^{T}/\sqrt{d}\right)\), \(\widehat{Q}_{t}^{c}\) is the query feature derived from the output of the self-attention layer, \(\widehat{K}_{t}^{c}\) and \(\widehat{V}_{t}^{c}\) are the key and value features derived from \(\tau_{N}\).

_Fusion Denoising._ Similar to the inversion denoising branch, we redefine the self-attention and cross-attention for easily adjusting the balance between the image latent code \(z_{t}\) and the text embedding \(\tau\). The fusion denoising process is redefined as:

\[z_{t-1}=\nu_{t}z_{t}+\beta_{t}\epsilon_{\theta}(z_{t},t,\tau,\alpha,i)+\gamma_ {t}\epsilon_{t}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\nu_{t}\), \(\beta_{t}\), \(\gamma_{t}\) and \(\epsilon_{t}\) are defined as Eq. (1), and \(\epsilon_{\theta}(z_{t},t,\tau,\alpha,i)\) is also the pre-trained U-Net model [56] with injected self-attention and scale cross-attention layers. The **injected self-attention** with an adjustable injection step \(i(0\leq i\leq T)\) is implemented as:

\[\text{InSelf-Attn}\left(M_{t}^{s},V_{t}^{s}\right)=M_{t}^{s}\cdot V_{t}^{s}, \;\;\;M_{t}^{s}=\begin{cases}\widehat{M}_{t}^{s},&\text{if}\;\;t>i\\ \text{Softmax}\left(Q_{t}^{s}(K_{t}^{s})^{T}/\sqrt{d}\right),&\text{otherwise} \end{cases}, \tag{4}\]

where \(Q_{t}^{s}\), \(K_{t}^{s}\) and \(V_{t}^{s}\) are the query, key and value features derived from the representation \(z_{t}\). Unlike the approach of injecting \(\widehat{K}_{t}^{s}\) and \(\widehat{V}_{t}^{s}\) from Eq. (2) into \(K_{t}^{s}\) and \(V_{t}^{s}\) in MasaCtrl [5], we focus on adjusting the injection step \(i\) by injecting \(\widehat{M}_{t}^{s}\) from Eq. (2) into \(M_{t}^{s}\). The **scale cross-attention** with an adjustable factor \(\alpha\in[0,2]\) is to control the synthesis process through the input text embedding \(\tau\), implemented as follows:

\[\text{ScCross-Attn}\left(Q_{t}^{c},K_{t}^{c},V_{t}^{c}\right)=M_{t}^{c}\cdot \alpha\cdot V_{t}^{c},\;\;\;M_{t}^{c}=\text{Softmax}\left(Q_{t}^{c}(K_{t}^{c })^{T}/\sqrt{d}\right), \tag{5}\]

where \(Q_{t}^{c}\) is the query feature derived from the output of the self-attention layer, \(K_{t}^{c}\) and \(V_{t}^{c}\) are the key and value features derived from the text embedding \(\tau\). Unlike the non-adjustable scale attention map approach in Prompt-to-Prompt [24], we introduce a factor, \(\alpha\), to adjust the value feature. This allows for better balancing of the text and image features, even though they share the same form. Using this fusion denoising process, the generation of a new object image is denoted as \(O\).

Following the ReNoise inversion technique [20], based on the denoising Eq. (1) and the approximation \(\epsilon_{\theta}(\widehat{z}_{t},t,\tau)\approx\epsilon_{\theta}(\widehat{z}_ {t-1},t,\tau)\)[14], the **noise addition process** is reformulated as:

\[\widehat{z}_{t}^{\prime}=\left(\widehat{z}_{t-1}^{\prime}-\beta_{t}\epsilon_{ \theta}(\widehat{z}_{t}^{\prime},t,\tau)-\gamma_{t}\epsilon_{t}\right)/\nu_{t}. \tag{6}\]

### Balance fidelity and editability by optimizing the noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) in inversion process

In this subsection, our goal is to achieve better fidelity and editability of the object image during the inversion process. We observe that increasing the Gaussian white noise of the denoising latent code \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}\) can enhance editability [46], while reducing the difference between the denoising latent code \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}\) and the standard path noise code \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}^{\prime}\) in Eq. (6) can improve fidelity [25; 67]. However, these two objectives are contradictory. To address this, we treat the sampling noise \(\epsilon_{t}\) in Eq.(1) as a learnable parameter. We define a reconstructed \(\ell_{2}\) loss between \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}\) and \(\widehat{z}_{t-1}^{\prime}\), \(\mathcal{L}_{r}(\epsilon_{t})=\|\widehat{z}_{t-1}^{\prime}-(\nu_{t}\widehat{z} _{t}+\beta_{t}\epsilon_{\theta}(\widehat{z}_{t},t,\tau)+\gamma_{t}\epsilon_{t })\|\), and a KL divergence loss between \(\epsilon_{t}\) and a Gaussian distribution, \(\mathcal{L}_{n}(\epsilon_{t})=\text{KL}(q(\epsilon_{t})||p(\mathcal{N}(0,I)))\), to simultaneously handle fidelity and editability. Based on Eqs.(1) and (6), we design a balance loss function as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}(\epsilon_{t})=|\mathcal{L}_{r}(\epsilon_{t})-\lambda\mathcal{L}_{ n}(\epsilon_{t})|, \tag{7}\]

where \(\lambda\) represents the weight to balance \(\mathcal{L}_{r}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{n}\), and in this paper, we set to \(\lambda=\frac{\mathcal{L}_{r}}{\mathcal{L}_{n}}=125\). Since the parameter \(\epsilon_{t}\) is sampled from a standard Gaussian distribution during the noise addition process, \(\mathcal{L}_{n}\) is used solely to balance \(\mathcal{L}_{r}\) and its gradient is not computed for optimization.

### Text-image harmony by adaptively adjusting injection step \(i\) and scale factor \(\alpha\)

Using the optimal noise \(\epsilon_{t}\), a fused object image \(O(\alpha,i)\) can be generated by the TIDM with an initial scale factor \(\alpha_{0}=1\) and injection step \(i_{0}=\lfloor T/2\rfloor\) from the input object image \(O_{I}\) and object text \(O_{T}\). Here, we adaptively adjust \(\alpha\in[0,2]\) and \(i\) (\(0\leq i\leq T\)) by introducing an Adaptive Text-Image Harmony (ATIH) method. We denote the similarity between the image \(O_{I}\) and the fused image \(O(\alpha,i)\) as \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)=d(O_{I},O(\alpha,i))\), and the similarity between the text \(O_{T}\) and the fused image \(O(\alpha,i)\) as \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)=d(O_{T},O(\alpha,i))\), where \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) represents the similarity distance between text/image and image. In this paper, we compute the similarities \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)\) and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)\) using the DINO features [44] and the CLIP features [48], respectively, based on a cosine distance \(d\). Our key idea is to balance and maximize both \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)\) and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i)\) for optimal text-image fusion.

**Adjust injection step \(i\) to balance fidelity and editability.** Before achieving the idea, we first enable the object image to be smoothly editable by adjusting the injection step \(i\) in the injected self-attention. We denote \(I_{\text{sim}}(i)=I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha_{0},i)\) for for convenience. In the inversion process, it is generally observed that more injections lead to less editability. When all injections are applied (\(i=T\)), an ideal fidelity is achieved. We observe that when \(I_{\text{sim}}(i)<I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\), the fused image deviates significantly from the input image, resulting in a loss of fidelity. Conversely, when \(I_{\text{sim}}(i)>I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{max}}\), the fused image is too similar to the input image, resulting in no editability. To balance fidelity and editability, \(I_{\text{sim}}(i)\) must satisfy \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\leq I_{\text{sim}}(i)\leq I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{ max}}\), in Fig. 5. Therefore, initializing \(i=\lfloor T/2\rfloor\), \(i\) is adjusted as follows:

\[i=\begin{cases}i-1,&I_{\text{sim}}(i)<I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\\ i,&I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\leq I_{\text{sim}}(i)\leq I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{ max}}\\ i+1,&I_{\text{sim}}(i)>I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{max}}\end{cases}, \tag{8}\]

where \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\) and \(\text{sim}^{\text{max}}\) are set to \(0.45\) and \(0.85\) in this paper, respectively, based on observations from Fig. 17. After using Eq. (8), this adaptive approach can obtain an injection step \(i^{*}\) to smooth the fusion process while maintaining a balance between fidelity and editability. Fixing the injection step \(i=i^{*}\), next we use abbreviations, \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)=I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i^{*})\) and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)=T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha,i^{*})\).

**Adaptively adjust the scale factor \(\alpha\) for harmonizing text and image.** To implement our key idea, we design an exquisite score function with \(\alpha\) as:

\[\max_{\alpha}F(\alpha):=\underbrace{I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)+k\cdot T_{\text{ sim}}(\alpha)}_{\text{maximize similarities (ellips)}}-\beta\underbrace{|I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)-k\cdot T_{\text{sim}}( \alpha)|}_{\text{balance similarities (hyperbola)}}, \tag{9}\]

where \(\beta\) is a weighting factor, and the parameter \(k\) is introduced to mitigate inconsistencies in scale between high \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\) and low \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\) due to differences in text and image modalities, ensuring their scale balance. As shown in Fig. 4, \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\) decreases and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\) increases as \(\alpha\) increases, and vice versa. Based on these observations, we set \(k=2.3\) and \(\beta=1\) in this paper.

In Eq. (9), the left-hand side represents the sum of the text and image similarities, forming an ellipse, while the right-hand side represents the absolute value of the difference between the text and image similarities, forming a hyperbola. A larger sum value indicates that the generated image integrates more information from the input text and image. Conversely, a smaller absolute value signifies a better balance between the text and image similarities. Additionally, given that \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\in[0,1]\) and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\in[0,1]\), their sum is greater than or equal to the absolute value of their difference, leading to \(F(\alpha)\geq 0\). Therefore, our objective is to maximize \(F(\alpha)\) to simultaneously enhance and balance both \(I_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\)and and \(T_{\text{sim}}(\alpha)\). Maximizing \(F(\alpha)\) is easily implemented by the Golden Section Search [47] algorithm, and we get the optimal \(\alpha^{*}\). Fig. 5 depicts a schematic diagram to adjust both ii and \(\alpha\). Overall, our **novel object synthesis**, detailed in **Algorithm 1**, is presented in Appendix F.

## 4 Experiments

### Experimental Settings

**Datasets.** We constructed an object text-image fusion (OTIF) dataset consisting of 1,800 text-image pairs, derived from 60 texts and 30 images in Appendix C. Images, selected from various classes in PIE-bench [26], include 20 animal and 10 non-animal categories. Texts were chosen from the 1,000 classes in ImageNet [53], with ChatGPT [42] filtering out 40 distinct animals and 20 non-animals.

**Details.** We implemented our method on SDXLturbo [56] only taking _ten seconds_. For image editing, we set the source prompt \(p_{s}\) as an empty string "Null" and the target prompt \(P_{t}\) as the target object class name. During sampling, we used the Ancestral-Euler sampler [28] with four denoising steps. All input images were uniformly scaled to \(512\times 512\) pixels to ensure consistent resolution in all the experiments. Our experiments were conducted using two NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090 GPUs.

**Metrics.** To comprehensively evaluate the performance of our method, we employed four key metrics: aesthetic score (AES) [57], CLIP text-image similarity (CLIP-T) [48], Dinov2 image similarity (Dino-I) [44], and human preference score (HPS) [68]. Following the Eq. (9), \(F\)score and balance similarities (\(B\)sim) with \(k=2.3\) are used to measure the text-image fusion effect.

### Main Results

We conducted a comprehensive comparison of our ATIH model with three image-editing models (_i.e._, MasaCtrl [5], InfEdit [69], and InstructPix2pix [4]), two mixing models (_i.e._, MagicMix [34] and ConceptLab [50]), and ControlNet [72]. Notably, MagicMix and ConceptLab share a similar objective with ours to fuse object text/image, while ConceptLab only accepts two text prompts as its inputs. Due to no available code for MagicMix, we utilized its unofficial implementation [13].

Figure 6: **Comparisons with different image editing methods.** We observe that InfEdit [69] MasaCtrl [5] and InstructPix2Pix [4] struggle to fuse object images and texts, while our method successfully implements new object synthesis, such as _bowling ball-fawn_ in the second row.

**Comparisons with image-editing methods.** For a fair comparison, we uniformly set the editing text prompt in all methods as _a photo of an [image category] creatively fused with a [text category]_ to achieve the fusion of two objects. Fig. 6 visualizes some combinational objects, with additional results available in Appendix H. Our observations are as follows: Firstly, MasaCtrl and InfEdit generally preserve the original image's details better during editing, as seen in examples like _sheep-triceratops_. In contrast, InstructPix2Pix tends to alter the image more significantly, making it closer to the edited text description. Secondly, different methods exhibit varying degrees of distortion when fusing two objects during the image editing process. For instance, in the case of _African chameleon-bird_, our method performs better by minimizing distortions and maintaining the harmony and high quality of the image. Thirdly, our method shows significant advantages in enhancing the editability of images. For the _European fire salamander-glass jar_ example, other methods often result in only color changes and slight deformations, failing to effectively merge the two objects. In contrast, our method harmoniously integrates the colors and shapes of both the glass jar and the European fire salamander, significantly improving the editing effect and operability. Specially, Fig. 7 shows the results of InstructPix2Pix with manually adjusted image strengths (\(1.0,1.5,2.0\)) and text strengths (ranging from \(1.0\) to \(1.5\)).

Figure 8: **Comparisons with different creative mixing methods.** We observe that our results surpass those of MagicMix [34]. For ConceptLab [50], we exclusively examine its fusion results without making good or bad comparisons, as it is a distinct approach to creative generation.

Figure 7: Comparisons with InstructPix2Pix [4] using image/text strength variations.

from \(1.5\) to \(7.5\)). At optimal settings of image strength \(1.5\) and text strength \(5.0\), InstructPix2Pix produced its best fusion, though some results were unnatural, like replacing the rabbit's ears with a rooster's head. In contrast, our method created novel and natural combinations of the rabbit and rooster by automatically achieving superior visual synthesis without manual adjustments.

**Comparisons with the mixing methods.** Fig. 8 illustrates the results of text-image object synthesis. We observe that both MagicMix and ConceptLab tend to overly bias towards one class, such as _zucchini-owl_ and _corgi-cock_. Their generated images often lean more towards one category. In contrast, our method achieves a more harmonious balance between the features of the two categories. Moreover, the fusion images produced by MagicMix frequently exhibit insufficiently smooth feature blending. For instance, in the fusion of a rabbit and an emperor penguin, the rabbit's facial features nearly disappear. Conversely, our method seamlessly merges the facial features of both the penguin and the rabbit in the head region, preserving the main characteristics of each.

**Comparisons with ControlNet.** We rigorously compared our method with ControlNet to assess their performance in complex text-image fusion tasks, as shown in Fig. 9. Our results highlight notable differences: ControlNet preserves structure well from depth or edge maps but struggles with semantic integration, especially with complex prompts, often failing to achieve seamless blending. In contrast, our method leverages full RGB features, including color and texture, alongside structural data.

**Quantitative Results.** Table 1 displays the quantitative results, illustrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in AES, HPS, \(F\)score and \(B\)sim, surpassing other methods. These results indicate that our approach excels in enhancing the visual appeal and artistic quality of images, while also aligning more closely with human preferences and understanding in terms of object fusion. Moreover, when dealing with text-image inconsistencies at scale \(k\)=2.3, our method achieves superior text-image similarity and balance, demonstrating superior fusion capability. Despite achieving the best DINO-I and CLIP-T scores under inconsistencies, InfEdit and InstructPix2Pix perform worse than our method in terms of AES, HPS, \(F\)score and \(B\)sim, and their visual results remain sub-optimal. These inconsistencies ultimately lead to the failure of integrating object text and image. In contrast, our approach achieves a better text-image balance similarities. Furthermore, Table 2 presents the \(H\)-statistics [30] and \(P\)-values [66] assessing the statistical significance of performance differences between our ATIH and other methods across various metrics.

**User Study.** We conducted two user studies to assess intuitive human perception of results presented in Table 3, Table 4, and Appendix G. Each participant evaluated 6 image-editing sets and 6 fusion sets. In total, these studies garnered 570 votes from 95 participants. Our method received the highest ratings in both studies, capturing 74.03% and 79.47% of the total votes, respectively. Among the image-editing methods, InfEdit [69] garnered 14.7% of votes for its superior editing performance, while InstructPix2Pix [4] and MasaCtrl [5] received only 8% and 2.8%, respectively. In the fusion category, ConceptLab [50] received 12.28% of votes, while MagicMix [34] received 8%.

### Parameter Analysis and Ablation Study

**Parameter analysis.** Our primary parameters include \(\lambda\) in (7), \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\) and \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{max}}\) in (8), and \(k\) in (9). \(\lambda=\frac{\mathcal{L}_{e}}{L_{n}}\) balances the editability and fidelity of our model. We determined the specific value through personal observation combined with the changes in AES, CLIP-T, and Dino-I values at different \(\lambda\) settings. Ultimately, we set \(\lambda\) to 125. To address the inconsistency between image similarity and text similarity scales, we approximated the scale \(k\). Initially, we measured the variations in image similarity and text similarity with changes in \(\alpha\), and identified the balanced similarity regions in the fusion results. As shown in Fig. 4, the optimal range for \(k\) was found to be between [0.21, 0.27]. Based on these observations and experimental experience, we ultimately set \(k\) to 0.23. As shown in Fig. 17 of Appendix D, we observe that when the similarity between the image and the original exceeds 0.85, the images become too similar, making edits with different class texts less effective and necessitating a decrease in \(i\). Conversely, when the similarity is below 0.45, the images overly favor the text, making them excessively editable, requiring an increase in injection steps. Therefore, we set \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\) to 0.45 and \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{max}}\) to 0.85. More discussions are provided in Appendix D.

**Ablation Study.** In Figs. 10 and 18 in Appendix E, we visualize the results with and without the balance loss in Eq. (7), the adaptive injection ii in Eq. (8), and the adaptive selection \(\alpha\) in Eq. (9) within our object synthesis framework. PnPinv, used for direct inversion and prompt editing, resulted in some distortion and blurriness. Compared to PnPinv, the balance loss significantly enhances image fidelity, improving details, textures, and editability. The adaptive injection enables a smooth transition from Corgi to Fire Engine in Fig. 18. Without this injection, the transformation is too abrupt, lacking a seamless fusion process. Finally, the adaptive selection achieves a balanced image that harmoniously integrates the original and target features. _Note that for limitations, please refer to Appendix B._

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we explored a novel object synthesis framework that fuses object texts with object images to create unique and surprising objects. We introduced a simple yet effective difference loss to optimize sampling noise, balancing image fidelity and editability. Additionally, we proposed an adaptive text-image harmony module to seamlessly integrate text and image elements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework excels at generating a wide array of impressive object combinations. This capability is particularly advantageous for crafting innovative and captivating animated characters in the entertainment and film industry. Broader impact, please see Appendix A.

Broader Impact

Our model's capability to fuse images and text to generate new and creative object images holds significant potential across various fields, including entertainment, design, and education. However, it also raises important considerations regarding content safety and ethical use. In particular, if the input image or text contains inappropriate or offensive material, the generated images may similarly be inappropriate, leading to potentially unpleasant experiences for users.

To mitigate these risks, it is crucial to implement robust NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content detection mechanisms. While existing methods can address some cases of inappropriate content, we acknowledge the need for continuous improvement in this area. As part of our future work, we will incorporate advanced NSFW checking models to ensure the generated content adheres to safety standards and ethical guidelines. This proactive approach aims to safeguard users and promote responsible use of our image generation technology.

## Appendix B Limitation

Our method relies on the semantic correlation between the original and transformed content within the diffusion feature space. When the semantic match between two categories is weak, our method tends to produce mere texture changes rather than deeper semantic transformations. This limitation suggests that our approach may struggle with transformations between categories with weak semantic associations. Future work could focus on enhancing semantic matching between different categories to improve the generalizability and applicability of our method.

There are still some failure cases in our model, as shown in Fig. 11. These failures can be categorized into two types. The first row illustrates that when the content of the image is significantly different from the text prompt, the changes become implicit. The second row demonstrates that in certain cases, our adaptive function results in changes that only affect the texture of the original image. In our future work, we will investigate these situations further and analyze the specific items that do not yield satisfactory results.

## Appendix C Text and Image Categories.

We selected 60 texts, as detailed in Table 5, and categorized them into 7 distinct groups. The 30 selected images are shown in Fig.12, with each image corresponding to similarly categorized texts, as outlined in Table 6. Our model is capable of fusing content between any two categories, showcasing its strong generalization ability.

Analysis of \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\) and \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{max}}\).As shown in Fig. 17, we visualized several specific node images generated during the variation of different \(\alpha\) factor values. When the image similarity with the original image exceeds 0.85, the images become overly similar. For example, in the dog-zebra fusion experiment, the dog's texture remains largely unchanged, and no zebra features are visible. Conversely, when the image similarity falls below 0.45, the images overly conform to the text description. In this case, the entire head of the image turns into a zebra, representing an over-transformation phenomenon. Based on these observations, we set the minimum similarity threshold \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\) to 0.45 and the maximum similarity threshold \(I_{\text{sim}}^{\text{min}}\)to 0.85. This range helps us achieve a good balance between retaining original image information and integrating text features.

## Appendix E Ablation Study.

We present another set of ablation study results in Fig. 19, where the two rows represent the cases without (w/o) and with (w) attention projection. The input image is a Corgi, and the text is Fire engine. The output images display the different transformations as \(\alpha\) varies. The top row shows the abrupt change in appearance without attention projection, resulting in a sudden transition from a Corgi to a fire engine. In contrast, with attention projection (bottom row), the change is smoother, achieving the desired blending result in the middle.

## Appendix F Algorithm.

Overall, our **novel object synthesis** comprises three key components: optimizing the noise \(\epsilon_{\epsilon}\) through a balance of fidelity and editability loss, adaptively adjusting the injection step \(i\), and dynamically modifying the factor

**Algorithm 1** Novel Object Synthesis

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

## Appendix H More results.

In this section, we present additional results from our model. Fig. 21 showcases further generation results using our ATIH model. We experimented with four different images, each edited with four distinct text prompts. Fig. 22 provides further examples showcasing the effectiveness of our method in complex text-driven fusion tasks. Specifically, our approach excels in extreme cases by accurately extracting prominent features, such as color and basic object forms, from detailed textual descriptions. For instance, Fig. 22 shows a well-defined edge structure for the raw image and the text 'Green tricartops with rough, scaly skin and massive frilled head.' Additionally, Fig. 23 illustrates our model's versatility with multiple prompts, emphasizing its capability for continuous editing.

## Appendix I More Comparisons

In this section, we present additional results from our model and compare its performance against other methods.

In Fig. 24, we compare our results with those from the state-of-the-art T2I model DALL-E-3 assisted by Copilot. Our model shows superior performance when handling complex descriptive prompts for image editing. We observe that the competing model struggles to achieve results comparable to ours, particularly in maintaining the original structure and layout of images, despite adequate prompts.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, refer to Sectionrefsec:intro Introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, refer to Appendix refsec:limitation Limitation. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: the paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: refer to Subsection 4.1 Experimental Settings and Subsection 4.3 Parameter Analysis. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example * If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. * If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. * If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). * We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: for data we used in paper, we introduced in Appendix refsec:TICategories, and we will provide source code when this paper is published. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. ** The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: refer to Subsection \(\text{efsubsec:exp}_{s}etting,efsubsec:parameter,andAppendixrefsec:sup_{p}aram Guidelines:\) 7. The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. 8. The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. 9. The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

#### Experiment Statistical Significance

Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: refer to Subsection \(\text{efsubsec:main}_{r}esMainResults.Guidelines:\)  The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

#### Experiments Compute Resources

Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: refer to Subsection \(\text{efsubsec:exp}_{s}ettingGuidelines:\)  The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

**Code Of Ethics**

Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?)

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
* If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
* The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

**Broader Impacts**

Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: refer to Appendix refsec:sup\({}_{i}mpBroaderImpacts.Guidelines\) :

The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

**Safeguards**

Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: this paper poses no such risks.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

#### Licenses for existing assets

Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We cite the original papers of the open-sourced data and codes.

#### Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

#### New Assets

Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: this paper does not release new assets.

#### Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

#### Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects

Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: this paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

#### Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

#### Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects

Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: this paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
