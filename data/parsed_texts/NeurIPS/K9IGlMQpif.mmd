###### Abstract

Despite the effectiveness of data selection for pretraining and instruction fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), improving data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains poses significant challenges due to the complexity of fine-tuning data. To bridge this gap, we introduce an effective and scalable data selection method for SFT, SmallToLarge (S2L), which trains a small model, clusters loss trajectories of the examples, and samples from these clusters to guide data selection for larger models. We prove that during fine-tuning, samples within the same loss trajectory cluster exhibit similar gradients. Then, we show that S2L subsets have a bounded gradient error w.r.t. the full data, hence guarantee convergence to the neighborhood of the optimal solution. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that S2L significantly improves data efficiency in SFT for mathematical problem-solving, reducing the training data requirement to just 11% of the original MathInstruct dataset [64] to match full dataset performance while outperforming state-of-the-art data selection algorithms by an average of \(4.7\%\) across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, selecting only 50K data for SFT, S2L achieves a 32.7% accuracy on the challenging MATH [19] benchmark, improving Phi-2 [28] by 16.6%. In clinical text summarization on the MIMIC-III dataset [21], S2L again outperforms training on the full dataset using only 50% of the data. Notably, S2L can perform scalable data selection using a reference model \(100\times\) smaller than the target model, proportionally reducing the computational cost. 1

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized artificial intelligence by demonstrating an unprecedented ability to understand and generate human language [7]. Among all the contributing factors, the quality and selection of data is becoming increasingly recognized for its importance in training LLMs effectively. Recent research indicates that LLMs benefit more from training for additional epochs on carefully curated data rather than on larger, uncurated ones during pretraining [48] and instruction fine-tuning [67], making data selection one of the most promising means to unlock the next level of LLMs' language capability. However, while generalist models obtained through pre-training or instruction fine-tuning excel in _general language tasks_, they may not deliver optimal outcomes in _specialized domain_, such as mathematics [3, 31, 63, 30, 64], code [42, 32], medicine [43, 44, 9], or finance [57, 9]. These domains are not only critical for real-world applications but also hold substantial economic and societal impacts.

To maximize performance in specialized domains, models fine-tuned on domain data offer superior capabilities over generalist models [20]. Yet, maximizing the data efficiency in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for specialized domains remains a challenging and under-explored problem. Firstly, heuristic approaches that are effective in the instruction fine-tuning stage, like manual curation [67] or using advanced models such as GPT-4 for dataset evaluation [8], are less reliable due to the need for specialized knowledge and become costly with large volumes of uncurated fine-tuning data. Beyond these heuristic methods, other approaches rely on generating representations for each training example using a reference model, often utilizing metrics like perplexity [34], confidence [46, 53], or hidden states [1, 48, 61, 4] as features. However, these techniques also fall short in SFT for specialized domains for two reasons: (1) the significant shift between pretraining and SFT data can render these metrics less informative (Figure 0(b)), and (2) the computation and memory demands associated with generating representations for each training example become prohibitive, as these specialized domains often require larger models, some with up to 540 billion parameters [10, 43], leading to substantial scalability challenges (Figure 0(c)).

To tackle the challenges of data efficiency in SFT for specialized domains, we present SmallToLarge (S2L), an effective and scalable data selection algorithm. S2L operates by first gathering training loss trajectories for each training example using a small model. These trajectories are then clustered, and similar number of examples are selected from these clusters uniformly at random. This process is grounded in our theoretical findings that examples within the same cluster exhibit similar gradients during training, thereby affecting the model similarly. Consequently, subsets sampled from these clusters have a bounded gradient error w.r.t. the full data, allowing for training a comparable model with only a subset of data. Furthermore, we provide a convergence rate analysis for training on these subsets, establishing a robust theoretical foundation for S2L's effectiveness and efficiency.

To validate S2L's effectiveness, we applied it to the challenging tasks of SFT for (1) mathematical problem-solving and (2) clinical text summarization. Our experiments on MathInstruct [64] shows that S2L can significantly reduce the required training data size to just 11% of the original dataset size while still matching the performance levels of the full dataset, outperforming current state-of-the-art one-shot and online data selection algorithms by an average of 4.7% across 6 in- and out-domain evaluation datasets. Remarkably, on the MATH benchmark [19], S2L attained a 32.7% accuracy with just 50K data points, improving the best open-sourced model under 3 billion parameters, Phi-2, by 16.6%. For clinical text summarization tasks on the MIMIC-III [21] dataset, S2L outperforms training on the full dataset, using only half of the data. Unlike existing methods that require training and getting features from large models, S2L achieves superior data efficiency using a model with as few as 70 million parameters, which is \(100\times\) smaller than the largest target model we train with 7 billion parameters.

Figure 1: Existing data selection methods depend heavily on the feature representations from a reference model, which makes their effectiveness vulnerable to the quality of training on the target domain [34]. For supervised fine-tuning (SFT), while pretrained models can effectively separate topics (shown in different colors) in natural language (Figure 0(a)), they struggle with fine-tuning data that deviates from the pretraining distribution (Figure 0(b)). Additionally, the cost of training a reference model escalates with model size (Figure 0(c)), making existing data selection methods for large models prohibitively expensive.

Related Work

**Foundations of Data Selection.** Data selection has been well studied for small models and classification tasks. There are one-shot algorithms that select data based on rankings of the proposed training statistics, for example, the L2-norms of error and gradient vectors (EL2N and GraNd) [39], confidence and its variability across epochs [46], and the number of times each example is learned but then forgot at the subsequent training step [49]. Besides these heuristic indicators, there are embedding-based pruning algorithms [45] and online selection algorithms with theoretical performance guarantees for efficiency [35; 23; 24; 40; 60] and robustness [59; 62; 16]. Coleman et al. proposed to use the intermediate feature representation of a small proxy model to select data for image classification. Most recently, data selection has shown great potential in more substantial training speedup when implemented on near-storage hardware [41], and data selection beyond supervised learning of image data, e.g., for self-supervised learning [22] and multimodal learning [1; 33], also emerged.

**Data Efficient Training of Large Language Models.** For the pre-training of LLMs, Marion et al. studied data quality indicators including Perplexity, Error L2-Norm (EL2N) [39], and memorization ranking [5], and found training on examples with middle Perplexity rankings outperforms training on examples selected based on the other two metrics, and sometimes even outperforms training on the entire dataset. Tirumala et al. uses pre-trained model embeddings to select data for LLM pre-training. The proposed algorithm, D4, first applies an embedding-based data de-duplication algorithm [1] and then discards data points that are the closest to the K-Means cluster centroids in the embedding space [45] to ensure diversity. On fine-tuning LLMs, existing work on data efficiency primarily focused on manually curating high-quality instructions [67], or using strong closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4 [2] or ChatGPT) to rate the quality of each training example [18; 27; 8]. Bhatt et al. implemented an experimental design framework to evaluate the existing data selection methods for instruction fine-tuning of LLMs and found selecting facility locations based on hidden representations (i.e., embeddings) is the most effective. As the only data selection algorithm for specialized domains, SCIP [61] focuses on pruning low-quality code data for training code LLMs. Since it relies on breaking the code syntax to understand the characteristics of low-quality code in the embedding (i.e, hidden states) space, adapting SCIP to domains other than Python code data is non-trivial.

**Adapting Large Language Models for Specialized Domains.** The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) gives rise to new state-of-the-art models in specialized domains. For mathematical reasoning, Galactica [47], MINERVA [26] and Llemma [3] continue to train an LLM on large-scale math-related web data to improve a model's general scientific reasoning; WizardMath [31] and TinyGSM [30] fine-tune LLMs using supervised data. Similarly for medical LLMs, Cheng et al. continued training pre-trained LLMs on medical text, and [43; 44] fine-tuned PaLM with instruction prompt tuning on medical domain data.

## 3 Problem Formulation

**LLM Fine-tuning Objective.** Consider a transformer-based language model, parameterized by \(\bm{\theta}\), and denoted as \(p_{\bm{\theta}}\). This model, when provided with a sequence of prompt tokens \(\mathbf{x}=(x_{1},\dots,x_{M})\), generates a sequence of response tokens \(\mathbf{y}=(y_{1},\dots,y_{L})\). The conditional probability of generating \(\mathbf{y}\) given \(\mathbf{x}\) is then formulated as

\[p_{\bm{\theta}}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x})=\prod_{l=1}^{L}p_{\bm{\theta}}(y_{l}| \mathbf{y}_{1:l-1},\mathbf{x}).\] (1)

Note that \(\mathbf{y}_{1:0}\) is an empty sequence. To adapt the pre-trained LLM for a specialized domain of distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is usually employed with a domain-specific training dataset \(D_{\text{train}}=\{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\sim\mathcal{D}\) containing pairs of prompt \(\mathbf{x}\) and annotated response \(\mathbf{y}\). The fine-tuning objective is thus to minimize the following negative log likelihood loss, expressed as:

\[\min_{\bm{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta},D_{\text{train}})=-\frac{1}{n}\sum_ {(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})_{i}\in D_{\text{train}}}\big{[}\log p_{\bm{\theta}}( \mathbf{y}_{i}|\mathbf{x}_{i})\big{]}.\] (2)

**Data Selection Objective.** In a general setting for data selection, we consider a target language model \(p_{\bm{\theta}}\) with parameters \(\bm{\theta}\). Given a fixed data budget \(B\), which constrains the number of data pointsthat can be used for training, our objective is to select a subset \(S\subseteq D_{\text{train}}\) to train the target model, such that it obtains a superior generalization performance. In practice, the subset \(S\) is selected based on a reference model \(r_{\bm{\phi}}\) parameterized by \(\bm{\phi}\), which generates representations, confidence scores, or other metrics for each data point \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})_{i}\in D_{\text{train}}\), denoted by \(r_{\bm{\phi}}((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})_{i})\), which will be utilized by a data selection algorithm to produce \(S\).

In existing data selection algorithms, \(\bm{\phi}\) is commonly either weights of the pre-trained target model or a target model that has been fully trained on the dataset \(D_{\text{train}}\). However, as evidenced by Figure 1, representations generated by the pretrained model may not always be good enough for data selection in specialized domains, and fine-tuning the target model significantly increases the computational cost of data selection.

## 4 Methodology

Training a large target model to obtain feature representations for each example in \(D_{\text{train}}\) can be computationally intensive. However, a recent finding demonstrates that the training dynamics of most examples are consistent across differently sized models of the same family, and this phenomena even generalizes across different model families [58]. Our proposed method, **SMALLToLarge (S2L)**, leverages _loss trajectories_ of training examples collected during fine-tuning a _small_ reference model on the full or a subset of training data.

Loss Trajectory.Let \(\bm{\phi}^{(t)}\) be the parameters of a small LM during training on \(D_{\text{train}}\) at times \(t_{q},q\in\{1,...,T\}\). S2L records the loss trajectory for each data point \(i\) at times \(t_{q}\) during training the reference model \([\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}(\bm{\phi}^{(t_{1})}),\ldots,\mathcal{L}_{i}^ {\text{proxy}}(\bm{\phi}^{(t_{T})})]\) where

\[\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}(\bm{\phi}^{(t)})=\mathcal{L}^{\text{proxy}}( \bm{\phi}^{(t)},(\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{i}))=-\log p_{\bm{\phi}^{(t)}}( \mathbf{y}_{i}|\mathbf{x}_{i}),\] (3)

and \(T\) is the length of the loss trajectory. Note that \(\bm{\phi}^{(t)}\) is trained for a fixed number of iterations from \(\bm{\phi}^{(t-1)}\).

Assume the parameter vector \(\bm{\theta}^{(t)}\) represents the parameters of the target model at the time \(t\). Define \(\mathbf{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}=[\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}(\bm{\phi}^{(t _{1})}),\ldots,\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}(\bm{\phi}^{(t_{T})})]\) and \(\mathbf{L}_{i}^{\text{target}}=[\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{target}}(\bm{\theta}^ {(t_{1})}),\ldots,\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{target}}(\bm{\theta}^{(t_{T})})]\) as the training loss trajectory of the example \(i\) on the small proxy model and the large target model, respectively. Let \(\bm{H}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) be the Hessian matrix for each example \(i\) and assume that the loss function for each example during fine-tuning can be modeled by a second-order Taylor approximation with bounded curvature (\(c\leq\|\bm{H}_{i}\|\leq C\)), a reasonable assumption in fine-tuning settings. The following lemma shows that examples with similar loss trajectories on the proxy model have similar gradients throughout the training of the target model.

**Theorem 4.1**.: _If examples \(i\) and \(j\) have similar loss trajectories on the proxy model, i.e., \(\|\mathbf{L}_{i}^{\text{proxy}}-\mathbf{L}_{j}^{\text{proxy}}\|\leq\epsilon\), and their loss trajectories on the proxy and target model is similar, i.e., \(\|\mathbf{L}_{p}^{\text{proxy}}-\mathbf{L}_{p}^{\text{target}}\|\leq\delta\) for \(p\in\{i,j\}\), then \(i\) and \(j\) have similar gradients throughout training the target model:_

\[\|\nabla\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{target}}(\bm{\theta})-\nabla\mathcal{L}_{j}^{ \text{target}}(\bm{\theta})\|\leq\frac{2\epsilon^{\prime}+2CD^{2}}{d}=\Delta.\] (4)

_where \(\epsilon^{\prime}=\epsilon+2\delta\) and \(\|\bm{\theta}\|\leq D\) for all \(t\)._

The proof of Theorem 4.1 can be found in Appendix A.1. Theorem 4.1 shows that examples with similar loss trajectories have similar gradients during the training, thereby influencing the model in a similar manner.

Data selection from Loss Trajectory Clusters.Once the loss trajectories are recorded on the proxy model, we apply a clustering algorithm to group examples based on the similarity of their loss trajectories. This results in a set of clusters \(\{C_{1},C_{2},\ldots,C_{K}\}\), where each cluster \(C_{i}\) contains examples with similar loss and gradient trajectory throughout the training:

\[C_{i}=\{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})_{j}\in D_{\text{train}}|i=\arg\min_{j\in[K]}d( \mathbf{L}_{j},\mathbf{L}_{C_{j}})\},\] (5)

where \(\mathbf{L}_{C_{i}}\) is the centroid of the loss trajectories in cluster \(C_{i}\), and \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is a distance metric, such as Euclidean distance, used for clustering. For datasets that contain different sources of data, we cluster each source separately.

on the full dataset. IG methods such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) update parameters iteratively based on the gradient of the loss of individual examples, multiplied by stepsize \(\alpha\). Formally,

\[\bm{\theta}^{t+1}=\bm{\theta}^{t}-\alpha\nabla\mathcal{L}_{i}^{\text{target}}( \bm{\theta}^{t}).\] (6)

**Corollary 4.2**.: _Under the assumptions of Theorem 4.1, applying IG with stepsize \(\alpha\) to subsets found by S2L, converges to the neighborhood of the optimal solution, as follows:_

\[\|\bm{\theta}^{t+1}-\bm{\theta}^{\star}\|^{2}\leq(1-\alpha c)^{t+1}\|\bm{ \theta}^{t}-\bm{\theta}^{\star}\|^{2}+2\xi R/c^{2}+\alpha B^{2}(r_{\min}/k)^{ 2}\bm{g}_{\max}^{2}\] (7)

_where \(c\leq\|\bm{H}\|\), \(B=k\cdot K\) is the total size of the subset, \(\bm{g}_{\max}\) is the largest gradient norm of individual examples during training, \(r_{\min}=\min_{j}|C_{j}|,r_{\max}=\max_{j}|C_{j}|\), \(R=\min\{d_{0},B\bm{g}_{\max}+\xi/c\}\) and \(d_{0}=\|\bm{\theta}^{0}-\bm{\theta}^{\star}\|\) is the initial distance to the optimal solution \(\bm{\theta}^{\star}\), and \(\xi\) is given by:_

\[\xi=K[r_{\min}\Delta+(r_{\max}-r_{\min})\bm{g}_{\max}].\] (8)

The proof can be found in Appendix A.2.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we present the comprehensive experiments conducted to evaluate the efficacy of the proposed data selection method, SmallToLarge (S2L), across two challenging domains (mathematical reasoning and clinical text summarization).

Figure 2: Examples in the same clusters have very similar loss trajectories (Figure 1(a)) while the loss trajectories of examples in different clusters are very different (Figure 1(b)).

### Baselines

We systematically compare S2L against a comprehensive set of open-sourced data selection methods. These methods are categorized based on the type of representation they use and selected as the most representative or best-performing methods as identified in prior work. These include: (1) **Random Sampling**; selecting examples with the (2) **Least Confidence**[4] or (3)**Middle Perplexity**[34]; (4) **High Learnability**, determined by the loss decrease before and after full fine-tuning [68]; and (5) **Facility Locations** selection based on hidden states [4]. Additionally, we incorporate one online selection techniques: (6) **Confidence Curriculum** proposed by Varshney et al., which selects examples with decreasing confidence during the training. Given that the optimal reference model may vary for each one-shot selection method, we ensure a fair comparison by adopting the approach used in [34], which runs each method with both the fully fine-tuned target model and an early fine-tuning checkpoint as the reference model. We report the best results from these setups.

### Specialized Domain 1: Mathematical Reasoning

**Training Settings.** We focus on fine-tuning using the **MathInstruct** dataset [64] with 262,040 training examples for its comprehensive coverage of diverse mathematical fields and its capability in training models to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the standard evaluation benchmarks. We employ the open-source model suites Pythia [6], Phi-2 [28], Llama-2 [50] as our base models to validate our S2L algorithm and directly compare its performance against the state-of-the-art.

**Evaluation Datasets.** We follow the framework established in [64] for a comprehensive assessment using several well-regarded datasets, including in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. For the in-domain datasets, we consider **GSM8K**[11], **MATH**[19], and **NumGLUE**[36]. For the out-of-domain datasets, we consider **SVAMP**[38], **Mathematics**[13], **SimulEq**[25]. These datasets collectively span a diverse range of mathematical subjects, such as algebra, probability, number theory, calculus, and geometry. Additionally, some questions in these datasets require the application of commonsense, reading comprehension, and multi-step reasoning. All questions are open-formed.

**Evaluation Metric.** We use the standard evaluation metric for open-formed questions, **exact match**, which measures the model's accuracy by comparing its generated answers against the correct solutions. For an answer to be considered correct, it must match the reference solution precisely.

More details about the settings and baseline implementations can be found in Appendix B.

#### 5.2.1 Setting 1: Less Data for Better Models

In the first setting, we standardize the number of training steps to correspond to 3 epochs on the full dataset, aligning with [64]. This allows us to maintain a consistent training schedule across different methods and data budgets, ensuring fair and accurate comparisons of the quality of data.

**Scaling the Data: SOTA algorithms fail with small data budgets while S2L stands out across data scales.** In Figure 4, we compare S2L against the baselines from Section 5.1 on Pythia-410M across varying data sizes. The training trajectories used by S2L are based on Pythia-70M, a model approximately 6x smaller than Pythia-410M. With the same number of training steps as the full training, S2L exceeds the full dataset's performance using only 30K examples, only 11% of the full dataset. It leads the runner-up baselines by an average of 4.7%, 4.6% and 2.4% with data budget 30K, 50K and 100K across all six evaluation datasets. While state-of-the-art data selection algorithms like Facility Locations [4] and High Learnability [68] have decent performance with a large enough data budget (i.e., 100K), all SOTA algorithms except S2L cannot even outperform the random sampling baseline when the allowed data size is small (i.e., 30K). Unlike the existing algorithms, S2L consistently outperforms all baselines and even full training across all data sizes. Note that compared to the runner-up algorithm in this setting, Facility Locations, the cost of S2L is much lower in both training the reference model and data selection stages (Figure 5), and therefore more scalable to both larger target models or larger data sizes.

Figure 5: Wall-clock time required to train the reference model and select 100K data from MathInstruct for training Pythia-410M.

**Scaling the Model: Data selected by S2L can transfer to larger models in different model suites.** We also test whether this subset, chosen using Pythia-70M, can effectively train larger models beyond 410M and models outside the Pythia suite. As shown in Table 1, our experiments with Phi-2 reveal that fine-tuning on only 50K S2L-selected data again outperforms full dataset training on the most challenging MATH [19] benchmark improving the pretrained Phi-2 by \(16.6\%\) and is more data efficient than training on the full MathInstruct dataset to get the same performance.

#### 5.2.2 Setting 2: Less Data for Faster Training

The second setting we consider is when fixing the number of times each example can be seen over the entire course of training, directly translating smaller datasets into reduced training and storage costs. This is particularly beneficial for large models that would require extensive training times without data selection. By experimenting with models of larger sizes than the previous setting, we observe in Table 2 that S2L can achieve comparable performance to full-data training when using only 50% data and thereby reducing both the data storage space and the training time by half.

#### 5.2.3 Why is S2L So Effective?

**Examples in Clusters Encode the Same Knowledge/Skill.** In Appendix C, we compare actual training examples in MathInstruct that get clustered together due to their similar training trajectories on the small Pythia-70M model. We observe that examples in the same cluster are of the same type and related to the same knowledge/skill, e.g., open-formed algebra questions (Figure 15), examples requiring extracting useful information from long text and writing programs

recorded at any training stage (early, middle, or recorded sparsely throughout the training.

**S2L does not require the full training data to train the proxy and can scale efficiently to larger datasets.** To further demonstrate the scalability of the proposed S2L method, we conducted experiments by training the proxy on a smaller sample of the data (100K examples) for the same number of epochs (3 epochs) and saving the loss for all examples. The results, shown in Figure 10, confirm that S2L remains effective when the proxy model is trained on a smaller subset of training data and therefore is scalable to larger datasets without a proportional increase in computational costs.

**S2L is robust across different clustering parameter values for K.** We conducted detailed experiments varying the clustering parameter K, as shown in Figure 11. The results demonstrate that S2L maintains high performance across different values of K, highlighting the robustness of our method to different clustering parameter choices. We chose K=100 for our experiments as it provided the best average accuracy across the evaluation datasets for the math reasoning task.

**S2L remains effective and efficient compared to using full data when trained for the same number of epochs.** Figure 12 illustrates the relative accuracy to full data across different epochs, comparing S2L-selected data and full data with the same number of epochs. Both in-domain and overall average accuracy are shown. S2L demonstrates superior performance with fewer data and fewer training iterations.

**S2L supports a range of small models as effective proxies.** To understand whether different small models could serve as effective proxies, we used GPT-2 (124M) and Pythia-160M as proxy models for data selection to train Pythia-410M. The results, illustrated in Figure 13, show that both proxy models perform comparably in guiding the data selection, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of using different small models for S2L.
In this work, we introduced SMLToLarge (S2L), a scalable data selection method to improve the data efficiency of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains. By clustering data points based on their training dynamics on smaller models and balanced sampling from all clusters, S2L significantly reduces the required training data size without compromising performance compared to using the entire training dataset. Our comprehensive experiments across the mathematical problem-solving and clinical text summarization domains demonstrate the effectiveness of S2L.

Our study does come with its limitations. S2L has been only tested within two domains, mathematics and medicine, and on models up to 7 billion parameters, constrained by our computational resources. Additionally, our experiments employed a fixed training schedule across all methods without further optimization or hyperparameter tuning for each method, including S2L. This unified approach, while it ensures a fair comparison, may not fully capture the potential performance improvement that could be achieved with more tailored training strategies. We encourage further research to extend the application of S2L across a broader spectrum of domains and investigate the impact of hyperparameter tuning on its effectiveness.

### Proof of Corollary 4.2

Without loss of generality, assume we select \(k\) example from each cluster and we have \(k\leq\min_{j\in[K]}|C_{j}|\). Then the error of the subset in capturing the full gradient will be

\[\xi\leq\sum_{j}(|C_{j}|-k)(\bar{\bm{g}}_{j}+\Delta),\] (22)

where \(\bar{\bm{g}}_{j}\) is the norm of the average gradient of the selected examples from \(C_{j}\). In practice, we can weight elements of the subset by \(r_{\min}/k\), which has a similar effect to scaling the step size when training on the subset. Let \(\bm{g}_{\max}=\max_{j}\|\bm{g}_{j}\|\) be the maximum gradient norm during training, \(r_{\max}=\max_{j}|C_{j}|,r_{\min}=\min_{j}|C_{j}|\). Then, we get

\[\xi^{\prime} \leq\sum_{j}(r_{\min}-k)\Delta+(|C_{j}|-r_{\min})(\bar{\bm{g}}_{ j}+\Delta)\] (23) \[\leq K[r_{\min}\Delta+(r_{\max}-r_{\min})\bm{g}_{\max}]\] (24)

The first term in RHS of Eq (23) is the error of the subset selected from \(C_{j}\) to capture its full gradient and the second term is due to selecting the same number of examples, \(k\), from the larger clusters.

Using the above error and following the proof of Theorem 1 in [35], for a constant step size \(\alpha\leq 1/c\) we get:

\[\|\bm{\theta}^{t+1}-\bm{\theta}^{*}\|^{2}\leq(1-\alpha c)^{t+1}\|\bm{\theta}^ {t}-\bm{\theta}^{*}\|^{2}+2\xi^{\prime}R/c^{2}+\alpha B^{2}(r_{\min}/k)^{2} \bm{g}_{\max}^{2},\] (25)

where \(c\leq\|\bm{H}\|\), and \(B=k\cdot K\) is the total size of the subset, \(R=\min\{d_{0},B\bm{g}_{\max}+\xi^{\prime}/c\}\) and \(d_{0}=\|\bm{\theta}^{0}-\bm{\theta}^{*}\|\) is the initial distance to the optimal solution \(\bm{\theta}^{*}\).

If \(k\geq|C_{j}|\) for any cluster \(C_{j}\), one can simply add \((r_{\min}/k-1)\cdot\hat{\bm{g}}_{j}\) to \(\xi^{\prime}\) for the corresponding clusters, where \(\hat{\bm{g}}_{j}\) is the norm of the total gradient of cluster \(C_{j}\) and we replace \(r_{\min}\) in Eq (23) with the size of smallest cluster that has larger than \(k\) examples.

## Appendix B Experiment Details

### Models

Pythia.The Pythia models [6] are a suite of large language models (LLMs) developed by EleutherAI licensed under the Apache License 2.0. These models range in size from 70 million to 12 billion parameters and are designed to enable controlled scientific research on transparently trained LLMs across various scales.

Phi.The Phi models [28] developed by Microsoft are under the MIT License. Phi-1.5, a transformer-based model with 1.3 billion parameters, and its successor, Phi-2, with 2.7 billion parameters, have been trained on a diverse set of data sources, including synthetic texts and curated websites. The Phi models underscore the potential of small yet powerful language models in understanding and generating human language, empowering a range of NLP tasks. Phi-2, in particular, has raised the bar for reasoning and language understanding among foundation models, matching or even exceeding the performance of models 25 times its size on complex benchmarks.

LLaMA 2.The LLaMA 2 models [50], released by Meta AI and licensed under the LLaMA 2 Community License Agreement, are designed for improved natural language understanding and generation. LLaMA 2-7B, the smallest in this series with 7 billion parameters, has demonstrated competitive performance across various NLP benchmarks despite its moderate size.

### Datasets

MathInstruct.The MathInstruct dataset [64] is compiled from 13 diverse math rationale datasets, using both chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales. It ensures comprehensive coverage across various mathematical fields in the 262K training examples, making it a popular resource for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) for general math problem-solving. MathInstruct is licensed under the MIT license.

Mimic-Iii.The MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) dataset [21] is a comprehensive collection of de-identified health data associated with over 40,000 patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, Massachusetts. This large dataset includes information such as demographics, vital signs, laboratory tests, medications, and more, making it an invaluable resource for a wide range of research in healthcare, including clinical decision support systems, medical procedure efficacy studies, and patient care optimization strategies.

The MIMIC-III dataset is made freely available to the research community under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) compliance, ensuring patient confidentiality and data protection. Access to the dataset is granted under a data use agreement (DUA) to individuals affiliated with an institution that approves the use of the data for research purposes. Researchers seeking to utilize the MIMIC-III dataset must complete a required training course on human research protections, which ensures that all researchers are aware of the responsibilities involved in handling sensitive patient data.

### Implementation Details

S21The training trajectories for both MathInstruct and MIMIC-III are gathered from training a Pythia-70M model, the smallest model in the Pythia model suite, recorded every \(500\) training iterations. We utilize the Faiss library [17] to perform efficient K-means clustering of loss trajectories with Euclidean distance with \(K=100\) and \(20\) iterations. The hyperparameter \(K\) is tuned in the range of \(\{50,100,200\}\) based on the average accuracy of the model trained on \(30K\) selected data. We found \(K=100\) worked the best for both datasets we studied in this paper. Ablations studies on the length and the best time in the training to record the trajectories can be found in Section 5.4.

Comparing Reference Models for the BaselinesFor one-shot selection methods (excluding S2L), we use representations from either step 1000 or the end of fine-tuning Pythia-410M on MathInstruct and reported the better result in Figure 4 and Table 1. In Table 4, we include the complete comparison between using early-fine-tuning vs. end-of-fine-tuning model checkpoints as the inference model. For Facility Locations, we further compared using the first hidden states as the feature representation as suggested in [4] to using the last hidden states [56] for the tasks we studied.The ranges for confidence, perplexity, and learnability are chosen according to the best-performing intervals reported in prior research (Section 5.1).

Due to memory and computational constraints, for Facility Locations, we calculate pairwise similarity and perform greedy selection on a per-data-source basis. We found this per-source selection approach also yields benefits for S2L as different data sources within MathInstruct exhibit distinct common patterns in their training trajectories. Therefore, we implement S2L also on a per-source basis for MathInstruct, and recommend applying S2L per source when dealing with datasets composed of multiple data sources.

HyperparametersFollowing the setup used in [64], we adopt a training regimen with a learning rate of 2e-5, a batch size of 128, a maximum length of 512, and a cosine scheduler with a 3% warm-up period.

Experiments Compute ResourcesWe fine-tune all the models with the Huggingface transformers library [55] with Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) [66] on 4 48G NVIDIA RTX A6000.

### Evaluation

#### b.4.1 MathInstruct

Datasets.We utilize 6 diverse datasets with open-formed questions for evaluating the mathematical reasoning capabilities of models trained with both the full MathInstruct dataset and selected subsets. These datasets, detailed in Table 5, span a range of mathematical disciplines from early algebra to calculus and linear algebra, covering various types of questions such as multi-step reasoning, arithmetic word problems, and problems from mathematics competitions. This variety ensures a comprehensive assessment across both in-domain and out-domain tasks.

Pipeline.We utilize the pipeline provided by [64]2, designed to first determine whether the model can be prompted to generate a code snippet. This code snippet, if successfully generated, should be executable and produce the correct answer when run. This code-based evaluation is also used for Phi models [28]. In cases where the model does not directly produce a viable code solution, we employ a "think step-by-step" prompting strategy [54]. This method prompts the model to break down its reasoning process, a technique that has been widely proven effective in fully exploiting the model's problem-solving capacity.

#### b.4.2 Mimic-Iii

Following [14, 15], we include the six most common modality/anatomy pairs: CT head, CT abdomen, CT chest, MRI head, CT spine, and CT neck, and five less common pairs in the text data: MRI spine, CT sinus, MRI abdomen, MRI pelvis, and MRI neck in the evaluation. There are in total 13.7K test examples after data preprocessing and train-test splitting.

## Appendix D Topic Distribution of Data Selected by S2L

Beyond qualitative examples from different clusters, we study how S2L changes the data distribution to outperform using the full fine-tuning dataset as well as using random subsets of the same size that have the same distribution as the original dataset. In Figure 18, we can observe that S2L not only guarantees a thorough and balanced coverage across the spectrum of topics but also ensures sufficient representation of foundational topics, such as pre-algebra, which lays the groundwork for tackling more complex subjects.

## Appendix E Broader Impacts

This paper introduces a data selection method for large language models (LLMs), aiming to enhance the data efficiency in the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of these models.

Figure 14: Break-down accuracies (\(\uparrow\)) on in-domain and out-of-domain datasets using Pythia-410M. Data size refers to the total number of unique training examples used. All experiments in this table share the same total training steps and learning rate schedule (see Section 5.2).

**Positive Impacts:** Our method, by reducing the data requirements for training LLMs, can make fine-tuning LLMs more effective and accessible. This could lead to broader participation in AI research and application development across various fields, including healthcare and education.

**Negative Impacts:** Our method does not inherently involve or encourage applications with direct negative societal impacts. The focus is on a generic improvement in the field of machine learning, particularly in the training of LLMs.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The theoretical results provided in Section 4 (and Appendix A) and the experimental results provided in Section 5 support the main claims made in the abstract and introduction. We also conducted experiments with both different data scales and model scales (Section 5.2.1), in both the math and medical domains (Section 5.2 and Section 5.3), and ablation studies (Section 5.4), to reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper discusses the limitations of the work in Section 6. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs**Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The complete proof for each theoretical result is provided in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper is provided in Section 5.2, Section 5.3 and Appendix B. Additionally, the anonymized code is provided with the instructions in the Supplementary Material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The anonymized code is provided with the instructions in the Supplementary Material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings for different tasks we considered are presented in the corresponding sections in the main paper (Section 5.2 and Section 5.3). More details are provided in Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive. We ran every experiment independently from the data selection to the target model training without pre-defining random seeds to avoid over-fitting to one selected subset or cherry-picking the seeds. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Information about the GPU including the memory is provided in Appendix B.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and confirmed that the research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes]Justification: The broader impacts of the work are discussed in Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks because it does not release new data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All assets used in this paper are properly cited. The license for each model and dataset is provided in Appendix B.1 and Appendix B.2 respectively. The code used for evaluation is introduced in Appendix B.4 with the URL provided in the footnote. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
