###### Abstract

While recent works on blind face image restoration have successfully produced impressive high-quality (HQ) images with abundant details from low-quality (LQ) input images, the generated content may not accurately reflect the real appearance of a person. To address this problem, incorporating well-shot personal images as additional reference inputs could be a promising strategy. Inspired by the recent success of the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM), we propose ReF-LDM--an adaptation of LDM designed to generate HQ face images conditioned on one LQ image and multiple HQ reference images. Our model integrates an effective and efficient mechanism, CacheKV, to leverage the reference images during the generation process. Additionally, we design a timestep-scaled identity loss, enabling our LDM-based model to focus on learning the discriminating features of human faces. Lastly, we construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset consisting of 20,405 high-quality (HQ) face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation data for reference-based face restoration models.

## 1 Introduction

Recent works [5, 26, 32] have achieved impressive results in generating a realistic high-quality (HQ) face image from an input low-quality (LQ) image. However, the important features of a person's face may be corrupted in the LQ image, and thus the reconstructed image may look like a different person. To tackle this problem, besides the LQ image, additional HQ images of this person can be used as reference input. Moreover, allowing multiple reference images may lead to better quality because they offer more comprehensive appearance of this person in different conditions, e.g., different poses, expressions, or lighting.

A previous work [16] has explored using multiple reference images for face restoration. Their method, however, depends on a face landmark model to detect facial components (i.e., eyes, nose, and mouse), which may become unreliable when the input LQ image is severely degraded. Besides, latent diffusion model (LDM) [22] has also been used in different image generating tasks with different input conditions, such as low-resolution images, semantic maps, or sketch images [22, 29].

Inspired by the recent success of LDM, we propose **ReF-LDM** for reference-based face image restoration. Unlike previous conditional LDM methods where their input conditions are usually spatially aligned with the target image, the reference images are not aligned with the target HQ image in our case. Therefore, we design a **CacheKV** mechanism, which effectively and efficiently integrates the reference images, albeit with different poses and expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a timestep-scaled identity loss to drive the reconstructed image to look like the same person of the LQ and reference images. Lastly, we also construct a new large-scale dataset of face images with corresponding reference images, which can serve as both training and evaluation datasets for future reference-based face restoration research.

With the above components, our ReF-LDM outperforms recent state-of-the-art methods with a significant improvement in face identity similarity. Extensive ablation studies for the proposed CacheKV mechanism and timestep-scaled identity loss are also conducted and reported. The main contributions of this work can be summarized as:

* We propose ReF-LDM, which features an effective and efficient CacheKV mechanism, for restoring an LQ face image using multiple reference images.
* We introduce a timestep-scaled identity loss, which considers the characteristics of diffusion models and helps ReF-LDM better learn the discriminating features of human identities.
* We construct FFHQ-Ref, a dataset comprising 20,406 high-quality face images and their corresponding reference images, to facilitate the advance of reference-based face image restoration.

## 2 Related work

Face restoration without personal reference imagesNumerous studies have been proposed for blind face image restoration [28; 2; 5; 32; 20; 13; 26]. Recent works such as VQFR [5] and CodeFormer [32] have achieved promising results by exploiting VQGAN, while DAEFR [26] further employs a dual-branch encoder to mitigate the domain gap between LQ and HQ images. Inspired by the success of diffusion models, several works [23; 31; 17; 27; 25] have adopted diffusion models for face image restoration. However, as these methods do not leverage reference images, the restored images may differ from the authentic facial appearance of a person, especially when an input image is severely degraded.

Face restoration with personal reference imagesSeveral methods [14; 15; 16; 19] have attempted to utilize additional reference images to enhance personal fidelity in face restoration. GFRNet [14] warps a single reference image to match the face pose of the LQ image, while ASFNet [15] selects the reference image with the closest matching facial landmarks to serve as the network input. Closer to the setting of this work, DMDNet [16] also utilizes multiple reference images. It detects facial

Figure 1: **Reference-based face image restoration. Given an input low-quality face image (a), a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) can reconstruct a high-quality image (b); however, it may not be faithful to the individualâ€™s facial identity. To address this problem, we propose ReF-LDM, which restores a high-quality image with faithful details (c) by utilizing additional reference images (d).**

landmarks on the LQ image and the reference images to extract features of facial components, and then integrates these features into the model by querying the corresponding components. However, their method relies on landmark detection, which may not be robust on severely degraded LQ images. In contrast, our ReF-LDM implicitly learns the correspondences between the features of the LQ image and the reference images, without the need for landmark detection. From a different perspective, MyStyle [19] adopts a per-person optimization setting, leveraging hundreds of images of an individual to define a personalized subspace within the latent space of a StyleGAN [12]. In comparison, our approach offers greater flexibility, capable of utilizing one to several reference images without the need for personalized model optimization for each individual.

Latent diffusion models with image conditionsPrevious work demonstrates that LDM can generate an image from a low-resolution image by simple channel-axis concatenation [22]. However, reference images in our task are not spatially aligned with the target HQ image, thus requiring a more sophisticated integration mechanism. MasaCtrl [1] achieves text-to-image synthesis with a single reference image by replacing the original keys and values tokens with those from the reference image. However, their solution requires passing the reference image through the denoising network for multiple timesteps, which increases computation and limits its feasibility for extending to multiple reference images. In contrast, we propose an efficient CacheKV mechanism that leverages multiple reference images by eliminating the redundant network passes.

## 3 The proposed ReF-LDM model

In this section, we present the proposed ReF-LDM model. We introduce the network architecture in Sec. 3.1, where a CacheKV mechanism is designed to leverage reference images. We illustrate how to train our model with the timestep-scaled identity loss in Sec. 3.2.

Figure 2: **The proposed ReF-LDM pipeline. Our model accepts a low-quality image and multiple high-quality reference images as input and generates a high-quality image. The blue top panel alone represents a typical LDM [22] denoising process. For an LQ image \(\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{LQ}}\), we concatenate its latent \(\mathbf{z}_{\mathrm{LQ}}\) with \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) along the channel axis to serve as the input for the denoising U-net. For the reference images \(\{\mathbf{x}_{\mathrm{ref}}\}\), we design a CacheKV mechanism, depicted in the red panel, to extract and cache their key and value tokens using the same denoising U-net for just one time. These cached KV tokens can then be utilized repeatedly in each of the \(T\) timesteps of the main denoising process. During training, we adopt the classic LDM loss (\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LDM}}\)) and introduce a timestep-scaled identity loss (\(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{time\,ID}}\)).**

### Model architecture of ReF-LDM

The proposed ReF-LDM accepts an input LQ image and multiple reference images to generate a target HQ image. Its model architecture is based on the latent diffusion model [22], with additional designs to incorporate the input LQ image and the reference images.

#### 3.1.1 Preliminaries on Latent Diffusion Model

To generate an image, an image diffusion model [8] starts from a noisy image \(\mathbf{x}_{T}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W\times 3}\), initialized with a Gaussian distribution, and gradually denoises it to a clean image \(\mathbf{x}_{0}\) with a denoising network over \(T\) timesteps. A latent diffusion model [22] operates similarly, but the diffusion process takes place in a more compact latent space of a pre-trained and frozen autoencoder (encoder \(\mathcal{E}\) and decoder \(\mathcal{D}\)). That is, it begins with a random latent \(\mathbf{z}_{T}\in\mathbb{R}^{H_{z}\times W_{z}\times C_{z}}\) and progressively denoises it to a clean latent \(\mathbf{z}_{0}\). A clean image is then generated by passing the clean latent through the decoder during the inference phase, i.e., \(\mathbf{x}_{0}=\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{z}_{0})\); conversely, a ground truth clean latent is obtained by encoding a clean image with the encoder during the training phase, i.e., \(\mathbf{z}_{0}^{*}=\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x}_{0}^{*})\). A typical choice for the denoising network is a U-net with self-attention layers at multiple scales.

#### 3.1.2 CacheKV: a mechanism for incorporating reference images

As illustrated in Fig. 2, our ReF-LDM leverages an input LQ image \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{LQ}}\) and multiple reference images \(\{\mathbf{x}_{\text{ref}}\}\) to generate a target HQ image \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{HQ}}\). For an LQ image, we simply concatenate its latent encoded by the frozen encoder, \(\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}}=\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{LQ}})\), with the diffusion denoising latent \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) along the channel axis to serve as the input of the denoising U-net. For reference images, we design a **CacheKV** mechanism. Essentially, we extract and cache the features of reference images using the same denoising U-net just once; these cached features can then be used repeatedly at each of the \(T\) timesteps in the main denoising process. Specifically, we pass the encoded latent of each reference image, \(\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}=\mathcal{E}(\mathbf{x}_{\text{ref}})\), through the U-net to extract their keys and values (KVs) at each self-attention layer and store them in a CacheKV. Subsequently, during the main diffusion process, within each self-attention layer of the U-net, we concatenate the reference KVs (from the corresponding self-attention layer) with the main KVs along the token axis. This mechanism enables the U-net to incorporate the additional KVs from the reference images into the main denoising process. When extracting KVs from the reference images, we use a timestep embedding of \(t=0\) and pad \(\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\) with a zero tensor to accommodate the additional channels introduced for the LQ image.

To summarize, for inference, we first run the U-net once to extract CacheKV from the reference images; subsequently, we proceed through the main denoising process for \(T\) timesteps, during which the U-net integrates \(\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}}\) and reference CacheKV. For training, in each iteration, we first run the U-net to extract CacheKV, and then we run the U-net again to estimate the target latent from a sampled noisy latent \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\), incorporating the conditions \(\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}}\) and reference CacheKV.

#### 3.1.3 Comparing CacheKV with other designs

There are other intuitive designs for integrating the reference latents \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) into the diffusion denoising process. However, they are either ineffective or computationally inefficient compared to the proposed CacheKV. The quantitative evaluation and computational analysis is reported in Sec. 5.2.1. We depict these designs in Fig. 3 and provide an intuitive explanation as follows:

* **Channel-concatenation**: Concatenating the condition with \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) along the channel axis works well for LQ images (and for other 2D conditions such as semantic maps [22]); however, it is not effective for reference images. A critical difference between these conditions is that--while the LQ image is spatially aligned with the target HQ image, the reference images are not. Therefore, it is challenging for the model to leverage reference images using simple channel-concatenation.
* **Cross-attention**: Cross-attention layers have been proven useful for text conditions in text-to-image models [22]. In our ablation experiment, we insert a cross-attention layer after each self-attention layer and use the reference latents \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) to produce keys and values. While cross-attention appears to have the potential to address the spatial misalignment problem, it still fails to effectively utilize the reference images. The difference between our CacheKV and the cross-attention setting is that CacheKV provides the reference images in a more aligned feature space for the main denoising process to leverage. Specifically, the CacheKV is extracted using the same U-net and the corresponding self-attention layer as in the main denoising process. Incontrast, the cross-attention setting processes the reference images only with the frozen encoder, resulting in features that are less aligned with those in the U-net of the denoising process.
* **Spatial-concatenation**: Concatenating \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) with \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) along the spatial dimension to serve as the input for U-net also effectively leverages the reference images. Conceptually, spatial-concatenation treats reference images in a very similar way to our CacheKV. In both mechanisms, \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) are processed through the denoising U-net, allowing the reference KVs to be accessed by the queries (Qs) of the main diffusion latent \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\). However, spatial-concatenation requires significantly more computational resources compared to our CacheKV. It passes \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) with \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) to the U-net at each of the \(T\) denoising timesteps, whereas CacheKV only passes \(\{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\}\) through the U-net once. Moreover, spatial-concatenation also requires significantly more GPU memory, as the spatial size of the input for the U-net increases with the number of reference images. As for a self-attention layer in the U-net, both mechanisms increase memory usage; CacheKV introduces additional reference KVs, while spatial-concatenation introduces reference QKVs.

### Timestep-scaled identity loss

#### 3.2.1 Timestep-scaled identity loss

As this work aims for face image restoration, we employ the identity loss to enhance face similarity, which is adopted in many face-related tasks [9; 21; 28]. The identity loss minimizes the distance within the embedding space of a face recognition model, thereby capturing the discriminating features of human faces more effectively than the plain RGB pixel space. In our experiments, we use the ArcFace model [3] with cosine distance between the 1D embedding vectors as the identity loss.

However, naively adding identity loss to the training of Ref-LDM significantly worsens the image quality. One possible explanation might be that, the one-step model prediction \(\mathbf{x}_{0|t}=\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{z}_{0}|\mathbf{z}_{t})\) at a very noisy timestep (e.g., \(t=T\)) is very different from a natural face image and thus out of the distribution that the ArcFace model is trained on; therefore, the identity loss provides ineffective supervision for diffusion models at large timesteps.

Figure 3: Different mechanisms for incorporating reference images into the main denoising process.

Based on this assumption, we propose a timestep-scaled identity loss, where a timestep-dependent scaling factor is introduced to scale down the identity loss when a larger timestep is sampled in a training step. Specifically, the timestep-scaled identity loss is defined as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{time\,ID}}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}\cdot\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ ID}}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}\cdot\Big{(}1-\frac{R(\mathbf{x})\cdot R(\mathbf{x}^{ \ast})}{\|R(\mathbf{x})\|\|R(\mathbf{x}^{\ast})\|}\Big{)},\] (1)

where \(R\) is a face recognition model, and \(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}}\) follows the definition in a typical diffusion process [8; 22] in which a noisy latent \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) is sampled given a clean latent \(\mathbf{z}_{0}^{\ast}\) as:

\[q(\mathbf{z}_{t}|\mathbf{z}_{0}^{\ast})=\mathcal{N}(\sqrt{\bar{\alpha_{t}}} \mathbf{z}_{0}^{\ast},(1-\bar{\alpha_{t}})\mathrm{I})\] (2)

#### 3.2.2 Training ReF-LDM with timestep-scaled identity loss

We train our ReF-LDM with the classic LDM loss and the proposed timestep-scaled identity loss:

\[\mathcal{L}_{total}=\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LDM}}+\lambda_{\mathrm{time\,ID}} \,\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{time\,ID}}\] (3)

Recall that the denoising U-net estimates the target latent in the latent space of the frozen autoencoder, and a typical \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LDM}}\) is computed as the L1 distance between the estimated latent and the target latent. To compute the identity loss with the face recognition model, which accepts an image as input, we decode the estimated latent into the image space using the frozen decoder, i.e, \(\mathbf{x}_{0}=\mathcal{D}(\mathbf{z}_{0})\). The experiments in Sec. 5.2.2 show that timestep-scaled identity loss can improve face similarity without degrading image quality, unlike the naive usage of identity loss.

## 4 FFHQ-Ref dataset

Recent works for non-reference-based face restoration commonly train their models with FFHQ dataset [12], which comprises 70,000 high-quality face images of wide appearance variety with appropriate licenses crawled from Flickr. These images are not provided with reference labels originally; however, we find that a good portion of the images are of the same identities. Thus, we construct a reference-based dataset--FFHQ-Ref--based on the FFHQ dataset, with careful consideration described as follows.

### Finding reference images of the same identity

To determine whether two images belong to the same identity, we utilize the face recognition model ArcFace [3]. Specifically, we first extract the 1D ArcFace embeddings for all images. Then, for each image, we compute the cosine distances between its embedding and the embeddings of all other images. A distance less than a threshold \(r=0.4\) indicates that the images are valid references belonging to the same person. Following this procedure, we identify 20,405 images with corresponding reference images.

### Splitting data according to identity

To enable the FFHQ-Ref dataset to serve as both training and evaluation datasets for reference-based face restoration models, we divide the images into train, validation, and test splits. However, random data splitting may result in the train and test splits containing images of the same individual, which is not ideal for a fair evaluation. To ensure that all images of a single identity are assigned to only one data split, we group the images based on their identities. Specifically, we consider identity grouping as a graph problem, where each image acts as a vertex and any pair of images with a distance less than \(r\) are connected by edges. We then apply the connected component algorithm from graph theory, where each connected component represents a group of images belonging to the same person. Finally, we identified 6,523 identities and divided them into three splits: a train split with 18,816 images of 6,073 identities, a validation split with 732 images of 300 identities, and a test split with 857 images of 150 identities. We report more statistics in Appendix C.

### Constructing evaluation dataset with practical considerations

Practical ConsiderationsFor a fair and meaningful evaluation, the input reference images should not be excessively similar to the target image; hence, we set a minimum cosine distance threshold of 0.1 for the test set. Additionally, we manually check the images in the test split to verify that all reference images indeed correspond to the same identity. Furthermore, in the context of reference-based face restoration applications, it is preferable to select input reference images that capture a more comprehensive representation of a person's appearance, such as varying face poses or expressions. Although a target image in the test split of our FFHQ-Ref may have two to nine reference images, different reference-based methods may have their own constraints on the maximum number of input reference images. To emulate a more representative set of reference images, we sort all available reference images of a target image using farthest point sampling on the ArcFace distance.

Degradation synthesis for input LQ imagesFor synthesizing input LQ images from ground truth HQ images, we follow the degradation model used in previous works [28; 5; 32]:

\[\textbf{x}_{\text{LQ}}=\{[(\textbf{x}_{\text{HQ}}*k_{\sigma})\downarrow_{r}+n_ {\delta}]_{\text{JPEG}_{q}}\}\uparrow_{r},\] (4)

where an HQ image is blurred with a Gaussian kernel \(k_{\sigma}\), downsampled by \(r\) scale, added with a Gaussian noise \(n_{\delta}\), compressed with JPEG quality level \(q\), and upscaled to the original size.

We construct two evaluation datasets with different degradation levels:

* FFHQ-Ref-Moderate: \(\sigma\), \(r\), \(\delta\), and \(q\) are sampled from \([0,8]\), \([1,8]\), \([0,15]\), and \([60,100]\).
* FFHQ-Ref-Severe: \(\sigma\), \(r\), \(\delta\), and \(q\) are sampled from \([8,16]\), \([8,32]\), \([0,20]\), and \([30,100]\).

### Comparison between FFHQ-Ref and existing datasets

Table 1 summarizes the differences between our proposed FFHQ-Ref and existing datasets. While the CelebRef-HQ dataset [16] has been constructed to train and evaluate reference-based face restoration models, our FFHQ-Ref dataset contains twice as many images and six times the number of identities compared to CelebRef-HQ. Moreover, built upon FFHQ [12], FFHQ-Ref provides superior image quality over CelebRef-HQ, as indicated by the lower NIQE score (3.68 vs. 3.97). Some ground-truth images in CelebRef-HQ are affected by watermarks and mirror padding artifacts, as shown in Appendix B.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we describe the experimental setup in Sec. 5.1, discuss ablation studies in Sec. 5.2, and provide the comparison between our ReF-LDM and the state-of-the-art methods in Sec. 5.3

### Experimental setup

#### 5.1.1 Implementation details

To exploit more ground truth images without available reference images, we use 68,411 images in the FFHQ dataset to train a VQGAN [4] as the frozen autoencoder and an LDM with only LQ condition. We then finetune our ReF-LDM from the LQ-conditioned LDM with the 18,816 images in our FFHQ-Ref dataset. All models are trained excluding the test split images to ensure fair evaluation on our FFHQ-Ref benchmark. In our experiments, we adopt a 512x512 image resolution, fix the number of reference images to five, and set loss scale \(\lambda_{\mathrm{time\,ID}}\) to 0.1. During training, we synthesize input LQ images with \(\sigma\), \(r\), \(\delta\), and \(q\) sampled from \([0,16]\), \([1,32]\), \([0,20]\), and \([30,100]\), respectively. For inference, we use 100 DDIM [24] steps and a classifier-free-guidance [7] with a scale of 1.5 towards reference images. We provides more implementation details in the Appendix G.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Dataset & With reference & Licensed & Quality & Images & Identities \\ \hline FFHQ [12] & & âœ“ & âœ“ & 70,000 & - \\ \hline CelebRef-HQ [16] & âœ“ & & & 10,555 & 1,005 \\ FFHQ-Ref & âœ“ & âœ“ & âœ“ & **20,405** & **6,523** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Comparison between the proposed FFHQ-Ref and existing datasets.

#### 5.1.2 Evaluation datasets and metrics

For evaluation datasets, we use the test split of our FFHQ-Ref with two different degradation levels: severe and moderate. In addition, previous non-reference-based methods commonly use CelebA-Test [28] for evaluation, which comprises 3,000 LQ and HQ image pairs sampled from the CelebA-HQ dataset [11]. Therefore, we follow the same procedures described in Sec. 4 to construct a subset of 2,533 images with available reference images, termed CelebA-Test-Ref.

For evaluation metrics, we adopt the identity similarity (IDS) [5; 32], which is the cosine similarity calculated using the face recognition model ArcFace [3]. We also use the widely used perceptual metrics LPIPS [30]. As face pixels are more of concern in the task of face restoration, we also measure the face-region LPIPS (fLPIPS), which is the LPIPS calculated using only the pixels in face regions. For assessing no-reference image quality, we adopt NIQE [18]. Furthermore, we measure the FID [6], using 70,000 images from the FFHQ dataset as the target distribution.

### Ablation studies

We provide the ablation studies of the proposed CacheKV, timestep-scaled identity loss, and the number of input reference images. In each ablation experiment, we fine-tune the model for 50,000 steps from the same LDM pre-trained without reference images. We compare the difference settings with the FFHQ-Ref-Severe dataset.

#### 5.2.1 CacheKV and other mechanisms

The CacheKV is proposed for integrating the input reference images into the diffusion denoising process. We compare it with other mechanisms illustrated in Sec. 3.1.3. According to Table 2, channel-concatenation and cross-attention fail to leverage reference images to improve the identity similarity (IDS). In contrast, both spatial-concatenation and our CacheKV significantly enhance IDS. Moreover, our CacheKV is more computationally efficient than spatial-concatenation, requiring only 20% of the inference time and 39% of the GPU memory.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c|c c} \hline \hline Mechanism & IDS\(\uparrow\) & NIQE\(\downarrow\) & LPIPS\(\downarrow\) & Inference time\(\downarrow\) & Memory\(\downarrow\) \\ \hline Channel-concatenation & 0.23 & 4.49 & 0.46 & 4.17 & 1.77 \\ Cross-attention & 0.23 & 4.56 & 0.46 & 14.54 & 2.80 \\ Spatial-concatenation & 0.69 & 4.84 & 0.43 & 58.36 & 7.44 \\ CacheKV & 0.65 & 4.38 & 0.43 & 12.15 & 2.87 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 4: Visual ablation results for the timestep-scaled identity loss.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

DMDNet [16], fails to restore the severely degraded images because it depends on unreliable facial landmark detection, reflected by higher fLPIPS. In contrast, our ReF-LDM consistently outperforms DMDNet on identity similarity and other metrics, owing to the proposed CacheKV mechanism and timestep-scaled identity loss, which effectively leverage the input reference images without the need for landmark detection. We also note that our method exhibits slightly inferior results in LPIPS metric. This is due to the difference in the background pixels, we provide further details in the Appendix D. It is also worth mentioning that the competing methods benefit from data leakage on the FFHQ-Ref benchmarks, as their models are trained with the entire FFHQ dataset or with a different train split than the identity-based one in the proposed FFHQ-Ref.

#### 5.3.2 Qualitative comparison

In Fig. 5, we present a qualitative comparison between our ReF-LDM, the pre-trained LDM without reference images, CodeFomer (a SOTA non-reference-based method), and DMDNet (a SOTA reference-based method). Given the severely degraded image, DMDNet generates distorted face images based on incorrectly detected landmarks. While CodeFormer yields realistic face images, it does not preserve the facial identity well. In contrast, our ReF-LDM produces results that are both realistic and faithful to the individual's facial identity.

## 6 Limitations

When the face region is occluded by other objects, our model may generate artifacts. For certain face poses (e.g, side face), the reconstructed eyes may appear unnatural. These problems are also commonly observed in other methods and might be caused due to the lack of such training images. However, there are some examples showing that these problems can be alleviated if our model is provided reference images with similar face poses to the target image. Visual examples of these limitations are provided in Appendix F.

## 7 Conclusion

In summary, we propose ReF-LDM, which incorporates the CacheKV mechanism and the timestep-scaled identity loss, to effectively utilize multiple reference images for face restoration. Additionally, we construct the FFHQ-Ref dataset, which surpasses the existing dataset in both quantity and quality, to facilitate the research in reference-based face restoration. Evaluation results demonstrate that ReF-LDM achieves superior performance in face identity similarity over state-of-the-art methods.

Broader Impacts

The ReF-LDM has the capability to leverage personal appearances from reference images. This introduces a potential risk of misuse, where it could be employed for malicious face editing by using a low-quality image in conjunction with reference images from a different individual.

## Appendix B Image quality issues in the previous dataset CelebRef-HQ

As described in Sec. 4.4, the previous dataset for the reference-based face restoration task, CelebRef-HQ [16], exhibits issues with image quality. We provide examples where the ground truth images in this dataset are corrupted by watermarks and mirror padding in Fig. 7.

## Appendix C Statistics of FFHQ-Ref dataset

We analyze the statistics of the proposed FFHQ-Ref dataset, introduced in Sec. 4.

In Fig. 8, we plot the distribution of the number of available reference images.

Furthermore, we assess the race, age, and gender distributions of the dataset using labels predicted by FairFace [10]. As depicted in Fig. 9, the race distribution within FFHQ-Ref is imbalanced, with a predominance of the 'white' category. To mitigate this, we intentionally sampled a greater number of images from other races to construct a more balanced test set. Additionally, as illustrated in Fig. 10, FFHQ-Ref encompasses a broad age range, from infants (0-2 years) to the elderly (70+ years). However, the distribution is not uniform across ages and genders. For example, there is a notably higher proportion of young females (29.2% of '20-29 female').

Figure 6: Examples of ReF-LDM using reference images from two different individuals.

Figure 7: Example images with mirror padding and watermark artifacts in the CelebRef-HQ dataset.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

example, our ReF-LDM restored the mirror padding in the CelebA-Test dataset as hairs.

## Appendix E Examples of illumination change

Fig. 12 shows an example where ReF-LDM exhibits warmer illumination compared to LDM. We conjecture that this may be due to the impact of the strong warm lighting in the input reference images. To address this issue, one could employ post-processing tricks, such as adjusting the means of the R, G, B channels to match those of the input LQ image. Another potential solution might be training ReF-LDM with data augmentation on the illuminations of input reference images, to encourage the model to disregard the illuminations of input references and maintain consistency with that of the input LQ image.

Figure 11: Examples where ReF-LDM generates background-region details that differ more from the ground truth.

More implementation details

### Classifier-free guidance towards reference images

Classifier-free guidance [7] is a technique widely used in diffusion models for guiding the generated results towards a condition \(c\) with a controllable scale factor \(s\) at inference time:

\[\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},c)=\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t}, \varnothing)+s\cdot(\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},c)-\epsilon_{\theta}( \mathbf{z}_{t},\varnothing))\] (5)

In our experiments, we use classifier-free guidance towards reference images with \(s=1.5\).

\[\tilde{\epsilon}_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}},\{\mathbf{z} _{\text{ref}}\})=\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}}, \varnothing)+s\cdot(\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{z}_{\text{LQ}}, \{\mathbf{z}_{\text{ref}}\})-\epsilon_{\theta}(\mathbf{z}_{t},\mathbf{z}_{ \text{LQ}},\varnothing))\] (6)

During the training phase, we randomly drop the conditions by setting them to zero tensors with a probability of 0.1.

### Data augmentation for input reference images

During the training phase, we use a fixed number of five input reference images. When a target images with less than five reference images are sampled, we repeat the reference images to obtain five reference images. In addition, we apply image augmentation to the input reference images with the following operations: color jitter (brightness \(\pm\) 0.2, contrast \(\pm\) 0.2, saturation \(\pm\) 0.2, hue \(\pm\) 0.02), affine transform (rotation \(\pm\) 2, translation \(\pm\) 0.05, scale \(\pm\) 0.05), perspective transform (scale \(\pm\) 0.2, probability 0.5), and horizontal flip (probability 0.5). Lastly, we randomly shuffle the order of available reference images for a target image, so that a different combination of reference images can be sampled at each training iteration. In Fig. 16, we provide an example where a set of two reference images is augmented to a set of five reference images.

### Training details

We trained the VQGAN for 200,000 iterations with batch size 32 on four A6000 GPUs for 7 days. We trained the LDM with only LQ condition for 500,000 iterations with batch size 40 on four A6000 GPUs for 7 days. We finetuned the ReF-LDM for 150,000 iterations with batch size 8 on four 3090 GPUs for 6 days. For training losses, the LDM is trained using only the typical LDM loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LDM}}\), while the ReF-LDM is trained with both \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{LDM}}\) and the proposed \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{time\,ID}}\).

### Hyperparameters of networks

For the frozen autoencoder, we use a VQGAN as in the LDM [22] with the following settings:

* input image: 512x512x3
* latent representation: 64x64x8
* code booksize: 8192
* network hyperparameters: base channel as 128, multiplier for each scale as [1, 1, 2, 4] with 2 residual blocks.

For the denoising U-net, we use the following settings:

* input latent: 64x64x16
* output latent: 64x64x8
* attention layer at resolutions: 32x32, 16x16, and 8x8
* network hyperparameters: base channel as 160, multiplier for each scale as [1, 2, 2, 4] with 2 residual blocks.

#### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The method is described in Sec. 3 and the ablation studies and evaluation results are provided in Sec. 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitation in Sec. 6 and provide visual examples in Appendix F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.

* The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work does not involve theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide implementation details in Sec. 3.2 and Appendix G.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We plan to release our dataset and model after the paper's acceptance. They are not included in the current submission because we are waiting formal permission from the associated company.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details in Sec. 3.2 and Appendix G. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?Answer: [No] Justification: We do not report error bars, as the training our LDM-based model for multiple times costs too much time and computational resources. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the computer resources for inference in Table. 2 and for training in Appendix G.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our FFHQ-Ref dataset in this work is based on an exisiting dataset FFHQ where only images with appropriate licences are collected. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the broader impacts in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.

* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We haven't release the dataset or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We properly states that our FFHQ-Ref is constructed based on the FFHQ dataset in Sec 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We haven't release the dataset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This work does not contain crowdsourcing experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?Answer: [NA]

Justification: This work does not contain crowdsourcing experiments.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
