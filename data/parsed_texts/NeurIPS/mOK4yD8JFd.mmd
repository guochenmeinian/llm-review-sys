###### Abstract

Polarimetric imaging is a challenging problem in the field of polarization-based vision, since setting a short exposure time reduces the signal-to-noise ratio, making the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) severely degenerated, while if setting a relatively long exposure time, the DoP and AoP would tend to be over-smoothed due to the frequently-occurring motion blur. This work proposes a polarimetric imaging framework that can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry ones. By adopting a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme with specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, our framework can not only improve the image quality but also preserve the polarization properties. Experimental results show that our framework achieves state-of-the-art performance.

## 1 Introduction

Polarimetric imaging aims to obtain the degree of polarization (DoP) and the angle of polarization (AoP) of the scene to provide physical clues for downstream polarization-based vision applications (_e.g._, reflection removal [16], shape from polarization [5], dehazing [31], _etc._). In practice, the DoP and AoP cannot be captured directly, but are usually calculated from polarized snapshots1 in an indirect manner. However, since a polarizer would block part of the light, selecting an appropriate exposure time could be challenging, making the captured polarized snapshots often degrade [15; 33]. As shown in Fig. 1 (left), setting a short exposure time would result in a very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), making the DoP and AoP severely degenerated; while if setting a relatively long exposure time to increase the SNR, motion blur is more likely to occur, making the DoP and AoP over-smoothed, as shown in Fig. 1 (middle). To deal with the above issues, several methods have been proposed to handle the low-light noise [10; 25; 15; 32] or motion blur [33] in the polarized images. Since these methods can work in a polarization-aware manner (_i.e._, they explicitly take the preservation of polarization properties into consideration), they usually demonstrate higher performance compared with the corresponding methods designed for conventional images [3; 29; 14; 23]. However, due to the ill-posedness of the problems they face, the quality of their results is still limited.

Footnote 1: A polarized snapshot consists of four polarized images with different polarizer angles (\(0^{\circ},45^{\circ},90^{\circ},135^{\circ}\)), which can be captured using a polarization camera in a single shot or using a polarizer in multiple shots.

Considering the fact that different types of degraded polarized snapshots would provide complementary knowledge, _i.e._, the short-exposure noisy ones tend to be clear while the long-exposure blurryones tend to be clean, an intuitive strategy to improve the quality of polarimetric imaging could be complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots. Such a strategy can not only achieve an effect similar to "boosting" (_i.e._, combining multiple weak ones into a strong ones) to produce clean and clear results, but also bring the existing degraded polarized snapshots alive. However, current methods that can fuse noisy and blurry pairs [17; 2; 27; 28] are designed for conventional images, which are not suitable for polarimetric imaging since they cannot preserve the polarization properties, resulting in inaccurate DoP and AoP.

In this paper, we propose a quality-improved and property-preserved polarimetric imaging framework that can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry ones, as shown in Fig. 1 (right). Specifically, we design a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme that can explicitly take the preservation of polarization properties into consideration. The first phase is _irradiance restoration_, aiming to restore the polarization-unrelated high-level irradiance information of the scene by recovering the total intensity of the light, where the color and structure cue fusion (CSCF) module is proposed to make full use of the color and structure cues encoded in the Stokes parameters. The second phase is _polarization reconstruction_, aiming to establish the physical correlation between the polarized images by reconstructing the DoP and AoP, where the coherence-aware aggregation (CAG) and coherence injection (CI) modules are proposed to optimize the values of the DoP and AoP in a Cartesian coordinate representation. The third phase is _artifact suppression_, aiming to suppress the artifacts lying in the details by performing refinement in the image domain. Unlike the fusing methods designed for conventional images [17; 2; 27; 28], our framework can fully utilize the complementary knowledge from the noisy and blurry pairs in a polarization-aware manner, by virtue of our three-phase fusing scheme. Different from the polarized image enhancement methods [32; 33] designed for enhancing a single noisy or blurry polarized snapshot, our framework can effectively explore the usage of different physical quantities to improve the overall performance, thanks to the specially-designed modules tailored to each phase. To summarize, this paper makes contributions by demonstrating:

* A quality-improved and property-preserved polarimetric imaging framework, for the first time applying a fusing strategy to polarimetric imaging.
* A neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme, fully utilizing the complementary knowledge from the noisy and blurry pairs in a polarization-aware manner.
* Specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, effectively exploring the usage of different physical quantities to improve the overall performance.

**Low-light enhancement and deblurring for polarized images.** There are many methods specially designed for enhancing polarized images, aiming to improve the quality of polarimetric imaging.

Figure 1: In polarimetric imaging, since a polarizer would block part of the light, setting a short exposure time would result in a low SNR, making the DoP and AoP severely degenerated (_left_); while if setting a relative long exposure time to increase the SNR, motion blur is more likely to occur, making the DoP and AoP over-smoothed (_middle_). Our framework can produce clean and clear results with high-quality DoP and AoP by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots (_right_).

IPLNet [10] and ColorPolarNet [25] adopted residual dense blocks to build the backbone for dealing with multiple polarized low-light noisy images simultaneously. Li _et al_. [15] proposed a noise modeling method for realistic polarized low-light data synthesis along with a powerful vision Transformer-based network structure to reduce the noise. PLIE [32] designed a novel Stokes-domain low-light enhancement strategy and proposed a dual-branch network to reduce the artifacts lying in the DoP and AoP. PolDeblur [33] proposed a polarized image deblurring pipeline along with a two-stage network to remove the motion blur in a polarization-aware manner. However, they are not good at recovering details due to the ill-posedness of the problem they face.

**Image enhancement by fusing noisy and blurry pairs.** In comparison with the image enhancement methods that only take a single degenerated image as the input (_e.g._, low-light enhancement [3; 29] or deblurring [14; 23] methods that focus on processing either a single low-light noisy image or a single blurry image), fusing noisy and blurry pairs could usually achieve higher performance and better generalization ability since additional information can be acquired. Early works are usually based on numerical optimization. Yuan _et al_. [26] adopted a residual deconvolution process along with a gain-controlled deconvolution process to reduce the overall ringing artifacts during fusing. Choi _et al_. [4] designed a novel camera system that could capture two blurry images and one noisy image in a single shot, and proposed a motion-based image merging algorithm to merge the captured images into a high-quality one. Son and Park [22] proposed a patches-based point spread function (PSF) estimation approach by extracting the structure information from the noisy image, along with a channel-dependent deblurring method to obtain the blur-free image. Son _et al_. [21] proposed a scheme to alternatively estimate the PSF and perform the deconvolution operation on the blurry image using the noisy image as a guiding signal. Gu _et al_. [7] proposed a method based on Gaussian mixture model to estimate the underlying intensity distribution of the noisy and blurry pairs first and then perform the pixel fusing. Recently, deep neural networks have also been adopted to handle this problem. LSD2 [17] and LSFNet [2] proposed to use convolutional neural networks to fuse the images in an end-to-end manner. SelfIR [27] proposed a self-supervised learning strategy to restore the clean and clear image contents. D2HNet [28] adopted a two-phase pipeline to further increase the visual quality. However, the above methods are designed to enhance the quality of a single input image, which would show inferior performance when handling multiple polarized images.

## 3 Method

### Problem formulation and overall framework

As shown in Fig. 1, our goal is to reconstruct a clean and clear polarized snapshot with preservation of polarization properties (denoted as \(\mathcal{I}=\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\)) from a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots (denoted as \(\mathcal{L}=\mathbf{L}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) and \(\mathcal{B}=\mathbf{B}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) respectively), where \(\alpha_{1,2,3,4}=0^{\circ},45^{\circ},90^{\circ},135^{\circ}\) stand for the polarizer angles of the polarized images in the polarized snapshot respectively. Once \(\mathcal{I}\) becomes available, high-quality DoP \(\mathbf{p}\) and AoP \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) could be calculated using

\[\mathbf{p}=\frac{\sqrt{\mathbf{S}_{1}^{2}+\mathbf{S}_{2}^{2}}}{\mathbf{S}_{0} }\;\;\text{and}\;\;\boldsymbol{\theta}=\frac{1}{2}\arctan(\frac{\mathbf{S}_{2} }{\mathbf{S}_{1}}),\] (1)

where \(\mathbf{S}_{0,1,2}\) are called the Stokes parameters [13]2, which can be computed as

Footnote 2: More information about the Stokes parameters could be found in the supplementary material.

\[\begin{cases}\mathbf{S}_{0}=\frac{1}{2}(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1}}+\mathbf{I}_{ \alpha_{2}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{3}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{4}})=\mathbf{I}_{ \alpha_{1}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{3}}=\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{2}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha _{4}}\\ \mathbf{S}_{1}=\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{3}}-\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1}}\\ \mathbf{S}_{2}=\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{4}}-\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{2}}\end{cases}.\] (2)

Here, we can see \(\mathbf{S}_{0}\) describes the total intensity of the light, which is polarization-unrelated. In the following, we will use \(\mathbf{S}_{0,1,2}^{\text{L}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{0,1,2}^{\text{B}}\) to denote the Stokes parameters of \(\mathcal{L}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\) respectively.

The overall reconstruction process of our framework can be formulated as maximizing a posteriori of the output \(\mathcal{I}\) conditioned on the inputs \(\mathcal{L}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\) along with the fusing function \(f\) parameterized by \(\Psi\):

\[\operatorname*{argmax}_{\Psi}f(\mathcal{I}|\mathcal{L},\mathcal{B},\Psi).\] (3)To solve this maximum a posteriori estimation problem, we design a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme to implement the fusing function \(f\), as shown in Fig. 2. First, the irradiance restoration phase restore the polarization-unrelated high-level irradiance information of the scene, by enhancing \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{L}}\) to obtain the coarse value of the total intensity of the light \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}\) under the guidance of the color and structure cues provided by \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{B}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{1,2}^{\text{B}}\) respectively. Then, we compute \((\mathbf{x}^{\text{t}},\mathbf{y}^{\text{t}})\), which are the coarse values of the DoP and AoP in a Cartesian coordinate representation, and feed them into the polarization reconstruction phase to obtain the corresponding enhanced values \((\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\) with the help of \((\mathbf{x}^{\text{B}},\mathbf{y}^{\text{B}})\) (the DoP and AoP of \(\mathcal{B}\) in a Cartesian coordinate representation) along with the irradiance clues encoded in \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}\), aiming to establish the physical correlation between the polarized images. Finally, we compute the coarse values of the polarized images \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\), and adopt an artifact suppression phase to obtain \(\mathbf{\Gamma}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) that make up the clean and clear polarized snapshot \(\mathcal{I}\), by suppressing the artifacts in the image domain for increasing the quality of details.

### Phase1: Irradiance restoration

This phase aims to restore the polarization-unrelated high-level irradiance information for providing further guidance. As shown in Fig. 1, since \(\mathcal{L}\) would retain better contours than \(\mathcal{B}\), we propose to learn the residual between \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{L}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}\) instead of the residual between \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{B}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}\). However, \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{L}}\) usually suffers from color bias and noise, which would increase the difficulty of feature extraction, resulting in erroneous global tone and less salient local structure. Fortunately, despite that \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{B}}\) would suffer from motion blur, it still contains undamaged color information due to the relatively high SNR of \(\mathcal{B}\); besides, \(\mathbf{S}_{1,2}^{\text{L}}\) could provide distinctive structure information since both of them describe the difference between two polarized images (see Eq. (2)), which would highlight the regions with high gradients. Therefore, we propose to effectively explore the usage of \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{B}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{1,2}^{\text{L}}\).

Specifically, we first explicitly adopt two modal-specific feature encoders \(\mathcal{F}_{\text{enc}}^{\text{c}}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{\text{enc}}^{\text{s}}\) to extract the multiscale color and structure features \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{s}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{s}}\) from \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{B}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}_{1,2}^{\text{B}}\) respectively for guidance. Then, we propose to use three color and structure cue fusion (CSCF) modules to apply the guidance provided by \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{c}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{s}}\) to \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{in}}\) in a successive manner, and output \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{out}}\) for restoring \(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}\). Here, \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{in}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{1,2,3}^{\text{out}}\) denote the multiscale input and output features of the CSCF modules respectively, which are extracted from and fed into the encoder and decoder part of a modified autoencoder architecture [9] where a dense block [11] is inserted into the coarsest layer.

Figure 2: The workflow of our framework, consisting of three phases: irradiance restoration, polarization reconstruction, and artifact suppression.

**CSCF: color and structure cue fusion.** The CSCF module aims to address the issues of erroneous global tone and less salient local structure in the feature space. Without losing generality, we describe how the \(i\)-th scale (\(i=1,2,3\)) CSCF takes \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{t}}\), \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{s}}\), and \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{in}}\) as the input and output \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\text{out}}\), as shown in Fig. 3 (a). We first learn a multiplier \(\mathbf{m}_{i}\) and a bias \(\mathbf{b}_{i}\) from \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{t}}\) by

\[\mathbf{m}_{i}=B_{c}(C_{m}(Sigmoid(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{c}})))\;\;\text{ and}\;\;\mathbf{b}_{i}=B_{c}(C_{b}(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{c}})),\] (4)

where \(B_{c}\) denotes a bottleneck block [8] used for feature projection, \(C_{m}\) and \(C_{b}\) denote two different convolution layers. Then, we apply an affine transformation to \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\text{in}}\) using \(\mathbf{m}_{i}\) and \(\mathbf{b}_{i}\), to adjust the color in the feature space for solving the issue of erroneous global tone by

\[\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{t}}=\mathbf{m}_{i}\odot\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\text{in}}+ \mathbf{b}_{i},\] (5)

where \(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{t}}\) denote the transformed feature, \(\odot\) denotes element-wise product operation. Finally, to solve the issue of less salient local structure, we apply a deformable convolution layer [34]\(D\) to align the gradients and overcome the possible shifts caused by the exposure interval in the feature space by

\[\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\text{out}}=D(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{t}},\Delta\mathbf{P}_{i },\Delta\mathbf{M}_{i}),\] (6)

where \(\Delta\mathbf{P}_{i}\) and \(\Delta\mathbf{M}_{i}\) are the offsets of sampling points and the modulation scalars learned by

\[\Delta\mathbf{P}_{i}=B_{s}(C_{P}(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{s}}))\;\;\text{and} \;\;\Delta\mathbf{M}_{i}=B_{s}(C_{M}(\mathbf{F}_{i}^{\mathrm{s}})),\] (7)

where \(B_{s}\), \(C_{P}\), and \(C_{M}\) denotes another bottleneck block [8] and convolution layers respectively.

### Phase2: Polarization reconstruction

This phase aims to establish the physical correlation between the polarized images by reconstructing the high-quality DoP and AoP. To achieve it, previous methods usually choose to repair the degenerated values in the image domain [10; 25; 15; 33] or Stokes domain [32] for an indirect reconstruction, since the degeneration patterns of the DoP and AoP could be more complicated than the polarized images or Stokes parameters due to their non-linearity (see Eq. (1)), which could increase the ill-posedness. In contrast, we propose to reconstruct the DoP and AoP in a Cartesian coordinate representation, which can not only relieve the ill-posedness since the non-linearity reduces, but also optimize the values of the DoP and AoP in a direct manner to prevent error accumulation.

Here, we explain what is the Cartesian coordinate representation of the DoP and AoP: as shown in Fig. 4, if we regard \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(2\theta\) in Eq. (1) as the magnitude and angle of a vector \(\mathbf{\vec{S}}\) lying inside a unit circle, the Cartesian coordinate representation of \(\mathbf{\vec{S}}\) could be written as \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\), which satisfying

\[\mathbf{x}=\frac{\mathbf{S}_{1}}{\mathbf{S}_{0}}\;\;\text{and}\;\;\mathbf{y}= \frac{\mathbf{S}_{2}}{\mathbf{S}_{0}}.\] (8)

Figure 4: The Cartesian coordinate representation of the DoP and AoP.

Figure 3: The details of the proposed CSCF (color and structure cue fusion) and CAG (coherence-aware aggregation) modules.

Specifically, we propose to learn the residual between \((\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\) and \((\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\), with the help of \((\mathbf{x}^{\text{B}},\mathbf{y}^{\text{B}})\) and \(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}\), where

\[\mathbf{x}^{\text{t}}=\frac{\mathbf{S}^{\text{L}}_{1}}{\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{ 0}}\ \,\ \ \mathbf{y}^{\text{t}}=\frac{\mathbf{S}^{\text{L}}_{2}}{\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{ 0}}\ \,\ \ \mathbf{x}^{\text{B}}=\frac{\mathbf{S}^{\text{B}}_{1}}{\mathbf{S}^{\text{B}}_{ 0}}\ \ \text{and}\ \ \mathbf{y}^{\text{B}}=\frac{\mathbf{S}^{\text{B}}_{2}}{\mathbf{S}^{\text{B}}_{ 0}}.\] (9)

First, we propose to use a coherence-aware aggregation (CAG) module to estimate the coherence volumes \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{y}}\) from \(\mathbf{x}^{\text{B,t}}\), \(\mathbf{y}^{\text{B,t}}\), and \(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}\). Then, we adopt two branches for reconstructing \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) and \(\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\) respectively. The first branch contains a feature encoder \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{x}}_{\text{enc}}\) and three cascaded coherence injection (CI) modules using \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\) for guidance. Similarly, the second branch contains a feature encoder \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{y}}_{\text{enc}}\) and three cascaded CI modules using \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{y}}\) for guidance.

**CAG: coherence-aware aggregation.** The CAG module aims to aggregate the priors about the coherence between the polarization properties and the irradiance information. As shown in Fig. 3 (b), it contains two symmetrical parts for estimating \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{y}}\) respectively. Here, we only describe how to estimate \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\) since the estimation process of \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{y}}\) could be similar. We first adopt two bottleneck blocks [8] to extract polarization features and irradiance features from \(\mathbf{x}^{\text{B,t}}\) and \(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}\) respectively. Then, we project the extracted features into the coherence features \(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{x}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times C\times H\times W}\) using a convolution layer, where \(N,C,H,W\) represent the batch size, number of channels, height, and width respectively. After that, inspired by CBAM [24] that can make full use of the inter-channel relationship of features, we propose to learn an attention vector \(\mathbf{A}_{\text{x}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times C\times 1\times 1}\) to recalibrate \(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{x}}\) for obtaining \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times C\times H\times W}\):

\[\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}=\mathbf{A}_{\text{x}}\odot\mathbf{Z}_{\text{x}}=P(MLP( Sigmoid(\mathbf{Z}_{\text{x}})))\odot\mathbf{Z}_{\text{x}},\] (10)

where \(P\) denotes the global average pooling operation and \(MLP\) denotes a multi-layer perceptron.

**CI: coherence injection.** The CI module aims to inject the priors about coherence into the reconstruction of \(\mathbf{x}^{\text{t}}\) and \(\mathbf{y}^{\text{t}}\). To enlarge the receptive field and include long-range association, we choose to use Transformer modules [6] with cross-attention layers. Taking one of the CI module in the first branch (the branch for reconstructing \(\mathbf{x}^{\text{t}}\)) as an example, denoting its input as \(\mathbf{F}^{\text{in}}_{\text{x}}\) (from the previous CI module or \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{x}}_{\text{enc}}\)) and \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\) (from the CAG module), we let \(\mathbf{F}^{\text{in}}_{\text{x}}\) to serve as the query vector and adopt convolution layers to learn the key vector and the value vector from both \(\mathbf{F}^{\text{in}}_{\text{x}}\) and \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{x}}\).

### Phase3: Artifact suppression

With \(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}\) and \((\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\) available, we could compute the coarse values of the polarized images \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\). However, we should not output \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) directly since their quality is still not satisfying. This is because \(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}\) and \((\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\prime})\) are estimated from two different phases so that the irradiance-polarization consistency would break, bringing artifacts to the details. Therefore, we add an extra phase to refine \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) for increasing the quality of details by suppressing the artifacts in the image domain.

Specifically, we propose to learn the residual between \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) and \(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\). According to Eq. (2), we choose to divide \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}\) into two groups (\(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,3}}\) and \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{2,4}}\)) first to ensure both of them contain the full irradiance information and each of them contains half of the polarization properties. Then, we use two convolution layers to extract the features of \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{1,3}}\) and \(\mathbf{I}^{\prime}_{\alpha_{2,4}}\) respectively, and adopt a feature merger \(\mathcal{F}_{\text{mer}}\) to obtain the merged dual-group features \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{mer}}\). After that, a U-Net backbone [18] is used to perform pixel-wise multi-scale feature refinement on \(\mathbf{F}_{\text{mer}}\), and another two convolution layers are adopted for decoding the refined dual-group features into the residuals of each group.

## 4 Implementation details

**Loss function.** The total loss function can be written as

\[L=L_{\text{s}}+L_{\text{p}}+L_{\text{r}},\] (11)

which consists of three terms to optimize the three phases respectively: irradiance loss \(L_{\text{s}}\), polarization loss \(L_{\text{p}}\), and refinement loss \(L_{\text{r}}\). The irradiance loss could be written as

\[L_{\text{s}}=\lambda_{\text{s}}^{\text{a}}L_{1}(\mathbf{S}^{\text{t}}_{0}, \mathbf{S}^{\text{gt}}_{0})+\lambda_{\text{s}}^{\text{b}}L_{\text{perc}}(\mathbf{S }^{\text{t}}_{0},\mathbf{S}^{\text{gt}}_{0}),\] (12)

where \(\lambda_{\text{s}}^{\text{ab}}\) are set to be 10.0 and 0.05 respectively, \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{\text{perc}}\) denote the \(\ell_{1}\) loss and perceptual loss respectively, the subscript gt labels the ground truth throughout this paper. The perceptual loss \(L_{\text{perc}}\) is defined as

\[L_{\text{perc}}(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}},\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{gt}})=L_{2}(\phi_ {h}(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{t}}),\phi_{h}(\mathbf{S}_{0}^{\text{gt}})),\] (13)

where \(L_{2}\) denotes the \(\ell_{2}\) loss, \(\phi_{h}\) denotes the feature map from \(h\)-th layer of VGG-19 network [20] pretrained on ImageNet [19], and we use activations from \(VGG_{3,3}\) convolution layer here. The polarization loss could be written as

\[L_{\text{p}}=\lambda_{\text{p}}^{\text{a}}(L_{1}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{ x}^{\text{gt}})+L_{1}(\mathbf{y}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\text{gt}}))+\lambda_{ \text{p}}^{\text{b}}(L_{\text{tv}}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime})+L_{\text{tv}}(\mathbf{ y}^{\prime}))+\lambda_{\text{p}}^{\text{c}}L_{\text{pol}}^{1}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}, \mathbf{x}^{\text{gt}},\mathbf{y}^{\prime},\mathbf{y}^{\text{gt}}),\] (14)

where \(\lambda_{\text{p}}^{\text{a,b,c}}\) are set to be 1.0, 0.15, and 1.0 respectively, \(L_{\text{tv}}\) denotes the total variation loss, \(L_{\text{pol}}^{1}\) is a polarization-based regularization term to ensure the ratio between \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) and \(\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\) defined as

\[L_{\text{pol}}^{1}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{x}^{\text{gt}},\mathbf{y}^{ \prime},\mathbf{y}^{\text{gt}})=L_{2}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\odot\mathbf{y}^{ \text{gt}},\mathbf{y}^{\prime}\odot\mathbf{x}^{\text{gt}}).\] (15)

The refinement loss could be written as

\[L_{\text{r}}=\lambda_{\text{r}}^{\text{a}}L_{1}(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}, \mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}^{\text{gt}})+\lambda_{\text{r}}^{\text{b}}L_{ \text{pol}}^{2}(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}}),\] (16)

where \(\lambda_{\text{r}}^{\text{a,b}}\) are set to be 10.0 and 100.0 respectively, \(L_{\text{pol}}^{2}\) denotes another polarization-based regularization term defined as

\[L_{\text{pol}}^{2}(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{1,2,3,4}})=L_{2}(\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{ 1}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{3}},\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{2}}+\mathbf{I}_{\alpha_{4}}),\] (17)

which is similar to the one used in [30] for enforcing the preservation of polarization properties.

**Dataset preparation.** We propose to generate a synthetic dataset due to the fact that there is no public dataset for our settings. First, we choose the PLIE dataset [32] as our data source. It provides short-exposure polarized snapshots that suffer from low-light noise along with the corresponding high-quality reference snapshots captured by a Lucid Vision Phoenix polarization camera, which could serve as \(\mathcal{L}\) and \(\mathcal{I}\). Then, we adopt the approach proposed in [33] to generate the blurry polarized snapshots that suffer from motion blur, which could be served as \(\mathcal{B}\). To generate more severe motion blur for increasing the diversity, we add impulsive variation [1] to the motion trajectories. The images are resized and randomly cropped to \(256\times 256\) (\(512\times 512\)) pixels in the training (test) set. The training (test) set contains 7500 (300) different images in total.

**Training strategy.** Our framework is implemented using PyTorch with 2 NVIDIA 2080Ti GPUs, and a two-stage training strategy is applied. First, to ensure a stable initialization of the training process, we train the irradiance restoration phase and the polarization reconstruction phase independently for 300 epochs with learning rates of 0.01 and 0.0001 respectively. Then, we train the entire network for 100 epochs with learning rate of 0.0001, and in this training stage we multiply the loss terms \(L_{\text{s,p,r}}\) with 5.0, 10.0, and 10.0 respectively. For optimization, we use Adam optimizer [12] with \(\beta_{1}=0.5\), \(\beta_{2}=0.999\).

Table 1: Quantitative comparisons on synthetic data. The comparisons involve our framework, the state-of-the-art polarized image low-light enhancement method PLIE [32] and its improved version PLIE+, the only existing polarized image deblurring method PolDeblur [33] and its improved version PolDeblur+, and four learning-based image enhancement methods designed for conventional images that also fuse noisy and blurry pairs (LSD2 [17], LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28]).

## 5 Experiments

### Evaluation on synthetic data

First, we compare our framework with the state-of-the-art polarized image low-light enhancement method PLIE [32] and the only existing polarized image deblurring method PolDeblur [33]. Besides, we also compared with PLIE+ and PolDeblur+ (the improved versions of PLIE [32] and PolDeblur [33], where slight modifications are made to allow them to accept noisy and blurry pairs as the input) to ensure a fair comparison. In addition, four learning-based image enhancement methods designed for conventional images that also fuse noisy and blurry pairs (LSD2 [17], LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28]) are also compared to ensure a comprehensive evaluation. Note that all compared methods are retrained on our dataset. As other methods designed for polarized images [10, 25, 15, 32, 33] do, we not only evaluate the quality of \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\boldsymbol{\theta}\), but also the quality of \(\mathbf{S}_{0}\).

To evaluate the results quantitatively, we adopt two frequently-used metrics including PSNR and SSIM. Results are shown in Tab. 1, where our framework consistently outperforms the compared methods on all metrics. These results could demonstrate three points:

1. _Complementarily fusing can improve the quality of polarimetric imaging_, which could be deduced from the fact that PLIE+ and PolDeblur+ (which can accept a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots as the input) achieve better performance compared with PLIE [32] and PolDeblur [33] (which can only accept a single degraded polarized snapshot as the input) respectively.
2. _Our framework can utilize the complementary knowledge in a more effective manner_, since our framework still outperforms PLIE+ and PolDeblur+ despite that they share the same kind of input as our framework.

Figure 5: Qualitative comparisons on synthetic data. See the caption of Tab. 1 for explanation. We visualize the DoP \(\mathbf{p}\) and Ao\(\boldsymbol{\theta}\) using color maps after normalizing and averaging the RGB channels (as done in other methods designed for polarized images [10, 25, 15, 32, 33]) throughout this paper.

3. _Designing a fusing framework tailored to the polarized images is necessary_, since the performance of both LSD2 [17], LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28] is inferior in the task of polarimetric imaging.

Visual quality comparisons are shown in Fig. 53. As for \(\mathbf{p}\) and \(\bm{\theta}\), our framework can produce clean and clear edges, since it can make full use of the complementary knowledge in a polarization-aware manner, while the compared methods suffer from noisy or blurry artifacts. As for \(\mathbf{S}_{0}\), our results resemble the reference more closely with less color and structure distortion.

Footnote 3: Additional results can be found in the supplementary material.

### Evaluation on real data and downstream application

To evaluate on real data, we capture several pairs of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots from various scenes using a Lucid Vision Phoenix polarization camera. Qualitative results are shown in Fig. 64, from which we can see our framework can produce high-quality details.

Besides, in Fig. 7 we show that complementarily fusing can be beneficial to downstream polarization-based vision application such as reflection removal. Here, we feed a short-exposure noisy, a long-exposure blurry, and the fused polarized snapshots into a reflection removal network (RSP [16]) respectively. From the results we can see the reflection-removed image with the fusing process of our framework contains more detailed textures and less reflection contamination.

Footnote 4: Please see the supplementary material for additional results.

### Ablation study

To verify the validity of each design choice, we conduct a series of ablation studies and show comparisons in Tab. 2. First, we show the effectiveness of the first phase by substituting it with

Figure 6: Qualitative comparisons on real data. See the caption of Fig. 5 for explanation.

a learning-based image enhancement methods designed for conventional images (LSD2 [17] as Phase1). The reason why we choose LSD2 [17] is that it outperforms other similar methods (LSFNet [2], SelfIR [27], and D2HNet [28]) in restoring \(\mathbf{S}_{0}\) (see Tab. 1). We can see that the performance becomes inferior since our first phase can make full use of the color and structure cues encoded in the Stokes parameters while LSD2 [17] cannot. Then, we show the effectiveness of the proposed CSCF modules in the first phase (W/o CSCF) by substituting them with vanilla convolution layers. We can see that the performance degenerates since the CSCF modules are more suitable for addressing the issues of erroneous global tone and less salient local structure in the feature space. Similarly, we also show the effectiveness of the proposed CAG module and CI modules in the second phase (W/o CAG and W/o CI). We can see that the CAG module can facilitate the establishment of the physical correlation between the polarized images, and the CI modules can offer better optimization to the values of the DoP and AoP. Besides, we demonstrate the advantage of reconstructing the DoP and AoP in a Cartesian coordinate representation (W/o Cartesian) by directly reconstructing their values. We can see that the performance degraded severely due to the non-linearity. Finally, we verify the necessity of the third phase used for refinement (W/o refinement) by removing it. These results show our complete framework achieves the first performance with the proposed specific designs.

## 6 Conclusion

We propose a quality-improved and property-preserved polarimetric imaging framework by complementarily fusing a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots. By adopting a neural network-based three-phase fusing scheme consisting of irradiance restoration, polarization reconstruction, and artifact suppression, with specially-designed modules tailored to each phase, our framework can produce clean and clear polarized snapshots with high-quality DoP and AoP.

**Limitations.** Since our framework is designed for reconstructing a single high-quality polarized snapshot from a degraded pair of noisy and blurry polarized snapshots, it cannot reconstruct a polarized video. Besides, it cannot be used to fuse conventional RGB images since our first phase requires the Stokes parameters as part of the input, which are not available in such a setting.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.

* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.

* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

1. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No need for justification since the answer is "Yes". Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
