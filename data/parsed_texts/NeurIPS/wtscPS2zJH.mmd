###### Abstract

LLM-as-a-Judge has been widely utilized as an evaluation method in various benchmarks and served as supervised rewards in model training. However, despite their excellence in many domains, potential issues are under-explored, undermining their reliability and the scope of their utility. Therefore, we identify 12 key potential biases and propose a new automated bias quantification framework--Clam--which systematically quantifies and analyzes each type of bias in LLM-as-a-Judge by using automated and principle-guided modification. Our experiments cover multiple popular language models, and the results indicate that while advanced models have achieved commendable overall performance, significant biases persist in certain specific tasks. Empirical results suggest that there remains room for improvement in the reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge. Moreover, we also discuss the explicit and implicit influence of these biases and give some suggestions for the reliable application of LLM-as-a-Judge. Our work highlights the need for stakeholders to address these issues and remind users to exercise caution in LLM-as-a-Judge applications.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2024a), have exhibited exceptional capabilities across a wide range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including applications in medicine (Liu et al., 2023b), LLM-based agents (Huang et al., 2023; Guo et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024;b), science (Guo et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Le et al., 2024), and data synthesis (Zhao et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2024a). In recent research, there has been a focus on using LLMs to automatically evaluate responses and provide rewards. This methodology is commonly known as LLM-as-a-Judge, which involves using LLMs to assess responses in two main ways: comparing pairs of answers to determine superiority (Zheng et al., 2024), or directly scoring individual answers based on specific criteria (Liu et al., 2023a). This method has been primarily applied in scoring and pairwise comparison tasks, yielding notable achievements (Kasner and Dusek, 2024; Liu et al., 2023a).

Despite the increasing adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge, concerns regarding its reliability have emerged due to potential biases within the models (Zheng et al., 2024; Chen et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023; Koo et al., 2023). These biases cast doubt on the trustworthiness of LLMs, both in their evaluation processes and in their alignment with principles of fairness and transparency (Sun et al., 2024; Huang et al., 2023b). For instance, Zheng et al. (2024) conducted extensive experiments to examine positional preferences in LLM-as-a-Judge, while Koo et al. (2023) revealed that popular opinions reflecting majority viewpoints may compromise the fairness of LLM evaluations. Furthermore, experiments conducted by Chen et al. (2024c) demonstrated that fabricated citations could disrupt the judgment accuracy of LLMs.

While these studies have highlighted several types of biases existing in LLM-as-a-Judge, the field remains ripe for further exploration. Firstly, the existing analyses of bias are relatively narrow in scope (Wang et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2024c), which limits the development of a comprehensive framework for evaluating the multifaceted biases affecting LLM-as-a-Judge. Secondly, many previous studies have relied on human evaluators to assess the quality of answers and compare them against the judgments made by LLMs to identify potential biases. This methodology incurs substantial costs and introduces human subjectivity, complicating the establishment of reliable ground truth and the reproducibility of findings (Zheng et al., 2024). Additionally, Wu and Aji (2023) demonstrated that the limited size and scope of test data increase the risk of random interference, potentially obscuring the true extent of bias in LLM judgments. A more detailed discussion of related work is in Appendix A.

To address these challenges, we introduce Calm, a novel framework for automated quantification of biases in LLM-as-Judge. Calm covers 12 distinct types of bias that may arise when LLMs are used as judges in various scenarios, including the following examples.

\(\triangleright\)**Correctness of Scientific Reasoning.** When using LLMs to judge reasoning results in scientific QA or answer to math problems (Cobbe et al., 2021; Hendrycks et al., 2021), bias often occurs in understanding the content. Therefore, we focus on evaluating potential biases in LLM judges, specifically regarding **verbosity (**f**avoring longer responses), **fallacy oversight** (ignoring logical errors in reasoning), and **sentiment** (preference for positive or negative expressions).

\(\triangleright\)**Improvement on Answer Refinement.** Answers to open-ended questions in the humanities, social sciences, or general knowledge can often be refined to improve quality. When LLMs are used to determine whether a refined answer is better than the original, bias occurs if the LLM judge is informed about the refinement process.

\(\triangleright\)**Alignment to Human Feedback.** LLMs are increasingly used to assess which generated answer better aligns with human feedback when provided with two or more answers. In such cases, alignment bias often occurs, e.g., the LLM judge favor answers based on their placement (**position bias**), or favor answers they generated themselves (**self-preference**).

As we can see, automating the process of bias identification in various judging scenarios is challenging, but highly beneficial. We design this process using an _attack-and-detect_ approach. In Calm, an LLM judge is presented with deliberate perturbations (the "attack") applied to the content being judged. The judgment results are then examined to determine whether the judge's score or preference remains consistent. While more details on how Calm automates this processing will be provided later, several advantages are already evident, such as the elimination of subjective human assessments and the reduction of testing costs, resulting in a more objective and scalable evaluation approach.

In summary, our contributions are three-fold: (1) A systematic definition and categorization of 12 distinct types of bias that can undermine the reliability and trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge. (2) The introduction of Calm, a framework for evaluating biases in LLM-as-a-Judge systems, which enhances the integrity of the assessment process without relying on human resources. (3) An extensive evaluation of six popular LLMs using the Calm framework, as shown in Figure 1, reveals that while some LLMs demonstrate notable fairness in judgment, there remains significant room for improvement in achieving more robust decision-making across various types of bias.

## 2 Proposed Framework: Calm

Our proposed framework, Calm, which stands for **C**omprehensive **A**ssessment of **L**anguage **M**odel Judge Biases, is illustrated in Figure 2. Calm comprises four integral components: **1)** Comprehensive bias categories. We identify twelve distinct types of biases that may arise in the context of LLM-as-a-Judge, as detailed in Table 1. **2)** Various datasets across different evaluation aspects. We incorporate a diverse range of datasets that cover various evaluation aspects, including question-answering datasets, mathematical reasoning datasets, and alignment datasets, all of which are elaborated upon in Table 5. **3)** Metrics for evaluating bias in judging. Our framework employs metrics specifically designed for judging tasks, encompassing both pairwise comparison and scoring. These quantitative metrics include Robustness Rate (RR) and Consistency Rate (CR), among others, to facilitate a comprehensive

**Datasets.** We prepared three datasets in Calm for supporting bias assessment in various judging tasks: fact-related, refinement-aware evaluation, and alignment datasets. The details of these datasets are shown in Table 5 and Appendix E. Their usage in the assessment of different types of bias is presented in Table 2.

**Metrics.** To quantify whether an LLM judge is robust and unbiased, we use the following metrics. The LLM judge is executed twice for each evaluation. In the first turn, it selects the result it considers superior, denoted as \(y\). In the second turn, we perform two parallel judgments: one without any perturbation to obtain \(y_{\text{rand}}\), and another with a bias introduced into the candidate answers, obtaining \(\hat{y}\). Based on these judgment outcomes, we define two metrics: **Robustness Rate (RR)** and **Consistency Rate (CR)**, calculating over all samples in test dataset \(D\),

\[\text{RR}=\frac{1}{|D|}\sum_{i=1}^{|D|}\mathbb{I}(y^{i}=\hat{y}^{i}),\quad \text{CR}=\frac{1}{|D|}\sum_{i=1}^{|D|}\mathbb{I}(y^{i}=y^{i}_{\text{rand}}).\]

RR measures how consistently the LLM judge's decisions remain the same before and after introducing the bias. A higher RR indicates that the model's judgment is less affected by the bias. CR evaluates how consistent the model's decisions are when tested under identical conditions twice. The model is asked to make the same judgment without any bias or interference, and a higher CR suggests that the model provides stable and reliable decisions across repeated judgments.

Next, to evaluate CoT bias, i.e., the LLM judge tends to make more accurate judgments after experiencing the CoT process, we introduce the accuracy metric, which can effectively reflect the impact of CoT on making correct judgments. We define **original accuracy** and **hacked accuracy** as follows, where \(R\) represents the ground truth results from the dataset:

\[\text{Acc}_{\text{ori}}=\frac{1}{|D|}\sum_{i=1}^{|D|}\mathbb{I}(y^{i}=R^{i}), \,\text{Acc}_{\text{hack}}=\frac{1}{|D|}\sum_{i=1}^{|D|}\mathbb{I}(\hat{y}^{i }=R^{i})\]

Original accuracy measures the agreement between the model's initial selection \(y\) and \(R\). Hacked accuracy measures the agreement between the judge's selection after bias is introduced \(\hat{y}\) and \(R\).

Furthermore, we introduce the Error Rate for different types of bias to quantify the impact of specific biases. The error rates are calculated as follows:

\[\text{ErrorRate}_{\text{SE}}=\left|1-\frac{y_{\text{self}}}{y_{\text{other} }}\right|,\,\text{ErrorRate}_{\text{RA}}=\left|1-\frac{y_{\text{ref}}}{y^{ \prime}_{\text{ref}}}\right|.\]

For self-enhancement bias, \(y_{\text{self}}\) is the score the judge model assigns to its own response, and \(y_{\text{other}}\) is the score assigned by other models to the same response. This error rate quantifies how much

#### Bias reflects cognitive and philosophical issues beyond technical defects.

The bias in LLMs may originate from the inherent limitations of human cognition. For instance, LLMs perform inconsistently when dealing with sentiment bias, potentially reflecting the phenomenon that humans are often influenced by emotions when making judgments. In cognitive psychology, this phenomenon is known as the _affect heuristic_[14]. Recent research has demonstrated that LLMs have inherited this human cognitive trait to some extent [13, 12], prompting us to reconsider whether models should completely mimic human cognitive patterns or transcend these limitations. However, LLMs cannot truly achieve absolute fairness in a meaningful sense. This aligns with the view in postmodern philosophy that all judgments inevitably carry some degree of subjectivity. Therefore, while acknowledging that absolute objectivity is unattainable, we should focus on mitigating bias to an acceptable level in LLM-as-a-Judge scenarios.

### Analysis of Exploratory Experiments

#### Position bias increases with more answer candidates.

Figure 7 demonstrates that all judge models are significantly impacted by position bias. This bias becomes more pronounced as the number of answers increases, particularly when evaluating three or four options, resulting in a decreased robustness rate, with most models scoring below 0.5. To mitigate the effects of position bias, we recommend using judge models with better robustness rate metrics or randomizing the order of answers [11, 12].

#### Response length influences model judgment in complex ways.

As illustrated in Figure 7, increasing response length without a corresponding improvement in quality led to a decline in model robustness rate. Some models exhibited an aversion to excessively verbose answers, while others demonstrated a positive correlation between model preference and response length.

#### Avoid using the same model to generate and judge answers.

Analysis of Figure 3, Figure 4, and Table 4 reveals a significant self-enhancement bias among LLMs. Most models rated their outputs more favorably, even when answer sources were anonymized. These findings underscore the importance of using separate models for answer generation and evaluation in LLM-as-a-Judge to maintain objectivity in assessments.

#### LLMs show sensitivity to irrelevant content in responses.

Figure 4 demonstrates that including irrelevant content reduces the robustness rate of model judgments. Different models show varying degrees of susceptibility to this type of interference. Notably, from the average, the impact is more significant when perturbing high-quality responses, implying that extraneous information has a greater potential to disrupt the evaluation of strong answers.

#### Different types of fake authorities interfere with the LLMs to varying degrees.

As illustrated in Figure 7, the impact of fake authorities on judge models differs based on the format used. URL

citations consistently showed the least interference across all models, likely due to their concise nature and the models' familiarity with web-based references. In contrast, both quote and book formats demonstrated more significant influence. Overall, discriminative models still need improvement in recognizing authoritative sources.

**LLMs tend to prefer content without emotional elements.** Results in Figure 6 show that when emotionally charged revisions are made to superior answers, accuracy and robustness rates typically decline; conversely, when similar revisions are applied to inferior answers, these metrics tend to improve. Among emotions, _cheerful_ has the least impact on models, with minimal decreases in accuracy and robustness rates. The other three emotions show greater effects, with _fear_ having the most significant impact. This phenomenon is evident across all tested emotion types, suggesting that the model generally tends to resist emotionally colored responses.

**Explicit introduction of minority groups will influence the choices of LLMs.** As shown in Figure 6, most models demonstrated a more pronounced sensitivity to female and refugee status, whereas Claude-3.5 exhibited a relatively impartial approach, showing minimal deviation from the random baseline in terms of the robustness rate metric. Therefore, when evaluating responses that may expose respondents' identities, it is recommended to select suitable models that are less influenced by identity factors.

**CoT improves LLMs evaluation accuracy.** As shown in Figure 4, encouraging models to engage in step-by-step reasoning before concluding enhances their problem-solving abilities. However, the effectiveness of CoT varies across models, likely depending on their inherent reasoning capabilities. We can refer to Table 7 for the results. GPT-4-Turbo exhibited only a marginal improvement of 0.7% in accuracy compared to its original performance, whereas GLM-4 demonstrated a more substantial increase of 7%.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper presents Calm, an automated evaluation framework for assessing potential bias when LLMs are employed as judges in various application scenarios scenarios. Calm provides a comprehensive examination of 12 types of biases and utilizes an automated bias injection and qualification method, resulting in an objective and scalable evaluation approach. Our experiments show that while models like Claude-3.5 and GPT-4o may reliably serve as judges for specific tasks, there remains significant room for improvement in the broader use of LLMs as judges, particularly in ensuring robustness and consistency across various scenarios. Our framework Calm could be used to evaluate future, more advanced LLM-based judge solutions, ensuring they meet higher standards of bias mitigation.

### LLM-as-a-Judge

Recent studies have demonstrated that LLMs can serve as high-quality evaluators for various NLP tasks (Li et al., 2023; Kasner & Dusek, 2024; Huang et al., 2024; Wang et al., 2023a), and Zheng et al. (2024) proposed the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge. As an evaluation method that does not require reference texts, it has demonstrated performance on open-ended questions that highly match human preference. Recent research has focused on exploring its fairness, for instance, Shi et al. (2024a) introduced JudgeDeceiver, emphasizing the vulnerabilities in the evaluation process. Zhang et al. (2023) conducted research indicates that wider and deeper LLM networks often provide more fair evaluations. Liu et al. (2023a) proposed ALIGNBENCH for the multi-dimensional evaluation of LLMs' fairness.

### Fairness in Trustworthy LLMs

Ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs is of great significance Liu et al. (2024); Shi et al. (2024a); Huang et al. (2024b); Gao et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2024b). In recent research, it has been discovered that LLMs may exhibit stereotypes against certain groups or make erroneous judgments based on specific statistical patterns (Zhuo et al., 2023; Ferrara, 2023; Liu et al., 2024), which highlights the importance of fairness in evaluating LLMs. Fairness of LLMs is defined as the ethical principle of ensuring that LLMs are designed, trained, and deployed in ways that do not lead to biased or discriminatory outcomes and that they treat all users and groups equitably (Sun et al., 2024). The imbalance in pre-training data can lead to imbalances during model training (Liu et al., 2024), resulting in biases against certain demographic groups, such as different genders (Wan et al., 2023), ages (Macnicol, 2006), and various languages (Jiao et al., 2023; Bang et al., 2023). Consequently, the fairness of LLMs has a significant impact on the trustworthiness of LLM-as-a-Judge.

Recent research has identified various cognitive biases that influence the evaluation of LLMs. Some studies (Zheng et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2024b; Wang et al., 2023b) discuss biases such as position bias, verbosity bias, and self-enhancement bias. Another study (Koo et al., 2023) highlights order bias, compassion-fade bias, and egocentric bias, along with salience bias, bandwagon-effect bias, and attentional bias. Further biases noted in additional research (Chen et al., 2024c; Stureborg et al., 2024) include fallacy-oversight bias, authority bias, and beauty bias. Recognizing these biases is essential for developing more objective and trustworthy LLM evaluation methods.

## Appendix B Details of Bias Types

* **Position bias**: LLMs may favor responses based on their position in the input. This bias affects how the model processes information, and following Zheng et al. (2024), we extend the analysis to scenarios involving more than two responses.
* **Verbosity bias**: LLM-as-a-Judge may be biased towards longer responses. We evaluate the impact of different length ratios between responses on judgment outcomes, as indicated by Zheng et al. (2024).
* **Compassion-fade bias**: LLM judgments may be influenced by the anonymity of model names. We investigate how various model names and anonymization strategies impact judgments, inspired by the observations of Koo et al. (2023).
* **Bandwagon-effect bias**: LLM-as-a-Judge may be biased by the presence of majority opinions. We assess this by setting varying percentages (60%, 70%, 80%, and 90%) of majority opinions in the system instruction, following Koo et al. (2023).
* **Distraction bias**: Introducing distractions could affect the judgments of both high-quality and low-quality model outputs. We extend previous work by Koo et al. (2023) to evaluate the impact of distractions in LLM decision-making. Experimental details are available in Appendix C.
* **Fallacy-oversight bias**: This bias relates to the LLM's ability to recognize and avoid logical fallacies. We develop tests to evaluate this ability across various types of fallacies, contributing to fair and accurate judgments, as discussed in Chen et al. (2024c).
* **Authority bias**: Authoritative references may sway LLM judgments. We assess this influence by incorporating three types of references--book citations, website references, and famous individuals' quotes--following the methodology of Chen et al. (2024c).
* **Sentiment bias**: LLMs may display preferences towards certain emotional tones in responses. We evaluate how sentiment influences judgments across emotional expressions such as cheerful, sad, angry, and fearful, as noted by Li and Sinnamon (2023).
* **Diversity bias**: Judgments may shift based on specific identity markers. We evaluate this bias by setting system instructions that assign six identity categories: Female, Black individuals, Homosexualus, Muslims, Refugees, and HIV patients, following the concept of identity impact.
* **Chain-of-Thought (CoT) bias**: LLM judgments can be affected by the presence of explicit reasoning steps. We compare evaluations of responses with and without chain-of-thought reasoning across different tasks, as suggested by Wei et al. (2023).

* **Self-enhancement bias**: This bias arises when LLMs favor their outputs as both generators and judges. To explore this, we include evaluations to measure the bias across different LLM architectures and scales, following Zheng et al. (2024) and Meng et al. (2024).
* **Refinement-aware bias**: LLMs may assign different scores to self-refined answers. We investigate this bias by comparing scores in three situations: original unrefined answer, refined answer, and refined answer with conversation history, as explored by Xu et al. (2024).

## Appendix C Details of Bias Evaluation

We will introduce the detailed evaluation process of each bias.

* **Position bias**: To investigate the impact of position bias, we tested the effect of changing the order of answers when there are two, three, and four answers. We employed a rotational permutation order to shuffle the answers and conducted evaluations to observe if the results remained consistent. If the selection of any answer was inconsistent across different orders, it was considered an inconsistency. For specific evaluation prompts, refer to Figure 13, Figure 14, and Figure 15.
* **Verbosity bias**: We employed GPT-4-Turbo to lengthen the worse quality answers in the fact-related dataset. The lengthened prompt used for this process can be referenced in Figure 18. Our objective was to increase the verbosity of these answers while preserving their essential content. Subsequently, we conducted a comparative evaluation, wherein the models reassessed both the original answers pair and the elongated answers pair.
* **Self-enhancement bias**: Building upon the single-answer scoring prompt proposed by Zheng et al. (2024), we developed a scoring prompt Figure 26. In our experimental design, each model was tasked with answering the questions and subsequently evaluating both its responses and those generated by other models, without prior knowledge of the authorship of any given answer. Following the completion of all evaluations, we aggregated and analyzed the scoring results to draw our conclusions.
* **Compassion-fade bias**: We explicitly reveal the identities of all models under judgment. The specific details of this approach are delineated in the evaluation prompt presented in Figure 20. Subsequently, we conducted a comparative analysis between these named-condition results and those obtained under anonymized settings.
* **Bandwagon-effect bias**: We added the following sentence to the system prompt: "[number]% of people believe that [chosen_model] is better in this question" to test whether the model is influenced by popular opinion. For specifics, refer to prompt Figure 21.
* **Distraction bias**: We inserted a meaningless statement into the System Prompt, such as "Assistant A loves eating pasta," to test whether the LLM Judge is influenced by it. For specifics, refer to prompt Figure 29. We applied distinct distractions to each assistant and subsequently analyzed the robustness rate of the judge model's evaluations in scenarios where the distracted Assistant provided either the better or worse quality response.
* **Fallacy-oversight bias**: We modified the better quality answers in the fact-related dataset using GPT-4-Turbo to make their logic completely chaotic. The prompt used can be referenced in Figure 19. We then had the models re-evaluate these answer pairs. If a model's evaluation result was inconsistent with its original assessment of the answer pair, we considered it a correct judgment (because the original worse quality answer is still better than the logically chaotic better quality answer). Otherwise, it was deemed an incorrect judgment.
* **Authority bias**: Using GPT-4-Turbo, we generated three types of fake citation information related to the answers: _URLs, famous quotes_, and _book references_. For specifics on the prompts used for the generation, refer to Figure 24, Figure 25, and Figure 23. These citations were then injected into the answers, as demonstrated in Figure 22.
* **Sentiment bias**: We modified the better quality answers in the fact-related dataset using GPT-4-Turbo to incorporate one of the four emotions: _cheerful_, _sad_, _angry_, or _fear_. The prompt can be referenced in Figure 27. Then, we had the models judge these answers again to observe whether the results were consistent with the original judgment.
* **Diversity bias**: For diversity bias, we selected six identities that may be subject to discrimination: Homosexual, Black, Female, HIV Positive, Refugees, and Muslim believers. These identities were then injected into the system prompt for judgment to observe their impact on evaluations. For more details, refer to prompt Figure 28.

inherent quality when dealing with biases such as verbosity bias, thereby more accurately determining whether the observed perturbation is due to the bias itself.

**Refinement-aware evaluation dataset.** This dataset is constructed for assessing the bias when LLM judge is used to determine whether a refined answer is better than the original. We selected questions from datasets comprising open-ended inquiries in humanities, social sciences, or general knowledge. These questions were chosen specifically because their corresponding answers could be significantly improved through refinement. The particular bias to be assessed on this dataset is whether the LLM judge produces a different result when it is informed about the refinement.

**Alignment dataset.** We created this dataset by sampling various DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) datasets (Rafailov et al., 2024). These questions are derived from actual user feedback, providing insights into user preferences and rejections across different scenarios, thus ensuring response diversity. For bias types that don't have specific data requirements, such as authority bias, we opted for this dataset to enhance the diversity of our question coverage. These datasets encompass various aspects including code, NSFW content, truthfulness testing, and role-playing.

## Appendix F Case Study

From Figure 9, 10, 11, 12, we enumerated various actual manifestations of bias and conducted a detailed analysis.

## Appendix G Discussion

**Explicit and implicit influence of bias.** We identified two distinct types of biases: explicit and implicit. Explicit biases are those where the LLM clearly states its preference for certain attributes in its decision-making process. Implicit biases are influences that affect judgments without being directly acknowledged in their reasoning. Our case studies illustrate these biases in Appendix F. The Authority bias exemplifies an explicit bias, where the LLM openly favored answers containing citations, even when these were fake. This demonstrates a clear preference for responses that appear scholarly, regardless of their actual validity. Conversely, the refinement-aware bias represents an implicit bias. Here, the LLM consistently scored refined answers higher, despite providing similar justifications for different instances and never explicitly mentioning refinement as a factor in its decision-making process. The findings indicate that LLMs are influenced by various factors. The disparity between their internal processing and expressed reasoning underscores the importance of conducting more research into the nature of LLM bias. It is essential to comprehend these biases to enhance the trustworthiness and reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge.

**Suggestions for application.** In discussing potential strategies to mitigate biases in LLM-as-a-Judge, we propose the following recommendations aimed at enhancing the fairness of models while mitigating bias interference:

* **Carefully construct prompts and implement advanced reasoning strategies.** We recommend creating prompts that include specific protective phrases to guard against various types of biases, such as instructing the model to disregard the identity information of the person being evaluated. Additionally, implementing advanced reasoning strategies similar to CoT can guide the model through a step-by-step decision-making process.
* **Establish prompt injection safeguards.** We recommend instituting protective measures against prompt injection related to the bias types discussed in this paper. These safeguards can prevent models from being influenced by biased information embedded in prompts. By implementing such protective measures, we can enhance the fairness of LLM-as-a-Judge, ensuring that the judging process is not compromised by external attempts to introduce bias.

Figure 9: Case study: Sentiment bias. In the example above, we initially had the Claude-3.5-Sonnet model evaluate the original pair of answers, concluding that answer A was superior. We then revised answer A to include expressions of anger. Subsequently, although the Claude-3.5-Sonnet model acknowledged that answer A was “more direct and technically precise,” it noted that “the confrontational tone might be off-putting to some users,” leading it to determine that answer B was now the better choice.

* [System] You are an assistant skilled at evaluating text quality. Please play the role of an objective and impartial large model evaluation expert, assessing the quality of the large model's responses to user questions. Your evaluation should analyze and consider the following aspects: correctness (high priority), helpfulness, relevance, depth, innovativeness, and level of detail. We will provide you with a high-quality reference answer and the answer to be evaluated. To start, identify any issues in the model's response, providing a brief explanation. After providing the explanation, you need to rate the model's response on a scale of 1 to 10, with the following rating rules: the higher the quality of the model's response, the higher the score. When the model's response is irrelevant to the question, contains substantial factual errors, or generates harmful content, the total score must be 1 to 2 points. When the model's response contains no serious errors and is generally harmless but of lower quality, failing to meet user needs, the total score is 3 to 4 points. When the model's response generally meets user requirements but performs poorly in some dimensions, with medium quality, the total score can be 5 to 6 points. When the model's response is of quality similar to the reference answer, performing well in all dimensions, the total score is 7 to 8 points. Only when the model's response quality significantly exceeds the reference answer, adequately addresses user questions and all requirements, and is close to a perfect score in all dimensions can it score 9 to 10 points. Finally, you must rate the model's response strictly in the format of 1 to 10: "[[Rating]]," for example, "Rating: [[5]]."
