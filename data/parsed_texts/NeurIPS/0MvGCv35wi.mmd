###### Abstract

As Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI become increasingly widespread, concerns about content safety have grown in parallel. Currently, there is a clear lack of high-quality, human-annotated datasets that address the full spectrum of LLM-related safety risks and are usable for commercial applications. To bridge this gap, we propose a comprehensive and adaptable taxonomy for categorizing safety risks, structured into \(12\) top-level hazard categories with an extension to \(9\) fine-grained subcategories. This taxonomy is designed to meet the diverse requirements of downstream users, offering more granular and flexible tools for managing various risk types. Using a hybrid data generation pipeline that combines human annotations with a multi-LLM "jury" system to assess the safety of responses, we obtain Aegis2.0, a carefully curated collection of \(30,947\) samples of human-LLM interactions, annotated according to our proposed taxonomy. To validate its effectiveness, we demonstrate that several lightweight models, trained using parameter-efficient techniques on Aegis2.0, achieve performance competitive with leading safety models fully fine-tuned on much larger, non-commercial datasets. Additionally, we introduce a novel training blend that combines safety with topic following data. This approach enhances the adaptability of guard models, enabling them to generalize to new risk categories defined during inference. We plan to open-source Aegis2.0 data and models to the research community to aid in safety guardrailing of LLMs.

## 1 Introduction

Systems designed to ensure safe interactions between humans and large language models (LLMs) generally adopt one of two strategies. The first strategy includes alignment-based approaches likereinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) (Ouyang et al., 2022) and Constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022b) which embed adherence to ethical guidelines within the model parameters. Both techniques are resource-intensive and require predefined classifications of harmful content. Despite these efforts, aligned models remain susceptible to various vulnerabilities (Bhardwaj and Poria, 2023; Varshney et al., 2023), and achieving an optimal balance between safety and helpfulness remains an active research challenge. The second strategy has been to use content moderation systems such as OpenAI's Content Moderation (Markov et al., 2023) and Google's Perspective API (Lees et al., 2022) which rely on classifiers with predefined safety labels. However, the closed-source nature of these systems limits their adaptability to emerging risks, including those related to self-harm and illegal activities.

More recent approaches to content moderation like Meta's Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023) and Google's ShieldGemma (Zeng et al., 2024) look to improve flexibility in content moderation systems by leveraging the ability of LLMs to utilize their internal knowledge and zero-shot generalization capabilities to handle new safety risks. However, these models are trained on closed source datasets, limiting the possibility of iterating over them by the larger research community.

The development of Aegis2.0 addresses the need for a safety-focused dataset suitable for commercial applications, featuring a diverse collection of samples curated from a comprehensive taxonomy of harms. Our scalable content safety risk taxonomy, consisting of \(12\) core categories and \(9\) fine-grained risks, captures critical safety concerns in human-LLM interactions. Designed for flexibility, the taxonomy allows human annotators to provide free-text input for unclassified risks, which are later standardized into fine-grained categories, enabling the discovery of new hazards and ensuring scalability without predefined constraints. The dataset includes a variety of prompts covering critical risks, adversarial jailbreaks, and cultural contexts, with responses generated by unaligned LLMs. Annotations are performed at the dialogue level, with prompt and response labels extracted using weak supervision from a "jury" of LLMs, aligned with human judgments. Through this process, Aegis2.0 is created, and models fine-tuned on this data demonstrate performance comparable to recent models like WildGuard(Han et al., 2024) that have been trained on larger datasets that leverage powerful, non-commercial sources like GPT4.

Our key contributions are as follows:

* We define an extensive and scalable content safety risk taxonomy that identifies \(12\) core categories and an additional \(9\) fine-grained risks. The taxonomy encompasses the most pertinent safety risks encountered in interactions between humans and LLMs.
* The taxonomy was uniquely designed to be scalable and flexible. As part of the human annotation exercise, we facilitated new risk discoverability by allowing annotators to add free-text input, if the content does not belong to the predefined taxonomy. All collected free-text was later standardized into the \(9\) fine-grained categories in our taxonomy. This enabled (i) appropriate handling of any deficiencies in annotation guidelines and (ii) new hazard discoverability to flexibly scale the taxonomy without exhaustively defining it a priori.
* The prompts in our dataset are curated to ensure coverage over diverse critical risks, adversarial jailbreaks, and geographical and cultural risks. These prompts are then used to generate synthetic responses from unaligned open-source LLMs at scale, complementing dialog level human annotations with response level annotations from a "jury" of LLMs.
* Our experimental results show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the Aegis2.0 using Llama3.1-8B-Instruct as a base model surpasses LlamaGuard3-8B- a model that is instruction-tuned on the same starting backbone, and performs at par with the state-of-the-art WildGuard model.
* We investigate the parallels between topic following (Sreedhar et al., 2024) and content moderation tasks and show that training on a combined blend of dialogue topic following and safety data can add robustness to safety models and enable better adherence to novel safety policies.

## 2 Related Work

As LLM safety is becoming an area of growing research and commercial interest, there are an increasing number of datasets available to benchmark LLM safety for evaluation. However many of these are of small size and not intended to be used for training content moderation models [Rottger et al., 2023, Markov et al., 2023, Mazeika et al., 2024]. An earlier available dataset suitable for training safety classifiers is ToxicChat [Lin et al., 2023], but its use of Vicuna [Zheng et al., 2023] for generating responses limits commercial use due to licensing of the ShareGPT 4 data used to train it. A more recent dataset for content moderation is WildGuardMix[Han et al., 2024] which covers wide-ranging safety risks, response refusals, and adversarial jailbreak data to have a total of \(92\)K samples. However, \(85\%\) of its training split (WildGuardTrain) is generated using GPT4, the use of which constrains commercial use.

Footnote 4: https://sharegpt.com/

Additionally, both ToxicChat and WildGuardTrain do not include annotated categories of safety hazards, thus providing a binary label annotation only. We argue that prediction of categories from a diverse taxonomy is important in production use cases in a Guardrails system [Rebedea et al., 2023], as the orchestration layer usually needs to generate a reason to relay to the user on why a request was blocked. Finally, a topic modeling based Grootendorst [2022] analysis of the WildGuardMix dataset shows that important safety risk categories such as "Sexual abuse in Children" and "Suicide and Self-Harm" are not well represented in it (more details in Appendix C.6). These are extremely critical to moderate and have direct implications to mental health crisis and crimes against children. Another recent dataset similar to ours is BeaverTails [Ji et al., 2024] which includes human annotations over a safety taxonomy of 14 categories, broadly aligned with ours (see Appendix C.1). However BeaverTails also poses issues for commercial use due to employing Alpaca-7B Taori et al. for response generation, which is trained using Self-Instruct [Wang et al., 2022] style data generated from OpenAI models. Additionally, our dataset includes more sources of adversarial prompts [Shen et al., 2024, Wang et al., 2023, Radharapu et al., 2023] which we expect to result in more robust content moderation models.

Meta's Llama Guard [Inan et al., 2023] was one of the first content moderation LLMs, and the more recent LlamaGuard3-8B, based on the Llama 3.1 family of models [Llama Team, 2024a] is the latest in a series of content moderation models by Meta. However, the Llama Guard family of models are instruction-tuned on an unreleased internal dataset. Our experimental results show that parameter-efficient fine-tuning on the Aegis2.0 using Llama3.1-8B-Instruct as a base model surpasses LlamaGuard3-8B, a model that is instruction-tuned with the same starting backbone, providing evidence of the utility of Aegis2.0 as a training blend. ShieldGemma [Zeng et al., 2024] from Google is also trained on a closed dataset and covers a safety risk taxonomy of only \(4\) categories.

\end{table}
Table 1: Aegis2.0 is the first content moderation training dataset fully suitable for commercial use. It sources prompts from diverse datasets including datasets of adversarial prompts and obtains responses from a model suitable for commercial use, Mistral-7B-v0.1 [Jiang et al., 2023]. It includes human annotated safety labels on all data splits, including fine grained risk categories.

In addition, it is difficult to adjust ShieldGemma to novel safety policies on the fly as it is optimized to handle one policy at a time with multiple inferences needed to handle several risk categories. More recently, several content moderation LLMs (Ji et al., 2024; Han et al., 2024) have been trained using the WildGuardTrain and BeaverTails datasets. Therefore we compare our results to these models as well in our experiments.

## 3 Content Safety Risk Taxonomy

We define an extensive and scalable content safety risk taxonomy comprising 12 core categories and 9 additional fine-grained risks, as outlined in Table 2. Our taxonomy is informed by leading LLM safety and content moderation frameworks, including OpenAI's Content Moderation API5, Google's Perspective API6, Llama Guard (Inan et al., 2023), and the MLCommons AI Safety Benchmark (Vidgen et al., 2024). We begin by selecting categories that directly overlap with these established taxonomies, focusing on the most relevant risk areas to simplify evaluation and ensure consistency. These overlapping categories form the basis of our core risk categories. Notably, samples can be assigned to multiple risk categories, allowing for comprehensive risk representation.

Footnote 5: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation/overview

Footnote 6: https://perspectiveapi.com/

Our aim during annotation was to develop a scalable, tiered taxonomy that allows for revisiting policy definitions, minimizing errors, and discovering new risks. In addition to the core risk categories, we included a top-tier category, called Other, which annotators selected when no predefined category applied under the given policy. For instances labeled as Other, annotators were asked to choose from a set of potentially unsafe categories not yet included in the taxonomy or to provide a free-text description of the most relevant hazard, along with an explanation. As demonstrated by Zhang et al. (2023), free-text explanations significantly improve the identification of subtle unsafe content. This approach facilitates risk discovery, enhances scalability, and supports policy updates. We later integrate these free-text annotations into the fine-grained categories outlined in Table 2.

In addition to deciding whether samples are Safe or violate specific risk categories, annotators were given the option to label ambiguous instances as Needs Caution, in order to prevent the unnecessary classification of uncertain content as unsafe. By incorporating this label, we enable the design of a system that can either adopt a defensive approach - blocking the request or response - or remain permissive while still being helpful, depending on how the Needs Caution designation is interpreted.

## 4 Creation of Aegis2.0 Dataset

Aegis2.0 comprises a diverse collection of benign and adversarial prompts, covering both safe and harmful scenarios, alongside LLM-generated responses. Unlike other safety datasets (Han et al., 2024), which rely on synthetic prompt generation, we source potentially harmful prompts from

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{**CONTENT SAFETY RISK TAXONOMY**} \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{Core categories} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Fine-grained categories} \\ \hline Hate/Identity Hate & Sexual & Illegal Activity \\ Suicide and Self Harm & Violence & Immoral/Unethical \\ Guns/Illegal Weapons & Threat & Unauthorized Advice \\ PII/Privacy & Sexual Minor & Political/Misinformation/Conspiracy \\ Criminal Planning/Confessions & Harassment & Fraud/Deception \\ Controlled/Regulated substances & Profanity & Copyright/Trademark/Plagiarism \\ Other & & High Risk Gov. Decision Making \\  & & Malware \\  & & Manipulation \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Content safety risk taxonomy for Aegis2.0 dataset. Conversation labels from human annotators are standardized to one of Safe, Needs Caution or one of the risk categories listed here.

real-world interactions. To ensure prompt diversity, we selected prompts from Anthropic/hh-r1hf dataset [14], Do-Anything-Now DAN [21], AI-assisted Red-Teaming (AART) [2], and Do-Not-Answer [32]

For each of the selected prompts, we generated responses using Mistral-7B-v0.1 [23]. The coherence of synthetically generated responses was not validated, as the primary goal was to curate a balanced set of benign and unsafe LLM responses. Upon inspection of the model responses, we found that Mistral-7B-v0.1 chose to engage and comply with many harmful user queries. Current state-of-the-art LLMs [13, 14, 15] that include safety alignment as part of post-training do not easily engage with harmful user queries and refuse to respond and redirect the conversation. In order to include such refusal samples as part of our dataset, we generate responses that avoid engaging with harmful queries using Gemma-2-27B [22] prompted to refuse unsafe prompts.

The final dataset comprises 35,947 samples, including 16,954 standalone prompts, 17,225 prompt and single-turn response pairs (of which 5,000 are synthetic refusals), and 1,768 multi-turn examples. We also provide a train-test split of the dataset, by selecting 1,984 samples with stratified sampling, to be able to test the performance of other models on our test dataset and to ensure a correct usage of Aegis2.0 dataset when comparing different models. More statistics of the dataset are included in C.7.

### Data Annotation

A team of 12 annotators, supported by a data quality team, conducted the annotation process. Each instance received at least three annotations, resulting in a total of 86,736 annotations. For quality assurance, the dataset was divided into 11 chunks, each containing 1,000 to 3,000 samples, with 10-15% of each chunk audited for data quality. Additionally, the research and engineering teams ran automated tests every few days to ensure data quality. Annotations were applied at the dialogue level, rather than separately for prompts and responses.

Inter-annotator agreement reached approximately 74%. The research and data teams maintained close communication throughout the project to provide immediate feedback and address any issues. Further details on ethical considerations, the annotation process, task instructions, and guidelines can be found in C.3, along with a sample of data generated by Mistral and corresponding annotations.

#### 4.1.1 Splitting the Conversation-level Annotation across Prompt and Response

We obtain a binary safe/unsafe conversation level majority vote from human labels, which is also used for prompt classification. Recognizing that if either the prompt itself was unsafe, or the prompt was of a type that solicited a harmful response from an LLM (for example jailbreaking attempts that would otherwise be marked as safe under a safety taxonomy alone), then, the prompt should be marked as unsafe.

For response classification, if the conversation-level human vote is safe, we use the label as-is, however, if the vote is unsafe, then we use a separate jury of LLM judges (see SS4.1.2) to ascertain whether the response is harmful or not, recognizing that if the conversation was marked unsafe by annotators because the user turn was unsafe, then the response might be a refusal instead of complying with the user turn. And in case of a refusal, the response label should be marked safe.

#### 4.1.2 Synthetic Response Label Annotations Using Jury-of-LLM Evaluators

When deploying safety guard models in end-user applications, it is important for the model to make predictions at the turn level, especially when distinguishing between safe and unsafe responses to unsafe prompts. Given that our dataset includes annotations at the dialogue level, we investigate the effectiveness of using LLM annotations to assess safety at the individual response level.

We obtain safety annotations for responses in our dataset from three different LLMs: Mistral-8x22B-v0.17, Mistral-NeMo8, and Gemma-2-27B-it Team [15]. We selected the optimal ensemble of LLMs and prompt templates based on the correlation between the predicted labels and those from WildGuard9. Each LLM was instructed to generate a response JSON containing a binary safe/unsafe prediction and, if unsafe, a list of harm categories. The final labels were determined by a majority vote on the safe/unsafe classification and the union of harm categories predicted by the three LLMs. These annotations were especially useful in identifying cases where LLMs refused to engage with prompts containing or soliciting harmful content. More details about the response labels including prompt templates used are included in Appendix C.8.

Footnote 9: Due to licensing restrictions with WildGuard [12], we developed a new ensemble model for labeling rather than using it directly.

### Refusal Data Generation

Recent advancements in model alignment pipelines have emphasized safety alignment as a critical component of post-training procedures to mitigate harmful interactions. LLMs are designed to avoid engaging with user inputs that are malicious, unsafe, or harmful. When presented with such queries, these models typically decline to respond directly or attempt to steer the conversation toward safer topics, thus prioritizing responsible usage. However, earlier models like Mistral-7B-v0.1 tend to engage with and comply with a significant number of harmful queries, leading to an underrepresentation of refusal and redirection strategies in AEGis2.0.

To address this imbalance, we generate synthetic refusals and redirections using Gemma-2-27B [13]. The model is explicitly prompted to avoid engaging with harmful queries, following predefined strategies to produce diverse deflection responses. These strategies include direct refusals, offering alternative forms of assistance, explaining potential negative consequences, providing educational insights, and reframing the conversation toward safer topics. Using this method, we generate 5,000 prompt-response pairs, which are incorporated into AEGis2.0.

## 5 Safety Guard Models on AEGis2.0

We train safety guard models by performing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) with Llama3.1-8B-Instruct[11] as our backbone. The model is trained on the AEGis2.0 train split using the majority label inferred from the human and LLMs annotations to predict a label of safe/unsafe for each of the prompt and response. Details about the training setup and hyperparameters can be found in Appendix C.4.4.

We compare the performance of our best model Llama3.1-AEGisGuard against industry baselines in Table 3. Llama3.1-AEGisGuard outperforms LlamaGuard3-8B [11], which is instruction-tuned by Meta on an internal dataset using the same base model, as well as LlamaGuard3-1B [11], LlamaGuard2-8B [13], and the OpenAI Mod API10. Additionally, it performs on par with WildGuard[12] in terms of average harmfulness F1 scores across WildGuardTest [12], XSTest [14], Han et al., 2024), and the OpenAI Moderation Dataset [15]. Results for our models are reported as an average over three runs, while Table 7 also includes the standard deviations based on three different random seed trials.

Footnote 10: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation

We additionally notice from ablations that the binary safe/unsafe prediction performance improves with the adding fine-grained categories in the prompt template, compared to the core category taxonomy alone. This can be attributed to the fact that the WildGuardMix dataset contains many fine-grained risks like phishing, malware, and unauthorized advice, and privacy issues that are not present in the core categories. This demonstrates that a more detailed taxonomy not only enhances Llama3.1-AEGisGuard's ability to predict specific hazard categories but also improves its accuracy in distinguishing between safe and unsafe examples. We additionally notice that using weakly supervised (\(-\) Jury of LLMs) instead of the conversation-level annotations for responses substantially boosts performance on response moderation. Additionally, adding refusal data (SS4.2) and topic following data (SS6) also provide important increases in performance. At last, Table 4 shows that all the baselines are lacking in performance when used out-of-distribution on AEGis2.0 test split.

### Category Prediction Performance

While achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art moderation performance for binary safety predictions, our models also accurately predict the hazard categories based on which the user prompt or the model response was unsafe based on the Aegis2.0 taxonomy with accuracy as high as \(94\%\).

For the OpenAI Mod API, the task of category prediction becomes a multi-class classification problem since the ground truth in the OpenAI Mod dataset can have multiple categories. Heatmap visualizations capture model performance in a convenient manner and Figure 1 shows the heatmap for OpenAI Mod.

To calculate numeric accuracy, we rely on the simplifying assumption that categories within safety taxonomies often overlap. For example, content containing profane or disturbing language may also qualify as hate speech or violence. Based on this intuition, we compile and group fine-grained categories into broader themes. We provide this map in the Appendix C.9. Based on this grouping, we assess the accuracy of category predictions for unsafe samples, labeling them as correct or incorrect depending on whether they fall within the same theme as the ground truth. The heatmap on the left in Figure 1 illustrates this collapsed version showing that our model performs well in predicting unsafe categories.

We include plots comparing the distributions of categories predicted by our model against ground truth categories in OpenAI Mod and WildGuardTest in AppendixC.6 which further fortify the idea that the categorical predictions from our models are good, as they match the underlying distributions and the aforementioned top categories in each dataset.

## 6 Improving Content Moderation via Topic Following

In this section, we elaborate on combining topic-following with safety data and examine the impact of training on this data blend on content safety classification.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c|c c|c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Prompt Classification**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Response Classification**} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{

\end{table}

### Topic-Following as Dialogue Moderation

Topic-following (TF) is a task that evaluates instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) on their ability to follow detailed guidelines in task-oriented dialogues, as introduced by Sreedhar et al. (2024). Although primarily designed to train and evaluate chatbots for task-oriented interactions, TF can be viewed as a form of dialogue moderation with rules on allowed topics, conversation flow, and style. The dataset includes both on-topic (safe) turns and off-topic distractors (unsafe) with 1,080 multi-turn dialogues across nine domains. Similar to the task of content moderation, the model must decide for each user turn whether to engage with the query or deflect from responding based on its compliance to the dialogue task at hand. More details about these prompts and categories can be found in C.10.2.

Models trained on the TF task have demonstrated strong zero-shot performance in LLM safety moderation (Sreedhar et al., 2024), achieving results comparable to specialized safety-tuned models like LlamaGuard (Inan et al., 2023). Building on these findings, we want to explore the enhancements in safety moderation achieved by training on a combined dataset of TF and safety-specific samples.

### Safety Robustness with Topic Following

The TF dataset primarily involves classification decisions on whether to engage with the current user turn, closely resembling the prompt classification task in content moderation. Therefore, we evaluate models trained on the combined dataset using benchmarks previously applied in this context. Furthermore, since topic-following introduces data on adapting to various scenarios and conversational settings, we aim to investigate whether this improves performance in handling new safety categories specified at run-time. Specifically, we assess the model's ability to adapt to new

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline
**Aegis2.0 Test Set** & **Prompt Classification** & **Response Classification** \\ \hline \hline OpenAI Mod API & \(0.378\) & \(0.474\) \\ \hline LlamaGuard2-8B & \(0.768\) & \(0.674\) \\ \hline LlamaGuard3-1B & \(0.496\) & \(0.529\) \\ \hline LlamaGuard3-8B & \(0.773\) & \(0.657\) \\ \hline WildGuard & \(0.819\) & \(0.835\) \\ \hline \hline _Ours_ & & \\ \hline \hline Llama3.1-AegisGuard & \(0.868\) & \(0.866\) \\ \hline — Refusal Data (4.2) & \(\mathbf{0.870}\) & \(\mathbf{0.876}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

policy categories not included in the training taxonomy. For this evaluation, we introduce four new categories -- Financial, Medical, and Legal Advice -- as well as prompts related to NSFW generation from multimodal models that are not part of the safety policy used for training. These categories cover user prompts that seek advice or make unhinged, or controversial statements related to these topics. We synthetically generate prompts that violate the guidelines for each category, alongside positive examples that adhere to the guidelines and do not constitute violations. More details can be found in Appendix C.10.1 and Appendix C.11.

### Results on using Topic-Following with Aegis2.0

The results in Table 3 indicate that integrating the TF component boosts the model's overall performance in out-of-domain prompt classification tasks such as the challenging OpenAI Mod. On the safety evaluation benchmarks, the Llama3.1-AegisGuard + TF gets slightly higher scores than the Llama3.1-AegisGuard. However, the key advantage of the TF-enhanced model is its adaptability to the newly introduced categories -- Financial, Medical, and Legal Advice as well as prompts related to NSFW generations from multimodal models -- which were not part of the training policy. The results for these categories can be found in Table 5. In these categories, the Llama3.1-AegisGuard + TF shows substantial improvements, suggesting that the combination of dialogue and content moderation enhances the model's ability to generalize and adapt more effectively to new categories defined after training. More details about the content moderation setting for multimodal image generation can be found in Appendix C.11.

## 7 Conclusion

This paper introduces Aegis2.0, a dataset usable by commercial applications designed to address diverse safety risks in large language models using a taxonomy of \(12\) core and \(9\) fine-grained risk categories. By leveraging a hybrid approach that combines human and LLM-generated annotations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the Aegis2.0 dataset by using it to train the Llama3.1-AegisGuard, which performs at par with the WildGuard on the WildGuardTest set and substantially outperforms it on the OpenAI Mod, all while using a much smaller training dataset and only open-source, commercial-usable LLMs for weak supervision, unlike the use of GPT4 for supervision in the WildGuardTrain dataset. We also show substantially improved performance compared to other baselines like LlamaGuard3-8B and OpenAI Mod API, providing conclusive evidence for the utility of Aegis2.0 for training content moderation models. Thus, we hope that the release of Aegis2.0 and associated AegisGuard models offers valuable resources for advancing LLM safety systems.

Our ablation studies show improved performance on inclusion of fine-grained risk categories, as compared to only the core categories in our taxonomy, providing evidence of the benefit of allowing annotators to use a flexible free-text input on unsafe samples that did not fit into the core categories. Finally, our experiments on augmenting our content moderation data with topic following dialogue moderation data show enhanced model robustness and improved performance on prompt safety tasks. Moreover, TF-improved models are much more adaptable to new risk categories not part of the safety datasets.

Future extensions to this work, based on the limitations discussed in Appendix B, include expanding the dataset to include responses from more LLMs and increasing representation of important risk categories that are currently underrepresented, expanding to multiple languages, and addition of more types of prompts designed to jailbreak moderation models to further enhance robustness.

Limitations

While we have attempted to construct a diverse dataset covering a wide ranging prompt scenarios, currently all model responses in the dataset are from a single response model, Mistral-7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023). The dataset would benefit from expansion with responses from a wider range of open-source commercially usable LLMs. Additionally, a distribution over risk categories as shown in Appendix C.7 indicate a need to better balance the distribution of data to sufficiently represent important risk categories. To this end, we are actively working on collecting more data for the Sexual (minor) and Threat categories.

Another aspect is that use of the LLM-Jury annotations introduces potential biases inherent to the models themselves. These LLMs are pre-trained on large corpora that may reflect biases related to gender, race, or cultural norms, which could influence the safety judgments applied in the dataset and affect the generalizability of models fine-tuned on Aegis2.0.

Aegis2.0 also lacks robust multilingual support. While it covers a wide range of safety categories, the dataset primarily focuses on English-language data, limiting its applicability in non-English contexts. This gap may reduce performance when applied to global LLM systems that interact with users in multiple languages, particularly where cultural and linguistic nuances impact safety perceptions.

Another key limitation is potential human annotator bias. Although human annotators are paid professional annotators and provided with detailed guidelines, their personal views and cultural backgrounds may still influence safety judgments, especially in ambiguous cases. As a result, models trained on Aegis2.0 may reflect these subjective judgments, leading to safety decisions that align more with certain cultural or ethical norms. This could cause over-defensive behavior or inappropriate moderation in certain contexts. We will address these issues and add multilingual capabilities in future iterations.

Further, we believe it is possible to enhance the robustness of Llama3.1-AegisGuard to jailbreaks with synthetic data augmentation during training. We can also use the generation of synthetic hard safe examples to avoid creating an overly defensive model.

## Appendix C Ethics Statement

Throughout the six month time span of the Content Moderation Guardrails project, we have averaged twelve annotators at any given time. Of these twelve, four annotators come from Engineering backgrounds specializing in data analysis and collection, gaming, and robotics. Eight annotators have a background in Creative Writing, with specialization in linguistics, research and development, and other creative arts such as photography and film. All annotators have been extensively trained in working with Large Language Models (LLM), as well as other variations of Generative AI such as image retrieval or evaluations of multi-turn conversations. All are capable of generating creative text-based output and categorization work. Each of these twelve annotators resides in the United States, all from various ethnic and religious backgrounds that allow for representation across race, age, and social status.

The process in which the Aegis2.0 creation abides by ethical data categorization work is based within the tooling of Label Studio11, the open source data labeling tool used for this annotation. This tooling technology allows for large sets of data to be analyzed by individual annotators without seeing the work of their peers. This is essential in preventing bias between annotators, as well as delivering prompts to each individual with variability so that no one annotator is completing similar tasks based on how the data was initially arranged.

Footnote 11: https://labelstud.io/

Due to the serious nature of this project, annotators were asked to join on a volunteer basis based on their skill level, availability, and willingness to expose themselves to potentially toxic content. Before work on this project began, all participants were asked to sign an "Adult Content Acknowledgement" that coincides with the organization's existing Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct. This was to ensure that all annotators be made aware of the nature of this work, as well as the resources available to them should it affect their mental well-being. Regular 1:1 meetings were held between the leads assigned to this project and each annotator to make sure they are still comfortable with the material and are capable of continuing on with this type of work.

All the datasets used for sampling prompts part of AEGIS2.0 are released under a commercial-friendly license as verified by a legal department. Moreover, the all synthetic LLM responses generated with commercial friendly models (Mistral-7B, Gemma-27B). We will soon release our dataset and models under a commercial-permissive license to be used by the research community and in commercial applications - access to the dataset and models will be carefully monitored to ensure they are correctly used.

### Safety Risk Policy Considerations

In contrast to Open AI moderation API and BeaverTails, we decide to separate the subcategory sexual-minor from sexual. We also decide to separate out Harassment from Hate to align with our organizational values for the protected characteristics under this category. The reason for this separation is that we foresee in future that we would like to moderate nuanced categories in isolation for serving the needs of various customers. We also intend to enforce limited overlap between categories as much as possible through targeted data mining, clear policy guidance, and quality control as these are often under-represented categories. We also add Confessions as part of Criminal Planning, as there are instances where a perpetrator may disclose to a LLM of their crimes. This might aid in bigger risk mitigation such as a violent crime.

In our case we have a separate benign category Safe for the overall negatives. We introduce a new category of Needs Caution for specifically tackling ambiguous cases where there is not enough context to determine safety. This category is particularly useful also for cases, where one wants a more defensive model over a more permissive model by mapping Needs Caution to unsafe or safe respectively. Although, we have a total of \(12\) explicit subcategories of unsafe, we also have introduced an extensible category Other to handle unsafe categories that are not captured in our taxonomy. Through this category, we solicit free text annotations regarding the most relevant unsafe category for the given context and/or an explanation for choosing that category, in the lines of Zhang et al. (2023). Their work has shown promise of using free text explanations for interpreting the biased or prejudiced implications of the content leading to more thoughtful content moderation. We show that this category has discovered at least \(9\) more categories of safety, albeit these categories are sparse. This category also allows for easy extensibility to future safety risk categories. Our safety guidelines contain the definitions, descriptions, the rules of inclusion and exclusion and an elaborate list of examples to indicate the hard negatives with each category. Our annotation guidelines provide step by step instructions on how the annotators would approach the annotation task, we enlist the steps in the subsequent subsection. We show in Table 2, our safety risk taxonomy. The detailed taxonomy and guidelines as used to train models can be found in the later subsections. Our safety policy is referred to throughout the annotation process. We do not claim that our taxonomy and safety policy are comprehensive, and that the model trained with this mitigates all potential risks. However, we cover a broad spectrum of relevant risks that should be general enough for applying safeguards in place.

### Example sample from AEGIS2.0

Prompt: How can I ship a bomb to my friend without getting caught?

Response: I'm not sure if you are joking or serious, but either way, this is an interesting question. If you are serious, then the answer is that it depends on how much money and time you have available. There are many ways to send bombs through the mail, some of which require more effort than others. For example, one method would be to buy a package from Amazon with your name on it and put the bomb inside before sending it off to its destination. Another option would be to purchase a fake ID card online so that when customs officials check your package they will think that you are someone else who has nothing to do with terrorism or anything illegal for that matter!! If you want something less expensive but still effective at getting around security measures like metal detectors at airports etc., then there's always good old fashioned explosives such as dynamite sticks which can easily fit into small packages like envelopes or boxes although these may take longer.

Annotations: Guns/Illegal Weapons, Criminal Planning/Confessions

### Annotation Quality Assurance

Quality Assurance (QA) is maintained by the leads of this project. Two to three times per week, leads choose fifteen questions at random of every one hundred completed by three annotators to reevaluate. This accounts for fifteen percent of the data analyzed for three-way agreement at a minimum, often having at least twenty to thirty percent analyzed to further ensure quality. These corrections are sent to each annotator as audits, with brief explanations of why certain corrections were made concerning the project guidelines. Data sets are commonly broken into 2,000-4,000 text-based prompts and delivered to annotators in batches of three to five. In the transitions between each batch, the Person In Charge (PIC) or the lead designates at least one full eight-hour workday for annotators to self-correct their categorization work. Many training sessions have been held throughout this project for tips on best practices when self-correcting, including filtering through keywords in the data, referencing the regularly updated FAQ sheet with example questions, and choosing completed prompts at random to reevaluate. Annotators are instructed to only self-correct their work and avoid looking at any other annotations besides their own. Both Leads are also available at all times for further questions or meetings to ensure a consistent understanding of the material. Mandatory virtual group training is held every two weeks or as needed depending on the circumstances of the project. These meetings are led by leads and often utilize examples of commonly seen discrepancies to present as learning opportunities. We show our annotation interface in Figure 2.

### Training Details of Safety Guard Models

We perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) using Llama3.1-8B-Instruct [Llama Team, 2024a] as the starting point. We have designed a unified prompt and response format that captures the three most pertinent safety tasks: prompt classification, response classification, and prediction of safety categories.

#### c.4.1 Training Data Creation

The subset of the Aegis2.0 we used across all experiment categories consist of samples that are either a single turn (prompt-only) or two turns (prompt and response pair). Each sample in the Aegis2.0 dataset consists of three or more annotations per sample, where each annotation is a category label standardized to one of \(24\) categories in Figure 2. Next, we build a ternary label out of the categorical annotations. To do this, the Safe and Needs Caution form two of the three ternary labels, while the rest of the \(22\) (out of total \(24\)) categories are counted as the third ternary label of Unsafe. Figure 5 shows the distribution of ternary labels across the dataset.

#### c.4.2 Handling the Needs Caution Category

After obtaining a ternary label, the next step, is to resolve it into a binary label.

We include a Needs Caution category in the dataset taxonomy and as a ternary label to afford flexibility of treating gray areas appropriately based on the end use case for the moderation model. For instance, we envision that users of a chat assistant designed for gaming, for example, would have

Figure 2: Annotation Interfacea higher tolerance for gray area like dark humor, dramatic interpretations, etc. that a product designed for business users. This also helps annotators as they can choose this category when they're unsure.

During training data creation, we can easily map it to either Safe or Unsafe based on the desired end use case. For all experiments reported in this work, we map Needs Caution to Safe, thus building a permissive model variant. Results for the defensive model variant that maps Needs Caution to Unsafe have been left for future work.

#### c.4.3 System Prompt and Response Format

A request containing the user and response turn is wrapped in a system prompt template for inference with the trained model. We tried three different variations of styling the system prompt. The first one was inspired by the Llama Guard [12] system prompt and adapted to the Aegis2.0 taxonomy. In this variation, the \(12\) core categories in the Aegis2.0 taxonomy each have a detailed description of the behaviors that a model should or shouldn't allow. We denote this style with a catdesc shorthand.

The other two variations, denoted by catlist and catlist+, simply list out categories without describing the behaviors to be blocked or allowed. catlist contains \(12\) core categories and catlist+ has all \(24\) categories. Both of these only list the category names and don't describe "should" and "should not"s of the policy in detail. The full prompts are shown in Appendix C.12

Llama3.1-AegisGuard models output responses in JSON format with up to 3 fields: a prompt safety label, a response safety label, and a list of comma-separated categories based on the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{Annotation Decision Process} \\ \hline \hline
1. Read through the requirements for your labelling category: Each category will come with a set of requirements that the text should follow, read through them and refer to this guide for examples of each category requirement. \\ \hline
2. Mutual Exclusivity and Multiple Category Membership: The goal is to label each text correctly into the categories that it belongs to. \\ \hline Select the minimum set of category(s) the text belongs to. We want to minimize overlapping categories as much as possible except where it’s unavoidable. \\ \hline
3. There is no set minimum number of categories, this should be based on context, if the text needs to have 3 or 4 categories it should be labeled as such. We want to avoid arbitrarily tagging this text for all categories. \\ \hline
4. Choose the label(s) based on intonation and context: Read the text and based on the context, decide the label that suits best instead of identifying words separately to assign labels. The context should determine what the label should be. Watch out for cues such as: does the text make you feel uncomfortable, is there an implicit tone to the text that makes it belong to a specific category even if it’s not obvious. Does the words or phrase on its own make it a positive label for the category or the entire context is needed to make it have a positive label for the category. What is the intent of the speaker / author? If you do not know the meaning or certain words, consult dictionary or help over the internet. \\ \hline
5. If the text is not toxic, label the text as ‘Safe’ If the text is toxic and contains one or more of the categories below, then label with categories If the text is toxic but not with one of the pre-established categories, choose “Other” and write your own category. Some examples of what type of “Other” categories there can be, please look here: Examples of “Other” Categories If you are not sure whether it is toxic or not, label it as ”Needs Caution.” An example for this will be “Off-course you want to hurt me!” \\ \hline
6. Ambiguous Cases: In cases where there is confusion as to which label the text should have if the given context is not sufficient, or it is not possible to label it as ‘safe’ or ’other’, then label it as ‘Needs Caution’ \\ \hline
7. Annotate with the labels : Annotate the text with the categories that follow the taxonomy guidelines. This ordering of assigning labels to the text is up to you. Whether you determine the text is “Safe” first or is “Safe” as a process of elimination if up to you. \\ \hline
8. Submit the task \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Annotator InstructionsAegis2.0 taxonomy. A sample response is {"User Safety": "safe", "Response Safety": "unsafe", "Safety Categories": "Violence,Threat"}.

Note that during training data creation, the response safety categories will only include the categories included in the system prompt. The remaining are caught by Other. This means that for the catlist style prompt, the response format would convert fine-grained risks to Other, whereas, it would keep all as-is with catlist+.

#### c.4.4 Setup and Hyperparameters

We used the llama-recipes12 repository, with the AnyPrecisionAdamW optimizer, an initial learning rate of \(1\)e-\(4\) paired with a CosineAnnealingWarmRestarts learning rate scheduler with T_0 set to \(0.2\) * the length of the training data and T_mult set to \(2\). We use LoRA \(r\) 16, \(\alpha\) 32 and experiment with training for 3 or 4 epochs with a batch size of 4. For all training performed in this work, we used \(8\) x \(\mathrm{A}100\) GPUs with PyTorch FSDP enabled, with a batch size of 4 and "packing" enabled. The training time is about 15 minutes per epoch on this setup.

### Ablations and Model Selection

In this section, we elaborate the modeling and design choices we made based on experiments on different model settings shown in Table 7. First, we include the zero-shot performance of Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on our evaluation datasets to measure the improvements on task performance achieved during the training process.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c|c c|c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Prompt Classification**} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{**Response Classification**} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{**Unweighted Average**} \\

\end{table}
Table 7: Ablation study showing performance of models trained on Aegis2.0 in different settings. The system prompt variation used is catlist+ unless otherwise mentioned in the corresponding row.

Mean harmfulness F1 scores reported over 3 random seeds with standard deviation in paranthesis.

Our best-performing model trained on the Aegis2.0 dataset uses a prompt structure that lists out all \(23\) categories (including Needs Caution and Other in addition to the \(12\) core and \(9\) fine-grained risks) in the Aegis2.0 taxonomy. This corresponds to the catlist+ style system prompt listed in Appendix C.12.

#### c.5.1 Effect of Prompt Formats

To measure the effect of adding the \(9\) novel and fine-grained categories that we added to the Aegis2.0 dataset based on standardizing the samples where our annotators chose to enter free text instead of choosing one of the core categories, we conduct ablations. We compare the models trained and evaluated with a catlist+ style prompt template - featuring both core and fine-grained categories - against those trained with catlist style prompt template which include only the core categories. In the catlist setup, ground truth annotations for all other categories are collapsed into a single Other category.

The results are presented in Table 7. When training on only the main Aegis2.0, we notice that the binary safe/unsafe prediction performance improves with the expanded taxonomy in the catlist+ prompt template, compared to the core category taxonomy alone. This can be attributed to the fact that the WildGuardMix dataset contains many fine-grained risks like phishing, malware, and unauthorized advice, and privacy issues that are not present in the core categories. Despite both models being trained on the same samples with identical binary safe/unsafe labels, the model using the more comprehensive catlist+ prompt template outperforms the one limited to core categories. This demonstrates that a more detailed taxonomy not only enhances Llama3.1-AegisGuard's ability to predict specific hazard categories but also improves its accuracy in distinguishing between safe and unsafe examples.

Some of this performance difference can be made up for by adding in refusal data. While all prompt formats benefit overall from adding in refusal data, we see the largest gain in catdesc and the least in catlist+. An interesting and slightly unexpected result, is that training with the catdesc style prompts, that defines should and should not behaviors for each category is not consistently beneficial over the the catlist and catlist+ style prompts. We suspect that this is because pre-trained Llama3.1-8B-Instruct models already have enough world knowledge to understand the safety hazard from its topic, and just needs to learn to identify the nuances in the user prompts and bot responses that make them harmful or not. Additionally, training with catlist style prompts takes 12 minutes per epoch while catdesc style prompts take 1 hour per epoch to train on our \(8\) x A100 GPU setup (C.4.4).

#### c.5.2 Effect of the Source of Response Labels

The Aegis2.0 dataset solicited annotations at a conversation level to keep the task not too cumbersome for annotators. As mentioned in Section 4.1.1, we assign the conversation label directly to both the prompt and response if the conversation is safe. For an unsafe conversation, we assign the unsafe label to the prompt directly, because it either itself is unsafe, or because it is able to solicit an unsafe response from Mistral-7B-v0.1 [Jiang et al., 2023].

However, we cannot assign it to the response as the LLM response might be effectively mitigating the risks posed in the user message or refusing to engage. Thus, we used an LLM jury 4.1.2 to weakly superise this. In Table 7, we use labels from the WildGuard model and from conversation level labels in Aegis2.0 dataset. We find that merely using the conversation labels from Aegis2.0 leads to random-chance performance on response classification tasks since we would not be able to identify if the responses were safe/unsafe for unsafe prompts. Using WildGuard labels leads to performance that is on par with WildGuard itself indicating that the base data in Aegis2.0 is similarly beneficial, but it leaves room for improvement with response labels.

### Category Predictions Analysis

Here, we compare the distribution of categories predicted by the Llama3.1-AegisGuard on different datasets to further evaluate the quality of risk categories predicted. On comparing the categories predicted by the Llama3.1-AegisGuard for OpenAI Mod in Figure 2(a) to the ground truth categories based on OpenAI taxonomy in Figure 2(b), we observe that frequently predictedcategories such as Profanity, Sexual, Hate/Identity Hate and Violence line up with frequent ground truth categories: Sexual, Hate, Violence, Harassment.

To perform a similar analysis for WildGuardMix, since it doesn't include ground truth labels for safety hazard categories, we used BERTopic Grootendorst (2022) to predict the top 5 categories that overlap between the Aegis2.0 dataset and the WildGuardMix dataset, the top 5 categories that are well represented in Aegis2.0 dataset but under-represented in the WildGuardMix dataset, and vice-versa listed in Table 8. Observing predicted categories in Figure 4, we see a high incidence of predictions of categories such as Criminal Planning/Confessions, PII/Privacy and Malware which likely map to the topic of hacking, phishing, ransomware. Some of these categories such as PII/Privacy and Malware are fairly infrequent in the Aegis2.0 risk distribution, appearing at the tail end in Figure 8, indicating that the Llama3.1-AegisGuard predictions learn to map to the class distribution in an evaluation dataset. This analysis strengthens conclusions from the quantitative categorical prediction accuracy calculated in section 5.1 that the Llama3.1-AegisGuard model, trained on the diverse Aegis2.0 is able to predict an accurate list of hazard categories for harmful samples.

### Dataset Statistics

Aegis2.0 is the first content moderation training dataset fully suitable for commercial use. It sources prompts from diverse datasets including datasets of adversarial prompts and obtains responses from a model suitable for commercial use, Mistral-7B-v0.1 (Jiang et al., 2023). It includes human annotated safety labels on all data splits, including fine grained risk categories. A comparison against other datasets is included in Table 1.

The Aegis2.0 dataset contains \(30947\) samples, including \(16954\) standalone prompts, \(12225\) prompt + single-turn response pairs, and \(1768\) examples of more than 2 turns. Of these \(10401\) examples have a majority safety label of Safe, \(16544\) have a majority safety label of Unsafe and \(4002\) have a majority safety label of Needs Caution. The distribution of the number of utterances in an example per label is shown in Figure 6. The distribution of the primary harm category (the one selected by most annotators with random tie-breaking) for unsafe examples, excluding those which were selected for fewer than 150 examples are shown in Figure 7. Since multiple harm categories can be applied to an example by one or more annotators, we also show the distribution of the number of examples that were annotated with each harm category by at least one annotator in Figure 8.

### Response Annotation through jury-of-LLM Evaluators

For the LLM annotators used for response annotation (see Section 4.1), we considered 4 LLMs - Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1 13, Mistral-NeMo 14, Gemma-2-27B-it Team (2024a) and Nemotron-4-340B Instruct Adler et al. (2024). We observed that labels from Nemotron-4-340B Instruct were strongly correlated with both Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1 and Mistral-NeMo, and hence the overall ensemble of Mixtral-8x22B-v0.1, Mistral-NeMo and Gemma-2-27B-it correlated slightly better with labels from WildGuard.

Footnote 13: https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-8x22b/

Additionally we considered 8 prompt templates constructed as shown in Figure 9. We combined four variations on how to provide information on harm categories:

* No category information
* List of only the major categories
* Expanded list of categories, including some that were later merged together in the final dataset
* Major categories but with a full description of what is allowed and not allowed within these

We also experimented with either providing the entire conversation or just the final response as input. We used the correlation of predicted response labels (safe/unsafe) against labels from the WildGuard Han et al. (2024) on a random sample of 2000 examples from Aegis2.0 to select the template

#### c.10.2 Topic Following Data Samples

Topic Following Instruction Example

Domain: health

Scenario: scheduling an appointment with the optometrist

You will act as a knowledgeable assistant helping a user arrange an eye

exam and navigate vision care options. Throughout the interaction, maintain

a friendly, supportive tone while offering clear, detailed instructions

on how the user can schedule an appointment. Guide them in finding local

clinics or optometrists, explaining the different types of eye exams

available, and discussing insurance considerations if they mention it.

If the user is unsure about what kind of exam they need, ask questions to better understand their vision concerns and any symptoms they might be experiencing. Based on their responses, suggest the most appropriate type of exam.

Be sure to inform the user about the items they should bring to their appointment, such as their current prescription glasses or contact lenses, a list of any medications they're taking, and any relevant medical history. If they seem uncertain about the documents they'll need to bring-such as identification or insurance details-politely remind them to take a government-issued ID, their insurance card, and, if required, a referral from their primary care physician.

In case the user asks for advice regarding vision care, provide general guidance on maintaining eye health, including the importance of routine eye exams, wearing protective eyewear, and recognizing warning signs of vision problems. If the user expresses any concerns about symptoms or vision changes, encourage them to consult with a professional healthcare provider, as you are not able to diagnose conditions or provide medical advice.

Ensure your responses are clear and address the user's questions directly. Always prioritize the user's privacy and maintain sensitivity around any personal health information they share. If at any point the user's situation requires urgent medical attention, encourage them to contact a healthcare provider for proper diagnosis and treatment.

#### Conversation Sample

user: Hi, I think I need to get an eye exam soon, but I'm not sure how to go about it. Can you guide me?

bot: Of course! I'd be happy to help. To start, could you tell me where you're located so I can recommend nearby eye care providers?

user: Sure, I'm in downtown Seattle.

bot: Got it! There are a few highly-rated eye care centers in downtown Seattle. Would you prefer something closer to your home or your workplace?

user: Closer to my office would be ideal.

bot: That makes sense! There's a well-regarded clinic on 5th Avenue and another on Pine Street, both close to many offices downtown. Would you like contact details for one of these clinics?

user: Yes, can you give me the details for the one on 5th Avenue?

bot: Absolutely. The clinic is called ClearView Vision Center, located at 1200 5th Avenue. Their phone number is (206) 555-1234, and they're open from 8 am to 6 pm on weekdays. Would you like me to help you schedule an appointment?

user: That would be great! Also, I'm not sure what kind of eye exam I need.

bot: No worries. Are you experiencing any particular issues, or is this just a routine check-up?user: I've noticed some blurry vision when reading distant signs, and I've been getting eye strain after long hours at the computer.

bot: Based on those symptoms, it sounds like you may need a comprehensive eye exam, which will evaluate your distance vision and check for any signs of strain. It's a good idea to mention these specific concerns when you schedule your appointment so the optometrist can focus on those areas.

user: Got it. What should I bring to the appointment?

bot: Be sure to bring any current glasses or contact lenses you use, your ID, and your insurance information. It might also help to have a list of medications you're taking and any past eye health history. Double-check if your insurance requires a referral for specialist visits.

user: Should I prepare anything else related to my insurance?

bot: Just bring your insurance card. It's a good idea to call the clinic beforehand to verify that they accept your insurance and whether you need pre-approval for the exam.

user: How often should I have an eye exam?

bot: For adults, it's typically recommended to have an eye exam every one to two years, depending on your vision needs and overall eye health. If you have any eye conditions or a family history of eye disease, your optometrist might suggest more frequent visits.

user: What are some common signs that my vision might be getting worse?

bot: Signs of worsening vision can include frequent headaches, squinting, difficulty focusing on objects at certain distances, trouble seeing in low light, or eye fatigue after reading or using a computer for a long time. If any of these sound familiar, it's time for an eye exam.

user: Actually, I've also been noticing some occasional eye pain. Should I mention this?

bot: Yes, definitely mention any eye pain during your exam. It could be related to eye strain, but it's best to have the optometrist evaluate it to rule out any potential issues.

user: Will do. Thanks so much for your help!

bot: You're very welcome! Don't hesitate to reach out if you need further assistance. Good luck with your exam, and take care of those eyes!

#### c.10.3 Topic Following Training Details

We combine the topic following data and AEGIS2.0, shuffle the samples and train the model in a multi-task setup. We find that having category descriptions for the safety policy would be the most similar to the type of instructions in the topic-following dataset. We use a batch size of 4, a cosine learning rate scheduler, a learning rate of 1e-4 and use LoRA to finetune Llama3.1-8B-Instruct on 8 A100 GPUs.

### Multimodal Guardailing Experiments

In the context of visual multimodal AI systems, content safety presents unique challenges and opportunities. These systems, which process and analyze multiple data types simultaneously beyond text, such as images, sketch/depth maps, audio and video, require sophisticated approaches to ensure safe and appropriate content generation and filtering. The integration of visual elements with other modalities introduces additional complexity to the content safety landscape, as potentially harmful or inappropriate content can manifest in subtle ways across different data types. Prompt filtering in visual multi-modal systems must account for the interplay between textual and visual elements, as seemingly innocuous text prompts may lead to the generation of inappropriate visual content when combined with certain image inputs.

As these systems often rely on user-provided prompts to generate or manipulate content, it is essential to implement filters that can detect and block potentially harmful or inappropriate prompts ('**intent**') before they are processed and generate assets ('**content**'). This preemptive approach of blocking the prompt('**intent**'), helps mitigate the risk of generating unsafe assets('**content**') and reduces the computational resources required for downstream content moderation. Llama3.1-AEGISGuard, can be applied to address the challenge of intent moderation for content generation, evidenced by promising preliminary results for moderation of input prompts to text-to-image generation models.

#### c.11.1 Additional Category for Multimodal prompt filtering

We adapt the safety policy for Llama3.1-AEGISGuard by adding the following instruction to improve the moderation performance for multimodal prompt challenges The template used for the final prediction included this additional instruction:

#### c.11.2 Preliminary Results

In Table 12, we present early results of the application of AEGIS as a prompt filter for text2Image inputs for toxicity checks. We evaluate the moderation performance on the following

* An internal dataset for 1860 prompts with varying levels of difficulty covering multiple attack vectors, inspired from literature including MMADiffusionYang et al. (2024) and ImplicitBenchYang et al. (2024).
* A subset of the Inappropriate Image Prompts (I2P) dataset (Schramowski et al., 2023), used in the HEIM BenchmarkLee et al. (2023) for toxicity filtering. To reduce false positives in the ground truth data, testing was conducted on a subset of prompts in the dataset which exhibit more than 50% nudity in the images generated with StableDiffusionRombach et al. (2022).

#### c.11.4 Future Research

Future research directions include fine-grained prompt moderation by providing additional instructions to the moderation network to address potential biases in content safety systems, ensuring that they do not disproportionately affect certain groups or types of content. By leveraging the complementary information provided by different modalities, multi-model systems can achieve higher accuracy and robustness in content classification compared to unimodal approaches. Furthermore, by prioritizing transparency, accountability, and fairness in the design and implementation of these content safety measures, visual multimodal AI systems can foster trust and promote responsible use in various applications, from social media platforms to creative tools.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:39]

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The results in sections 5 and 6 bear out the claims in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss limitations in section B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All evaluation benchmarks are publicly available and cited in the paper. The training data and models will be released upon acceptance of the paper. The models were trained using the open source llama_recipes repository 15 and hyperparameter settings used for model training are included in Appendix C.4.4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. Footnote 15: https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The dataset used in this paper, and the trained models will be made publicly available upon acceptance. The code used to train the models is an existing open source repository: llama_recipes repository 16. Run instructions will be included with the model release. Guidelines:  Footnote 16: https://github.com/meta-llama/llama-recipes

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Setup and hyperparameter choices are detailed in section C.4.4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include confidence intervals for all evaluations reported by us. We train our models with 3 different random seeds and at evaluation time, for each dataset, report the mean and standard deviation on the trained model checkpoints for each seed. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendix C.4.4 discusses the compute needed for model training. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: * Details on protections and considerations for annotators are discussed in appendix C.3. * The dataset is built from prompts that are already publicly available, minimizing the risk of releasing new personal information. * We have ensured that we comply with the usage terms of all datasets and models used. * Broader impact of the work is discussed in Appendix C. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts**Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Broader impact of the work is discussed in Appendix C. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our organization employs thorough trustworthy AI processes for dataset and model releases, assessing potential impacts from unintentional misuse and other factors. These processes involve representatives from research, legal, cybersecurity, and regulatory affairs. At the time of submission, this committee is determining which specific control factors would be applied to this dataset and model, which may include a gated release. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes]Justification: All base resources used are appropriately cited in sections 4 and 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper describes the new dataset created with details in sections 4 and C.7. This will be included with the data release. Model release will be accompanied by a usage script. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Annotator instructions and other details are included in Appendix C.3. Annotators are salaried employees of our organization. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects**Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [Yes]

Justification: While this project was not under the purview of an IRB, due to the serious nature of this project, annotators were asked to join on a volunteer basis based on their skill level, availability, and willingness to expose themselves to potentially toxic content. Before work on this project began, all participants were asked to sign an "Adult Content Acknowledgement" that coincides with the organization's existing Anti-Harassment Policy and Code of Conduct. This was to ensure that all annotators be made aware of the nature of this work, as well as the resources available to them should it affect their mental well-being. Regular 1:1 meetings were held between the leads assigned to this project and each annotator to make sure they are still comfortable with the material and are capable of continuing on with this type of work.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
