###### Abstract

Pre-trained language encoders--functions that represent text as vectors--are an integral component of many NLP tasks. We tackle a natural question in language encoder analysis: What does it mean for two encoders to be similar? We contend that a faithful measure of similarity needs to be _intrinsic_, that is, task-independent, yet still be informative of _extrinsic_ similarity--the performance on downstream tasks. It is common to consider two encoders similar if they are _homotopic_, i.e., if they can be aligned through some transformation.1 In this spirit, we study the properties of _affine_ alignment of language encoders and its implications on extrinsic similarity. We find that while affine alignment is fundamentally an asymmetric notion of similarity, it is still informative of extrinsic similarity. We confirm this on datasets of natural language representations. Beyond providing useful bounds on extrinsic similarity, affine intrinsic similarity also allows us to begin uncovering the structure of the space of pre-trained encoders by defining an order over them.

Footnote 1: Homotopy, from the Greek \(\phi_{\text{U}}\phi_{\text{C}}\) (homo; same) and \(\neg\phi_{\text{T}}\pi_{\text{O}}\)\(\circ\) (topos; place), refers to a continuous transformation between functions or shapes, showing they can be deformed into one another without breaking or tearing.

## 1 Introduction

A common paradigm in modern natural language processing (NLP) is to pre-train a **language encoder** on a large swathe of natural language text. Then, a task-specific model is fit (_fine-tuned_) using the language encoder as the representation function of the text. More formally, a language encoder is a function \(\boldsymbol{h}\colon\Sigma^{*}\to\mathbb{R}^{D}\), i.e., a function that maps a string over an alphabet \(\Sigma\) to a finite-dimensional vector. Now, consider sentiment analysis as an informative example of a task. Suppose our goal is to classify a string \(\boldsymbol{y}\in\Sigma^{*}\) as one of three polarities \(\Pi=\{\odot,\odot,\odot\}\). Then, the probability of \(\boldsymbol{y}\) exhibiting a specific polarity is often given by a log-linear model, e.g., the probability of \(\odot\) is

\[p(\odot\mid\boldsymbol{y})=\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{E}\,\boldsymbol{h}( \boldsymbol{y})+\mathbf{b})_{\odot}\] (1)

where \(\mathbf{E}\in\mathbb{R}^{3\times D}\), \(\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\) and \(\operatorname{softmax}\colon\mathbb{R}^{N}\to\Delta^{N-1}\). Empirically, using a pre-trained encoder \(\boldsymbol{h}\) leads to significantly better classifier performance than training a log-linear model from scratch.

In the context of the widespread deployment of language encoders, this paper tackles a natural question: Given two language encoders \(\boldsymbol{h}\) and \(\boldsymbol{g}\), how can we judge to what extent they are similar? This question is of practical importance--recent studies have shown that even small variations in the random seed used for training can result in significant performance differences on downstream tasks between models with the same architecture [13; 35] In this case, we say that two such language encoders exhibit an _extrinsic_ difference, i.e., the difference between two encoders manifests itself when considering their performance on a _downstream_ task. However, we also seek an _intrinsic_ notionof similarity between two language encoders, i.e., a notion of similarity that is independent of any particular downstream task. Moreover, we may hope that a good notion of intrinsic similarity would allow us to construct a notion of extrinsic similarity that holds for _all_ downstream tasks.

Existing work studies language encoder similarity by evaluating whether two encoders produce similar representations for a finite dataset of strings [3; 20; 22; 42; _inter alia_], often by analyzing whether the representation sets can be approximately _linearly_ aligned [22; 27]. More formally, two encoders are considered similar if there exists a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) such that \(\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{y})\approx\mathbf{A}\,\boldsymbol{g}(\boldsymbol{y})\) holds for strings \(\boldsymbol{y}\) in some finite set \(\mathcal{D}\subset\Sigma^{*}\).2 This assumes that examining finitely many outputs provides sufficient insight into encoder behavior. In contrast, we set out to study the relationships between language encoders, i.e., functions, themselves. This decision, rather than being just a technicality, allows us to derive a richer understanding of encoder relationships, revealing properties and insights that remain obscured under conventional finite-set analysis. Concretely, we ask what notions of similarity between encoders one could consider and what they imply for their relationships.

Footnote 2: We discuss related work in more detail in App. C.

The main contributions of the paper are of a theoretical nature. We first define an (extended) metric space on language encoders. We then extend this notion to account for _transformations_ in a broad framework of \(S\)-**homotopy** for a set of transformations \(S\), where \(\boldsymbol{g}\) is \(S\)-homotopic to \(\boldsymbol{h}\) if \(\boldsymbol{g}\) can be transformed into \(\boldsymbol{h}\) through some transformation in \(S\). As a concrete application of the framework, we study _affine_ homotopy--the similarity of \(\boldsymbol{h}\) and \(\psi\circ\boldsymbol{g}\) for affine transformations \(\psi\). The notion of intrinsic similarity induced by such one-sided alignment is not symmetric and can be seen as the _cost_ of transforming \(\boldsymbol{g}\) into \(\boldsymbol{h}\). Nevertheless, we show it is informative of _extrinsic_ similarity: If one encoder can be affinely mapped to another, we can guarantee that it also performs similarly on downstream tasks. We confirm this empirically by studying the intrinsic and extrinsic similarities of various pre-trained encoders, where we observe a positive correlation between intrinsic and extrinsic similarity. Beyond measuring similarity, homotopy also allows us to define a form of hierarchy on the space of encoders, elucidating a structure in which some encoders are more informative than others. Such an order is also suggested by our experiments, where we find that certain encoders are easier to map to than others which shows in the rank of the learned representations and affects their transfer learning ability.

## 2 Language Encoders

Let \(\Sigma\) be an alphabet--a finite, non-empty set of symbols \(y\)--and \(\textsc{eos}\notin\Sigma\) a distinguished end-of-string symbol. With \(\Sigma^{*}\stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}}\bigcup_{n=0}^{\infty} \Sigma^{n}\) we denote the Kleene closure of \(\Sigma\), the set of all strings \(\boldsymbol{y}\). A **language encoder** is a function \(\boldsymbol{h}\colon\Sigma^{*}\to V\stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}} \mathbb{R}^{D}\) that maps strings to real vectors.3 We write \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}}V^{\Sigma^{*}}\) for the \(\mathbb{R}\)-vector space of language encoders, and \(\mathcal{E}_{b}\stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}}\{\boldsymbol{h}\in \mathcal{E}_{V}\mid\boldsymbol{h}(\Sigma^{*})\text{ is bounded}\}\subset \mathcal{E}_{V}\) for its sub-vector space of **bounded encoders**.

Footnote 3: In principle, one could relax the replace \(\mathbb{R}^{D}\) with any finite dimensional vector space.

There are two common ways that language encoders are created [7]. The first is through autoregressive language modeling. A **language model** (LM) is a probability distribution over \(\Sigma^{*}\).4**Autoregressive LMs are defined through the multiplication of conditional probability distributions \(p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(y_{t}\mid\boldsymbol{y}_{<t})\) as

Footnote 4: In the following, we assume language model _tightness_ to the effect that we can assume that LMs produce valid probability distributions over \(\Sigma^{*}\)[15].

\[p_{\boldsymbol{h}}^{\textsc{lsr}}(\boldsymbol{y})=p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(\textsc {eos}\mid\boldsymbol{y})\prod_{t=1}^{T}p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(y_{t}\mid\boldsymbol{ y}_{<t}),\] (2)

where each \(p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(\cdot\mid\boldsymbol{y}_{<t})\) is a distribution over \(\Sigma\cup\{\textsc{eos}\}\)_parametrized_ by a language encoder \(\boldsymbol{h}\):

\[p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(y_{t}\mid\boldsymbol{y}_{<t})\stackrel{{\text {def}}}{{=}}\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{E}\,\boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{y}_ {<t}))_{y_{t}},\] (3)

where \(\mathbf{E}\in\mathbb{R}^{(|\Sigma|+1)\times D}\). An autoregressive LM provides a simple manner to _learn_ a language encoder from a dataset of strings \(\mathcal{D}=\{\boldsymbol{y}^{(n)}\}_{n=1}^{N}\) by minimizing \(\mathcal{D}\)'s negative log-likelihood. We may also learn a language encoder through **masked language modeling** (MLM), which defines the conditional probabilities based on both sides of the masked symbol's context

\[p_{\boldsymbol{h}}(y_{t}\mid\boldsymbol{y}_{<t},\boldsymbol{y}_{>t}) \stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}}\operatorname{softmax}(\mathbf{E}\, \boldsymbol{h}(\boldsymbol{y}_{<t}\circ\texttt{[mask]}\circ\boldsymbol{y}_{>t}) )_{y_{t}}.\] (4)Maximizing the log-likelihood of a corpus under a language model derived from a language encoder \(\bm{h}\) with a gradient-based algorithm only requires \(\bm{h}\) to be a differentiable function of its parameters. Once a language encoder has been trained on a (large) corpus, its representations can be used on more fine-grained NLP tasks such as classification. The rationale for such transfer learning is that representations \(\bm{h}\left(\bm{y}\right)\) stemming from a performant language model also contain information useful for other downstream tasks on natural language. An NLP practitioner might then implement a task-specific transformation of \(\bm{h}\left(\bm{y}\right)\). To tackle the problem that the tasks of interest are often less resource-abundant and to keep the training costs low, task-specific transformations are usually simple, often in the form of linear transformations of \(\bm{h}\left(\bm{y}\right)\), as in Eq. (1).

## 3 Measuring the Alignment of Language Encoders

We begin by introducing measures of affine alignment and hemi-metrics on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\).

### Preliminaries on Hemi-Metric Spaces

Language encoders compute representations for the infinitely many strings in \(\Sigma\)*. In general, these representations might diverge towards \(\infty\), making it necessary to talk about _unbounded_ encoders, where it is convenient to allow distances and norms to take extended real numbers as values.5

Footnote 5: \(\overline{\mathbb{R}}_{+}\) is the set of non-negative real numbers along with the “value” \(\infty\), assumed to be above all reals. We adopt the following conventions: \(\infty\cdot 0=0\cdot\infty=0\); \(\infty+r=r+\infty=\infty\), \(\infty\cdot r=\mathbb{R}_{>0}\) for every \(r\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}\).

**Definition 3.1**.: _An **extended metric** on a set \(X\) is a map \(d\colon X\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}_{+}\) such that_

* \(\forall x,y\in X,\quad d(x,y)=0\) _iff_ \(x=y\)_;_ (Identity)__
* \(\forall x,y,z\in X,\quad d(x,y)\leqslant d(x,z)+d(z,y);\)__(Triangle Inequality)__
* \(\forall x,y\in X,\quad d(x,y)=d(y,x).\)__(Symmetry)__

Similarly, an _extended norm_ is a map \(\|\cdot\|\colon X\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}_{+}\) that satisfies the norm axioms. Moreover, we will consider maps \(d\) that do not satisfy the symmetry axiom. Lawvere [25] notes that symmetry is artificial and unnecessary for many of the main theorems involving metric spaces. In such situations, the quantity \(d(x,y)\) can be interpreted as the _cost_ of going from \(x\) to \(y\). Occasionally, we want \(d\) to capture that it costs more to go from \(x\) to \(y\) than to return, making asymmetry desirable.

**Definition 3.2**.: _A **hemi-metric6** or Lawvere-metric on a set \(X\) is a map \(d\colon X\to\overline{\mathbb{R}}_{+}\) such that_

Footnote 6: A basic example of a hemi-metric space is the pair \((\mathbb{R},d_{\mathbb{R}})\), where \(d_{\mathbb{R}}(x,y)=\max(x-y,0)\).

* \(d(x,x)\leqslant d(x,y)+d(y,z)\) _for all_ \(x,y,z\in X\)_._

One of our main contributions is a formalization of measuring how far a language encoder \(\bm{h}\) is from the _set_ of all possible transformations of another encoder \(\bm{g}\)--for example, from all affine transformations of \(\bm{g}\). For this, we _lift_ a hemi-metric over elements \(x\in X\) to _subsets_ of \(X\), a crucial for the rest of the paper.

**Definition 3.3**.: _Let \((X,d)\) be a hemi-metric space. For non-empty \(E,E^{\prime}\subset X\), we define_

\[d^{\mathcal{H}}(E,E^{\prime})\stackrel{{\text{\tiny def}}}{{=}} \sup_{x\in E}\inf_{y\in E^{\prime}}d(x,y).\] (5)

_The map \(d^{\mathcal{H}}\) is called the **Hausdorff-Hoare map** and is a hemi-metric on \(\mathcal{P}(X)\backslash\{\emptyset\}\), the power set of \(X\). When \(E\) is a singleton set \(\{x\}\), we will, with a slight abuse of notation, write \(d^{\mathcal{H}}(x,E^{\prime})\) to mean \(d^{\mathcal{H}}(\{x\},E^{\prime})\), defined as \(=\inf_{y\in E^{\prime}}d(x,y)\).7_

Footnote 7: Additional properties of \(d^{\mathcal{H}}\) are discussed in Lem. D.1.

We next introduce the **hemi-metric recipe**. It tells us how one can define a hemi-metric on a set \(X\) by _embedding_\(X\) into the power set of another space \(Y\) where a hemi-metric already exists. After \(X\) is embedded, one can use the Hausdorff-Hoare map based on the hemi-metric from \(Y\) to define a hemi-metric on \(X\) through the images of \(x\in X\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

In the case of affine isometries \(\mathrm{Iso}(V)=\{\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\mid\psi_{\mathrm{lin}}\in\mathrm{O}(V)\}\) we show that the pair \((\mathcal{E}_{V},d_{\mathrm{Iso}(V)})\) constitutes an extended pseudo-metric space.

**Proposition 3.1**.: _The pair \((\mathcal{E}_{V},d_{\mathrm{Iso}(V)})\) is an extended pseudo-metric space._

## 4 Intrinsic Affine Homotopy

The notion of affine alignment allows us to introduce _homotopic relations_ on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\). We first derive the affine intrinsic preorder \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) on the space of encoders.13

Footnote 13: All left-out proofs can be found in App. D.2.

**Lemma 4.1**.: _Let \((X,d)\) be a hemi-metric space. The relation \((x\succsim_{d}y\) iff \(d(x,y)=0)\) is a **preorder14** and it will be called the **specialization ordering** of \(d\)._

Footnote 14: A reflexive and transitive relation on \(X\).

Proof.: Goubault-Larrecq [17, Proposition 6.1.8]. 

**Definition 4.1** (Intrinsic Affine Preorder).: _For two encoders \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), we define the relation_

\[\bm{h}\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g}\quad\text{iff}\quad d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}( \bm{h},\bm{g})=0.\] (9)

**Lemma 4.2**.: _The relation \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) is a preorder on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\)._

Proof.: Follows from \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\psi\circ\bm{h},\bm{g})\leq\|\psi_{\mathrm{lin}}\|_{V} \cdot d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\), see App. D.3. 

Intuitively, \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) captures the order of encoders such that higher-positioned encoders in the order can be \(S\)-transformed to the lower-positioned ones. To derive the implications of \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) we introduce the notion of an encoder rank.

**Definition 4.2** (Encoder Rank).: _For any \(\bm{h}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\) let the **encoder rank** be \(\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})\stackrel{{\text{\tiny def}}}{{=}}\dim_{ \mathbb{R}}(V_{\bm{h}})\), where \(V_{\bm{h}}\) is the subvector space generated by the image of \(\bm{h}\). When \(\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})=\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(V)\), \(\bm{h}\) is a **full rank** encoder, else it is **rank deficient**._

**Theorem 4.1**.: _For \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), we have_

\[\bm{h}\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g}\Leftrightarrow\bm{h}=\psi(\bm{\pi}_{\bm{ h}}\circ\bm{g})\text{ for some }\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\] (10)

_where, \(\pi_{\bm{h}}\) is the orthogonal projection of \(V\) onto \(V_{\bm{h}}\). In particular, if \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\) then \(\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})\leq\mathrm{rank}(\bm{g})\). If in addtion, we know \(\mathrm{rank}(\bm{g})=\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})\), then \(\bm{g}\) must by an affine transformation of \(\bm{g}\), i.e., \(\bm{h}=\psi\circ\bm{g}\) for some \(\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\)._

This allows us to state our first notion of language encoder similarity: intrinsic affine homotopy.

**Definition 4.3** (Exact Intrinsic Affine Homotopy).: _We say that two encoders \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\) are **exactly intrinsically affinely homotopic** and write \(\bm{h}\simeq_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g}\) if_

\[d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\text{ and }\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})= \mathrm{rank}(\bm{g}).\] (11)

For any \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), one can easily show that

\[\bm{h}\simeq_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g}\Longleftrightarrow(\bm{g}\succsim_{ \mathrm{Aff}}\bm{h}\text{ and }\bm{h}\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g})\Longleftrightarrow d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)} ^{\mathcal{H}_{\mathrm{f}},\mathrm{\,sym}}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0,\] (12)

which implies that \(\simeq_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) is an equivalence relation on the set of language encoders \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\). Intuitively, two encoders \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) are exactly intrinsically affinely homotopic, this means that both \(\bm{g}\) can be affinely mapped to \(\bm{h}\), as well as the other way around.

## 5 Extrinsic Homotopy

In SS4, we explore methods for assessing how similar two language encoders are without reference to any downstream tasks. Here, we extend our discussion to the _extrinsic_ homotopy of language encoders. Since language encoders are primarily used to generate representations for downstream tasks--such as in transfer learning, illustrated by the sentiment analysis example in SS1--we argue that the key criterion in the similarity of two encoders lies in how closely we can align predictions stemming from their representations.15

Footnote 15: The proofs of all claims in this section can be found in App. D.3.

**Principle 5.1** (Extrinsic Homotopy).: Two language encoders \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) are **extrinsically homotopic** if we can guarantee a similar performance on any downstream task \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) might be used for.

The rest of the section formalizes this intuitive notion and describes its relationship with intrinsic affine homotopy. Let \(W\) be the vector space \(\mathbb{R}^{N}\) and set \(\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)\) as the set of affine maps from \(V\) to \(W\).16 We define \(\mathcal{E}_{\Delta}\stackrel{{\text{\tiny def}}}{{=}}\text{ Map}(\Sigma^{*},\Delta^{N-1})\) and \(\mathcal{E}_{W}=\text{Map}(\Sigma^{*},W)\). Lastly, we formalize the notion of a transfer learning task as constructing a classifier that uses a language encoder's string representations. Particularly, we set \(\mathcal{V}_{N}\) to be the family of log-linear models as follows

Footnote 16: Given an affine map \(f\colon V\to W\), there is a unique linear map \(\mathbf{A}=f_{\mathbb{in}}\in\mathcal{L}(V,W)\) and \(\mathbf{b}\in W\) such that for every \(v\in V\) we have \(f(\mathbf{v})=\mathbf{A}\cdot\mathbf{v}+\mathbf{b}\).

\[\mathcal{V}_{N}\colon\mathcal{E}_{V}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{E}_{\Delta^{N-1}}) \backslash\{\emptyset\},\quad\bm{h}\mapsto\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}(\mathrm{ Aff}_{V,W}(\bm{h})),\] (13)

where \(\mathrm{Aff}_{V,W}\) is the map

\[\mathrm{Aff}_{V,W}\colon\mathcal{E}_{V}\to\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{E}_{W}) \backslash\{\emptyset\},\quad\bm{h}\mapsto\{\psi\circ\bm{h}\mid\psi\in\mathrm{ Aff}(V,W)\}\] (14)

and \(\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}\colon\mathbb{R}^{N}\to\Delta^{N-1}\) is defined for \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_{+},\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N}\), and \(n\in[N]\) as

\[\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)_{n}=\frac{\exp\left(\lambda x _{n}\right)}{\sum_{n^{\prime}=1}^{N}\exp\left(\lambda x_{n^{\prime}}\right)}.\] (15)

**Remark 5.1**.: _Each \(p_{\psi}=\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}\circ\psi(\bm{h}(\bm{y}))\) can be seen as a "probability distribution" over \([N]\)_

\[\mathcal{V}_{N}(\bm{h})=\{p(\Box\mid\bm{y})\colon[N]\to[0,1],\Box\mapsto \mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}\circ\psi(\bm{h}(\bm{y}))_{\circ}\mid\psi\in\mathrm{ Aff}(V,W)\}.\] (16)

Through our standard recipe from Remark 3.1, we can define the following hemi-metrics on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\).

**Definition 5.1**.: _For any two encoders \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), we define17_

Footnote 17: The subscript \(\infty\) in \(d_{\infty,\Delta}\) and \(d_{\infty,W}\) is used to insist on that we are considering the supremum distance \(d_{\infty}\) in \(\Delta^{N-1}\) and \(W\), respectively.

\[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{A}\mathrm{H}}(V,W)(\bm{h},\bm{g}) \stackrel{{\text{\tiny def}}}{{=}}d^{\mathcal{H}}_{ \mathcal{A}_{\infty},W}(\mathrm{Aff}_{V,W}(\bm{h}),\mathrm{Aff}_{V,W}(\bm{g}))\] (17a) \[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g}) \stackrel{{\text{\tiny def}}}{{=}}d^{\mathcal{H}}_{ \mathcal{A}_{\infty},\Delta^{N-1}}(\mathcal{V}_{N}(\bm{h}),\mathcal{V}_{N}( \bm{g}))\] (17b)

Notice that we use \(d^{\mathcal{H}}\) rather than \(d\) in Def. 5.1 since we are interested in how closely we can bring \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) when we affinely transform _both_ of them--this corresponds to independently affinely transforming the encoders for the same transfer learning task. In particular, Eq. (17b) measures how different two encoders are on any transfer learning task, formalizing the notion of extrinsic homotopy (cf. Principle 5.1), captured by the following definition.

**Definition 5.2** (Extrinsic Affine Preorder).: _An encoder \(\bm{h}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\) is **exactly extrinsically homotopic** to18\(\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\) if \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\)._

Footnote 18: Exact extrinsic homotopy is asymmetric.

Analogously to Def. 4.1, we use \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) to define a preorder.

**Definition 5.3** (Extrinsic Affine Preorder).: _For two encoders \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), we define the relation_

\[\bm{h}\mathrel{\succscentre\mskip 1.0mu \succscentre\mskip 1.0mu \succscentre \mskip 1.0mu \mathrel{\mathop{\mathrm{Ext}}}}\bm{g}\quad\text{ iff }\quad d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0.\] (18)

**Lemma 5.1**.: _The relation \(\bm{h}\mathrel{\succscentre\mskip 1.0mu \succscentre\mskip 1.0mu \mathrel{\mathop{ \mathrm{Ext}}}}\bm{g}\) is a preorder on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\)._

We now relate \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) and \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) from Def. 5.1, and \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) from SS4.

**Lemma 5.2**.: _Let \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\). We have_

1. _There exists a constant_ \(c(\lambda)>0\) _such that for any_ \(\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)\)__ \[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{A},\Delta^{N-1}}(\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}(\psi \circ\bm{h}),\mathcal{V}_{N}(\bm{g}))\leq c(\lambda)\|\psi_{\mathbb{in}}|d_{ \mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g}).\]
2. \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\leq c(\lambda)d^{ \mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\)_._3. \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\Rightarrow d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}( \bm{h},\bm{g})=0\Rightarrow d^{\mathcal{H}}_{V(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\).

Lem. 5.2 shows that \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Ext}}\) is _finer_ than \(\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\). This means that the affine intrinsic preorder is contained in the extrinsic preorder, i.e., \(\bm{h}\succsim_{\mathrm{Aff}}\bm{g}\Rightarrow\bm{h}\succsim_{\mathrm{Ext}} \bm{g}\). Lastly, we can show that \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) is upper bounded by the intrinsic hemi-metric \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\).

**Theorem 5.1** (\(\epsilon\)-Intrinsic \(\Rightarrow\mathcal{O}(\epsilon)\)-Extrinsic).: _Let \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\) be two encoders. Then,_

\[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\leq c(\lambda)\,d^{ \mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g}).\]

## 6 Linear Alignment Methods for Finite Representation Sets

SSS 4 and 5 introduce ways of comparing language encoders as functions, which holistically characterizes relationships between them. We now address a more practical concern: Given two language encoders \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\), how can we approximate their similarity in practice? Rather than comparing \(\bm{h}\left(\bm{y}\right):\Sigma^{*}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{D}\) with \(\bm{g}\left(\bm{y}\right):\Sigma^{*}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{D}\) over the entire \(\Sigma^{*}\),19 we compare them over a finite set of strings \(\mathcal{Y}=\{\bm{y}^{(n)}\}_{n=1}^{N}\). We combine \(\mathcal{Y}\)'s representations given by \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) into matrices \(\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\), where we denote \(\mathbf{H}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot}}=\bm{h}\left(\bm{y}\right)\) and \(\mathbf{G}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot}}=\bm{g}\left(\bm{y}\right)\). We can approximate the notions of similarity from SS3 by optimizing over the affine maps \(\mathrm{Aff}(V)\) (for example, using gradient descent). Particularly, we approximate intrinsic similarity as

Footnote 19: For simplicity, we assume that \(\bm{h}\) and \(\bm{g}\) both map to \(\mathbb{R}^{D}\)

\[\hat{d}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G})\stackrel{{ \text{\tiny def}}}{{=}}\inf_{\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\max_{\bm{y}\in \mathcal{Y}}\|\mathbf{H}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot}}-\psi\circ\mathbf{G}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot} }\|_{V},\] (19)

and extrinsic similarity for some task-specific fixed \(\psi^{\prime}\) as

\[\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}(\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G})\stackrel{{\text{ \tiny def}}}{{=}}\inf_{\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}\max_{\bm{y}\in\mathcal{Y}}\| \mathrm{softmax}(\psi^{\prime}\circ\mathbf{H}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot}})-\mathrm{softmax }(\psi\circ\mathbf{G}_{\bm{y}_{\cdot}})\|_{W}.\] (20)

Unfortunately, the \(\max\) over \(\mathcal{Y}\) makes the optimization in Eqs. (19) and (20) difficult. For simplicity, we turn to commonly used linear alignment methods, which we review for completeness.

Orthogonal Procrustes Problem.Rather than optimizing the infinity norm over \(\mathcal{Y}\) as Eqs. (19) and (20), the orthogonal Procrustes problem finds the orthogonal transformation minimizing the Frobenius norm [34] by solving \(\mathrm{argmin}_{\mathbf{A}\in\mathrm{O}(V)}\|\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{A}\mathbf{G} \|_{F}\). Given the singular-value decomposition \(\mathbf{H}^{\top}\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{U}\bm{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\), the optimum is achieved by \(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\).20 Since the \(\mathrm{argmin}\) is over \(\mathrm{O}(V)\), this defines an extended pseudo-metric space by Prop. 3.1.

Footnote 20: See App. E for the derivation.

Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA).CCA [20] is a linear alignment method that finds the matrices \(\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\) that project \(\mathbf{H}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\) into subspaces maximizing their canonical correlation. Let \(\mathbf{A}_{\cdot,j}\) and \(\mathbf{B}_{\cdot,j}\) be the \(j\)th column vectors of \(\mathbf{A}\) and \(\mathbf{B}\), respectively. The formulation is as follows

\[\rho_{j}=\sup_{\mathbf{A}_{\cdot,j},\mathbf{B}_{\cdot,j}}\mathrm{corr}(\mathbf{ H}\mathbf{A}_{\cdot,j},\mathbf{G}\mathbf{B}_{\cdot,j})\quad\text{s.t.}\quad \forall_{i<j}\ \mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}_{\cdot,j}\perp\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}_{\cdot,i}\;,\;\;\forall _{i<j}\ \mathbf{G}\mathbf{B}_{\cdot,j}\perp\mathbf{G}\mathbf{B}_{\cdot,i}.\] (21)

The representation similarity is measured in terms of the goodness of CCA fit, e.g., the mean squared CCA correlation \(R_{\text{CCA}}^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{D}\rho_{i}^{2}/D\). We can reformulate the CCA objective in Eq. (21) as

\[\inf_{\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}}\frac{1}{2}\|\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{B} ^{\top}\mathbf{G}\|_{F}^{2}\qquad\text{s.t.}\quad(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H})( \mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H})^{\top}=(\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{G})(\mathbf{B}^ {\top}\mathbf{G})^{\top}=\mathbf{I}.\] (22)

Given the singular-value decomposition \(\mathbf{H}^{\top}\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{U}\bm{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\), the solution of Eq. (22) is \((\hat{\mathbf{A}},\hat{\mathbf{B}})=((\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}^{\top})^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathbf{U},(\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}^{\top})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{V})\), where \((\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}^{\top})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) and \((\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}^{\top})^{-\frac{1}{2}}\) are whitening transforms of \(\mathbf{U}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\). Assuming the data is whitened during pre-processing, CCA corresponds to linear alignment under an orthogonality constraint, equivalent to the orthogonal Procrustes problem; see also App. E.

CCA Extensions.Projection-weighted CCA (PWCCA) [30] also finds alignment matrices with CCA but applies weighting to correlation values \(\rho_{i}\) to report the goodness of fit. Given the canonical vectors \(\hat{\mathbf{A}}\), PWCCA reports \(\bar{\rho}_{\text{PW}}=\sum_{i=1}^{D}\alpha_{i}\rho_{i}/\sum_{i}\alpha_{i}\), where \(\alpha_{i}=\sum_{j}|\langle\hat{\mathbf{A}}_{\cdot,i},\mathbf{H}_{\cdot,j}\rangle|\).21

Footnote 21: CCA extensions beyond PWCCA are dicussed in App. C.

Non-Alignment Methods. While not explicitly (linearly) aligning representations, CKA [22] evaluates the kernel similarity between representations. CKA computes the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt independence [18] between centered kernel matrices \(\mathbf{K^{H}}\) and \(\mathbf{K^{G}}\) where \(\mathbf{K}^{H}_{ij}=k(\mathbf{H}_{i,\cdot},\mathbf{H}_{j,\cdot})\), and \(\mathbf{K}^{G}_{ij}=k(\mathbf{G}_{i,\cdot},\mathbf{G}_{j,\cdot})\) for a kernel function \(k\), i.e., \(\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{K^{H}}\mathbf{K^{G}})/\sqrt{(\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{K^{H}} \mathbf{\top}\mathbf{K^{H}})\mathrm{tr}(\mathbf{K^{G}}\mathbf{\top}\mathbf{K^{ G}}))}\). Linear CKA, where \(k(\mathbf{H}_{i,\cdot},\mathbf{H}_{j,\cdot})=\mathbf{H}^{\top}_{i,\cdot} \mathbf{H}_{j,\cdot}\), is commonly used.

## 7 Experiments

We now explore the practical implications of our theoretical results. We conduct experiments on ELECTRA [6], RoBERTa[28], and the 25 MultiBERT [35] encoders, which are architecturally identical to Bert-Base[11] models pre-trained with different seeds. We report results on the training sets of two GLUE benchmark classification tasks: SST-2 [38] and MRPC [14]. When reporting \(d\) and \(\hat{d}_{v^{\prime}}\) from Eq.19 and Eq.20, we use the \(L_{2}\) norm for simplicity and approximate \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}\) as

\[\hat{d}^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G})=\sup_{ \psi^{\prime}\in\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}\inf_{\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}\max_{ \boldsymbol{y}\in\mathcal{Y}}|\mathrm{softmax}(\psi^{\prime}\circ\mathbf{H}_ {\boldsymbol{y},\cdot})-\mathrm{softmax}(\psi\circ\mathbf{G}_{\boldsymbol{y},\cdot})\|_{2}.\] (23)

The experimental setup and compute resources are further described in App. F.

The Intrinsic 'Preorder' of Encoders. We first investigate whether the asymmetry of \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\) is measurable in the finite alphabet encoder representations. Figure1 shows distinct vertical lines for both tasks indicating that there are encoders that are consistently easier to affinely map _to_\((\neg\mathcal{M})\). This seems to be rather independent of which encoder we map _from_\((\mathcal{M}^{\neg})\). We further see that this trend is task-independent for early layers but diverges for later layers.

The Influence of Encoder Rank Deficiency. As discussed in SS4, the encoder rank plays a pivotal role in affine mappability; exact affine homotopy is only achievable between equal-rank encoders.22 With this in mind, we return to our findings from Figure1 to evaluate whether the observed differences

Figure 1: Asymmetry between ELECTRA (E), RoBERTa (R), and MultiBERT encoders (M1-M25) across layers. For each pair of the encoders \(\mathcal{M}^{(i)}\) and \(\mathcal{M}^{(j)}\), we generate training set embeddings \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)},\mathbf{H}^{(j)}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\) for SST-2, COLA, and MNLI. We then fit \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)}\) to \(\mathbf{H}^{(j)}\) with an affine map and report the goodness of fit through the max error L2 norm, i.e., an approximation of \(d(\mathbf{H}^{(j)},\mathbf{H}^{(i)})\) on row \(i\) and column \(j\) of the grid. Full results across GLUE tasks are shown in Figure4.

between encoders can be attributed to a difference in measurable rank. Due to the inaccuracies of computing the rank numerically, we approximate the encoder rank using the **rank to precision**\(\epsilon\) as the number of representation matrix singular values larger than some \(\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}\).23 We find statistically significant (\(p\)-value < 0.05) rank correlation with the median intrinsic distance \(\hat{d}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\) when mapping _to_ the corresponding encoder for RTE (\(\rho=0.312\)), MRPC (\(\rho=0.609\)), and QQP (\(\rho=0.389\)). We find no statistically significant correlations with the median distance when mapping _from_ the corresponding encoder. This difference in encoder ranks could, therefore, partially explain the previously observed differences in affine mappingly as some encoders seem to learn lower-rank representations.

Footnote 23: Following Press et al. [31], we choose \(\epsilon\) as \(n\cdot\sigma_{1}\cdot\epsilon_{p}\cdot\max(N,D)\) for \(n=5\), where \(\sigma_{1}\) is the largest singular value of the \(N\times D\) representation matrix and \(\epsilon_{p}\) the float machine epsilon. We note that the rank to precision \(\epsilon\) and the recovered correlation may depend on the chosen \(\epsilon\).

A Linear Bound on Extrinsic Similarity. Lem. 5.2 derives a relationship between affine intrinsic and extrinsic similarity. To evaluate its strength in practice, we measure Spearman's Rank Correlation (\(\rho\)) and Pearson Correlation (PCC) between intrinsic measures introduced in SS6 and the extrinsic measures \(\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}\) and \(\hat{d}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}^{\eta}\). PCC measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two random variables, whereas Spearman's \(\rho\) additionally evaluates the variables' monotonic association. \(\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}\) is computed by training a linear classifier \(\psi^{\prime}\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\) on the final MultiBERT layer for each task. Further, we report \(\hat{d}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}^{\eta}\) as the maximum \(L_{2}\) loss for a large number of randomly generated24 classifiers \(\psi^{\prime}\) on the final layer of each MultiBERT encoder. We generate \(100\) such classifiers for a range of GLUE datasets.25 Table 1 show significant, large linear correlation prevalent in all linear alignment methods, whereas CKA--a linear, non-alignment method--does not capture extrinsic behavior as faithfully. Further, Figure 2 visualizes the linear relationship explicitly for all considered GLUE datasets.

Footnote 24: The generation process is described in App. F.

Footnote 25: The computational expense of computing \(\hat{d}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}^{\eta}\) restricts this analysis to a limited set of classifiers, depending on the alphabet size. See App. B for a discussion.

## 8 Discussion

We set out to explore homotopic relationships between language encoders, augmenting existing work on the similarity of finite representation sets by holistically studying encoder _functions_. In particular, the general framework of \(S\)-homotopy allows us to study any functional relationship between encoders, enabling the exploration of many types of encoder relationships. As a first step in this direction and a concrete example, SS4 explores _affine_ homotopy, discussing what it means to be able to align two models with affine transformations. Here, Hausdorff-Hoare maps prove useful, as they allow us to measure a notion of (asymmetric) distance between a point--an encoder--and the _set_ of all affine transformations of another encoder. Lem. 5.2 in SS5 then connects the intrinsic,

Figure 2: For ELECTRA (E), RoBERTa (R), and MultiBERTs (M1-M25), we plot extrinsic (\(\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}\)) against intrinsic similarity (\(\hat{d}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\)) across GLUE tasks. We group the points by how well we can map to each encoder (\(\leftharpoonup\mathcal{M}\)), and display the median, as well as the first and third quartiles as vertical and horizontal lines. We additionally show the linear regression from \(\hat{d}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\) to \(\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}\).

task-independent, similarly to extrinsic similarity--the similarity of performance on downstream tasks. Concretely, it derives a linear relationship between the intrinsic and extrinsic dissimilarity for any fixed affine transformation \(\psi^{\prime}\) (i.e., a fixed downstream task). Thm. 5.1 discusses a stronger bound, namely on the _worst-case_ extrinsic dissimilarity among all downstream linear classifiers, i.e., among all possible tasks. Further, by accounting for the asymmetries of encoder relationships, we augment the work on similarity in proper metric spaces [3, 36, 42].

Although encoders may not be affinely related in practice, empirical evidence in SS7 suggests that notions of affine order still surface (cf. Tab. 1, Fig. 2), particularly as differently initialized BERTs exhibit variations in downstream task performance [29]. While other similarity measures, such as those used in seed specificity tests [12], are designed to remain invariant to initialization changes, our results indicate that intrinsic affine homotopy is appropriately _sensitive_ to them. This sensitivity raises new questions about the landscape of pre-trained encoders; as seen in Fig. 1, asymmetry in intrinsic affine similarity among similarly pre-trained encoders impacts downstream performance, as corroborated by Lem. 5.2 and empirical results in Tab. 1. Differences in representation ranks may partly explain this asymmetry--mapping between artificially generated rank-deficient encoders yields mostly symmetric affine distances (cf. Fig. 3). Another explanation might be that easy-to-learn encoders might be approximately linear combinations of others, making them easy to map _to_ but not necessarily _from_. Overall, our findings highlight the need to account for directionality in encoder similarity measures to address the asymmetry inherent in this problem.

## 9 Conclusion

We discuss the structure of the space of language encoder in the framework of \(S\)-homotopy--the notion of aligning encoders with a chosen set of functions. We formalize affine alignment between encoders and show that it provides upper bounds on the differences in performance on downstream tasks. Experiments show our notion of intrinsic affine homotopy to be consistently predictive of downstream task behavior while revealing an asymmetric order in the space of encoders.

## Appendix A Notation

## Appendix B Limitations

In this section, we address some of our work's limitations.

Non-Linear Encoder Relationships. This work focuses on affine similarity between encoders. As we find and discuss in SS4 with the example of MultiBERTs, language encoder representations may generally not be exactly affinely related. Nevertheless, understanding the affine-homotopy relationships on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\) still helps us to make conclusions about practical findings as in SS7.

Linear Classifiers. Our work provides precise theoretical guarantees on the performance of linear classifiers applied to affinely-related encoders. In practice, task fine-tuning can take the form of more complex models, such as re-training entire pre-trained models. This work does not cover such more complex fine-tuning techniques.

Numerical Approximations. To bridge our theoretical findings on affine homotopy relationships in \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\) with their practical implementations in SS7, we concede several approximations. For instance, while \(d^{\text{tr}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}\) is valuable in analysis, optimizing Eq. (23) directly is computationally challenging and requires costly approximations. Similarly, in computing intrinsic distances across all representation layers in Fig. 1, we optimize for mean squared error (MSE) and evaluate the maximum loss instead of optimizing for it directly, which serves as an approximation of \(d\) that results in more stable optimization given computational constraints. Finally, we address numerical inaccuracies encountered during singular value decomposition (SVD) computations in SS7, which we mitigate by tuning the rank according to precision \(\epsilon\).

Representational and Functional Similarity.Our work is related to the ongoing efforts to quantify the similarity between neural networks. Much related work discusses similarity measures in terms of the invariance properties of neural networks [12, 22, _inter alia_]; see Klabunde et al. [21] for a recent comprehensive survey. Notably, Klabunde et al. [21] compile various _representational_[19, 23, 27, 32, 39, _inter alia_] and _functional_ ways to measure similarity, which are related to our notions of intrinsic and extrinsic homotopy, respectively. Whereas our notion of intrinsic affine homotopy fits into the class of linear alignment-based measures [12, 27, 42, _inter alia_] as described in SS6, the notion of extrinsic similarity fits into the broader category of performance-based functional measures [1, 8, 26]. Most relevantly, Boix-Adsera et al. [3] propose the Gulp metric that provides a bound on the expected prediction dissimilarity for norm-one-bounded ridge regression.

Similarity Measures as Metrics. A line of work draws from _statistical shape analysis_[37] to motivate the development of similarity measures that are that conform to axioms of valid metrics [3, 36, 42]. Learning within proper metric spaces provides certain theoretical guarantees [2, 5, 10, 41, 43]. For example, Williams et al. [42] derive two families of _generalized shape metrics_, modifying existing dissimilarity measures to ensure they meet metric criteria. Notably, one of these generalized shape metrics is based on linear regression over the group of linear isometries, similar to the approach derived for encoder maps in Prop. 3.1.

Understanding Similarity of Language Encoders. Finally, several previous works characterize the landscape of language encoders and their sensitivity to slight changes to the pre-training or fine-tuning procedure [9, 13, 44]. This prompted multi-seed releases of encoders such as BERT [35, 44] that are frequently used for robustness or sensitivity analysis [12, 33], similar to the one presented in this work.

In this section, we provide additional derivations and proofs complementing the discussion in SS3-SS5.

### Preliminaries on Hemi-Metric Spaces

**Definition D.1**.: _Let \((X,d)\) be a hemi-metric space. The **open ball**\(B(x,\epsilon)\) of center \(x\) and radius \(\epsilon>0\), is the set \(\{y\in X\mid d(x,y)<\epsilon\}\). The open balls form a base for the open ball topology.26_

Footnote 26: This, by definition, is the topology generated by all open balls.

**Lemma 4.1**.: _Let \((X,d)\) be a hemi-metric space. The relation \((x\;\raise 1.29pt\hbox{$>$\kern-7.5pt\lower 4.3pt\hbox{$\sim$}}_{d}\;y\) iff \(d(x,y)=0)\) is a **preorder**27 and it will be called the **specialization ordering** of \(d\)._

Footnote 27: A reflexive and transitive relation on \(X\).

**Example D.1**.: An example of a specialization ordering is the prefix ordering of strings \(\leq_{\text{prefix}}\)28. More precisely, for any \(\boldsymbol{y},\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}\in\Sigma^{*}\), we define \(d_{\Sigma^{*}}(\boldsymbol{y},\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime})\) to be zero if \(\boldsymbol{y}\) is a prefix of \(\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}\) and \(2^{-n}\) otherwise, where \(n\) is the length of the longest prefix of \(\boldsymbol{y}\) that is also a prefix of \(\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}\). Then \((\Sigma^{*},d_{\Sigma^{*}})\) is a hemi-metric space whose specialization ordering is \(\leq_{\text{prefix}}\). //

Footnote 28: Defined by \(\boldsymbol{y}\leq_{\text{prefix}}\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}\) if \(\boldsymbol{y}\) is a prefix of \(\boldsymbol{y}^{\prime}\).

**Lemma D.1**.: _Let \((X,d)\) be a hemi-metric space._

1. _The set_ \(\{x\in X\mid d^{\text{\tiny H}}(x,E)=0\}\) _is exactly the closure of_ \(E\) _in the open ball topology._
2. _For any_ \(x,x^{\prime}\in X\)_, we have the inequality_ \(d^{\text{\tiny H}}(x,E)\leq d(x,x^{\prime})+d^{\text{\tiny H}}(x^{\prime},E)\)_. If_ \(d\) _is a metric, then_ \(d^{\text{\tiny H}}(\cdot,E)\) _is_ \(1\)_-Lipschitz from_ \((X,d)\) _to_ \(\overline{\mathbb{R}}_{+}\)_._
3. _Let_ \(\mathcal{Z}\subset\mathcal{P}(X)\) _be any space of non-empty subsets of_ \(X\)_. The **Hausdorff-Hoare map**__\(d^{\text{\tiny H}}\) _is hemi-metric on_ \(\mathcal{Z}\)_. Its specialization ordering_ \(\raise 1.29pt\hbox{$>$\kern-7.5pt\lower 4.3pt\hbox{$\sim$}}_{d^{\mathcal{H}}}\) _is given by_ \(E\;\raise 1.29pt\hbox{$>$\kern-7.5pt\lower 4.3pt\hbox{$\sim$}}_{d^{\mathcal{H}}}\;E^{ \prime}\) _iff_29__\(E\subset cl(E^{\prime})\)_, iff_ \(cl(E)\subset cl(E^{\prime})\)_._

Footnote 29: Here, the closure is with respect to the topology defined by \(d\).

Proof.: See Goubault-Larrecq [17, Lemma 6.1.11, Proposition 6.2.16 & Lemma 7.5.1].

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:16]

1. Let \(t\in\mathcal{T}\) be the translation moving the center of the ball enclosing \(\bm{h}(\Sigma^{*})\) to the center \(0_{V}\). Hence \[\|\bm{h}\|_{\text{Iso}(V)}\leqslant\|\bm{h}\|_{\mathcal{T}}\leqslant\|t\circ\bm{ h}\|_{\infty}=r_{\bm{h}}\] Now observe that for any other isometry \(\psi\neq t\), then \(r_{\psi\circ\bm{h}}=r_{\bm{h}}\). The ball \(B(0_{V},\|\psi\circ\bm{h}\|_{\infty})\) clearly contains all points in \(\psi\circ\bm{h}(\Sigma^{*})\), hence by definition of the radius \(r_{\psi\circ\bm{h}}\) we must have \(\|\psi\circ\bm{h}\|_{\infty}\leqslant r_{\bm{h}}\), which finishes the proof of 1.
2. Write \(\psi=\phi_{\text{lin}}\circ t\), with \(t\in\mathcal{T}\). We then have \[\|\psi\circ\bm{h}\|_{S} =\inf_{\phi\in S}\|\phi(\psi\circ\bm{h})\|_{\infty}\] \[=\inf_{\phi\in S}\|\psi_{\text{lin}}(\underbrace{\psi_{\text{ lin}}^{-1}\circ\phi\circ\psi_{\text{lin}}\circ t}_{\in S}\circ\bm{h})\|_{\infty}\] Note that \(\phi\mapsto\psi_{\text{lin}}^{-1}\circ\phi\circ\psi_{\text{lin}}\circ t\) is by definition a bijection of \(S\), hence \[\|\psi\circ\bm{h}\|_{S} =\inf_{\phi\in S}\|\psi_{\text{lin}}(\phi\circ\bm{h})\|_{\infty}\] \[=\inf_{\phi\in S}\sup_{\bm{y}\in\Sigma^{*}}|\psi_{\text{lin}}\left( (\phi\circ\bm{h})(\bm{y})\right)|_{V}\] \[\leqslant\|\psi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}\inf_{\phi\in S}\sup_{\bm{y} \in\Sigma^{*}}|(\phi\circ\bm{h})(\bm{y}))|_{V}\] \[=\|\psi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}\cdot\|\bm{h}\|_{S}.\qed\]

**Corollary D.1**.: Let \(S\supset\mathcal{T}\) such that \(\inf_{\psi\in S}\|\psi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}\).33 Then, \(d_{S}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\stackrel{{\text{def}}}{{=}}\inf_{\psi,\psi^ {\prime}\in S}\|\psi\circ\bm{h}-\psi^{\prime}\circ\bm{g}\|_{\infty}=0\) for all \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{b}\).

Footnote 33: This is, for example, the case if \(S\) is a group and there exists \(\phi\in S\) such that \(\|\phi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}<1\), e.g., \(S=\operatorname{Aff}(F)\).

Proof.: Note that \(d_{S}(\psi\circ\bm{h},\bm{g})\leqslant\|\psi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}\cdot d_{S}( \bm{h},\bm{g})\), which follows from Lem. D.4. Hence

\[d_{S}(\bm{h},\bm{g}) =\inf_{\psi\in S}d_{S}(\psi\circ\bm{h},\bm{g})\] \[\leqslant\underbrace{\inf_{\psi\in S}\|\psi_{\text{lin}}\|_{V}}_{ =0}\,d_{S}(\bm{h},\bm{g}).\qed\]

### Proofs: Intrinsic Affine Homotopy

**Lemma 4.2**.: _The relation \(\succsim_{\operatorname{Aff}}\) is a preorder on \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\)._

Proof.: Since \(d_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}(\psi\circ\bm{h},\bm{g})\leqslant\|\psi_{\text{lin}} \|_{V}\cdot d_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\) (see Lem. D.4),

\[d_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\Leftrightarrow d_{\operatorname{ Aff}(V)}^{\mathcal{H}}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0.\]

Therefore, the relation \(\succsim_{\operatorname{Aff}}\) is the specialization ordering of the hemi-metric \(d_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}^{\mathcal{H}}\). 

**Theorem 4.1**.: _For \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\), we have_

\[\bm{h}\succsim_{\operatorname{Aff}}\bm{g}\Leftrightarrow\bm{h}=\psi(\pi_{ \bm{h}}\circ\bm{g})\text{ for some }\psi\in\operatorname{Aff}(V)\] (10)

_where, \(\pi_{\bm{h}}\) is the orthogonal projection of \(V\) onto \(V_{\bm{h}}\). In particular, if \(d_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\) then \(\operatorname{rank}(\bm{h})\leqslant\operatorname{rank}(\bm{g})\). If in addition, we know \(\operatorname{rank}(\bm{g})=\operatorname{rank}(\bm{h})\), then \(\bm{g}\) must by an affine transformation of \(\bm{g}\), i.e., \(\bm{h}=\psi\circ\bm{g}\) for some \(\psi\in\operatorname{Aff}(V)\)._

Proof.:
1. Recall from SS3.2 that \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\) is complete with respect to the metric \(d_{\infty}\). The condition \(d(\bm{h},\bm{g})_{\operatorname{Aff}(V)}=0\) simply means that there exists \(\phi_{n}\in\operatorname{Aff}(V)\) such that \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi_{n}\circ\bm{g}=\bm{h}\) in \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\), in other words \(\bm{h}\in\overline{\operatorname{Aff}(\bm{g})}\), i.e., \(\bm{h}\) lies in the closure of \(\operatorname{Aff}(\bm{g})\) in \(\mathcal{E}_{V}\).

Let \(\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}}\subset\Sigma^{\bm{*}}\) such that \(\bm{h}(\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}})\) is a basis for \(V_{\bm{h}}\). Therefore, there exists \(\epsilon>0\) such that any family34 Footnote 34: close enough to \(\bm{h}(\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}})\). \[(v_{\bm{y}})_{\bm{y}}\in\prod_{\bm{y}\in\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}}}B(\bm{h}(\bm{y}),\epsilon)\] has rank \(\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(V_{\bm{h}})\). This shows that there exists \(N\geq 1\) such that for any \(n\geq N\) one has \(\|\bm{h}-\phi_{n}\circ\bm{g}\|_{\infty}<\epsilon\), and \[\mathrm{rank}(\{\phi_{n}\circ\bm{g}(\bm{y})\colon\bm{y}\in\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}} \})=\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h}).\] Which implies in particular \[\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(V_{\bm{h}})\leq\dim_{\mathbb{R}}(V_{\bm{g}})\text{ i.e., }\mathrm{rank}\,\bm{h}\leq\mathrm{rank}\,\bm{g}.\] (26)
2. If \(\mathrm{rank}(\bm{g})=\mathrm{rank}(\bm{h})=D\), then \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi_{n}=\phi\), where \(\phi\) is the affine map given by \(\bm{g}(\bm{y})\mapsto\bm{h}(\bm{y})\) for \(\bm{y}\in\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}}\). Indeed, for any \(v=\sum_{b\in\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}}}\lambda_{b}b\in V\), we have \[\|(\phi-\phi_{n})(v)\|\leq\|\bm{h}-\psi_{n}\circ\bm{g}\|_{\infty}\sum_{b\in \bm{h}(\mathcal{B}_{\bm{h}})}|\lambda_{b}|\leq c\|\bm{h}-\psi_{n}\circ\bm{g}\| _{\infty}\,\|v\|_{V}\] for some constant \(c>0\), since all norms on \(V\) are equivalent. Hence, \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\|\phi-\phi_{n}\|_{V}=0\), which shows the claim. Accordingly, we must have \(\phi\circ\bm{g}=\bm{h}\). Now we can prove Eq. (10): \[\exists\Rightarrow\] Given that \(|\bm{h}-\pi_{\bm{h}}\circ\phi_{n}\circ\bm{g}\|_{\infty}\leq\|\bm{h}-\phi_{n} \circ\bm{g}\|_{\infty},\) we also have \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\pi_{\bm{h}}\circ\phi_{n}\circ\bm{g}=\bm{h}\). Write \(\pi^{\perp}\) for the orthogonal projection on \(V^{\perp}\) and set \(\pi_{\bm{h},n}=\pi_{\bm{h}}\oplus\frac{1}{n\|\phi_{n}\|}\pi^{\perp}_{\bm{h}}\). Note that \(\lim_{n\to\infty}\pi_{\bm{h},n}=\pi_{\bm{h}}\). Accordingly, \[\lim_{n\to\infty}\psi_{n}(\pi\circ\bm{g})=\bm{h},\] where \(\psi_{n}=\pi_{\bm{h},n}\phi_{n}\pi^{-1}_{\bm{h},n}\). From this, we deduce that \[d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\pi_{\bm{h}}\circ\bm{g})=0.\] Now applying 2. yields \(\bm{h}=\phi(\pi_{h}\circ\bm{g})\) for some \(\phi_{h}\in\mathrm{Aff}(V_{\bm{h}})\), or \(\bm{h}=\phi(\pi_{\bm{h}}\circ\bm{g})\) where \(\phi=\phi_{h}\oplus\pi^{\perp}_{\bm{h}}\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\).
3\(\Leftarrow\) Assume now that \(\bm{h}=\phi(\pi_{\bm{h}}\circ\bm{g})\) for some \(\phi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)\). Then \(\bm{h}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\phi\circ\pi_{\bm{h},n}(\bm{g})\), where \(\pi_{\bm{h},n}=\pi_{\bm{h}}\oplus\frac{1}{n}\pi^{\perp}_{\bm{h}}\), which shows the desired implication. 

### Proofs: Extrinsic Homotopy

**Lemma 5.2**.: _Let \(\bm{h},\bm{g}\in\mathcal{E}_{V}\). We have_

1. _There exists a constant_ \(c(\lambda)>0\) _such that for any_ \(\psi\in\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)\)__ \[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\omega,\Delta^{N-1}}(\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}(\psi\circ\bm{ h}),\mathcal{V}_{N}(\bm{g}))\leq c(\lambda)\|\psi_{\text{in}}\|d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}( \bm{h},\bm{g}).\]
2. \(d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})\leq c(\lambda)d^{ \mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V,W)}(\bm{h},\bm{g}).\)__
3. \(d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\Rightarrow d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathrm{Aff}(V,W )}(\bm{h},\bm{g})=0\Rightarrow d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\mathcal{V}(V,\Delta)}(\bm{h}, \bm{g})=0.\)__

Proof.:
1. Clearly, \[d^{\mathcal{H}}_{\omega,\Delta^{N-1}}(\mathrm{softmax}_{\lambda}( \psi\circ\bm{h}),\mathcal{V}_{N}(\bm{g})) \leq c(\lambda)d_{\mathcal{V}(V,W)}(\psi\circ\bm{h},\mathrm{Aff}_{ V,W}(\bm{g}))\] \[\leq c(\lambda)\inf_{\psi^{\prime}\in\psi\circ\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\| \psi\circ\bm{h}-\psi^{\prime}\circ\bm{g}|_{\infty,W}\] \[=c(\lambda)\inf_{\psi^{\prime}\in\mathrm{Aff}(V)}\|\psi(\bm{h}-\psi^ {\prime}\circ\bm{g})\|_{\infty,W}\] \[=c(\lambda)\|\psi_{\text{in}}\|d_{\mathrm{Aff}(V)}(\bm{h},\bm{g}).\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

Orthogonal Procrustes Problem.Let \(\mathbf{G}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\) representation matrices. In the orthogonal Procrustes problem, we seek to find the _orthogonal_ matrix \(\mathbf{A}\) that best maps \(\mathbf{H}\) to \(\mathbf{G}\):

\[\operatorname*{argmin}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)}\|\mathbf{H}- \mathbf{A}\mathbf{G}\|_{F}.\] (34)

Since

\[\|\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}\|_{F}^{2} =\operatorname{tr}((\mathbf{G}-\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A})^{\top}( \mathbf{G}-\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A}))\] \[=\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{G}^{\top}\mathbf{G})-\operatorname{tr }(\mathbf{G}^{\top}\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A})-\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}^{\top} \mathbf{H}^{\top}\mathbf{G})+\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H}^{ \top}\mathbf{H}\mathbf{A})\] \[=\|\mathbf{G}\|_{F}^{2}+\|\mathbf{H}\|_{F}^{2}-2\operatorname{tr }(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H}^{\top}\mathbf{G}),\]

an equivalent objective to Eq. (34) is

\[\hat{\mathbf{A}}=\operatorname*{argmax}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)} \langle\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G}\rangle_{F}\]

Let \(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\) be the singular-value decomposition of \(\mathbf{H}^{\top}\mathbf{G}\), then

\[\hat{\mathbf{A}} =\operatorname*{argmax}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)} \langle\mathbf{A}\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G}\rangle_{F}\] (35a) \[=\operatorname*{argmax}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)} \langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{G}\mathbf{H}^{\top}\rangle_{F}\] (35b) \[=\operatorname*{argmax}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)} \langle\mathbf{A},\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\rangle_{F}\] (35c) \[=\operatorname*{argmax}_{\mathbf{A}\in\operatorname{O}(V)} \langle\mathbf{U}^{\top}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V},\mathbf{\Sigma}\rangle_{F}\] (35d)

where \(\mathbf{U}^{\top}\mathbf{A}\mathbf{V}\) is a product of orthogonal matrices, and, therefore, orthogonal. Since \(\mathbf{\Sigma}\) is diagonal, Eq. (35d) is maximized by \(\mathbf{U}^{\top}\hat{\mathbf{A}}\mathbf{V}=\mathbf{I}\), which means that \(\hat{\mathbf{A}}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\).

Canonical Correlation Analysis.We can rewrite the CCA objective from Eq. (21) as

\[\max_{\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}}\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H} \mathbf{G}^{\top}\mathbf{B})\qquad\text{s.t.}\quad(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{ H})(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H})^{\top}=(\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{G})(\mathbf{B}^{ \top}\mathbf{G})^{\top}=\mathbf{I},\] (36)

which, by definition of the Frobenius norm, is equivalent to Eq. (22). Let \(\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{G}}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{G}^{\top}\), \(\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}}=\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}^{\top}\), \(\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}}=\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}^{\top}\), and let \(\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}=\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{G}}\) be the singular-value decomposition of \(\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{G}}\). One can show that the optimum of Eq. (22) is found at \((\hat{\mathbf{A}},\hat{\mathbf{B}})=(\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}}^{- \frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{U},\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{G}\mathbf{G}}^{-\frac{1}{2}} \mathbf{V})\). Because \(\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{H}\), \(\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{G}\), \(\mathbf{U}\), and \(\mathbf{V}\) are by definition orthogonal, we see that CCA first whitens the representations \((\mathbf{H},\mathbf{G})\) through \((\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{H}\mathbf{H}}^{-\frac{1}{2}}\mathbf{M}_{\mathbf{G}\mathbf{ G}}^{-\frac{1}{2}})\) and then orthogonally transforms them. This provides the intuition behind a close relationship between CCA and the Orthogonal Procrustes problem: For pre-whitened representation matrices, CCA (Eq. (22)) is equivalent to solving the Orthogonal Procrustes problem (Eq. (34)). To see this, let \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{H}}\) and \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{G}}\) be whitening transforms for \(\mathbf{H}\) and \(\mathbf{G}\), respectively. Then, Eq. (22) is equivalent to

\[\min_{\mathbf{A},\mathbf{B}\in\operatorname{O}(V)}\|\mathbf{A}^{\top}\mathbf{W }_{\mathbf{H}}\mathbf{H}-\mathbf{B}^{\top}\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{G}}\mathbf{G} \|_{F}^{2}\] (37)

such that

\[(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{H}}\mathbf{H})(\mathbf{A}\mathbf{W }_{\mathbf{H}}\mathbf{H})^{\top} =\mathbfExperimental Setup

In this section, we provide additional details about the setup and compute resources of the experiments in SS7. To generate embeddings, we used the open-sourced code by Ren et al. [2019]. Further, for Orthogonal Procrustes, CCA, PWCCA, and Linear CKA, we use the open source implementation by Ding et al. [2019]. Our complete code is added as supplementary material.

Models and Datasets.We first extract the \(D=768\) dimensional training set representations for SST-2, MRPC, RTE, CoLA, MNLI, and QQP across all 12 layers of ELECTRA [2017], RoBERTa [2018], and the 25 MultiBERT [2019] models from HuggingFace.35 The models and the MRPC dataset are licensed under Apache License 2.0. The SST-2 dataset is licensed under the Creative Commons CC0: Public Domain license. The RTE dataset is licensed under the CC BY 3.0 license. The CoLA dataset is licensed under the CC BY-SA 4.0 license. The MNLI dataset is licensed under the General Public License (GPL). THE QQP dataset is licensed under a custom non-commercial license.36 The dataset statistics are shown in Tab. 3. We note that for all experiments, MNLI and QQP were shortened to the first 10K training samples due to computational limitations.

Hyperparameters.Each experiment was run using RiemannSGD37 as an optimizer as it initially produced the best convergence when computing our affine similarity measures. Further, to account for convergence artifacts, we ran the intrinsic similarity computation optimizations in each experiment for learning rates [\(1\text{e-}4\), \(1\text{e-}3\), \(1\text{e-}2\), \(1\text{e-}1\)] and extrinsic computations for [\(1\text{e-}3\), \(1\text{e-}2\), \(2\text{e-}2\)] and report the best result. When training the task-specific linear probing classifier \(\psi^{\prime}\) for \(\hat{d}_{\psi^{\prime}}\), we use the cross-entropy loss, RiemannSGD and optimize over the learning rates [\(1\text{e-}2\), \(1\text{e-}1\), \(2\text{e-}1\), \(4\text{e-}1\)]. For the computation of Hausdorff-Hoare map \(d^{\mathcal{H}}\), we fixed a lr of \(1\text{e-}3\) to save compute resources, as this lr generally leads to the best convergence in previous experiments. We used a batch size 64 and let optimization run for 20 epochs, keeping other parameters at default. For reproducibility, we set the initial seed to 42 during training.

Footnote 37: https://github.com/geoopt/geoopt

Generating Random Affine Maps.For the last experiment, we generate random affine maps. To approximate \(d^{\mathcal{H}}\) we sample the matrix entries of the affine map from \(\mathcal{N}(0,1)\). We then additionally normalize the transformed representation matrix as this leads to better convergence. To approximate \(\hat{d}^{\mathcal{H}}_{\psi(V,\Delta)}\), we fit a linear probe on \(\mathbf{H}\) to 100 sets of randomly generated class labels, for the embeddings of each task. The predictions of that probe then become what \(\mathbf{G}\) affinely maps to. In both cases, the seeds are set ascendingly from 0.

Compute Resources.We compute the embeddings on a single A100-40GB GPU, which took around two hours. All other experiments were run on 8-32 CPU cores, each with 8 GB of memory. Computing extrinsic distances between 600 model combinations across both datasets usually takes 2-3 hours on 8 cores, whereas intrinsic computation is more costly, and can run up to 4 hours. Note our approximation of Hausdorff-Hoare maps (cf. Eq. (23)) across all models is significantly more costly due to our sampling approach and can take up to 72 hours to compute on 32 cores for large datasets such as SST-2, and up to 12 hours for MRPC. The resources needed for initially failed experiments do not significantly exceed the reported compute.

## Appendix G Additional Experimental Results

**The Influence of Encoder Rank Deficiency.** In Thm. 4.1 we discuss how the relative rank of encoders influences their affine alignment and derive the equivalence relation \(\simeq_{\mathrm{Aff}}\) conditioned on equal rank between encoders. To test the effect of unequal rank on affine alignment in an isolated setup, we artificially construct reduced-rank encoders through singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation. In Figure 3 we expectedly find a trend in how the encoder rank influences affine mappability. We additionally highlight that the computed distances are rather symmetric, with no clear differences when mapping _to_ (\({}^{-}\mathcal{M}\)), rather than _from_ (\(\mathcal{M}^{-}\)) an encoder. Finally, we note the trend in the diagonal indicating that mapping between encoders of the same rank becomes easier between lower-rank encoders.

Figure 3: The effect of artificial rank deficiency averaged across MultiBerts. For each pair of embeddings \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{(j)}\) from MultiBerts \(\mathcal{M}^{(i)}\) and \(\mathcal{M}^{(j)}\) we generate additional rank-deficient encoders \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)}_{X\%}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{(j)}_{Y\%}\) with \(X,Y\in\{20\%,...,90\%\}\) of the full rank through SVD truncation. We compute \(d(\mathbf{H}^{(i)}_{Y\%},\mathbf{H}^{(j)}_{X\%})\), for each pair of possible rank-deficiency and finally report the median across all MultiBerts on row \(X\) and column \(Y\) on the grid. We additionally show row-, and column medians.

## 6 Conclusion

Figure 4: Asymmetry between ELECTRA (E), RoBERTa (R), and MultiBERT encoders (M1-M25) across layers. For each pair of the encoders \(\mathcal{M}^{(i)}\) and \(\mathcal{M}^{(j)}\), we generate training set embeddings \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)},\mathbf{H}^{(j)}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times D}\) for the GLUE tasks SST-2, CoLA, MNLI, QQP, RTE, and MRPC. We then fit \(\mathbf{H}^{(i)}\) to \(\mathbf{H}^{(j)}\) with an affine map and report the goodness of fit through the max error L2 norm, i.e., an approximation of \(d(\mathbf{H}^{(j)},\mathbf{H}^{(i)})\) on row \(i\) and column \(j\) of the grid.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the claims and contributions. The claims match the theoretical and experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We highlight limitations in the main text and add more general points in App. B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: If not in the main text, all proofs along with their assumptions are in App. D and App. E. We additionally provide short proof sketches in the main text. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe all used models, procedures as well as parameters, seeds, and required compute resources either in the main text or in App. F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code pulls data from GLUE, is runnable, and is submitted as supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Again, if not listed in the main text, it is listed in App. F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide significance indications in the form of p-values to all correlation computations and fitted regressions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Listed in App. F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors do not foresee any ethical implications to this work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Discussed in the final, "Broader Impact", section in the main body. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the original paper that produced each re-used code snippet and dataset. We provide licenses for all models and datasets used in App. F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not do crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not do crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
