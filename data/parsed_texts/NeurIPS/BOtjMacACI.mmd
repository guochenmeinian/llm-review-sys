###### Abstract

A common strategy for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) involves adapting the model to downstream tasks by learning a low-rank adaptation matrix. This matrix is decomposed into a product of down-projection and up-projection matrices, with the bottleneck dimensionality being crucial for reducing the number of learnable parameters, as exemplified by prevalent methods like LoRA and Adapter. However, these low-rank strategies typically employ a fixed bottleneck dimensionality, which limits their flexibility in handling layer-wise variations. To address this limitation, we propose a novel PEFT approach inspired by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) for representing the adaptation matrix. SVD decomposes a matrix into the product of a left unitary matrix, a diagonal matrix of scaling values, and a right unitary matrix. We utilize Householder transformations to construct orthogonal matrices that efficiently mimic the unitary matrices, requiring only a vector. The diagonal values are learned in a layer-wise manner, allowing them to flexibly capture the unique properties of each layer. This approach enables the generation of adaptation matrices with varying ranks across different layers, providing greater flexibility in adapting pre-trained models. Experiments on standard downstream vision tasks demonstrate that our method achieves promising fine-tuning performance.

## 1 Introduction

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) for pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) aims to adapt these models to downstream tasks by learning a small set of parameters while keeping most or all of the original model parameters frozen. This approach is expected to reduce the cost of fine-tuning and potentially improve the model's generalization performance, particularly when the downstream task involves limited data.

A common strategy for adapting the parameters is to learn an adaptation matrix that modifies the original matrix through addition or multiplication. To reduce the parameter scale of the adaptation matrix, a low-rank strategy is typically employed. This involves decomposing the adaptation matrix into the product of a down-projection matrix and an up-projection matrix, where the bottleneck dimensionality determines the parameter scale. Many prevailing PEFT solutions [1, 2, 3] follow this approach. However, these methods usually set the bottleneck dimensionality empirically to balance adaptation performance and parameter size. The fixed dimensionality, however, lacks the flexibility to accommodate variations in layer-wise properties.

In this work, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method to fine-tune pre-trained ViTs. Our design of the adaptation matrix is inspired by Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which decomposes a matrix into a product of a left unitary matrix, a diagonal matrix, and a right unitary matrix. In SVD, the unitary matrices consist of orthogonal vectors, and the diagonal matrix of singular values essentially determines the rank of the matrix. Inspired by SVD, we propose to use Householder transformations to replace the left and right unitary matrices. Householder transformations maintain orthogonality properties similar to unitary matrices but can be derived simply by a vector, making them parameter efficient. With left and right Householder matrices, we learn the diagonal matrix adaptively for each layer to accommodate layer-wise properties. This approach, termed the Householder Transformation-based Adaptor (HTA), enables us to derive the adaptation matrix in a parameter-efficient manner while theoretically allowing for varying ranks for the adaptation matrices, thus achieving a better balance between parameter efficiency and adaptation performance.

We conducted experiments on a set of downstream vision classification tasks. The results show that our method can be effectively applied to various ViT versions, achieving promising fine-tuning performance. In summary, the contributions of this work can be summarized as follows:

* We approach PEFT from a novel angle by viewing the adaptation matrix from the perspective of SVD, which inspires us to propose a Householder transformation-based adaptation strategy that is parameter-efficient.
* By learning scaling coefficients to compose Householder transformation matrices together into adaptation matrices, our method can theoretically allow varying adaptation matrix ranks to accommodate layer-wise variations.
* Experiments on two sets of downstream vision classification tasks reveal our method can achieve an appealing balance between adaptation performance and parameter efficiency.

### Pre-training and Transfer Learning

As an advanced learning strategy, extensive research [4; 5; 6; 7] has demonstrated the wide applicability of transfer learning across various fields. Especially in cases where the target task has limited data, high labeling costs, or poor data quality [8; 9; 10], transfer learning significantly enhances model generalization and training efficiency. By pre-training on large-scale datasets and using the obtained parameters as initialization for downstream tasks, transfer learning can effectively transfer and apply the knowledge of pre-trained models. In this process, the performance and convergence speed of downstream tasks are highly correlated with the dataset used for pre-training the model. In the field of computer vision, pre-training on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet [11] has significantly improved the performance of tasks like image classification [12; 13; 14; 15], object detection [16; 17], and semantic segmentation [18; 19]. Moreover, self-supervised pre-training [20; 21] leverages the advantage of not requiring large amounts of labeled data, expanding the data scale and enhancing feature extraction capabilities, thereby further improving the generalization ability and robustness of pre-trained models. However, due to the substantial computational resources required to fully fine-tune the parameters of pre-trained models in downstream tasks, current research has shifted towards exploring more efficient fine-tuning methods.

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

Compared to full fine-tuning, the PEFT methods [22; 23; 24; 25; 2; 26] aim to reduce the high cost of fine-tuning by freezing the majority of parameters in the pre-trained model and introducing a small number of learnable parameters to adapt to specific downstream tasks.

With the development of large pre-trained models, various PEFT approaches have emerged. Adapter [22] inserts a bottleneck-structured adapter layer into the pre-trained model and refines the model by updating only the parameters within the adapter layer. Bias [23] focuses on the fine-tuning of models for specific downstream tasks by meticulously calibrating the bias terms. VPT [24] integrates the concept of prompt learning into visual tasks, thereby facilitating targeted optimization for specific downstream tasks. SSF [25] efficiently fine-tunes the weights in pre-trained modelsthrough affine transformations composed of scaling and shifting operations. AdaptFormer [2] explores a parallel adapter solution on ViT for various downstream tasks. FacT [26] decomposes the weights of ViT into individual three-dimensional tensors and further decomposes the increments into lightweight factors. During fine-tuning phase, these factors are updated and stored, effectively reducing computational overhead.

### LoRA and its variants

As represented by LoRA [1], the core of this type of PEFT method is the utilization of low-rank matrices to approximate weight adjustments during the fine-tuning phase. By employing reparameterization techniques, these low-rank matrices are combined with the existing parameter matrices, thereby circumventing extra inference costs. AdaLoRA [27] employs singular value decomposition to decompose weight matrices, pruning insignificant singular values to effectively reduce the number of parameters. ARC [3] uses symmetric up-down projections to create cross-layer shared bottleneck operations. By learning low-dimensional rescaling coefficients, it effectively recombines layer-adaptive adapters, reducing the costs of fine-tuning. FedPara [28] reparameterizes model layers with low-rank matrices and uses the Hadamard product. This approach, unconstrained by low-rank limitations, offers greater capacity and reduces learning costs. RLRR [29] examines mainstream PEFT methods from the perspective of SVD decomposition, exploring the critical balance between preserving generalization in pre-trained models and adapting them to downstream tasks. Our research abandons the traditional fixed-rank approach, opting instead for a more flexible adjustment of parameter matrices using a small number of learnable parameters.

## 3 Methodology

In this section, we commence with an introduction of the notations, symbols, and contextual background related to low-rank adaptations and Householder transformation. Then we present the decomposed structure of low-rank adaptation and discuss its inherent operating mechanism from the perspective of singular value decomposition. Finally, we propose a novel adaptation via Householder transformation. This adaptation primarily aims to construct the Householder unitary matrices via a learnable weight vector, thereby trading-off the fully spanned representation space and the affordable parameter size.

### Preliminary knowledge

Low-rank adaptation.Pre-trained ViT models are typically initialized with weights learned from large-scale image datasets, such as ImageNet. The pre-training process involves optimizing the model on an unsupervised or supervised pretext task. The resulting pre-trained weights encode rich semantic information that can be transferred to a wide range of downstream tasks through fine-tuning. As one of the most representative methods of fine-tuning, PEFT method achieves excellent results on downstream tasks by merely utilizing a small number of additional learnable parameters to fine-tune the ViT. The most prevalent PEFT is the adaptation method, which can be divided into two categories: LoRA-based and adapter-based methods. In general, LoRA-based method is defined as:

\[\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)}=\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)}(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}+\mathbf{ W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{(l)}\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{(l)})+\vec{\bm{b}}^{(l) \top},\] (1)

where \(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)}\) is the fine-tuning output, \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}\) is any linear weight projection \(\{\mathbf{W}_{q}^{(l)},\mathbf{W}_{k}^{(l)},\mathbf{W}_{v}^{(l)},\mathbf{W}_{ v}^{(l)},\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{v}}^{(l)},\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{F}C2}^{(l)}\}\) in ViT, \(\vec{\bm{b}}^{(l)}\) is the bias weights, \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{\prime}\times D^{(l)}}\) are down- and up-adapting projection matrices across varying layers with the dimensionality \(D^{\prime}\ll D^{(l)}\). The detailed framework of LoRA-based method is shown in Fig. 1 (a). Analogously, adapter-based method is described as:

\[\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)} =\mathrm{Act}(\mathrm{MHA}(\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)})\mathbf{W}_{ \mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)})\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)},\] (2) \[\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{PT}}^{(l)} =\mathrm{Act}(\mathrm{FFN}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)}) \mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)})\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{ \mathrm{FFN}(l)},\]

with the activation function \(\mathrm{Act}(\cdot)\), Multi-Head Attention (MHA), and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) modules in ViT. The detail of adapter-based method is shown in Fig. 1 (c). By observing Eq. (1) and (2), both above-mentioned PEFT methods involve a low-rank bottleneck structure, _i.e._, \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{adaptation}}=\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{down}}\mathbf{W }^{(l)}_{\mathrm{up}}\). Note that we remove the activation in the low-rank bottleneck because the presence or absence of such activation does not affect the low-rank structure of adaptation.

Householder transformation.Householder transformation, or Householder reflection, is a linear transformation that reflects a vector across a hyperplane defined by a Householder vector. It is characterized by a Householder matrix, which is an orthogonal and symmetrical matrix with determinant -1. This transformation, initially proposed by A.S. Householder in 1958 [30], has significant applications in numerical linear algebra [31], particularly in QR decomposition [32], where it is used to transform a matrix into an upper triangular or Hessenberg form [33]. Householder transformation can also be employed to set specific elements of a vector to zero while preserving its norm, making it a valuable tool for matrix orthogonalization and symmetrization. The Householder matrix is defined as following:

\[\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{I}-\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}^{\top},\] (3)

with the identity matrix \(\mathbf{I}\) and the Householder vector \(\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}\).

### Viewing the adaptation matrix from SVD

Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) offers a profound insight into matrix factorization. It breaks down a matrix into three constituent matrices. Viewing the adaptation matrix through the lens of SVD, we represent it as:

\[\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{adaptation}}=\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}} \mathbf{D}^{(l)}\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}},\] (4)

Figure 1: Underpinned by (a) LoRA [1] and (c) Adapter [22], we utilize Householder matrix to construct Householder transformation-based adaptations, involving (b) LoRA-based method with HTA and (d) Adapter-based method with HTA.

where \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\) is the left unitary matrix and \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\) is the right unitary matrix; and \(\mathbf{D}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\) is the diagonal matrix in which the diagonal elements of a diagonal matrix are singular values. Unitary matrices \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\) and \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\) essentially characterize the rotation transformations in a linear space. The left unitary matrix \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\) rotates an arbitrary vector multiplied by the adaptation matrix \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{adaptation}}\) into the space it spans. Then, the vector is scaled by the diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{D}^{(l)}\). Finally, the right unitary matrix \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\) rotates the vector back to the original linear space. Therefore, the SVD decomposition characterizes the transformations of rotation and scaling in the linear space.

When it comes to the fine-tuning strategy, PEFT methods employ ViT as the backbone and essentially fine-tune the learnable parameters of unitary matrices \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{\prime}\times D^{(l)}}\) and the learnable singular values of diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{D}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{\prime}\times D^{\prime}}\) to downstream tasks, implicitly performing the rotation and scaling transformations. Note that the number of non-zero singular values in matrix \(\mathbf{D}^{(l)}\) does not exceed its dimensionality \(D^{\prime}\). However, the fixed bottleneck dimensionality \(D^{\prime}\) empirically set to LoRA- or adapter-based methods is inflexible, thereby without accommodating variations in layer-wise properties. This implies that the linear space spanned by the low-rank adaptation matrix and its corresponding number of non-zero singular values is constrained within a low dimensionality \(D^{\prime}\). Increasing the dimensionality \(D^{\prime}\) could effectively enhance the space capacity of the adaptation matrix, thereby improving the performance potential of the fine-tuned ViT model. However, this also further increases the number of parameters in the PEFT method.

### Householder transformation-based adaptation

To address the aforementioned issue, we introduce Householder transformation into the adaptation matrix learning, and propose the Householder Transformation-based Adaptor (HTA). Following this way, HTA facilitates the derivation of the adaptation matrix in a manner that is parameter-efficient, while theoretically accommodating the flexibility of varying ranks for the adaptation matrices.

In our approach, we respectively employ the Householder matrices \(\mathbf{H}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\) as substitutes for the left and right unitary matrices \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{\prime}\times D^{(l)}}\) within the adaptation matrix \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{adaptation}}\) to form the HTA adaptation matrix \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{HTA}}\):

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{HTA}}&=\mathbf{ H}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\mathbf{D}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{H}}\mathbf{H}^{(l)}_{ \mathrm{right}}\\ &=(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\vec{ \mathbf{v}}^{(l)\top}_{\mathrm{left}})\mathbf{D}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{H}}(\mathbf{I }-\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)\top}_{ \mathrm{right}})),\end{split}\] (5)

with two learnable parameter vectors \(\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{left}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}\) and \(\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}\) and a learnable diagonal parameter vector \(\vec{\vec{\mathbf{d}}}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}}\) in the diagonal matrix \(\mathbf{D}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{H}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times D^{(l)}}\).

Since the Householder transformation matrix is derived from a single vector, its transformation capacity can be limited and sensitive to the vector learned to derive it. To enhance the robustness of the adaptation matrix, we incorporate an additional low-rank adaptation matrix, resulting in the ultimate HTA. Building on this design, we can derive the LoRA alternative as follows:

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)}_{\mathrm{FT}}&=\mathbf{ X}^{(l-1)}(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}+\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{down}}\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{ \mathrm{up}}+\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{HTA}})+\vec{\mathbf{b}}^{(l)\top}\\ &=\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)}(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}+\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{ down}}\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{up}}+(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{ \mathrm{left}}\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)\top}_{\mathrm{left}})\mathbf{D}^{(l)}( \mathbf{I}-\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{right}}\vec{\mathbf{v}}^{(l)\top}_{ \mathrm{right}}))+\vec{\mathbf{b}}^{(l)\top},\end{split}\] (6)

where \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{down}}\in\mathbb{R}^{D^{(l)}\times 1}\) and \(\mathbf{W}^{(l)}_{\mathrm{down}}\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times D^{(l)}}\), unless otherwise stated. The HTA structure of the LoRA alternative is shown in Fig. 1 (b).

Analogously, we can derive HTA alternative to the adapter-based method (as shown in Fig. 1 (d)) as follows:

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)}=&\mathrm{ MHA}(\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)})(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)}\mathbf{W}_{ \mathrm{up}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)}+\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{HTA}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)})\\ =&\mathrm{MHA}(\mathbf{X}^{(l-1)})(\mathbf{W}_{ \mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)}\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)}+\\ &(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{left}}^{\mathrm{MHA}( l)}\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{left}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)\top})\mathbf{D}_{ \mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)}(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{right}}^ {\mathrm{MHA}(l)}\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{right}}^{\mathrm{MHA}(l)\top} )),\end{split}\] (7)

\[\begin{split}\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l)}=&\mathrm{ FFN}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)})(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)} \mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)}+\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{HTA}}^{\mathrm{ FN}(l)})\\ =&\mathrm{FFN}(\mathbf{X}_{\mathrm{FT}}^{(l-1)})( \mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)}\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{up}}^{\mathrm{ FFN}(l)}+\\ &(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{left}}^{\mathrm{FFN}( l)}\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{left}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)\top})\mathbf{D}_{ \mathrm{H}}^{\mathrm{FFN}(l)}(\mathbf{I}-\vec{\boldsymbol{v}}_{\mathrm{right}}^ {\mathrm{FFN}(l)\top})).\end{split}\]

By observing Eq. (6), we can see that LoRA-based method with HTA could be re-parameterized to the form \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{re-param}}=\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{down}}^{(l)}\mathbf{W}_{ \mathrm{up}}^{(l)}+\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{HTA}}^{(l)}\) during the model inference stage. And also, the re-parameterization \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{re-param}}^{\mathrm{MHA}}=\mathbf{W}_{o}^{(l)}\mathbf{W}_{ \mathrm{HTA}}^{(l)}\) of MHA in Eq. (7) is available due to the fact that the weight matrix \(\mathbf{W}_{o}^{(l)}\) is positioned at the end of MHA. Similarly, the re-parameterization of FFN is \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{re-param}}^{\mathrm{FFN}}=\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{FC2}}^{(l)} \mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{HTA}}^{(l)}\) due to the weight matrix \(\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{FC2}}^{(l)}\) at the tail of FFN.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we present the experimental settings, comparison to existing solutions, and ablation studies to unveil the key properties of the proposed method.

### Experimental settings

**Datasets.** We evaluated the effectiveness of our method using two sets of visual adaptation benchmarks: FGVC and VTAB-1k, involving a total of 24 datasets. The FGVC collection consists of five Fine-Grained Visual Classification (FGVC) datasets: CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Oxford Flowers, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars. These datasets focus on distinguishing between visually similar subcategories within a broader category, making the task more challenging and detailed. The VTAB-1k benchmark comprises 19 diverse visual classification tasks, divided into three categories: Natural, which includes images captured by standard cameras; Specialized, which includes images captured by specialized equipment such as remote sensing and medical imaging devices; and Structured, which includes synthesized images from simulated environments, such as object counting and 3D depth prediction. Each VTAB-1k task includes 1,000 training samples.

Pre-trained backbones.We employ ViT [13] and Swin Transformer [14] as backbone architectures to evaluate our proposed approach. To demonstrate the versatility of the proposed HTA model, we utilize two variants of ViT: ViT-Base and ViT-Large. These models are pre-trained on the ImageNet21K dataset [11]. Additionally, to ensure a fair comparison, we follow the settings from previous work [29] and conduct separate experiments using a ViT backbone enhanced with AugReg [34].

Baselines and existing PEFT methods.In our comparative analysis, we evaluate the performance of our HTA against two baselines and several state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Unless otherwise specified, our HTA follows the design in Eq. (6), with the dimension of the low-rank adaptation matrix set to 1. The two baselines we consider are: (1) Full Fine-tuning: This baseline involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained model using the training data of the downstream task. (2) Linear Probing: This baseline focuses on learning a linear classification head on the downstream task while keeping the remaining parameters of the pre-trained model frozen. In addition to the baselines, we compare our method with the following state-of-the-art solutions: Adapter [22], Bias [23], LoRA [1], VPT [24], AdaptFormer [2], FacT [26], ARC [3] and RLRR [29]. The results are presented in Table 1 and Table 2.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

Experiments on larger-scale ViT backbone.

In addition to using the ViT-B backbone, we also employed the ViT-L backbone, which has a deeper block structure, to validate the scalability and generalizability of our method. The comparison results are shown in Table 3. Our method achieves the best performance among all the compared methods while maintaining a reasonable parameter count. These results demonstrate that our method can effectively adapt models of varying scales and complexities in an efficient manner.

Experiments on hierarchical Vision Transformers.To further validate the effectiveness of our method, we tested it on the Swin Transformer [14]. The Swin Transformer is renowned for its hierarchical design, consisting of multiple stages, each with transformer blocks that maintain consistent feature dimensions unique to that stage. As shown in Table 4, our method notably outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods across various downstream tasks, with an overall improvement of 1.2% over the previous best performance while using only half of the parameters.

### Ablation studies

To gain deeper insights into the proposed method, we conducted comprehensive ablation studies to elucidate its critical features and carry out pertinent analyses.

Using HTA as alternative to low-rank based adaptation matrix.As mentioned earlier, our proposed HTA model offers a more flexible adaptation capacity compared to other low-rank based adaptation matrices. To validate this claim, we replaced the adaptation matrices of LoRA [1] and Adaptor [22] with HTA. Initially, following FacT [26], LoRA [1] was originally applied to the \(\{\mathbf{W}_{q},\mathbf{W}_{v}\}\) projection matrices in the multi-head attention operation of each ViT layer, while Adapter was applied to the feed-forward neural network components layer-wise, as described in Eq. (2). For

a fair comparison, we also applied HTA separately to \(\{\mathbf{W}_{q},\mathbf{W}_{v}\}\) and \(\{\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{FC1}},\mathbf{W}_{\mathrm{FC2}}\}\). From the results in Table 5, we observe that our method slightly outperforms LoRA but with significantly fewer parameters. Moreover, our method achieves significant improvement over Adapter still using much fewer parameters. These results indicate that our method achieves a better trade-off between adaptation performance and parameter efficiency. To further test the effectiveness of our method when using a similar parameter scale to LoRA, we additionally applied HTA to FFN layers. The results show that under the same parameter size, our method exhibits a noticeable improvement over LoRA.

Ablation study on the bottleneck dimensionality of additive adaptation matrix in HTA.We conducted ablation experiments to verify the effect of incorporating low-rank adaptation matrices in HTA, as well as the impact of its bottleneck dimensionality. The results are presented in Fig. 2. From these results, we observe that without the addition of low-rank adaptation, HTA experiences an obvious performance drop. This is due to the fact that while deriving orthogonal matrices using Householder transformations is parameter-efficient, their inherent dependence on a single chosen vector makes them insufficient as a set of general orthogonal bases for representing arbitrary high-dimensional space. When using a low-rank adaptation matrix with rank 1, HTA shows a significant performance boost. This indicates that even with a simple low-rank adaptation, HTA can achieve a promising trade-off between adaptation performance and parameter efficiency. By incorporating these low-rank matrices, HTA can maintain high performance while being parameter-efficient.

## 5 Limitations

In this work, we use Householder transformations to construct adaptation matrices in a parameter-efficient manner. Although Householder transformation matrices are orthogonal, they cannot serve as general orthogonal bases in high-dimensional spaces due to their inherent dependence on a single vector. This limitation may reduce the adaptation capacity of the adaptation matrix composed of two Householder matrices. We address this issue by incorporating a rank-1 adaptation matrix, which may somewhat detract from the elegance of the proposed method. However, it is worth exploring strategies to eliminate the need for the additive adaptation matrix, thereby further enhancing the elegance and efficiency of the HTA method.

Conclusions

In this work, we proposed a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) solution. Our method addresses the limitation of fixed bottleneck dimensionality in low-rank based adaptation matrices, which can restrict adaptation flexibility. By viewing the adaptation matrix from the perspective of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), we use Householder transformations to mimic orthogonal bases. These transformations, derived from a single vector, are highly parameter-efficient. We adaptively learn diagonal coefficients to flexibly combine two Householder matrices into an adaptation matrix, accommodating layer-wise variations. Theoretically, our method can generate adaptation matrices with varying ranks while maintaining a reasonable parameter size, offering a potential alternative to low-rank based adaptations. Experiments on two sets of downstream vision classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Detailed dataset statistic

We provide detailed information about the datasets used in this paper, including the number of classes and the sizes of the training, validation, and test sets, in Table 1 (FGVC) and Table 2 (VTAB-1k).The FGVC datasets include CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Oxford Flowers, Stanford Dogs, and Stanford Cars, which are used for fine-grained classification tasks of birds, flowers, dogs, and cars, respectively. The VTAB-1k datasets cover natural, specialized, and structured tasks, including natural image datasets such as CIFAR-100, Caltech101, DTD, Flowers102, Pets, SVHN, and Sun397; specialized image datasets such as Patch Camelyon, EuroSAT, Resisc45, and Retinopathy; and structured image datasets such as Clevr/count, Clevr/distance, DMLab, KITTI/distance, dSprites/location, dSprites/orientation, SmallNORB/azimuth, and SmallNORB/elevation. Detailed information about these datasets is presented in the tables.

## Appendix B Hyper-parameters in our work

Table 3 provides a summary of the configurations used in our experiments. As discussed in Section 4, we performed a grid search on the validation set of each task to determine the optimal hyperparameters, including learning rate, weight decay, batch size, and dropout rate.

## Appendix C Experimental details on larger-scale and hierarchical ViT backbones

Table 4 and 5 respectively display the comprehensive results of the comparison conducted in Section 4 among ViT-Large and Swin-Base models.

## Appendix D Experimental details on ablation study

We provide further explanation of the ablation experiments in Section 4. In the study on the transferability of HTA, we replaced the low-rank adaptation matrices in LoRA, we used an HTA module to replace the bottleneck part of LoRA, while in Adapter, we directly replaced the Adapter with an HTA module. The detailed experimental results are presented in the table 6. In the study of the low-rank adaptation part of HTA, we set its dimensions to 0, 1, 2, and 4, respectively. The results are shown in Table 7.

## Appendix E Broader impacts

Practicality: Our approach differs from traditional methods by employing Householder transformations rather than standard unitary matrices, which can be efficiently derived. This approach boosts the efficiency of parameter usage and significantly cuts down on the number of parameters requiring fine-tuning. With this technique, we manage to achieve high performance while optimizing parameter use. Leveraging large-scale pre-trained models, our HTA method proves to be both highly efficient and practical across diverse applications.

Low Energy Consumption: Our approach enhances the model's computational efficiency by decreasing the necessary computational parameters, thus reducing energy usage during training. This reduction aids in conserving energy and lowering emissions, aligning with global sustainability goals and the push for eco-friendly practices. Moreover, our method not only improves the model's

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Abstract and Introduction Section 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: Our work does not involve specific theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide supplementary materials involving statistical datasets, detailed hyper-parameters of model settings. And also we provide complete code, datasets and models at the anonymous link https://drive.google.com/file/d/18sXhtqMlKZd4_LRICk2NvSlKiFiHrG2d/view?. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide supplementary materials involving statistical datasets, detailed hyper-parameters of model settings. And also we provide complete code, datasets and models at the anonymous link https://drive.google.com/file/d/18sXhtaMlKZd4_LRICk2NvSlKiFiHrG2d/view?. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyper-parameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see our supplementary materials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve specific error bars. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our paper conforms the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Appendix Section E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The license and terms of use explicitly are mentioned and properly respected. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
