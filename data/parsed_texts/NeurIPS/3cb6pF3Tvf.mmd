###### Abstract

In this paper, we study learning-augmented algorithms for the Bahncard problem. The Bahncard problem is a generalization of the ski-rental problem, where a traveler needs to irrevocably and repeatedly decide between a cheap short-term solution and an expensive long-term one with an unknown future. Even though the problem is canonical, only a primal-dual-based learning-augmented algorithm was explicitly designed for it. We develop a new learning-augmented algorithm, named PFSUM, that incorporates both history and short-term future to improve online decision making. We derive the competitive ratio of PFSUM as a function of the prediction error and conduct extensive experiments to show that PFSUM outperforms the primal-dual-based algorithm.

## 1 Introduction

The Bahncard is a railway pass of the German railway company, which provides a discount on all train tickets for a fixed time period of pass validity. When a travel request arises, a traveler can buy the train ticket with the regular price, or purchase a Bahncard first and get entitled to a discount on all train tickets within its valid time. The Bahncard problem is an _online_ cost minimization problem, whose objective is to minimize the overall cost of pass and ticket purchases, without knowledge of future travel requests [1]. It reveals a _recurring_ renting-or-buying phenomenon, where an online algorithm needs to irrevocably and repeatedly decide between a cheap short-term solution and an expensive long-term one with an unknown future. The performance of an online algorithm is typically measured by the _competitive ratio_, which is the worst-case ratio across all inputs between the costs of the online algorithm and an optimal offline one [2].

Recently, there has been growing interest in using machine-learned predictions to improve online algorithms. One seminal work was done by Lykouris and Vassilvitskii [3] for the caching problem, in which the online algorithms are allowed to leverage predictions of future inputs to make decisions, but they are not given any guarantee on the prediction accuracy. Since then, the framework of online algorithms with predictions has been extensively studied for a wide range of problems including ski-rental [4, 5, 6, 7, 8], scheduling [9, 10], graph optimization [11], covering [12, 13], data structures [14, 15, 16], etc. In this framework, the measurements for the online algorithms include _consistency_ and _robustness_, where the former refers to the competitive ratio under perfect predictions while the latter refers to the upper bound of the competitive ratio when the predictions can be arbitrarily bad.

The Bahncard problem with machine-learned predictions was recently studied by Bamas et al. [12]. They designed a primal-dual-based algorithm assuming given a prediction of the optimal solution, i.e., an optimal collection of times to purchase Bahncards such that the total cost is minimized. While Bamas et al. [12] presented an elegant framework for seamlessly integrating the primal-dual method with a predicted solution, their approach faces three critical issues. First, their considered scenario is limited, involving slotted time and a fixed ticket price of \(1\) for any travel request. The discretization is necessary for them to formulate an integer program and enable the application of the primal-dualmethod proposed by Buchbinder et al. [17]. Second, their results of consistency and robustness are weak in that they only hold under the condition that the cost of a Bahncard goes towards infinity, in which case the optimal solution is to never buy any Bahncard. Last, their algorithm demands a complete solution as input advice, which implies a predicted _complete_ sequence of travel requests over an arbitrarily long timespan, which is impractical for real employment.

In this paper, we study the Bahncard problem with machine-learned predictions, adopting a different technical perspective. We address the general scenario where travel requests may arise at any time with diverse ticket prices. We develop an algorithm, named PFSUM, which takes short-term predictions on future trips as inputs. We derive its competitive ratio under any prediction error that is naturally defined as the difference between the predicted and true values. To present our results, we introduce several notations. The Bahncard problem is instantiated by three parameters and denoted by \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,T)\), meaning that a Bahncard costs \(C\), reduces any (regular) ticket price \(p\) to \(\beta p\) for some \(0\leq\beta<1\), and is valid for a time period of \(T\). When \(\beta=0\) and \(T\to\infty\), the Bahncard problem reduces to the well-known ski-rental problem. Following the definition in [3; 4], we take the competitive ratio of a learning-augmented online algorithm ALG as a function \(\texttt{CR}_{\texttt{\small ALG}}(\eta)\) of the prediction error \(\eta\). ALG is _\(\delta\)-consistent_ if \(\texttt{CR}_{\texttt{\small ALG}}(0)=\delta\), and _\(\vartheta\)-robust_ if \(\texttt{CR}_{\texttt{\small ALG}}(\eta)\leq\vartheta\) for all \(\eta\).

At any time \(t\) when a travel request arises and there is no a valid Bahncard, a prediction on the total (regular) ticket price of all travel requests in the upcoming interval \([t,t+T)\) is made. Incorporating this prediction, PFSUM purchases a Bahncard at time \(t\) when (i) the total ticket price in the past interval \((t-T,t]\) is at least \(\gamma\) and (ii) the predicted total ticket price in \([t,t+T)\) is also at least \(\gamma\), where \(\gamma:=C/(1-\beta)\). Denoting by \(\eta\) the maximum prediction error, we derive that

\[\texttt{CR}_{\texttt{\small PFSUM}}(\eta)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2 \gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\gamma)+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (1)

The result shows that PFSUM is \(2/(1+\beta)\)-consistent and \(1/\beta\)-robust, and its competitive ratio degrades smoothly as the prediction error increases. We also share our experience in the design of PFSUM with some interesting observations.

## 2 Related Work

**The Bahncard problem.** Fleischer [1] was the first to study the Bahncard problem. By extending the optimal \(2\)-competitive break-even algorithm for ski-rental, he proposed an optimal \((2-\beta)\)-competitive deterministic algorithm named SUM for \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,T)\). He also proposed a randomized algorithm named RAND for \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,\infty)\), and proved that it is \(e/(e-1+\beta)\)-competitive. He conjectured that RAND keeps the same competitiveness for \(T<\infty\). Karlin et al. [18] designed a randomized online algorithm for TCP acknowledgement and applied it to \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,T)\) with the conjecture settled positively. In addition, the Bahncard problem was extended to several realistic problems in computer systems such as bandwidth cost minimization [19], cloud instance reservation [20], and data migration [21]. Notably, Wang et al. [20] designed algorithms incorporating short-term predictions about the future for reserving virtual machine instances in clouds, which brings inspiration to our algorithm design.

**Learning-augmented algorithms.** Learning-augmented algorithms aim to leverage machine-learned predictions to improve the performance in both theory and practice [22]. Algorithms using possibly imperfect predictions have found applications in numerous important problems [4; 5; 6; 7; 9; 10; 11; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27]. See https://algorithms-with-predictions.github.io/ for a comprehensive collection of the literature.

To our knowledge, the only learning-augmented algorithms specifically designed for the Bahncard problem were developed by Bamas et al. [12] and Drygala et al. [28]. Bamas et al. [12] proposed an algorithm, named PDLA, which is \(\lambda/(1-\beta+\lambda\beta)\cdot(e^{\lambda}-\beta)/(e^{\lambda}-1)\)-consistent and \((e^{\lambda}-\beta)/(e^{\lambda}-1)\)-robust when \(C\to\infty\), where \(\lambda\in(0,1]\) is a hyper-parameter of the algorithm. Their method, as previously discussed, is limited to scenarios with slotted time and uniform ticket prices for all travel requests. Our approach significantly differs from [12]. First, we address the general scenario where travel requests can arise at any time and feature varied ticket prices. Second, our algorithm utilizes short-term predictions provided at the times when travel requests are made, in contrast to their method which requires predicting a complete solution. We experimentally compare our algorithm with that of [12] in Section 5. Drygala et al. [28] focused on how many predictions are required to gather enough information to output a near-optimal Bahncard purchasing schedule, assuming all predictions are correct. The learning-augmented algorithm proposed takes a suggested sequence of buying times as input and assumes a slotted time setting, thereby sharing similar drawbacks to [12].

Im et al. [26] explored a somewhat related TCP acknowledgement problem with machine-learned predictions. They introduced a new prediction error measure designed to assess how much the optimal objective value changes as the difference between actual requests and predicted requests varies. A detailed comparison between our work and [26] is provided in Appendix A.1 of [29].

## 3 Preliminaries

We adhere to the notations coined by Fleischer [1]. \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,T)\) with \(C>0\), \(T>0\), and \(0\leq\beta<1\) is a request-answer game between an online algorithm ALG and an _adversary_ (see, e.g., [30]). The adversary presents a finite sequence of travel requests \(\sigma=\sigma_{1}\sigma_{2}\cdots\), where each \(\sigma_{i}\) is a tuple \((t_{i},p_{i})\) that contains the travel time \(t_{i}\geq 0\) and the regular ticket price \(p_{i}\geq 0\). The travel requests are presented in chronological order: \(0\leq t_{1}<t_{2}<\cdots\).

ALG needs to react to each travel request \(\sigma_{i}\). If ALG does not have a valid Bahncard, it can opt to buy the ticket with the regular price \(p_{i}\), or first purchase a Bahncard which costs \(C\), and then pay the ticket price with a \(\beta\)-discount, i.e., \(\beta p_{i}\). A Bahncard purchased at time \(t\) is valid during the time interval \([t,t+T)\). Note that a travel request arising at time \(t+T\) does not benefit from the Bahncard purchased at time \(t\). We say \(\sigma_{i}\) is a _reduced request_ of ALG if ALG has a valid Bahncard at time \(t_{i}\). Otherwise, \(\sigma_{i}\) is a _regular request_ of ALG. We use ALG\((\sigma_{i})\) to denote ALG's cost on \(\sigma_{i}\):

\[\textsf{ALG}(\sigma_{i})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\beta p_{i}&\textsf{ ALG has a valid Bahncard at }t_{i},\\ p_{i}&\text{otherwise}.\end{array}\right.\]

We denote by ALG\((\sigma)\) the total cost of ALG for reacting to all the travel requests in \(\sigma\). The competitive ratio of ALG is defined by \(\textsf{CR}_{\textsf{ALG}}:=\max_{\sigma}\textsf{ALG}(\sigma)/\textsf{OPT}(\sigma)\), where OPT is an optimal offline algorithm for \(\text{BP}(C,\beta,T)\). We use ALG\((\sigma;\mathcal{I})\) to denote the partial cost incurred during a time interval \(\mathcal{I}\): \(\textsf{ALG}(\sigma;\mathcal{I})=C\cdot x+\sum_{i:t_{i}\in\mathcal{I}}\textsf {ALG}(\sigma_{i})\), where \(x\) is the number of Bahncards purchased by ALG in \(\mathcal{I}\). Additionally, we use \(c(\sigma;\mathcal{I})\) to denote the total regular cost in \(\mathcal{I}\): \(c(\sigma;\mathcal{I}):=\sum_{i:t_{i}\in\mathcal{I}}p_{i}\). Given a time length \(l\), we define the _\(l\)-term-cost_ of \(\sigma\) at time \(t\) as \(c(\sigma;(t-l,t])\). Similarly, we define the _\(l\)-future-cost_ of \(\sigma\) at time \(t\) as \(c(\sigma;[t,t+l))\). In our design, we assume that when a travel request \((t,p)\) arises, a short-term prediction of the total regular cost in the time interval \([t,t+T)\) can be made. To represent prediction errors, we use \(\dot{c}(\sigma;[t,t+T))\) to denote the predicted total regular cost in \([t,t+T)\). Sometimes we are concerned about the regular requests of an algorithm ALG in a recent time interval. Thus, we further define the _regular \(l\)-recent-cost_ of ALG on \(\sigma\) at time \(t\) as

\[\textsf{ALG}^{r}\big{(}\sigma;(t-l,t]\big{)}:=\sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}i: \sigma_{i}\text{ is a regular request of }\textsf{ALG in }(t-l,t]\end{subarray}}p_{i}.\]

Without loss of generality, we assume that an online algorithm ALG or an optimal offline algorithm OPT considers purchasing Bahncards at the times of regular requests _only_. The rationale is that the purchase of a Bahncard at any other time can always be delayed to the next regular request without increasing the total cost.

**Lemma 3.1**.: _[_1_]_ _For any time \(t\), if \(c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}\geq\gamma:=C/(1-\beta)\), OPT has at least one reduced request in \([t,t+T)\). The same holds for the time interval \((t,t+T]\)._

\(\gamma\) is known as the break-even point, i.e., the threshold to purchase a Bahncard at time \(t\) for minimizing the cost incurred in the time interval \([t,t+T)\).

**Corollary 3.2**.: _At any time \(t\), if the \(T\)-future-cost \(c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}<\gamma\), OPT does not purchase a Bahncard at \(t\)._

An optimal deterministic online algorithm for the Bahncard problem is SUM, which is \((2-\beta)\)-competitive [1]. SUM purchases a Bahncard at a regular request \((t,p)\) whenever its regular \(T\)-recent-cost at time \(t\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e., \(\textsf{SUM}^{r}\big{(}\sigma;(t-T,t]\big{)}\geq\gamma\).

Learning-Augmented Algorithms for the Bahncard Problem

### Initial Attempt

The \(\mathsf{SUM}\) algorithm developed in [1] purchases a Bahncard based on the cost incurred in the past only. It is likely that there is no further travel request in the valid time of the Bahncard besides the request at the purchasing time. Our initial attempt is an adaptation of the \(A_{\gamma}^{w}\) algorithm proposed in [20]. Aiming to save cost, the \(A_{\gamma}^{w}\) algorithm shifts the cost consideration for Bahncard purchasing towards the future with the help of predictions. That is, a Bahncard is purchased based on a combination of the actual cost incurred in the past and the predicted cost in the future. We name the adaptation of \(A_{\gamma}^{w}\) to the Bahncard problem as \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\).1 Specifically, at each regular request \((t,p)\), \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) predicts the total regular cost in a prediction window \((t,t+w]\) where \(w\)\((0<w<T)\) is the length of the prediction window. \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) purchases a Bahncard at a regular request \((t,p)\) whenever the sum of the regular \((T-w)\)-recent-cost at \(t\) and the predicted total regular cost in \((t,t+w]\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

Footnote 1: Wang et al. [20] studied a restricted setting where time is slotted into hours and purchases are performed only at the beginning of slots because virtual machine instances in clouds are billed in an hourly manner.

\[\mathsf{SUM}_{w}^{r}\big{(}\sigma;(t+w-T,t]\big{)}+\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;(t,t+ w]\big{)}\geq\gamma.\] (2)

Note that \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) reduces to \(\mathsf{SUM}\) when \(w=0\).

Unfortunately, \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) is not a good algorithm for using machine-learned predictions. We find that its consistency is at least \((3-\beta)/(1+\beta)\), which is even larger than \(\mathsf{SUM}\)'s competitive ratio of \(2-\beta\) since \(\beta<1\). We construct a travel request sequence to show the consistency result in Appendix A.2 of [29]. Moreover, \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) does not have any bounded robustness. Consider another example where only one travel request \((t,p)\) arises with \(p\to 0\), but the predictor yields \(\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;(t,t+w]\big{)}\geq\gamma\). Then, \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) purchases a Bahncard at \((t,p)\). Thus, we have \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}(\sigma)/\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma)=(C+\beta p)/p\to\infty\).

\(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) fails because if a Bahncard is purchased at time \(t\), it is possible that most of the ticket cost in the interval \((t+w-T,t+w]\) is incurred before \(t\). Consequently, only a small fraction of the ticket cost is incurred from \(t\) onward and can benefit from the Bahncard purchased. As a result, \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) suffers from the same deficiency as \(\mathsf{SUM}\). We remark that it is not helpful to set the prediction window length \(w\) to \(T\) or even larger values, because the travel request arising at (or beyond) time \(t+T\) (if any) is not covered by the Bahncard purchased at time \(t\).

### Second Attempt

What we have learned from \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) is that the Bahncard purchase condition should not be based on the total ticket cost in a past time interval and a future prediction window. Thus, our second algorithm \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) (Future \(\mathsf{SUM}\)) is designed to purchase a Bahncard at a regular request \((t,p)\) whenever the predicted \(T\)-future-cost at time \(t\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}\geq\gamma.\] (3)

Note that \(\mathsf{FSUM}\neq\mathsf{SUM}_{T}\) because the Bahncard purchase condition of \(\mathsf{SUM}_{T}\) is \(\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;(t,t+T]\big{)}\geq\gamma\).

**Theorem 4.1**.: _FSUM is \(2/(1+\beta)\)-consistent._

The proof is given in Appendix A.3 of [29]. \(\mathsf{FSUM}\)'s consistency is generally better than \(\mathsf{SUM}\)'s competitive ratio since \(2/(1+\beta)<2-\beta\) always holds for \(0<\beta<1\). However, similar to \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\), \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) does not have any bounded robustness. Consider again the example where only one travel request \((t,p)\) arises with \(p\to 0\), but the predictor yields \(\hat{c}(\sigma;[t,t+T))\geq\gamma\). Then, \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard at \((t,p)\) and \(\mathsf{FSUM}(\sigma)/\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma)=(C+\beta p)/p\to\infty\).

### \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) Algorithm

\(\mathsf{FSUM}\) fails to achieve any bounded robustness because it completely ignores the historical information in the Bahncard purchase condition. Thus, the worst case is that the actual ticket cost in the prediction window is close to \(0\), while the predictor forecasts that it exceeds \(\gamma\), in which case hardly anything benefits from the Bahncard purchased. On the other hand, we note that \(\mathsf{SUM}\) achieves a decent competitive ratio because a Bahncard is purchased only when the regular \(T\)-recent-cost is at least \(\gamma\), so that the Bahncard cost can be charged to the regular \(T\)-recent-cost in the competitive analysis. Motivated by this observation, we introduce a new algorithm PFSUM (Past and Future SUM), in which the Bahncard purchase condition incorporates the ticket costs in both a past time interval and a future prediction window, but uses them _separately_ rather than taking their sum. PFSUM purchases a Bahncard at a regular request \((t,p)\) whenever (i) the \(T\)-recent-cost at \(t\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e., \(c(\sigma;(t-T,t])\geq\gamma\), and (ii) the predicted \(T\)-future-cost at \(t\) is also at least \(\gamma\), i.e., \(\hat{c}(\sigma;[t,t+T))\geq\gamma\). Note that the first condition is different from the condition for SUM to purchase a Bahncard: PFSUM considers the \(T\)-recent-cost, but SUM considers only the regular \(T\)-recent-cost. The rationale is that by definition, the regular \(T\)-recent-cost is not covered by any Bahncard, so requiring it to be at least \(\gamma\) for Bahncard purchase would make the algorithm less effective in saving cost. Compared with FSUM, though PFSUM has an additional condition for purchasing the Bahncard, it is somewhat surprising that PFSUM achieves the same consistency of \(2/(1+\beta)\) as FSUM, as shown below.

Given a travel request sequence \(\sigma\), we use \(\mu_{1}<\dots<\mu_{m}\) to denote the times when PFSUM purchases Bahncards. Accordingly, the timespan can be divided into epochs \(E_{j}:=[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+1})\) for \(0\leq j\leq m\), where we define \(\mu_{0}=0\) and \(\mu_{m+1}=\infty\). Each epoch \(E_{j}\) (except \(E_{0}\)) starts with an _on_ phase \([\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T)\) (the valid time of the Bahncard purchased by PFSUM), followed by an _off_ phase \([\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\) (in which there is no valid Bahncard by PFSUM). Epoch \(E_{0}\) has an off phase only. We define \(\eta\) as the maximum prediction error among all the predictions used by PFSUM:

\[\eta:=\max_{(t,p)\text{ is a regular request}}\big{|}\hat{c}\big{(} \sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}-c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}\big{|}\,.\] (4)

Then, for any travel request \((t,p)\) in an off phase, we have

\[c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}-\eta\leq\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T )\big{)}\leq c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}+\eta.\] (5)

The following lemmas will be used frequently in the competitive analysis of PFSUM.

**Lemma 4.2**.: _The total regular cost in an on phase is at least \(\gamma-\eta\)._

Proof.: If \(c(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))<\gamma-\eta\) for some \(j\), it follows from (5) that \(\hat{c}(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))\leq c(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))+\eta< \gamma-\eta+\eta=\gamma\), which means that PFSUM would not purchase a Bahncard at time \(\mu_{j}\), leading to a contradiction. Thus, we must have \(c(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))\geq\gamma-\eta\). 

**Lemma 4.3**.: _In an off phase, the total regular cost in any time interval \([t,t+l)\) of length \(l\leq T\) is less than \(2\gamma+\eta\)._

Proof.: Assume on the contrary that \(c(\sigma;[t,t+l))\geq 2\gamma+\eta\). We take the earliest travel request \((t^{\prime},p)\) in \([t,t+l)\) such that \(c(\sigma;[t,t^{\prime}])\geq\gamma\). This implies \(c(\sigma;[t,t^{\prime}))<\gamma\). Then, we have \(c(\sigma;[t^{\prime},t+l))=c(\sigma;[t,t+l))-c(\sigma;[t,t^{\prime}))>2\gamma+ \eta-\gamma=\gamma+\eta\). Hence, \(c(\sigma;(t^{\prime}-T,t^{\prime}))\geq c(\sigma;[t,t^{\prime}])\geq\gamma\) and \(c(\sigma;[t^{\prime},t^{\prime}+T))\geq c(\sigma;[t^{\prime},t+l))>\gamma+\eta\). By (5), the latter further leads to \(\hat{c}(\sigma;[t^{\prime},t^{\prime}+T))\geq c(\sigma;[t^{\prime},t^{\prime}+ T))-\eta>\gamma\), which means that PFSUM should purchase a Bahncard at time \(t^{\prime}\), contradicting that \(t^{\prime}\in[t,t+l)\) is in the off phase. Hence, \(c(\sigma;[t,t+T))<2\gamma+\eta\) must hold. 

**Lemma 4.4**.: _Suppose a time interval \([t,t+T)\) overlaps with an off phase. Among the total regular cost in \([t,t+T)\), let \(s_{2}\), \(s_{3}\) and \(s_{4}\) denote those in the preceding on phase, the off phase, and the succeeding on phase respectively (see Figure 1). If \(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\), \(s_{2}\leq\gamma\) and \(s_{4}\leq\gamma\), then the total regular cost in \([t,t+T)\) is no more than \(2\gamma+\eta\), i.e., \(s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta\)._

Proof.: Assume on the contrary that \(s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{4}>2\gamma+\eta\). Then, \(s_{3}>0\) and hence there is at least one travel request during the off phase. We take the earliest travel request \((t^{\prime},p)\) in the off phase, such that \(c(\sigma;[t,t^{\prime}])\geq\gamma\). With a similar analysis to Lemma 4.3, we can derive that PFSUM should purchase a Bahncard at time \(t^{\prime}\), contradicting that \(t^{\prime}\) is in the off phase.

Figure 1: Illustration for Lemma 4.4. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

We adopt a divide-and-conquer approach to analyze PFSUM. Specifically, we focus on the time intervals in which at least one of PFSUM and OPT has a valid Bahncard, and analyze the cost ratio between PFSUM and OPT in these intervals. Consider a maximal contiguous time interval throughout which at least one of PFSUM and OPT has a valid Bahncard. As shown in Figure 2, there are 6 different patterns. If OPT and PFSUM purchase a Bahncard at the same time, the time interval is exactly an on phase (Pattern I), and the cost ratio in it is \(1\) (Proposition 4.5). Otherwise, there are 5 different cases: the time interval does not overlap with any on phase (Pattern II); and the time interval overlaps with at least one on phase - it can start at some time in an on or off phase and end at some time in an on or off phase, giving rise to four cases (Patterns III to VI). In Patterns II to VI, we assume that none of the involved Bahncards purchased by OPT are bought at the same time as any Bahncards purchased by PFSUM.

**Proposition 4.5**.: (Pattern I) _If OPT purchases a Bahncard at time \(\tau_{i}\) at the beginning of epoch \(E_{j}\), i.e., \(\tau_{i}=\mu_{j}\), then_

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))}{\textsf{OPT}( \sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T))}=1.\] (6)

Apparently, if the cost ratios between PFSUM and OPT of Patterns II to VI are all capped by the same bound, the competitive ratio of PFSUM is given by this bound. Unfortunately, this is _not_ exactly true. In what follows, we show that the cost ratios of Patterns II to V can be capped by the same bound (Propositions 4.6 and 4.7), which is the competitive ratio of PFSUM that we would like to prove. For Pattern VI, we show that its cost ratio is capped by the same bound if a particular condition holds, where we refer to such Pattern VI as _augmented_ Pattern VI (Proposition 4.8). For non-augmented Pattern VI, we show that it must be accompanied by Patterns I to IV in the sense that a time interval of non-augmented Pattern VI must be preceded (not necessarily immediately) by a time interval of Pattern I, II, III or IV. We prove that the cost ratio of non-augmented Pattern VI combined with such Pattern I, II, III or IV is capped by the same aforesaid bound (Propositions 4.9 and 4.10). This then concludes that PFSUM's competitive ratio is given by this bound.

**Proposition 4.6**.: (Pattern II) _If OPT purchases a Bahncard at time \(\tau_{i}\) in the off phase of an epoch \(E_{j}\) and the Bahncard expires in the same off phase, i.e., \(\mu_{j}+T\leq\tau_{i}<\tau_{i}+T<\mu_{j+1}\), then_

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i}+T))}{\textsf{OPT}( \sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i}+T))}<\frac{2\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\] (7)

Proof.: Let \(x=c(\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i}+T))\). Based on the definition of Pattern II, OPT\((\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i}+T))=C+\beta x\) (OPT buys a card at \(\tau_{i}\)) and PFSUM\((\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i}+T))=x\) (PFSUM does not buy cards during any off phase). Hence, the cost ratio is \(\frac{x}{C+\beta x}\), which increases with \(x\) since \(\beta<1\). By Lemma 4.3, \(x<2\gamma+\eta\). Thus, the cost ratio is bounded by \(\frac{2\gamma+\eta}{C+\beta(2\gamma+\eta)}=\frac{2\gamma+\eta}{(1-\beta)\gamma +\beta(2\gamma+\eta)}=\frac{2\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}\). 

Figure 2: All the 6 patterns of concerned time intervals in which either PFSUM or OPT has a Bahncard. In Patterns III to VI, \(x\) is the number of Bahncards purchased by OPT in an on phase and expiring in the next on phase. \(x\) can be any non-negative integer.

The proof technique of the following propositions for Patterns III to VI is to divide the time interval concerned into sub-intervals, where each sub-interval starts and ends at the time when OPT or PFSUM purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased expires. Then, for \(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\) and \(\eta>\gamma\), we respectively derive the upper bound of the cost ratio based on Lemmas 4.2 to 4.4. All the bounds in Propositions 4.7 to 4.8 are tight (achievable). Detailed proofs are given in Appendixes A.4 to A.5 of [29].

**Proposition 4.7**.: (Patterns III to V) _The cost ratio in the time interval of Patterns III, IV, and V is bounded by_

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta) \gamma+\delta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\delta\eta}&\eta>\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (8)

We refer to Pattern VI as _augmented_ Pattern VI if the total regular cost in the last on phase involved is at least \(\gamma\). Proposition 4.8 shows that the cost ratio of augmented Pattern VI is capped by the same bound as Patterns III to V.

**Proposition 4.8**.: (Augmented Pattern VI) _Denote by \(\mu_{j}\) and \(\mu_{j+x}\) respectively the first and last Bahncards purchased by PFSUM in Pattern VI. If the total regular cost in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\) is at least \(\gamma\), the cost ratio in the time interval of Pattern VI, i.e., \([\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), is bounded by (8)._

We remark that the cost ratio of general Pattern VI cannot be capped by the same bound as Patterns III to V. This is because in Pattern VI, PFSUM purchases one more Bahncard than OPT and hence has a higher cost of card purchases, whereas PFSUM purchases less or equal numbers of Bahncards compared to OPT in Patterns III to V. Thus, an additional condition is necessary in Proposition 4.8.

Next, we examine non-augmented Pattern VI. Note that the time intervals of Patterns V and VI cannot exist in isolation. By the definition of PFSUM, when a Bahncard is purchased at time \(\mu_{j}\), the total regular cost in the preceding interval \((\mu_{j}-T,\mu_{j}]\) is at least \(\gamma\) (referred to as feature \(\diamond\)). Consequently, by Lemma 3.1, OPT must purchase a Bahncard whose valid time overlaps with \((\mu_{j}-T,\mu_{j}]\). To deal with non-augmented Pattern VI that starts at time \(\mu_{j}\) for some \(j\), we backtrack from \(\mu_{j}\) to find out what happens earlier. Our target is to identify all possible patterns that might precede Pattern VI.

Note that the time interval \((\mu_{j}-T,\mu_{j}]\) definitely intersects with the off phase of epoch \(E_{j-1}\) and may also intersect with the on phase of \(E_{j-1}\) (if the off phase of \(E_{j-1}\) is shorter than \(T\)). Therefore, it is possible for all Patterns I to VI to precede Pattern VI (see Figures 3(b) and (c) for illustrations). If Pattern I, IV or VI precedes Pattern VI, there is an off phase in between, in which neither PFSUM nor OPT holds a valid Bahncard. Figure 3(a) presents a _pattern graph_ to illustrate all possible concatenations of patterns preceding Pattern VI. In this graph, a node represents a pattern, and an edge from node \(i\) to node \(j\) means pattern \(i\) can precede pattern \(j\). Since every Pattern V or VI must be preceded by some pattern, the backtracking will always encounter a time interval of Pattern I, II, III or IV. We stop backtracking at the first Pattern I, II, III or IV encountered.

We use \(p_{1}\oplus p_{2}\) to denote the composite of pattern \(p_{1}\) followed by pattern \(p_{2}\); use \(p^{y}\) to denote a sequence comprising \(y\) consecutive instances of pattern \(p\); and use \(\{p_{1},\ldots,p_{n}\}\oplus p_{j}\) to represent all possible composite patterns of the form \(p_{i}\oplus p_{j}\) for each \(i=1,\ldots,n\). Then, the patterns encountered in the backtracking can be represented by

\[\{\text{I,II,III,IV}\}\oplus\{\text{V,VI}\}^{y}\oplus\text{VI},\] (9)

Figure 3: Pattern graph.

where \(y\) can be any non-negative integers. Following the feature \(\diamond\), for each VI in \(\{\mathrm{V},\mathrm{VI}\}^{y}\) of (9), the total regular cost in the last on phase of Pattern VI and the following off phase is at least \(\gamma\). It is easy to see that the cost ratio between PFSUM and OPT in the time interval of such Pattern VI is no larger than that of augmented Pattern VI and hence the upper bound given in Proposition 4.8. For each \(\mathrm{V}\) in \(\{\mathrm{V},\mathrm{VI}\}^{y}\) of (9), the cost ratio of Pattern V is capped by the same bound based on Proposition 4.7. In the following, we prove that the cost ratio of non-augmented Pattern VI combined with Pattern I, II, III or IV at the beginning of (9) is also capped by the same bound.

**Proposition 4.9**.: _The cost ratio in the combination of a time interval of Pattern VI and a time interval of Pattern II or III is bounded by (8)._

Proof Sketch.: Note that in Patterns II and III, PFSUM purchases one less Bahncard than OPT. Recall that in Pattern VI, PFSUM purchases one more Bahncard than OPT. Hence, when considering Pattern VI with Pattern II or III together, PFSUM purchases the same number of Bahncards as OPT. Therefore, we can use the same technique as Proposition 4.7 to cap the cost ratio by the same bound. See Appendix A.6 of [29] for details. 

**Proposition 4.10**.: _The cost ratio in the combination of a time interval of Pattern VI and a time interval of Pattern I or IV encountered in backtracking is bounded by (8)._

Proof Sketch.: Consider Pattern IV. When analyzing the cost ratio of Pattern IV in Proposition 4.7, it is assumed that the total regular cost in the last on phase is at least \(\gamma-\eta\). In IV of (9), following the feature \(\diamond\), the total cost of travel requests in the last on phase of Pattern IV and the following off phase is at least \(\gamma\). Thus, there is an additional cost of at least \(\eta\). Therefore, we can "migrate" an additional cost of \(\eta\) to the non-augmented Pattern VI at the end of (9) and make the latter become an augmented Pattern VI so that the result of Proposition 4.8 can be applied. Meanwhile, the proof of Proposition 4.7 still applies to the Pattern IV even if the cost \(\eta\) is removed from the last on phase. Hence, after migrating the cost of \(\eta\), the Patterns IV and VI involved have the same upper bound of cost ratio given in (8). The proof for Pattern I is similar. See Appendix A.7 of [29] for details. 

By the above analysis and Propositions 4.6 to 4.10, we have:

**Theorem 4.11**.: _PFSUM has a competitive ratio of_

\[\small\texttt{CR}_{\textsf{PFSUM}}(\eta)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2 \gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (10)

By letting \(\eta=0\), it is easy to see that the consistency of PFSUM is \(2/(1+\beta)\). Note that the competitive ratio of (10) is a continuous function of the prediction error \(\eta\). It increases from \(2/(1+\beta)\) to \((4-\beta)/(1+2\beta)\) as \(\eta\) increases from \(0\) to \(\gamma\), and further increases from \((4-\beta)/(1+2\beta)\) towards \(1/\beta\) as \(\eta\) increases from \(\gamma\) towards infinity. Hence, PFSUM is \(1/\beta\)-robust.

## 5 Experiments

We conduct extensive experiments to compare PFSUM with SUM [1], PDLA [12], SUM\({}_{w}\) (Section 4.1), FSUM (Section 4.2), and SRL (Ski-Rental-based Learning algorithm), where SRL is adapted from Algorithm 2 proposed in [4] for ski-rental. SRL performs as follows. Let \(\lambda\in(0,1]\) be a hyper-parameter, SRL purchases a Bahncard at a regular request \((t,p)\) if and only if there exists a time \(t^{\prime}\in(t-T,t]\) that satisfies one of the following conditions: (i) the predicted \(T\)-future-cost at time \(t^{\prime}\) is no less than \(\gamma\), and the total regular cost in \([t^{\prime},t]\) is greater than \(\lambda\gamma\); or (ii) the predicted \(T\)-future-cost at time \(t^{\prime}\) is less than \(\gamma\), and the total regular cost in \([t^{\prime},t]\) is greater than \(\gamma/\lambda\).

We test SUM\({}_{w}\) with \(w=T/2\), and test SRL and PDLA with \(\lambda\) set to \(0.2,0.5\), and \(1\). To accommodate SRL and PDLA, we discretize time over a sufficiently long timespan, closely approximating a continuous time scenario. The experimental results across diverse input instances demonstrate the superior performance of PFSUM.

**Input instances.** Referring to the experimental setup of [31], we consider two main types of traveler profiles: _commuters_, and _occasional travelers_. We set the timespan at 2000 days, during which commuters travel every day. For occasional travelers, there is a time gap between travel requests. We model the inter-request time of occasional travelers using an exponential distribution with a mean of 2. We consider only one travel request per day. This is because multiple travel requests occurringon the same day can be effectively treated as a single request with combined ticket price, since a Bahncard's validity either covers an entire day or does not cover any part of the day.

For each request sequence generated, we investigate three types of ticket price distributions: a Normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a variance of 25, a Uniform distribution centered around a mean of 50, and a Pareto distribution called the Lomax distribution with a shape parameter of 2 and a scale parameter of 50. Our choice of the Pareto distribution stems from the observation that prices of travel requests in the real world often exhibit a heavy tail, which suggests that a minority of travel requests typically account for a significant portion of total cost. Such heavy-tailed distributions are often hypothesized to adhere to some form of Pareto distributions [32, 33].

**Noisy prediction.** The predictions are generated by adding noise to the original instance, following the methodology used by Bamas et al. [12]. Specifically, we introduce a perturbation probability \(p\). For each day in a given instance, with probability \(p\), the travel request on that day is removed, if it exists. Meanwhile, with probability \(p\), we add random noise, sampled from the same distribution used for generating ticket prices, to the price of the travel request, or simply add a travel request if no request exists on that day. These two operations are executed independently. We vary the perturbation probability from 0 to 1 in the experiments. Intuitively, the prediction error increases with the perturbation probability. The predictions needed by SRL, SUM\({}_{w}\), FSUM, and PFSUM are derived from the total regular cost over the specified time period in the perturbed instance. For PDLA, the predicted solution is obtained by executing the offline optimal algorithm on the perturbed instance.

**Results and discussion.** For all types of input instances, the algorithms exhibit similar relative performance. We present in Figures 4 to 7 the results obtained for commuters and occasional travelers when setting \(\beta=0.8\) (or \(0.6\)), \(T=10\) (or \(5\)), \(C=100\), and different ticket price distributions, including the Uniform distribution, the Normal distribution, and the Pareto distribution. Experimental results for other settings are given in Appendix A.8 of [29]. Each curve in the figure represents the average cost ratio between an algorithm and OPT over 100 experiment runs. The shaded area represents the 95% confidence interval of the corresponding curve.

We make the following observations from the experimental results. (1) When predictions are good (perturbation probability is small), PFSUM, FSUM, SUM\({}_{w}\), and SRL all perform better than SUM. This shows that predictions on the ticket prices of short-term future trips are useful for reducing the total cost. With perfect predictions (perturbation probability = 0), in most cases, either PFSUM or

Figure 4: The cost ratios for commuters (\(\beta=0.8\), \(T=10\), \(C=100\)). “U”, “N” and “P” represent Uniform, Normal and Pareto ticket price distributions respectively.

Figure 5: The cost ratios for occasional travelers (\(\beta=0.8\), \(T=10\), \(C=100\)). “U”, “N” and “P” represent Uniform, Normal and Pareto ticket price distributions respectively.

FSUM produces the lowest cost ratio among all algorithms. This empirically confirms that PFSUM and FSUM have better consistency than SUM and SUM\({}_{w}\). (2) PFSUM outperforms all the other algorithms for a wide range of perturbation probability, demonstrating that PFSUM makes wise use of predictions. In general, PFSUM has the narrowest confidence intervals, indicating that its results are the most stable among all algorithms. (3) For the Pareto distribution, as the prediction error increases, PFSUM demonstrates its robustness through a gradual and smooth rise in the cost ratio to OPT. Even when the perturbation probability is large, PFSUM hardly performs worse than SUM. In contrast, the performance of SUM\({}_{w}\) and FSUM deteriorates rapidly with increasing perturbation probability, showing their poor robustness. (4) The primal-dual-based algorithm PDLA generally has much higher cost ratios than PFSUM and even the conventional online algorithm SUM. This shows that it is important to take advantage of the characteristics of the Bahncard (it is valid for a fixed time period only and provides the same discount to all the tickets purchased therein) when designing learning-augmented algorithms. (5) PFSUM consistently outperforms SRL, particularly in scenarios with significant prediction errors. While the performance of SRL improves with increasing \(\lambda\) under high prediction errors, as a larger \(\lambda\) leads to reduced reliance on the predictions and enhances the algorithm's robustness, its overall performance remains inferior to that of SUM.

## 6 Discussions and Conclusions

We have developed a new learning-augmented algorithm called PFSUM for the Bahncard problem. PFSUM makes predictions on the short-term future only, aligning closely with the temporal nature of the Bahncard problem and the practice of real-world ML predictions. We present a comprehensive analysis of PFSUM's competitive ratio under arbitrary prediction errors by a divide-and-conquer approach. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance advantages of PFSUM.

Different from prior works, we do not predict a full sequence of requests from the outset, and predict just a sum of near-future requests (cost) when needed. In some online problems with temporal aspects, compared with individual requests, the aggregated arrival pattern across a group of requests is more predictable (see, e.g., [34]). Thus, our approach can enhance the learnability of ML predictions. We believe that our analysis and result will be useful to various applications of the Bahncard problem as well as other problems with recurring renting-or-buying phenomena.

Appendix

### A Detailed Comparison between Our Work and [26]

Im et al. [26] studied a problem somewhat related to the Bahncard problem, focusing on TCP acknowledgement enhanced with machine-learned predictions. In the TCP acknowledgment problem, a sequence of requests unfolds over time, each requiring acknowledgment, and a single acknowledgment can address all pending requests simultaneously. The objective here is to optimize the combined total of request delay and acknowledgement cost (strike a balance between minimizing the delays in addressing requests and the costs of acknowledgments). Im et al. [26] introduced a novel prediction error measure that estimates how much the optimal objective value changes when the difference between the actual numbers of requests and the predictions varies. Im et al. [26] took into account the temporal aspects of requests, akin to a previous work [9]. The new error measure enables their algorithm to achieve near-optimal consistency and robustness simultaneously. Our investigation into the Bahncard problem differs significantly from theirs in terms of techniques employed. The main differences are summarized as follows.

* In [26], predictions are made for a _full_ sequence of TCP acknowledgment requests. The prediction necessitates a discrete formulation, where time is partitioned into slots of equal length. In contrast, our approach refrains from discretization and requires only _short-term_ predictions within a future interval of length \(T\), i.e., the length of the valid time period of a Bahncard. In our work, a prediction on the short-term future is made only when a travel request arises and there is no valid Bahncard, aligning more closely with real-world ML predictions.
* Im et al. [26] designed an error measure that is built on the change of the optimal objective value when the algorithm input varies from \(\min\{p_{t},\hat{p}_{t}\}\) to \(\max\{p_{t},\hat{p}_{t}\}\), where \(p_{t}\) is the actual number of requests arising in time slot \(t\) and \(\hat{p}_{t}\) is the predicted number. By contrast, our error measure estimates the quality of predictions directly. Harnessing the novel error measure, Im et al. [26] formulated an _intricate_ algorithm, simultaneously ensuring near-optimal consistency and robustness. In contrast, we design a _simple_ and _easily implementable_ algorithm using short-term predictions and demonstrates its significant performance advantages in experimental evaluations.

### Consistency of \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) is at least \((3-\beta)/(1+\beta)\)

As shown in Figure 8, consider a travel request sequence \(\sigma\) of five requests: \((t_{1},\epsilon)\), \((t_{2},\gamma-\epsilon)\), \((t_{3},\gamma-2\epsilon)\), \((t_{4},\epsilon)\), and \((t_{5},\epsilon)\), where \(t_{1}<t_{2}\leq t_{1}+w<t_{4}+w-T<t_{1}+T<t_{3}<t_{4}<t_{2}+T<t_{3}+w<t_{5}\leq t _{4}+w\). By the algorithm definition, \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) purchases two Bahncards at times \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{4}\) respectively, while \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases a Bahncard at time \(t_{2}\). When \(\epsilon\to 0\), we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{SUM}_{w}(\sigma)}{\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma)}=\frac{2C+\beta(\gamma+2 \epsilon)+(\gamma-2\epsilon)}{C+\beta(2\gamma-2\epsilon)+2\epsilon}\to\frac{2 C+\beta\gamma+\gamma}{C+2\beta\gamma}=\frac{3-\beta}{1+\beta}.\]

### Proof of Theorem 4.1

For analyzing consistency, we have \(\hat{c}(\sigma;[t,t+T))\equiv c(\sigma;[t,t+T))\) holds for any regular request \((t,p)\). Given a travel request sequence \(\sigma\), we denote by \(\mu_{1}<\cdots<\mu_{m}\) the times when \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) purchases Bahncards. Then, the timespan can be divided into epochs \(E_{j}:=[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+1})\) for \(0\leq j\leq m\), where we define \(\mu_{0}=0\) and \(\mu_{m+1}=\infty\). Due to perfect predictions, each epoch \(E_{j}\) (except \(E_{0}\)

Figure 8: An example where the shaded rectangle (resp. bold line) is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) (resp. \(\mathsf{OPT}\)). \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) purchases a Bahncard at \(t_{1}\) because \(t_{2}\leq t_{1}+w\) and \(\epsilon+(\gamma-\epsilon)\geq\gamma\). \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) does not purchase a Bahncard at \(t_{3}\) since \(t_{3}+w<t_{5}\) and \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}^{\prime}(\sigma;(t_{3}+w-T,t_{3}])+\hat{c}(\sigma;(t_{3},t_{ 3}+w])=(\gamma-2\epsilon)+\epsilon<\gamma\). \(\mathsf{SUM}_{w}\) purchases a Bahncard at \(t_{4}\) because \(t_{3},t_{4},t_{5}\in(t_{4}+w-T,t_{4}+w]\) and the total ticket cost is \(\gamma\).

starts with an _on_ phase \([\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T)\) in which the total regular cost is at least \(\gamma\), followed by an _off_ phase \([\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\). Epoch \(E_{0}\) has an off phase only. By the definition of \(\mathsf{FSUM}\), for any time \(t\) in an off phase when a travel request arises, we have

\[\hat{c}\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}=c\big{(}\sigma;[t,t+T)\big{)}<\gamma.\] (11)

Note that when both \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\) do not have a valid Bahncard, they pay the same cost. Thus, we focus on only the time intervals in which at least one of \(\mathsf{FSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\) has a valid Bahncard. We examine the Bahncards purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) relative to the Bahncards purchased by \(\mathsf{FSUM}\). Clearly, \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases at most one Bahncard in any on phase since the length of an on phase is \(T\), and \(\mathsf{OPT}\) does not purchase any Bahncard in any off phase by (11) and Corollary 3.2. For any epoch \(E_{j}\), if \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases its \(i\)-th Bahncard at time \(\tau_{i}\in[\mu_{j},\mu_{j}+T)\), there are two cases to consider.

**Case I.** The Bahncard expires in the following off phase \([\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\). As shown in Figure 9, for ease of notation, we use \(s_{1},...,s_{5}\) to denote the total regular costs in the time intervals \([\mu_{j},\max\{\mu_{j},\tau_{i-1}+T\},\tau_{i})\), \([\max\{\mu_{j},\tau_{i-1}+T\},\tau_{i})\), \([\tau_{i},\mu_{j}+T)\), \([\mu_{j}+T,\tau_{i}+T)\), and \([\tau_{i}+T,\mu_{j+1})\) respectively. Here \(\tau_{i-1}\) is the time when \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases its \((i-1)\)-th Bahncard. If \(i=1\), we define \(\tau_{i-1}=-\infty\). Note that some of the aforesaid intervals can be empty so that the corresponding total regular cost is \(0\). Since the total regular cost in an on phase is at least \(\gamma\), we have

\[s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}\geq\gamma.\] (12)

By Lemma 3.1, we have \(s_{3}+s_{4}\geq\gamma\). If no travel request arises during the time interval \([\mu_{j}+T,\tau_{i}+T)\), we have \(s_{4}=0\). Otherwise, we denote by \(t^{\prime}\in[\mu_{j}+T,\tau_{i}+T)\) the time when the first travel request arises in this interval. Since \(t^{\prime}\) is in an off phase, it follows from (11) and \(\tau_{i}<t^{\prime}\) that

\[s_{4}=c\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j}+T,\tau_{i}+T)\big{)}=c\big{(}\sigma;[t^{\prime},\tau_{i}+T)\big{)}\leq c\big{(}\sigma;[t^{\prime},t^{\prime}+T)\big{)}<\gamma.\] (13)

Hence, we always have

\[s_{4}<\gamma.\] (14)

The cost ratio in epoch \(E_{j}\) is given by

\[\frac{\mathsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j})}{\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j})} =\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+s_{4}+s_{5}}{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{ 3}+s_{4})+s_{2}+s_{5}}\] \[<\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+\gamma+s_{5}}{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{ 3}+\gamma)+s_{2}+s_{5}}\] (14) \[\leq\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+\gamma+s_{5}}{C+\beta(s_{1} +s_{2}+s_{3}+\gamma)+s_{5}} s_{2}\geq 0\text{ \& }\beta<1\] \[\leq\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+\gamma}{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2} +s_{3}+\gamma)} s_{5}\geq 0\] \[\leq\frac{C+\beta\gamma+\gamma}{C+2\beta\gamma}\] (12) \[=\frac{2}{1+\beta}. \gamma=\frac{C}{1-\beta}\] (15)

**Case II.** The Bahncard expires in the on phase of the next epoch, i.e., \([\mu_{j+1},\mu_{j+1}+T)\).

**Case II-A.**\(\mathsf{OPT}\) does not purchase any Bahncard in \([\tau_{i}+T,\mu_{j+1}+T)\). As shown in Figure 10, we use \(s_{1},...,s_{7}\) to denote the total regular costs in the time intervals \([\mu_{j},\max\{\mu_{j},\tau_{i-1}+T\})\), \([\max\{\mu_{j},\tau_{i-1}+T\},\tau_{i})\), \([\tau_{i},\mu_{j}+T)\), \([\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\), \([\mu_{j+1},\tau_{i}+T)\), \([\tau_{i}+T,\mu_{j+1}+T)\), and

Figure 9: Case I. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

\([\mu_{j+1}+T,\mu_{j+2})\), respectively. Again \(\tau_{i-1}\) is the time when OPT purchases its \((i-1)\)-th Bahncard. If \(i=1\), we define \(\tau_{i-1}=-\infty\). Since the total regular cost in an on phase is at least \(\gamma\), we have

\[s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3} \geq\gamma,\] (16) \[s_{5}+s_{6} \geq\gamma.\] (17)

If no travel request arises during the time interval \([\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\), we have \(s_{4}=0\leq s_{6}\). Otherwise, we denote by \(t^{\prime}\in[\mu_{j}+T,\mu_{j+1})\) the time when the first travel request arises in this interval. It follows from (11) and \(\tau_{i}<t^{\prime}\) that

\[s_{4}+s_{5}=c\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j}+T,\tau_{i}+T)\big{)}=c\big{(}\sigma;[t^{ \prime},\tau_{i}+T)\big{)}\leq c\big{(}\sigma;[t^{\prime},t^{\prime}+T)\big{)} <\gamma.\] (18)

Together with (17), we get \(s_{4}<s_{6}\). Therefore, we always have

\[s_{4}\leq s_{6},\] (19)

and

\[s_{4}<\gamma.\] (20)

The cost ratio in epochs \(E_{j}\) and \(E_{j+1}\) is given by

\[\frac{\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j}\cup E_{j+1})}{\textsf{OPT}( \sigma;E_{j}\cup E_{j+1})} =\frac{2C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})+s_{4}+s_{7}}{C+\beta (s_{1}+s_{3}+s_{4}+s_{5})+s_{2}+s_{6}+s_{7}}\] \[\leq\frac{2C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})+s_{4}+s_{7}}{C+ \beta(s_{1}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})+s_{2}+s_{4}+s_{7}}\] (19) & \[\beta<1\] \[\leq\frac{2C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})+s_{4}+s_{7}}{C+ \beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})+s_{4}+s_{7}}\] \[\leq\frac{2C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})}{C+\beta(s_{1}+ s_{2}+s_{3}+s_{5}+s_{6})}\] \[\leq\frac{2C+2\beta\gamma}{C+2\beta\gamma}\] (16) & (17) \[=\frac{2}{1+\beta}.\] \[\gamma=\frac{C}{1-\beta}\] (21)

In addition, the cost ratio in epoch \(E_{j}\) is given by

\[\frac{\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j})}{\textsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j})} =\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+s_{4}}{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{3}+s_{4} )+s_{2}}\] \[\leq\frac{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s_{3})+s_{4}}{C+\beta(s_{1}+s_{2}+s _{3}+s_{4})}\] \[\leq\frac{C+\beta\gamma+s_{4}}{C+\beta\gamma+\beta s_{4}}\] (16) \[<\frac{C+\beta\gamma+\gamma}{C+\beta\gamma+\beta\gamma}\] (20) & \[\beta<1\] \[=\frac{2}{1+\beta}.\] \[\gamma=\frac{C}{1-\beta}\] (22)

**Case II-B.** After time \(\tau_{i}+T\), OPT purchases another \(x\) Bahncards at times \(\tau_{i+1},...,\tau_{i+x}\) respectively (\(x\geq 1\)) as shown in Figure 11. For each \(k=1,...,x\), the purchasing time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falls in the on phase

Figure 10: Case II-A. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

\([\mu_{j+k},\mu_{j+k}+T)\), and the expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falls in the next on phase \([\mu_{j+k+1},\mu_{j+k+1}+T)\). OPT does not purchase any new Bahncard in \([\tau_{i+x}+T,\mu_{j+x+1}+T)\). Essentially, the pattern in epoch \(E_{j}\) of Case II-A repeats \(x\) times, followed by the pattern of Case II-A. By (22), \(\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{i+k})/\textsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j+k})\leq 2/(1+\beta)\) for each \(k=0,...,x-1\). By (21), \(\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j+x}\cup E_{j+x+1})/\textsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j+x}\cup E _{j+x+1})\leq 2/(1+\beta)\). Hence,

\[\frac{\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j}\cup\cdots\cup E_{j+x+1})}{\textsf{OPT}( \sigma;E_{j}\cup\cdots\cup E_{j+x+1})}\leq\frac{2}{1+\beta}.\] (23)

**Case II-C.** After time \(\tau_{i}+T\), OPT purchases another \(x\) Bahncards at times \(\tau_{i+1},...,\tau_{i+x}\) respectively (\(x\geq 1\)) as shown in Figure 12. For each \(k=1,...,x-1\), the purchasing time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falls in the on phase \([\mu_{j+k},\mu_{j+k}+T)\), and the expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falls in the next on phase \([\mu_{j+k+1},\mu_{j+k+1}+T)\). The purchasing time \(\tau_{i+x}\) falls in the on phase \([\mu_{j+x},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), and the expiry time \(\tau_{i+x}+T\) falls in the following off phase \([\mu_{j+x}+T,\mu_{j+x+1})\). Essentially, the pattern in epoch \(E_{j}\) of Case II-A repeats \(x\) times, followed by the pattern of Case I. By (22), \(\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j+k})/\textsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j+k})\leq 2/(1+\beta)\) for each \(k=0,...,x-1\). By (15), \(\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j+x})/\textsf{OPT}(\sigma;E_{j+x})\leq 2/(1+\beta)\). Hence,

\[\frac{\textsf{FSUM}(\sigma;E_{j}\cup\cdots\cup E_{j+x})}{\textsf{OPT}( \sigma;E_{j}\cup\cdots\cup E_{j+x})}\leq\frac{2}{1+\beta}.\] (24)

If OPT does not purchase any Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j}\), it must have purchased a Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j-1}\), and the Bahncard expires in the on phase of \(E_{j}\) due to Lemma 3.1. Otherwise, purchasing another Bahncard at the beginning of \(E_{j}\) can never increase the total cost, because the total regular cost in the on phase of \(E_{j}\) is at least \(\gamma\). Thus, \(E_{j-1}\) and \(E_{j}\) must fall into Case II-A or be the last two epochs of Case II-B, which have been analyzed above.

The theorem follows from (15), (21), (23) and (24).

### Proof of Proposition 4.7

#### a.4.1 Proof for Pattern III

**Proposition Restated.** If OPT purchases \(x+2\) Bahncards (\(x\geq 0\)) in successive on phases starting from \(E_{j}\), where (i) the first Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i}\) falling in the off phase of \(E_{j-1}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j}\), (ii) for each \(k=1,...,x\), the \((k+1)\)-th Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k-1}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k}\), and (iii) the \((x+2)\)-th Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i+x+1}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+x+1}+T\) falling in the off phase of \(E_{j+x}\), then

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}{\textsf{ OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma, \\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (25)

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) when \(x\rightarrow\infty\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 13, we divide \([\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\) into \(4x+5\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when OPT or PFSUM purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by OPT or PFSUM expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(-1,0,1,2,...,4x+3\), and

Figure 11: Case II-B. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

Figure 12: Case II-C. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

let \(s_{-1},s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{4x+3}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}/\textsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below.

\[\frac{1}{\beta} -\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T) \big{)}}{\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+2)C+\beta\big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(} s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+(s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3})\big{]}}{\beta\cdot \textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[+\frac{\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-\beta\big{[}(x+1)C+\beta\sum_{k=0}^ {x}\big{(}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\big{)}+\sum_{k=-1}^{x}s_{4k+3}\big{]}}{ \beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+2)C+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+ \beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+2}+\beta\sum_{k=-1}^{x}s_{4k+3}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{ OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[-\frac{\beta(x+1)C+\beta^{2}\sum_{k=0}^{x}\big{(}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+ s_{4k+2}\big{)}+\beta\sum_{k=-1}^{x}s_{4k+3}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{[(x+2)-\beta(x+1)]C+\beta(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x}\big{(}s_{4 k}+s_{4k+2}\big{)}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}{\textsf{ OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (26)

Next, we analyze the upper bound of the cost ratio. There are two cases to consider.

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=-1,0,...,x\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k+1}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{-1}+s_{0}\geq\gamma,\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\geq\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (27)

By Lemma 4.2, for each \(k=0,...,x\), we have

\[s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta.\] (28)

Note that all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th (for \(k=0,...,x\)) and the \((4k+4)\)-th (for \(k=-1,...,x-1\)) time intervals are reduced requests of both PFSUM and OPT. Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T)\), we should minimize these \(s_{4k+2}\)'s and \(s_{4k+4}\)'s. If they are greater

Figure 13: Illustration for Pattern III. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (27) and (28). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+2}\leq\gamma&\text{for each }k=0,...,x,\\ s_{4k+4}\leq\gamma&\text{for each }k=-1,...,x-1.\end{array}\right.\] (29)

It follows from (29) and Lemma 4.4 that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\text{for }k=-1,\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\text{for each }k=0,...,x-1,\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\text{for }k=x.\end{array}\right.\] (30)

As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;\left[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T\right) )}{\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma;\left[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T\right))}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}\left(s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2} \right)+\sum_{k=-1}^{x}s_{4k+3}}{(x+2)C+\beta\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0} ^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)+\left(s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\right) \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2 }+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)+\left(s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\right)\Big{]}}{(x+2)C+\beta \Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right) +\left(s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\right)\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[+\frac{\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x}\left( s_{4k}+s_{4k+2}\right)}{(x+2)C+\beta\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1} \left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)+\left(s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\right)\Big{]} +\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1} -(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x}\left(s_{4k}+s_{4k+2}\right)}{(x+2)C+\beta(x+2)(2 \gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\quad\text{(by (\ref{eq:26})) and (\ref{eq:27}))}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1-\beta )\sum_{k=0}^{x}\left(s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\right)}{(x+2)C+\beta(x+2)(2 \gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1- \beta)(x+1)(\gamma-\eta)}{(x+2)C+\beta(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+ 1}}\quad\text{(by (\ref{eq:28}))}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)-(1-\beta)(x+1)(\gamma-\eta)} {(x+2)C+\beta(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)}\quad\text{(since }\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}\geq 0)\] \[=\frac{x\big{(}C+(\gamma+2\eta)+\beta(\gamma-\eta)\big{)}+\big{(} C+3(\gamma+\eta)+\beta(\gamma-\eta)\big{)}}{x\big{(}C+\beta(2\gamma+\eta)\big{)}+ \big{(}2C+\beta(4\gamma+2\eta)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{x\big{(}2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta\big{)}+\big{(}4\gamma+(3- \beta)\eta\big{)}}{x\big{(}(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta\big{)}+\big{(}(2+2\beta) \gamma+2\beta\eta\big{)}}\] \[\leq\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}. \quad\text{(when }x\to\infty\text{)}\] (31)

**Case II. \(\eta>\gamma\).** By Lemma 4.3, for each \(k=-1,0,...,x\), the total regular cost in the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval (which is in an off phase and has length at most \(T\)) is less than \(2\gamma+\eta\):

\[s_{4k+3}<2\gamma+\eta.\] (32)

On the other hand, the total regular cost in any time interval in an on phase is non-negative. As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;\left[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T\right) )}{\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma;\left[\tau_{i},\tau_{i+x+1}+T\right))} <\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)}{(x+2)C+\beta(x+2)(2\gamma+ \eta)}\quad\text{(by (\ref{eq:26}) and (\ref{eq:27}))}\] \[=\frac{x\big{(}C+(2\gamma+\eta)\big{)}+\big{(}C+(4\gamma+2\eta) \big{)}}{x\big{(}C+\beta(2\gamma+\eta)\big{)}+\big{(}2C+\beta(4\gamma+2\eta) \big{)}}\]\[\leq\frac{C+(2\gamma+\eta)}{C+\beta(2\gamma+\eta)}\quad\text{(when $x \rightarrow\infty$)}\] \[=\frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\] (33)

The result follows from (31) and (33).

A tight example is given in Figure 14, where \(x\rightarrow\infty\). The upper bound is achieved when \(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\), for each \(k=-1,...,x-1\), \(s_{4k+3}=\gamma+2\eta\), \(s_{4x+3}\to 2\gamma+\eta\); for each \(k=0,...,x\), \(s_{4k}=\gamma-\eta\), \(s_{4k+1}=s_{4k+2}=0\), or when \(\eta>\gamma\), for each \(k=-1,...,x\), \(s_{4k+3}=2\gamma+\eta\) and for each \(k=0,...,x\), \(s_{4k}=s_{4k+1}=s_{4k+2}=0\).

#### a.4.2 Proof for Pattern IV

**Proposition Restated.** If \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases \(x+1\) Bahncards (\(x\geq 0\)) in successive on phases starting from \(E_{j}\), where (i) the first Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i}\) falling in the off phase of \(E_{j-1}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j}\), and (ii) for each \(k=1,...,x\), the \((k+1)\)-th Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k-1}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k}\), and (iii) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) does not purchase any new Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\), then

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T))}{\mathsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll} \frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma, \\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (34)

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) for any \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 15, we divide \([\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\) into \(4x+3\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(-1,0,1,2,...,4x+1\), and let \(s_{-1},s_{0},s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{4x+1}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T))/\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[ \tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below.

\[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k +2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4 k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta^{2}\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1 }s_{4k+1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+2}\Big{]}+\beta\sum_{k=-1}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{ \beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(1-\beta)(x+1)C+\beta(1-\beta)\big{(}\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k}+ \sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+2}\big{)}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta \cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{ \textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (35)

Next, we analyze the upper bound of the cost ratio. There are two cases to consider.

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=-1,0,...,x\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k+1}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{-1}+s_{0}\geq\gamma,\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$.}\end{array}\right.\] (36)

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta \quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$,}\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma-\eta.\end{array}\right.\] (37)

Note that all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th (\(k=0,...,x-1\)) and the \((4k+4)\)-th (\(k=-1,...,x-1\)) time intervals are reduced requests of both PFSUM and OPT. Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), we should minimize \(s_{4k+2}\) and \(s_{4k+4}\). If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (36) and (37). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k+2}\leq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$,}\\ s_{4k+4}\leq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=-1,...,x-1$.}\end{array}\right.\] (38)

It follows from (38), and Lemma 4.4 that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta \quad\text{for $k=-1,$}\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$.}\end{array}\right.\] (39)

As a result, we have

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{ \textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{i},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_ {4k+2}\right)+(s_{4x}+s_{4x+1})\Big{]}+\sum_{k=-1}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+\beta \Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right) \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+ 3}+s_{4k+4}\right)+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}(s_{-1}+s_{ 0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\left(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\right)\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{ x}s_{4k+1}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:22]

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) for any \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 17, we divide \([\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\) into \(4x+3\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(1,2,...,4x+3\), and let \(s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{4x+3}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

Next, we analyze the upper bound of the cost ratio. There are two cases to consider.

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}/\mathsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below.

\[\frac{1}{\beta}-\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau _{i+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4 k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+\big{(}s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+ 1}}{\beta\cdot\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+2}+\sum_{k=0}^{ x}s_{4k+3}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+4}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot \mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+2}+\sum_{k=0}^ {x}s_{4k+3}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+4}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot \mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad=\frac{(1-\beta)(x+1)C+\beta(1-\beta)\big{(}\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{ 4k+2}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+4}\big{)}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{ \beta\cdot\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{ OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (44)

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=0,...,x\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\geq\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (45)

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{1}+s_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta,\\ s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each $k=1,...,x$}.\end{array}\right.\] (46)

Figure 17: Illustration for Pattern V. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

Note that all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th (for \(k=0,...,x\)) and the \((4k+4)\)-th (for \(k=0,...,x-1\)) time intervals are reduced requests of both PFSUM and OPT. Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\), we should minimize these \(s_{4k+2}\)'s and \(s_{4k+4}\)'s. If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (45) and (46). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+2}\leq\gamma&\mbox{for each $k=0,...,x$},\\ s_{4k+4}\leq\gamma&\mbox{for each $k=0,...,x-1$}.\end{array}\right.\] (47)

It follows from (47) and Lemma 4.4 that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\mbox{ for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\mbox{for $k=x$}.\end{array}\right.\] (48)

As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mbox{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T))}{\mbox{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2 }+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+\big{(}s_{4x+1}+s_{4x+2}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+3} }{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+ \big{(}s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4} \big{)}+\big{(}s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\big{)}+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{(x+1)C+ \beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+\big{(}s_ {4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[-\frac{(1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+4} \big{)}+s_{4x+2}\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_ {4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+\big{(}s_{4x+2}+s_{4x+3}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_ {4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1} -(1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+s_{4x+2} \Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] (by ( 44 ) and ( 48 ) \[=\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1- \beta)\Big{[}(s_{1}+s_{2})+\sum_{k=1}^{x}\big{(}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2} \big{)}\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1- \beta)(x+1)(\gamma-\eta)}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] (by ( 46 ) \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)-(1-\beta)(x+1)(\gamma-\eta)} {(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)}\] (since \[\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}\geq 0\] ) \[=\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\] (49)

**Case II.**\(\eta>\gamma\). By Lemma 4.3, for each \(k=0,...,x\), the total regular cost in the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval (which is in an off phase and has length at most \(T\)) is less than \(2\gamma+\eta\):

\[s_{4k+3}<2\gamma+\eta.\] (50)

On the other hand, the total regular cost in any time interval in an on phase is non-negative. As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mbox{FSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}}{ \mbox{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\tau_{i+x}+T)\big{)}} <\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+ \eta)}\quad\mbox{by (\ref{eq:2}) and (\ref{eq:2})}\] \[=\frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\] (51)

The result follows from (49) and (51).

A tight example is given in Figure 18, where \(x=0\). The upper bound is achieved when \(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\), \(s_{1}=0\), \(s_{2}=\gamma-\eta\), and \(s_{3}\to\gamma+2\eta\), or when \(\eta>\gamma\), \(s_{1}=s_{2}=0\), and \(s_{3}\to 2\gamma+\eta\).

### Proof of Proposition 4.8 (For Augmented Pattern VI)

**Proposition Restated.** If (i) there is no Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) expiring in the on phase of \(E_{j}\), (ii) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases \(x\) Bahncards (\(x\geq 1\)) in successive on phases starting from \(E_{j}\), where for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((k+1)\)-th Bahncard has its purchase time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k+1}\), and (iii) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) does not purchase any new Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\), and (iv) the total regular cost in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\) is at least \(\gamma\), then

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T))}{\mathsf{OPT}(\sigma;[\mu_ {j},\mu_{j+x}+T))}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1 +\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (52)

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) for any \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 19, we divide \([\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\) into \(4x+1\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(1,2,...,4x+1\), and let \(s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{4x+1}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}/\mathsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}<1/\beta\), as shown below:

\[\frac{1}{\beta} -\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)} }{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{xC+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_ {4k+4}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\big{[}\mathsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[-\frac{\beta\Big{[}(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k +1}+s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}\Big{]}} {\beta\cdot\Big{[}\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)} \Big{]}}\] \[=\frac{(1-\beta)xC-\beta C+\beta(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+2} +\beta(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+4}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{ \beta\cdot\big{[}\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[>\frac{(1-\beta)xC-\beta C+\beta(1-\beta)\big{(}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1} s_{4k+2}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-2}s_{4k+4}\big{)}}{\beta\cdot\Big{[}\mathsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\]

Figure 19: Illustration for Proposition 4.8. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

Figure 18: A tight example for Pattern V. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

\[+\frac{(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+1}+\beta(1-\beta)(s_{4x}+s_{4x+1})}{ \beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\right]} \quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\] \[\geq\frac{(1-\beta)xC-\beta C+\beta(1-\beta)\big{(}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1 }s_{4k+2}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-2}s_{4k+4}\big{)}}{\beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\right]}\] \[+\frac{(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+1}+\beta(1-\beta)\gamma} {\beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\right]} \quad\text{(since $s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma$)}\] \[=\frac{(1-\beta)xC+\beta(1-\beta)\big{(}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+2}+ \sum_{k=0}^{x-2}s_{4k+4}\big{)}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+1}}{\beta \cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\right]}\] \[>0.\] (53)

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (54)

There are two cases to consider.

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma.\] (55)

On the other hand, by Lemma 4.2 and the (iv)-th condition of the proposition, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{1}+s_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta,\\ s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each $k=1,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (56)

Note that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th and the \((4k+4)\)-th time intervals are reduced requests of both \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\). Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), we should minimize \(s_{4k+2}\) and \(s_{4k+4}\). If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (55) and (56) (except for \(s_{4x}\)). For \(s_{4x}\), if it is greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing it to \(\gamma\) without violating (55) and (56). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k+2}\leq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4k+4}\leq\gamma\quad\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$}.\end{array}\right.\] (57)

It follows from (57) and Lemma 4.4 that, for each \(k=0,...,x-2\),

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta.\] (58)

For \(k=x-1\), we still have

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta.\] (59)

Otherwise, there must exist a time \(t\) in the off phase of \(E_{j+x-1}\) such that \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard, leading to a contradiction.

As a result,

**Case II.**\(\eta>\gamma\). In this case, the total regular cost in any time interval in an on phase can be zero (except for the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\)):

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{1}+s_{2}\geq 0,\\ s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq 0\quad\text{for each $k=1,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma.\end{array}\right.\] (61)

On the other hand, by Lemma 4.3, for each \(k=0,...,x-2\), the total regular cost in the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval (which is in an off phase and has length at most \(T\)) is less than \(2\gamma+\eta\):

\[s_{4k+3}<2\gamma+\eta.\] (62)

For \(k=x-1\), we have

\[s_{4x-1}<\gamma+\eta.\] (63)

Otherwise, there must exist a time \(t\) in the off phase of \(E_{j+x-1}\) such that PFSUM purchases a Bahncard, leading to a contradiction.

As a result,

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T))}{\textsf{OPT} \big{(}\sigma;[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}} <\frac{(x+1)C+(x-1)(2\gamma+\eta)+(\gamma+\eta)+\beta\gamma}{ xC+\beta x(2\gamma+\eta)}\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad \text{(by \eqref{eq:2}), \eqref{eq:2}, and \eqref{eq:2})}\] \[=\frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\] (64)

The result follows from (60) and (64).

A tight example for Proposition 4.8 is given in Figure 20, where \(x=1\). The upper bound is achieved when \(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\), \(s_{1}=s_{5}=0\), \(s_{2}=\gamma-\eta\), \(s_{3}\to 2\eta\), and \(s_{4}=\gamma\), or when \(\eta>\gamma\), \(s_{1}=s_{2}=s_{5}=0\), \(s_{3}\to\gamma+\eta\), and \(s_{4}=\gamma\).

### Proof of Proposition 4.9

#### a.6.1 Non-Augmented Pattern VI Combined with Pattern II

**Proposition Restated.** If (i) OPT purchases a Bahncard at time \(\tau_{k}\) in the off phase of some epoch \(E_{l}\) which expires in the same off phase, (ii) there is no Bahncard purchased by OPT expiring in the on phase of \(E_{j}\) (\(j>l\)), (iii) OPT purchases \(x\) Bahncards (\(x\geq 1\)) in successive on phases starting from \(E_{j}\), where for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((k+1)\)-th Bahncard has its purchasing time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k+1}\), and (iv) OPT does not purchase any new Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\), then

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x} +T)\big{)}}{\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+ x}+T)\big{)}}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta) \gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (65)

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) for any \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 21, we divide \([\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\) into \(4x+2\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when OPT or PFSUM purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by OPT or PFSUM expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(-1,1,...,4x+1\), and let \(s_{-1},s_{1},...,s_{4x+1}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T) \big{)}/\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x} +T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below:

\[\frac{1}{\beta} -\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[ \mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T) \cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+ 3}+s_{4k+4})\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[-\frac{\beta\Big{[}(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+1}+s_ {4k+2}+s_{4k+4})+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}\Big{]}}{ \beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+ x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(1-\beta)(x+1)C+\beta(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+2}+s_ {4k+4})+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\textsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\]

\[>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T )\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+ T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (66)

Next, we analyze the upper bound of the cost ratio. Note that by Lemma 4.3, we have

\[s_{-1}<2\gamma+\eta.\] (67)

There are two cases to consider.

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma.\] (68)

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{1}+s_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta,\\ s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each $k=1,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma-\eta.\end{array}\right.\] (69)

Note that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th and the \((4k+4)\)-th time intervals are reduced requests of both \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\). Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), we should minimize \(s_{4k+2}\) and \(s_{4k+4}\). If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (68) and (69). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[s_{4k+2} \leq\gamma,\] (70) \[s_{4k+4} \leq\gamma.\] (71)

It follows from (70), (71) and Lemma 4.4 that, for each \(k=0,...,x-1\),

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta.\] (72)

As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x }+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_ {j+x}+T)\big{)}}\]

\[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+4} \big{)}+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s _{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k =0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\]

\[<\frac{(x+1)C+(2\gamma+\eta)+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+1}+s_{4 k+2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+\beta \Big{[}2\gamma+\eta+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)} \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\quad\text{(by \eqref{eq:2.1})}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each }k=0,1,...,x.\\ q_{1}+q_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta\\ q_{4y}+q_{4y+1}\geq\gamma-\eta\\ q_{4k}+q_{4k+1}+q_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each }k=1,2,...,y-1.\end{array}\right.\] (79)

Note that for Pattern III, all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th (for \(k=0,...,x\)) and the \((4k+4)\)-th (for \(k=-1,...,x-1\)) time intervals are reduced requests of both \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\), similar for Pattern VI.

On the other hand, the total regular cost in any time interval in an on phase is non-negative, so it can be minimized to zero. As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k+x+1}+T)\cup[\mu _{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k+x +1}+T)\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[\quad\leq\frac{(x+1)C+\sum_{k=-1}^{x}s_{4k+3}+(y+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{y -1}q_{4k+3}}{(x+2)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+s_{4x+3}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}\Big{]} +yC+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}q_{4k+3}}\] \[\quad<\frac{(x+1)C+(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+(y+1)C+y(2\gamma+\eta)}{(x +2)C+\beta(x+2)(2\gamma+\eta)+yC+\beta y(2\gamma+\eta)}\quad\text{(by (\ref{eq:2011}) and (\ref{eq:2012}))}\] \[\quad=\frac{(x+y+2)C+(x+y+2)(2\gamma+\eta)}{(x+y+2)C+\beta(x+y+2) (2\gamma+\eta)}\] \[\quad=\frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}\] (84)

The result follows from (82) and (84).

### Proof of Proposition 4.10

#### a.7.1 Non-Augmented Pattern VI Combined with Pattern I

**Proposition Restated.** If (i) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases a Bahncard at time \(\tau_{k}\) at the beginning of \(E_{l}\), i.e., \(\tau_{k}=\mu_{l}\), (ii) there is no Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) expiring in the on phase of \(E_{j}\) (\(l<j\)), (iii) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) purchases \(x\) Bahncards (\(x\geq 1\)) in successive on phases starting from \(E_{j}\), where for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((k+1)\)-th Bahncard has its purchasing time \(\tau_{i+k}\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k}\) and its expiry time \(\tau_{i+k}+T\) falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+k+1}\), and (iv) \(\mathsf{OPT}\) does not purchase any new Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j+x}\), then

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu _{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[ \mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2\gamma+(2- \beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\gamma+\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (85)

where the upper bound is irrelevant with \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 23, we divide \([\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\) into \(4x+2\) time intervals, where each time interval starts and ends with the time when \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\) or \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) expires. Let these intervals be indexed by \(-1,1,...,4x+1\), and let \(s_{-1},s_{1},...,s_{4x+1}\) denote the total regular costs in these intervals respectively. By definition, it is easy to see that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \((4k+3)\)-th time interval, i.e., \([\mu_{j+k}+T,\mu_{j+k+1})\) (which is an off phase), is shorter than \(T\) since it is within the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T) \big{)}/\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+ T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below:

\[\frac{1}{\beta}-\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[ \mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T) \cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\]

Figure 23: Illustration for Appendix A.7.1. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by \(\mathsf{OPT}\).

\[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s _{4k+4})\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[ \tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\Big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2 }+s_{4k+4})+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1} +\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x} s_{4k+1}}\] \[\geq\frac{(1-\beta)(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k +2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\mathsf{OPT }\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}\big{)}} \quad\text{(since $s_{-1}\geq\gamma$)}\] \[>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+ T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+ T)\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}.\] (86)

There are two cases to consider.

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma.\] (87)

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{l}s_{-1}\geq\gamma,\\ s_{1}+s_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta,\\ s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta\quad\text{for each $k=1,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma-\eta.\end{array}\right.\] (88)

Note that for each \(k=0,...,x-1\), all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th and the \((4k+4)\)-th time intervals are reduced requests of both \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\). Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\), we should minimize \(s_{4k+2}\) and \(s_{4k+4}\). If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (87) and (88). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[s_{4k+2} \leq\gamma,\] (89) \[s_{4k+4} \leq\gamma.\] (90)

It follows from (89), (90) and Lemma 4.4 that, for each \(k=0,...,x-1\),

\[s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta.\] (91)

As a result, we have

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[\mu_ {j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\tau_{k}+T)\cup[ \mu_{j},\mu_{j+x}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+2)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+1}+s _{4k+2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+ \beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)} \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+2)C+\beta\Big{[}\gamma+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+1 }+s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+4}\big{)}+s_{4x+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}}{(x+1)C+ \beta\Big{[}\gamma+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\big{)} \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}}\quad\text{(by \eqref{eq:201})}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:35]

falling in the on phase of \(E_{j+x+p+2}\), and \((v)\) OPT does not purchase any new Bahncard in the on phase of \(E_{j+x+y+1}\), then

\[\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j +x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}{\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+T})\cup[\mu_{j+x+ 1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}\leq\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{2\gamma+(2- \beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}&0\leq\eta\leq\gamma,\\ \frac{(3-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\eta}&\eta>\gamma,\end{array}\right.\] (96)

where the upper bound is tight (achievable) for any \(x\).

**Proof.** As shown in Figure 24, we divide \([\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\) into \(4(x+y)+5\) time intervals, where each time intervals starts and ends with the time when OPT or PFSUM purchases a Bahncard or a Bahncard purchased by OPT or PFSUM expires. The first \(4x+3\) time intervals, from time \(\tau_{i}\) to \(\mu_{j+x}+T\), are concerned time duration of Pattern IV. The \((4x+4)\)-th interval is the off phase \([\mu_{l+x}+T,\mu_{l+x+1})\). The total regular costs in these time intervals are denoted by \(s_{-1},s_{0},s_{1},...,s_{4x+1},s_{4x+2}\), respectively. \([\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\) is the concerned interval of Pattern VI, which is divided into \(4y+1\) time intervals. The total regular costs in these intervals are denoted by \(q_{1},...,q_{4y+1}\), respectively.

According to Proposition 4.10. In IV of (9), the total cost of travel requests in the last on phase of Pattern IV and the following off phase is at least \(\gamma\). Thus we have

\[c(\sigma;[\mu_{l+x},\mu_{l+x+1})=s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}+s_{4x+2}\geq\gamma\] (97)

First, we observe that the cost ratio \(\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+ y+1}\ +T)\big{)}/\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+ y+1}+T)\big{)}\) is less than \(1/\beta\), as shown below:

\[\frac{1}{\beta} -\frac{\textsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[ \mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}{\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{ l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}s_{-1}+s_{0}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}(s_{4k+2}+s _{4k+3}+s_{4k+4})\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+s_{4x+2}}{\beta\cdot\Big{[} \textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+ T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[+\frac{yC+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}(q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+3}+q_{4k+4}) \Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}{\beta\cdot\Big{[}\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[ \tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[-\beta\cdot\frac{(x+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k+ 4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\big{)}+(s_{4x}+s_{4x+1})\Big{]}+\sum_{k=-1}^{x-1}s_{4k+3}+s_{4 x+2}}{\beta\cdot\Big{[}\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1}, \mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[-\beta\cdot\frac{(y+1)C+\beta\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\big{(}q_{4k+ 1}+q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+4}\big{)}+q_{4y+1}\Big{]}+\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}q_{4k+3}}{\beta \cdot\Big{[}\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1}, \mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[=\frac{(x+1)(1-\beta)C+\beta(1-\beta)(\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}s_{4k+2}+ \sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k})+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+(1-\beta)s_{4x+2}}{ \beta\cdot\Big{[}\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x +1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\] \[+\frac{\Big{[}y-\beta(y+1)\Big{]}C+\beta(1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^ {y-1}(\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}(q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+4})\Big{]}+(1-\beta^{2})\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_ {4k+1}+(1-\beta)s_{4x+2}}{\beta\cdot\Big{[}\textsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k}, \mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}\Big{]}}\]

Figure 24: Illustration for Appendix A.7.2. The shaded rectangle is the valid time of a Bahncard purchased by OPT.

\[\geq\frac{\left[(x+y)(1-\beta)+(1-2\beta)\right]C+\beta(1-\beta)s_{4x} +(1-\beta^{2})s_{4x+1}+(1-\beta)s_{4x+2}}{\beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(} \sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T\big{)}\right]}\] \[\geq\frac{\left[(x+y)(1-\beta)+(1-2\beta)\right]C+\beta(1-\beta)( s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}+s_{4x+2})}{\beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k}, \mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T\big{)}\big{)}\right]}\quad\text{( since $0\leq\beta<1$)}\] \[\geq\frac{\left[(x+y)(1-\beta)+(1-2\beta)\right]C+\beta(1-\beta) \gamma}{\beta\cdot\left[\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[ \mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T\big{)}\big{)}\right]}\quad\text{(by (\ref{eq:10}))}\] \[=\frac{\left[(x+y)(1-\beta)+(1-\beta)\right]C}{\beta\cdot\left[ \mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1} +T\big{)}\big{)}\right]}\] \[>0.\quad\text{(since $0\leq\beta<1,C>0$)}\]

Thus, the following inequality always holds:

\[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_ {j+x+y+1}+T\big{)}\big{)}}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1}) \cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T\big{)}\big{)}}<\frac{1}{\beta}\] (98)

**Case I.**\(0\leq\eta\leq\gamma\). By Corollary 3.2, the \(T\)-future-cost at \(\tau_{i+k+1}\) is at least \(\gamma\), i.e.,

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{-1}+s_{0}\geq\gamma,\\ s_{4k+2}+s_{4k+3}+s_{4k+4}\geq\gamma&\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+3}+q_{4k+4}\geq\gamma&\text{for each $k=0,...,y-1$}.\end{array}\right.\] (99)

By Lemma 4.2, we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta&\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4x}+s_{4x+1}\geq\gamma-\eta.\\ q_{1}+q_{2}\geq\gamma-\eta,\\ q_{4k}+q_{4k+1}+q_{4k+2}\geq\gamma-\eta&\text{for each $k=1,...,y-1$},\\ q_{4y}+q_{4y+1}\geq\gamma-\eta.\end{array}\right.\] (100)

Note that for Pattern IV, all the travel requests in the \((4k+2)\)-th and the \((4k+4)\)-th (for \(k=0,...,x-1\)) time intervals are reduced requests of both \(\mathsf{PFSUM}\) and \(\mathsf{OPT}\), similar for Pattern VI. Thus, to maximize the cost ratio in \([\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x}+T)\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\), we should minimize these \(s_{4k+2}\)'s and \(s_{4k+4}\)'s. If they are greater than \(\gamma\), the cost ratio can be increased by decreasing \(s_{4k+2}\) or \(s_{4k+4}\) to \(\gamma\) without violating (99) and (100). Thus, for the purpose of deriving an upper bound on the cost ratio, we can assume that

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+2}\leq\gamma&\text{for each $k=0,...,x$},\\ s_{4k+4}\leq\gamma&\text{for each $k=-1,...,x-1$},\\ q_{4k+2}\leq\gamma&\text{for each $k=0,...,y-1$},\\ q_{4k+4}\leq\gamma&\text{for each $k=0,...,y-1$}.\end{array}\right.\] (101)

It follows from (101) and Lemma 4.4 that,

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{-1}+s_{0}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\text{for each $k=0,...,x-1$},\\ s_{4k+2}+q_{4k+3}+q_{4k+4}\leq 2\gamma+\eta&\text{for each $k=0,...,y-1$} \end{array}\right.\] (102)

As a result, we have \[\frac{\mathsf{PFSUM}(\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1},\mu_ {j+x+y+1}+T))}{\mathsf{OPT}\big{(}\sigma;[\tau_{k},\mu_{l+x+1})\cup[\mu_{j+x+1}, \mu_{j+x+y+1}+T)\big{)}}\] (by (97) and (100)) \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\theta_{k}+\beta \sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+s_{4x+2}-(1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k} +s_{4k+2}\big{)}+s_{4x}\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(s_{-1}+s_{0}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1} \theta_{k})+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+s_{4x+2}+yC+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k }+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] \[+\frac{(y+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}+\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k}-( 1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\big{(}q_{4k+1}+q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+4}\big{)}+q_{4y+1 }\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(s_{-1}+s_{0}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\theta_{k})+\sum_{k=0}^{x} s_{4k+1}+yC+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k}+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(s_{-1}+s_{0})+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\theta_{k}+\beta \sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k}+s_{4k+2} \big{)}+s_{4x}\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(s_{-1}+s_{0}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\theta_{k})+ \sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+yC+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k}+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k +1}}\] \[+\frac{(y+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}+\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k}-( 1-\beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\big{(}q_{4k+1}+q_{4k+2}+q_{4k+4}\big{)}+q_{4y+1 }\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(s_{-1}+s_{0}+\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\theta_{k})+\sum_{k=0}^{x }s_{4k+1}+yC+\beta\sum_{k=0}^{y-1}\delta_{k}+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1- \beta)\Big{[}\sum_{k=0}^{x-1}\big{(}s_{4k}+s_{4k+1}+s_{4k+2}\big{)}+(s_{4x}+s _{4x+1})\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+yC+ \beta y(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] \[+\frac{(y+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}+y(2\gamma+\eta)-(1-\beta) \Big{[}q_{1}+q_{2}+\sum_{k=1}^{y-1}\big{(}q_{4k}+q_{4k+1}+q_{4k+2}\big{)}+q_{4y }+q_{4y+1}\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+yC+ \beta y(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] (by (98) and (102)) \[\leq\frac{(x+1)C+(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}-(1- \beta)\Big{[}x(\gamma-\eta)+\gamma\Big{]}}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+ \sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+yC+\beta y(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] \[+\frac{(y+1)C+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}+y(2\gamma+\eta)-(1-\beta)(y+ 1)(\gamma-\eta)}{(x+1)C+\beta(x+1)(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}+yC+ \beta y(2\gamma+\eta)+\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}}\] (by (97) and (100)) \[\leq\frac{(x+y+2)C+(x+y+1)(2\gamma+\eta)-(1-\beta)\Big{[}(x+y+2 )\gamma-(x+y+1)\eta\Big{]}}{(x+y+1)C+\beta(x+y+1)(2\gamma+\eta)}\] (103) \[\text{(since }\sum_{k=0}^{x}s_{4k+1}\geq 0,\sum_{k=0}^{y}q_{4k+1}\geq 0)\] \[=\frac{2(x+y+1)\gamma+(x+y+1)(2-\beta)\eta}{(x+y+1)\Big{[}(1+\beta )\gamma+\beta\eta\Big{]}}\] \[=\frac{2\gamma+(2-\beta)\eta}{(1+\beta)\gamma+\beta\eta}.\]

**Case II.**\(\eta>\gamma\). By Lemma 4.3, for Pattern IV, the total regular cost in the \((4k+3)\)-th (for \(k=-1,...,x\)) time interval (which is in an off phase and has length at most \(T\)) is less than \(2\gamma+\eta\), similar for Pattern VI. Thus we have

\[\left\{\begin{array}{ll}s_{4k+3}<2\gamma+\eta&\text{for each }k=-1,...,x-1,\\ q_{4k+3}<2\gamma+\eta&\text{for each }k=0,...,y-1.\end{array}\right.\] (104)

On the other hand, the total regular cost in any time interval in an on phase is non-negative, so it can be minimized to zero, except the last on phase of Pattern IV. As a result, we have

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the contributions made, matching both theoretical and experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [No] Justification: This paper provides both theoretical and experimental contributions for PFSUM. The theoretical results are derived without strong assumptions, but the experimental results are conducted, although extensively, only on synthesized dataset. Different travel request patterns may influence the advantage of PFSUM over the other algorithms. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs**Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the propositions, lemmas, theorems and formulas in the paper are numbered, cross-referenced, and proved. The proof sketches are provided in the main content while the detailed proofs are given in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have released the code and data for reproducibility. With our instructions, others can easily reproduce experimental results that are consistent with the results in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset).

4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The code and data can be openly accessed. We provide the instructions to reproduce all the experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings are presented in the experiment section and the details are provided with the code. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The statistical significance involved in our experiments is divided into two parts: data generation and confidence intervals for the results. For data generation, we have given their distributions as well as parameters, and specific methods of generation in the paper. Additionally, for the results, we have given 95\(\%\) confidence intervals for all results of 100 experiments through the shaded area in the figures. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide sufficient information on the computer resources for the experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, and we confirm that the research conducted conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in every respect. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts**Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: This paper presents work to design, analyze and evaluate learning-augmented algorithms for the Bahncard problem. There are some positive potential societal consequences of our work. For example, saving the cost of travelers. But none of them we feel must be specifically highlighted. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not use existing assets.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided details of the code in an anonymized manner. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
