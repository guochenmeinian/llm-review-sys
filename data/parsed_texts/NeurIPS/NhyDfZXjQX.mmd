###### Abstract

Developing fair automated machine learning algorithms is critical in making safe and trustworthy decisions. Many causality-based fairness notions have been proposed to address the above issues by quantifying the causal connections between sensitive attributes and decisions, and when the true causal graph is fully known, certain algorithms that achieve interventional fairness have been proposed. However, when the true causal graph is unknown, it is still challenging to effectively and efficiently exploit partially directed acyclic graphs (PDAGs) to achieve interventional fairness. To exploit the PDAGs for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection or causal effect identification, but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumptions. In this paper, we propose a general min-max optimization framework that can achieve interventional fairness with promising prediction accuracy and can be extended to maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with added background knowledge. Specifically, we first estimate all possible treatment effects of sensitive attributes on a given prediction model from all possible adjustment sets of sensitive attributes via an efficient local approach. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and possible estimated causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the superiority of our methods. To benefit the research community, we have reAleased our project at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/NeurIPS24-Interventional-Fairness-with-PDAGs.

## 1 Introduction

Making automated machine learning algorithms fair is critical to producing safe and trustworthy decisions with different sensitive attributes [1, 1, 1, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. To achieve fair predictions, association-based and causality-based fairness notions have been proposed. Specifically, the former requires statistical independence between the sensitive attribute and predicted outcome [14, 15, 16, 17, 18], whereas the later investigates causal effect of the sensitive attribute on the predicted outcome, requiring that the predicted outcome be the same across the real-world without intervention and the counterfactual world with intervention on sensitive attribute [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20].

Despite many algorithms have been developed to achieve causality-based fairness, most of them require the true causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) is fully known (Kusner et al., 2017; Nabi and Shpitser, 2018; Chiappa, 2019; Chikahara et al., 2021). Nevertheless, true causal DAGs and structural equations are usually not directly available in practice (Colombo et al., 2014). Moreover, without strong assumptions, e.g., linearity (Shimizu et al., 2006) and additive noise (Hoyer et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2014), the true causal DAG may not be recoverable from only the observed data, which raises a great challenge to achieve causality-based fairness based on partially DAGs (PDAGs).

To achieve causality-based fairness under partially known causal graphs, recent approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: variable selection methods (Zuo et al., 2022) and causal effect identification methods (Perkovic, 2020; Zuo et al., 2024). Specifically, the variable selection method first adopts causal discovery algorithms to obtain a Markov equivalence class of DAGs that encode the same set of conditional independencies from the data, and then classifies the covariate variables into three categories: definite non-descendants, possible descendants, and definite descendants of the sensitive attributes. By noting that a prediction model would be counterfactually fair if the prediction model is a function of the non-descendants of sensitive attributes (Kusner et al., 2017), these methods proposed to use only the definite non-descendants or further incorporate possible descendants to make fair predictions. Despite can theoretically guarantee interventional fairness, disregarding the descendants results in a notable decline in performance. Another category of methods proposed to identify causal effects of sensitive attributes on the outcome variable directly from the maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs), but relies on strong assumptions for identification.

In this paper, we aim to effectively and efficiently achieve interventional fairness with partially known causal graphs. Different from the previous variable selection and causal effect identification methods, we exploit all variables to ensure relatively high prediction accuracy, as well as does not need to rely on additional strong assumptions for identification. Specifically, we propose a novel local method to partially identify the causal effects of sensitive attributes on the predictor for satisfying the interventional fairness, which does not require a global search of all possible DAGs, but can estimate all possible causal effects using the obtained CPDAG. Inspired by the IDA framework (Maathuis et al., 2009), we first propose a local algorithm to obtain possible parental sets of the sensitive attributes on the PDAGs, from which we estimate all possible propensities for various cases. We then calculate all possible violations of intervention fairness using all possible propensities. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and the corresponding estimation of the possible causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. The validity of our method also holds for MPDAGs with added background knowledge.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

\(\bullet\) We propose a general min-max optimization framework to achieve interventional fairness, which enables to use all variables to achieve relatively high prediction accuracy, and can be extended to MPDAGs with added background knowledge.

\(\bullet\) Based on the proposed framework, we provide an efficient algorithm to estimate all possible causal effects of sensitive attribute on predictions for MPDAGs.

\(\bullet\) We further provide a joint learning approach that alternatively updates the prediction model and the corresponding estimation of the possible causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations.

\(\bullet\) We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in achieving interventional fairness with promising accuracy.

## 2 Preliminaries

### DAGs, PDAGs, CPDAGs, and MPDAGs

In a graph \(\mathcal{G}=(V,E)\), where \(V\) and \(E\) represent the node set and edge set in \(\mathcal{G}\), we say \(\mathcal{G}\) is _directed_, _undirected_, or _partially directed_ if all edges in the graph are directed, undirected, or a mixture of directed and undirected edges, respectively. The _skeleton_ of \(\mathcal{G}\) is an undirected graph obtained by removing all arrowheads from \(\mathcal{G}\). Given a graph \(\mathcal{G}\), an \(X_{i}\) is called a _parent_ of \(X_{j}\) and \(X_{j}\) is called a _child_ of \(X_{i}\) if \(X_{i}\to X_{j}\) in \(\mathcal{G}\). Also, \(X_{i}\) is a _sibling_ of \(X_{j}\) if \(X_{i}-X_{j}\) in \(\mathcal{G}\). If \(X_{i}\) and \(X_{j}\) are connected by an edge, they are _adjacent_. The notation \(pa(X_{i},\mathcal{G})\), \(ch(X_{i},\mathcal{G})\), \(sib(X_{i},\mathcal{G})\), and \(adj(X_{i},\mathcal{G})\) respectively represent sets of parents, children, siblings, and adjacent vertices of \(X_{i}\) in \(\mathcal{G}\). A graph is termed _complete_ if all distinct vertices are adjacent. A _path_ is a sequence of distinct vertices \((X_{k_{1}},\cdots,X_{k_{j}})\) where any two consecutive vertices are adjacent. A path is called _partially directed_ from \(X_{k_{1}}\) to \(X_{k_{j}}\) if \(X_{k_{i}}\gets X_{k_{i+1}}\) does not occur in \(\mathcal{G}\) for any \(i=1,\ldots,j-1\). A partially directed path is _directed_ (_undirected_) if all edges on the path are directed (undirected). A vertex \(X_{i}\) is an _ancestor_ of \(X_{j}\) and \(X_{j}\) is a _descendant_ of \(X_{i}\) if there is a directed path from \(X_{i}\) to \(X_{j}\) or \(X_{i}=X_{j}\). A directed (undirected) _cycle_ is a directed (undirected) path from a vertex to itself. Particularly, a cycle with the number of edges equal to three is called a _triangle_.

In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), all edges are directed and there is no directed cycle. A partially directed acyclic graph (DAG) may contain both directed and undirected edges without directed cycles. Two DAGs are Markov _equivalent_ if they induce the same set of conditional independence relations [Pearl, 1988]. A _Markov equivalence class_, denoted by \([\mathcal{G}]\), contains all DAGs equivalent to \(\mathcal{G}\). A Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a partially directed graph called _completely partially directed acyclic graph_ (CPDAG) \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\), in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent in \(\mathcal{G}\), and a directed edge occurs if and only if it appears in all DAGs in \([\mathcal{G}]\)[Andersson et al., 1997, Chickering, 2002a]. A CPDAG \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) can be refined to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (maximal PDAG or MPDAG) \(\mathcal{H}\) by giving background knowledge \(\mathcal{B}_{d}\) consisting of some directed causal relationships between variables in the form \(X_{i}\to X_{j}\)[Hauser and Buhlmann, 2012, Eigenmann et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017, Rothenhausler et al., 2018]. Meek [1995] proved that, with a series of orientation rules called Meek's rules, some undirected edges may be further directed (see Algorithm 4 in Appendix for details), and the resulting graph is an MPDAG. Both a DAG and a CPDAG can be viewed as special cases of an MPDAG, where the background knowledge is fully known and unknown, respectively.

### Structural Causal Model

We follow Pearl [2009] to define the structural causal model (SCM) as a triplet \((V,U,F)\) to describe the causal relationships between variables. Specifically, \(V\) is a set of observable endogenous variables, \(U\) is a set of latent independent background variables that cannot be caused by any variable in \(V\), and \(F\) is a set of functions \(\{f_{1},\ldots,f_{|V|}\}\), one for each \(V_{i}\in V\), such that \(V_{i}=f_{i}\left(pa_{i},U_{i}\right)\), where \(pa_{i}\subseteq V\setminus\{V_{i}\}\) and \(U_{i}\in U\). Notably, the set of equations \(F\) induces a directed graph over the variables, here assumed to be a DAG, where the directed causes of \(V_{i}\) represents its parent set. A causal DAG model consists of a DAG \(\mathcal{G}\) and a joint distribution \(P\) over \(V\) such that the distribution can be factorized as \(P(v_{1},...,v_{|V|})=\prod_{v_{i}\in V}P(v_{i}|pa(v_{i},\mathcal{G}))\)[Perkovic et al., 2017].

### Interventional Fairness

Given a DAG \(\mathcal{G}\) and two distinct variables \(X\) and \(Y\), the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) can be interpreted by the post-intervention distribution of \(Y\) intervening on \(X\) via _do_ operator [Pearl, 1995, 2009]. Formally, given a distribution \(P(U)\) over the background variables \(U\), an intervention \(do(X=x)\) that force variable \(X\) to take certain value \(x\) is defined as the substitution of the structural equation \(X=f_{x}(pa_{x},U_{x})\) with \(X=x\), and the post-interventional density of \(Y\) is denoted as \(f(Y=y\mid do(X=x))\). However, if we only know a CPDAG \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) or an MPDAG \(\mathcal{H}\), the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) may not be identifiable from observational data [Perkovic et al., 2015, 2017, Wu et al., 2019,b].

Build on the \(do\) operator, interventional fairness criterion [Kilbertus et al., 2017, Salimi et al., 2019] requires that given the covariates, intervening the value of the sensitive attribute does not affect the output distribution of the output predictor. Formally, let \(A\), \(Y\), and \(X\) denote sensitive attributes, outcomes of interest, and other covariates, and \(\hat{Y}\) be a predictor produced by a learning algorithm as a prediction of \(Y\). Without loss of generality2, we say the predictor \(\hat{Y}\) is interventionally fair with respect to the sensitive attributes \(A\) if it satisfies the following condition:

Footnote 2: Note that our proposed method can be naturally extend to interventional fairness with admissible attributes \(X_{ad}\subseteq X\)[Salimi et al., 2019], defined as \(P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=a),do(X_{ad}=x_{ad}))=P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=a^{\prime}), do(X_{ad}=x_{ad}))\), by observing that \(do(A)\) and \(do(X_{ad})\) are symmetric and including \(X_{ad}\) into \(A\).

**Definition 2.1** (Interventional fairness [Kilbertus et al., 2017]).: We say the prediction \(\hat{Y}\) is interventionally fair with respect to the sensitive attributes \(A\) if the following holds:

\[P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=a))=P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=a^{\prime})),\]

for all possible values of \(y\) and any value that \(A\) can take.

A General Min-Max Optimization Framework

### Motivation and Method Overview

Given only observational data, the underlying true causal DAG may not be recoverable without strong assumptions such as linearity (Shimizu et al., 2006) or additive noise (Hoyer et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2014). Instead, we can use causal discovery algorithms (Spirites and Glymour, 1991; Shimizu et al., 2006; Zhang and Hyvarinen, 2009; Peters et al., 2014) to obtain a CPDAG that contains that true causal DAG. To exploit the obtained CPDAG for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection (Zuo et al., 2022) or causal effect identification (Perkovic, 2020; Zuo et al., 2024), but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumption for identification.

Differing from the above work, we propose a novel local method to partially identify the causal effects of sensitive attributes on the predictor for satisfying the interventional fairness. Interestingly, our approach does not require a global search of all possible DAGs, but can estimate all possible causal effects using the obtained CPDAG. In the following, we first theoretically state the necessary and sufficient condition for discriminating a set to be a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute for CPDAG and MPDAG, respectively, from which we propose a local method for finding all possible parent sets of sensitive attributes and estimating the corresponding propensities (Sec. 3.2). We then calculate the all possible degrees of intervention fairness being violated using all possible estimated propensities (Sec. 3.3). Finally, we further propose a min-max joint learning approach to make the predictor satisfy intervention fairness by controlling for worst-case fairness violation (Sec. 3.4).

### Finding Possible Parental Sets and Estimating Propensities

Given a CPDAG obtained from observational data, since enumerating all DAGs is infeasible when the size of the Markov equivalence class is large (He et al., 2015; Zuo et al., 2022), we propose to adopt a novel framework called IDA (Maathuis et al., 2009; Fang and He, 2020) to only enumerate possible parental sets of the sensitive attribute. This provides a more efficient solution since enumerating possible parental sets only requires the local structure around the sensitive attribute. We further extend the above theoretical results to MPDAGs with background knowledge added, and estimate possible propensities by regressing sensitive attribute on each possible parental set.

**Definition 3.1** (v-structure).: For three distinct vertices \(X_{i},X_{j}\) and \(X_{k}\), if \(X_{i}\to X_{j}\gets X_{k}\) and \(X_{i}\) is not adjacent to \(X_{k}\) in \(\mathcal{G}\), then the triplet \((X_{i},X_{j},X_{k})\) is called a v-structure collided on \(X_{j}\).

Pearl (2009) have shown that two DAGs are equivalent if and only if they have the same skeleton and the same _v-structures_. Given a CPDAG \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) contains all DAGs equivalent to \(\mathcal{G}\) and a sensitive attribute \(A\), the local structure around \(A\) can be divided into three cases: parents \(pa(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\to A\), children \(pa(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\gets A\), and siblings \(sib(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})-A\) with undirected edges. Let \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) be a subset of \(sib(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\), we denote \(\mathcal{G}^{*}_{\mathbf{S}(A)\to A}\) as a DAG that is obtained from CPDAG \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) by changing all undirected edges \(\{Z-A,\forall Z\in\mathbf{S}(A)\}\) into the directed edges \(\{Z\to A,\forall Z\in\mathbf{S}(A)\}\) as parents, and all of other undirected edges \(\{Z-A,\forall Z\not\in\mathbf{S}(A)\}\) into the directed edges with opposite direction \(\{Z\gets A,\forall Z\not\in\mathbf{S}(A)\}\) as children. We say \(\mathbf{S}(A)\to A\) is a possible parental set of the sensitive attribute \(A\) for \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\), if there exists a DAG \(\mathcal{G}\) in the equivalence class \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) with the same directed edges adjacent to \(A\) as \(\mathcal{G}^{*}_{\mathbf{S}(A)\to A}\). Then a sufficient and necessary condition for determining whether a set \(\mathbf{S}(A)\subset\operatorname{sib}(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\) is a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute \(A\) is shown in below.

**Lemma 3.2** (Maathuis et al. (2009)).: _Given a CPDAG \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\), a set \(\mathbf{S}(A)\subset\operatorname{sib}(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\) is a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute \(A\), if and only if there is no more v-structure in \(\mathcal{G}^{*}_{\mathbf{S}(A)\to A}\) than \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\)._

From the above lemma, given any \(\mathbf{S}(A)\subseteq sib(A,\mathcal{G}^{*})\), we can determine whether \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) is a possible parental set from a local way. In particular, let the _induced subgraph_ of \(\mathcal{G}=(V,E)\) over \(V^{\prime}\subseteq V\) be the subgraph \(\mathcal{G}^{\prime}=(V^{\prime},E^{\prime})\) by restricting the edges \(E\) on the set of vertices \(V^{\prime}\), where the edge set \(E^{\prime}\) contains all edges with both endpoints in \(V^{\prime}\). Then Lemma 3.2 is equivalent to check whether the induced subgraph of \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) over \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) is complete, i.e., all vertices in the induced subgraph of \(\mathcal{G}^{*}\) over \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) are adjacent. This is because if there are two vertices \(X_{i}\) and \(X_{j}\) in \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) that are not adjacent, then by Definition 3.1, a v-structure is formed as \(X_{i}\to A\gets X_{j}\).

For MPDAG, a key difference compared with CPDAG is the possible generation of a directed triangular cycle (e.g., \(A\to X_{i}\to X_{j}\to A\)) (Fang and He, 2020), when incorporating the background knowledge and using Meek's rule for orienting undirected edges adjacent to the sensitive attribute \(A\). Motivated by such difference, we entend the theoretical results on CPDAGs to MPDAGs for determining possible parental sets of \(A\), which can also be implemented via a local way.

**Definition 3.3** (Direct triangle structure).: For three distinct vertices \(X_{i},X_{j}\) and \(X_{k}\), if \(X_{i}\to X_{j}\to X_{k}\to X_{i}\), then the triplet \((X_{i},X_{j},X_{k})\) is called a direct triangle structure.

**Lemma 3.4** (Fang and He (2020)).: _Given an MPDAG \(\mathcal{H}\), a set \(\mathbf{S}(A)\subset\mathrm{sib}(A,\mathcal{H})\) is a possible parent set of \(A\), if and only if there is no more direct triangle structure and v-structure in \(\mathcal{H}_{\mathbf{S}(A)\to A}\) than \(\mathcal{H}\)._

From Lemma 3.4, we can conclude that for a given MPDAG \(\mathcal{H}\), it is equivalent to checking whether the induced subgraph of \(\mathcal{H}\) over \(\mathbf{S}(A)\) is complete, as well as there does not exist \(S\in\mathbf{S}(A)\) and \(C\in adj(A,\mathcal{H})\backslash(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}(A))\) such that \(C\to S\), otherwise a direct triangle structrue is formed as \(A\to C\to S\to A\). This provides a efficient way to locally find the possible parental sets of \(A\). Without loss of generality, we denote the set of possible parental sets of \(A\) with a total number \(M\) as

\[\mathcal{S}_{A}=\left\{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(1)}(A),pa(A,\mathcal{ H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(2)}(A),\ldots,pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(M)}(A) \right\}.\]

Next, to estimate \(P(\hat{Y}=y|do(A=a))\) in the interventional fairness notion, for each possible parental set \(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\) with \(m=1,\ldots,M\), we propose to first estimate the corresponding propensity \(P(A\mid pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A))\). Specifically, we use the covariates \(X\) restricted on \(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\), denoted as \(X|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)}\), and train the propensity model \(g(X|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)};\hat{\phi}^{(m)})\) for estimating propensity \(P(A\mid pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A))\) by minimizing

\[\ell(\hat{\phi}^{(m)})= -\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bigl{[}A_{i}\log g(X|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H })\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)})+(1-A_{i})\log\big{(}1-g(X|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup \mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)})\big{)}\bigr{]},\]

where \(\hat{\phi}^{(m)}\) is the propensity model parameter and \(\hat{e}^{(m)}_{i}=g(x_{i}|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)};\hat{ \phi}^{(m)})\) is the estimated propensity of unit \(i\) corresponding to the possible parent set \(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\) for \(i=1,\ldots,N\) and \(m=1,\ldots,M\). Since CPDAGs can be viewed as special cases of MPDAGs, without loss of generality, we summarized the proposed local algorithm on MPDAGs in Alg. 1 (see Alg. 3 in Appendix for implementing the proposed local algorithm on CPDAGs).

### Estimating and Bounding Interventional Fairness

We then aim to estimate and bound all possible causal effects of sensitive attribute \(A\) on the predictor \(\hat{Y}\). Note that each parental set \(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\) is a valid back-door adjustment set in the back-door adjustment formula Pearl (1995, 2009), we have the following identification results.

**Lemma 3.5**.: _With observational data, for \(m\in\{1,\ldots,M\}\), if \(\hat{Y}\notin pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\)3, then the post-intervention distribution can be calculated from the observational data by:_

Footnote 3: It is worth noting that this assumption always holds, since the training of the predictor \(\hat{Y}\) cannot affect the origin sensitive attribute \(A\).

\[P(\hat{Y}=y|do(A=a))= \int P\left(\hat{Y}=y|A=a,pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A )\right)dP\left(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)\] \[= \int\frac{P\left(\hat{Y}=y,A=a|pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{( m)}(A)\right)}{P\left(A=a|pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)}dP \left(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right),\]

_where \(P\left(A=a|pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)\) is estimated via \(g(X|_{pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)};\hat{\phi}^{(m)})\) in Sec. 3.2._

Proof of Lemma 3.5.: \[P(\hat{Y}=y|do(A=a))\] \[= \int P\left(\hat{Y}=y|do(A=a),pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{( m)}(A)\right)dP\left(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)\] \[= \int P\left(\hat{Y}=y|A=a,pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A )\right)dP\left(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)\] \[= \int\frac{P\left(\hat{Y}=y,A=a|pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{( m)}(A)\right)}{P\left(A=a|pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right)}dP \left(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\right),\]

where the first and the third equations are from the conditional probability formula.

From Lemma 3.5, for each possible parental set \(pa(A,\mathcal{H})\cup\mathbf{S}^{(m)}(A)\) with \(m=1,\ldots,M\), given estimated propensities \(\hat{e}_{i}^{(m)}\) in Sec. 3.2, we can train a treatment effect estimation model \(h(x_{i};\hat{\psi}^{(m)})=\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}\) to estimate \(P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=1))-P(\hat{Y}=y\mid do(A=0))\) by minimizing

\[\ell(\hat{\psi}^{(m)})= \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\bigl{(}\frac{A_{i}f(x_{i};\theta)}{ \hat{e}_{i}^{(m)}}-\frac{(1-A_{i})f(x_{i};\theta)}{1-\hat{e}_{i}^{(m)}}-h(x_{i };\hat{\psi}^{(m)})\bigr{)}^{2},\]

where \(f(x_{i};\theta)=\hat{Y}_{i}\) is an outcome predictor parameterized by \(\theta\), and \(h(x_{i};\hat{\psi}^{(m)})=\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}\) aims to evaluate the interventional fairness violation of that learned predictor.

### Min-Max Joint Learning Approach

We now aim to train a predictor to satisfy interventional fairness. Since the parental set of the sensitive attribute in the true DAG is unknown, we propose a min-max learning approach to control for the worst-case interventional fairness violations of the predictor. Specifically, given all possible causal effects \(\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}\) of the sensitive attribute \(A\) on the predictor \(\hat{Y}\) in Section 3.3, the prediction model \(\hat{Y}=f(x;\theta)\) is trained by minimizing the average prediction error with the worst-case violations of interventional fairness as a penalty term

\[\min_{\theta}\ell(\theta;\hat{\psi}^{(1)},\ldots,\hat{\psi}^{(M )})=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i}-f(x_{i};\theta))^{2}+\gamma\cdot\max_{m} \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\xi_{i}^{(m)},\] s.t. \[\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}\leq C+\xi_{i}^{(m)},\;i=1,\ldots,N,\;m=1, \ldots,M,\] \[\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}\geq-C-\xi_{i}^{(m)},\;i=1,\ldots,N,\;m=1, \ldots,M,\] \[\xi_{i}^{(m)}\geq 0,\;i=1,\ldots,N,\;m=1,\ldots,M,\]which is a convex optimization problem when \(\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}=h(x_{i};\hat{\psi}^{(m)})\) is linear. It is equivalent to

\[\min_{\theta}\tilde{\ell}(\theta)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i}-f(x_{i}; \theta))^{2}+\lambda\cdot\max_{m}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\Big{[}(-C-\hat{\tau }_{i}^{(m)})_{+}+(\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}-C)_{+}\Big{]},\]

where \(\gamma\) and \(\lambda\) are hyper-parameters for trade-off between prediction accuracy and interventional fairness. Since achieving strict interventional fairness for all individuals, i.e., having zero causal effects of sensitive attribute on the predictor, is usually unrealistic and would come at the cost of much prediction accuracy, we introduce a slack variable \(\xi_{i}^{(m)}\) for each individual and a pre-specified threshold \(C\), which penalizes the loss when the estimated causal effect \(|\hat{\tau}_{i}^{(m)}|>C\). Note that when implementing the proposed min-max optimization approach, the treatment effect estimation models for evaluating the fairness violations in Section 3.3 and the prediction model controlling for worse-case fairness violations in Section 3.4 should be updated _alternatively_, which can be viewed as an iterative process of _interventional fairness evaluation_ and _policy improvement_ of the prediction model. We summarized the whole min-max optimization algorithm in Alg. 2.

**Algorithm 2**A min-max optimization approach alternatively updating possible counterfactual treatment effect models and prediction model controlling the worse-case fairness violations.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, both synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy and fairness of our approach. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between \(Y\) and \(\hat{Y}\) is used to measure the prediction performance, and the RMSE between \(\hat{Y}|do(A=a)\) and \(\hat{Y}|do(A=a^{\prime})\) is used to measure the violation of the interventional fairness, named "unfairness".

**Baselines.** We consider six baseline prediction models: (1) **Full** uses all attributes, (2) **Unaware** uses all attributes except the sensitive attribute, (3) **Oracle** uses all attributes that are non-descendants of the sensitive attribute given the ground-truth DAG, (4) **FairRelax** uses all definite non-descendants and possible descendants of the sensitive attribute in a CPDAG (or an MPDAG), (5) **Fair** uses all definite non-descendants of the sensitive attribute in a CPDAG (or an MPDAG), and (6) \(\epsilon\)**-IFair** uses all attributes and implement the constrained optimization problem.

**Synthetic Study.** Synthetic data are generated from a linear structural equation model based on a ground-truth DAG. Specifically, we first randomly generate a DAG with \(d\) nodes and \(2d\) directed edges according to the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model with \(d\in\left\{10,20,30,40\right\}\) in our experiment. Following the previous studies (Zuo et al., 2022, 2024), the path coefficients \(\beta_{jk}\) of directed edges \(X_{j}\to X_{k}\) are sampled from a uniform distribution \(\mathrm{U}([-2,-0.5]\cup[0.5,2])\). The data are generated using \(X_{k}=\sum_{X_{j}\in pa(X_{k})}\beta_{jk}X_{j}+\epsilon_{i},i=1,\dots,n\), where \(pa\left(X_{k}\right)\) represents the parent nodes of \(X_{k}\), noise \(\epsilon_{i}\sim N(0,\gamma)\) with \(\gamma\in\left\{1.5,2.5\right\}\), and \(n\) is the sample size, which is set to 1,000 in our 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

As \(p\) increases, due to the presence of more backdoor paths, the RMSE performance and unfairness performance of all methods decreases, however, our method still outperforms the baseline methods.

**The Performance on the Classification Problem.** We conduct more experiments to examine if the proposed method can be applied to classification problems. Specifically, we modify the data generation process (DGP) to clip the outcome variable \(Y\) to 1 if \(Y>0\), and to 0 if \(Y\leq 0\), and the rest DGP remains the same. In this scenario, we adopt AUC as the evaluation metric instead of RMSE. The experiment results are shown in Table 4. We find that both **Full** and **Unaware** perform better on AUC, while **Fair**, **FairRelax**, \(\epsilon\)**-IFair**, and our approach perform better on unfairness. Note that our approach outperforms **Fair**, **FairRelax**, and \(\epsilon\)**-IFair** in all scenarios for both AUC and unfairness.

**Case Study.** The sensitive attributes contained in many widely used datasets for fair machine learning have no parent nodes, such as sex in the Adult dataset4[Kohavi, 1996] and race in the COMPAS dataset5[Angwin et al., 2022]. Because sex, race, and age cannot be affected by other collected features, we further consider the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) dataset6[Kuzilek et al., 2017], in which disability is treated as the sensitive attribute and final_grade is treated as the outcome. The COMPAS dataset contains 6,172 units with 9 attributes such as gender and number_of_priors, the Adult dataset contains 48,842 units with 14 attributes such as age, education, and race, and the OULAD dataset contains 32,593 units with 11 attributes including demographic information such as gender, age, education_level, etc. For this case study, we first learn a CPDAG from the raw data using the PC algorithm in the causal-learn package and obtain an MPDAG with the background knowledge such as sex can not be caused by other attributes.

we randomly generate a DAG as the ground-truth from the learned MPDAG. After obtaining the DAG, we then divide the data into 100 random batches, and for each batch, we learn an MPDAG from the observed data and background knowledge. The path coefficients are determined based on linear regression and regard the residual of the regression as noise. The subsequent steps are the same as in the synthetic study. The experiment results are shown in Table 5, with density plots in Figure 3. First, both \(\epsilon\)-**IFair** and our method demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both prediction performance and fairness compared to other baselines. In addition, our method stably outperforms \(\epsilon\)-**IFair**, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed min-max joint learning approach.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper aims to achieve interventional fairness from observational data when the causal graph is unknown or partially known. Interestingly, we show it is actually sufficient to enumerate all possible parental sets of the sensitive attributes via a local approach, instead of enumerating all DAGs at high computational cost. We then propose a general min-max optimization framework to achieve interventional fairness that is easy applicable to CPDAGs and maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with the added background knowledge. One limitation of our approach is due to the proposed approach relying on a CPDAG given by the causal discovery algorithm and estimations of the propensities, which may lead to mild violations of interventional fairness when the CPDAG or estimates are inaccurate. Another possible limitation, which also serves as a future research direction, is to achieve interventional fairness in the presence of hidden variables with partially known DAGs.

## Broader Impacts

This paper proposes a general min-max optimization framework that can effectively achieve interventional fairness when the true causal graph is unknown or partially known. In contrast to statistical fairness, interventional fairness considers possible counterfactual decision-makings, not just based on the observed data. The implications of achieving interventional fairness in algorithms where the true causal graph is unknown or partially known are mainly in the following aspects. First, reducing bias: machine learning models may learn and reflect bias in the training data and unconsciously apply this bias to individuals in their predictions. interventional fairness helps reduce this possible bias. Second, improve fairness: if we can achieve interventional fairness on partially known causal graphs, our models will be prevented from treating unfairly because of the sensitive attributes. Third, enhancing trust: as our algorithms are able to process data in a fairer way, people's trust in those algorithms increases. This is critical in many areas, such as healthcare, finance, and justice. Fourth, promote policy making: understanding and addressing interventional fairness issues in algorithms can help policy makers better understand and regulate these technologies to ensure their fairness and transparency in practice. In a nutshell, studying how to effectively achieve interventional fairness in scenarios such as unknown causal graphs or the presence of hidden variables is both challenging and socially significant, and deserves more effort.

## Appendix A More Discussion on the Previous Work

To tackle the above problem, a recent work (Zuo et al., 2022) proposes to use observed data to first classify variables into three categories: _definite non-descendants_, _possible descendants_, and _definite descendants_ of the sensitive attributes. Next, by noting that a prediction model would be counterfactually fair if the prediction model is a function of the non-descendants of sensitive attributes (Kusner et al., 2017), as shown in Table 6, Fair method is proposed to use only the definite non-descendants, and FairRelax method further incorporates possible descendants.

However, both Fair and FairRelax forbid the use of definite descendants for model prediction, which greatly compromises the prediction accuracy. In particular, the sensitive attribute is usually an inherent nature of data, making most of the attributes are its descendants (Wu et al., 2019).

We proceed with a toy example for illustration: Figure 4(a) shows a sampled DAG as the ground-truth, and given the observed data, Fair and FairRelax algorithms first learn a Markov equivalence

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Variables (example in Figure 4(b)) & Fair & FairRelax & Ours \\ \hline Definite non-descendants (\(\emptyset\)) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Possible descendants (\(X_{1},X_{2}\)) & \(\times\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Definite descendants (\(\emptyset\)) & \(\times\) & \(\times\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Comparison of methods to achieve interventional fairness from PDAGs. Both Fair and FairRelax employ a two-stage approach: they first learn a CPDAG from observed data, and then make prediction with the definite non-descendants (and possible descendants) of the sensitive attribute. Our method alternatively updates the predictions using _all_ variables and possible counterfactual treatment effects via a min-max optimization.

Figure 4: A toy example for illustration: Fair has _no available variables_ for prediction; FairRelax uses \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\)_without_ further fairness constraint; Ours uses \(\{A,X_{1},X_{2}\}\)_with_ a min-max constraint bounding all possible counterfactual treatment effect.

class of DAGs that encode the same set of conditional independencies from the data, also known as a completely partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG), as shown in Figure 4(b). One on hand, the _definite non-descendants_ of sensitive attribute \(A\) is a empty set, thus Fair is unable to return valid prediction model. On the other hand, the _possible descendants_ of the sensitive attribute \(A\) are \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\), thus FairRelax uses both \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) to predict \(Y\) by minimizing the empirical risk _without imposing any further fairness constraint_. However, such relaxation would lead to a serious violation of interventional fairness, due to the nodes used (\(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) in this example) for outcome regression might be descendants of the sensitive attribute \(A\) in the true DAG, as in Figure 4(a).

When the true causal graph is unknown, to the best of our knowledge, Zuo et al. (2022) performed the first work to obtain an interventional fairness predictor on an MPDAG, which focuses on utilizing the properties of the causal graph (Level 1 in Kusner et al. (2017)) - to make predictions with the definite non-descendants (and possible descendants) of the sensitive attribute, as shown in Table 6. However, further incorporating the descendants of sensitive attribute into the predictor may also achieve interventional fairness by "cancelling out" the counterfactual treatment effects, which utilizes the observed variables more sufficiently and further improves the accuracy of the prediction.

We provide an intuition for the rationality and the advantages of using all variables by adopting the toy example in Figure 4. Suppose the structural equations in Figure 4(a) are: \(A=U_{A}\), \(X_{1}=A+U_{1}\), \(X_{2}=A+U_{2}\), and \(Y=2X_{1}+X_{2}+U_{Y}\), which satisfies the faithfulness assumption (Uhler et al., 2013). In such a case, as discussed before, the Fair algorithm proposed in Zuo et al. (2022) prevents all variables from predicting \(Y\), while the FairRelax algorithm uses both \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) to predict \(Y\) without imposing any fairness constraints, and therefore cannot achieve causal fairness, since \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) are descendants of \(A\). To achieve more accurate predictions with interventional

Figure 5: The visualization of four rules of Meek’s criteria. If the graph on the left-hand side of a rule is an induced subgraph of a PDAG \(\mathcal{G}\), then orient the undirected edge such that the resulting subgraph is the one on the right-hand side of the rule.

fairness guarantees, one may notice that a function of \(X_{1}-X_{2}\) can be used to predict \(Y\). On the one hand, this is strictly counterfactually fair due to the fact that \(X_{1}-X_{2}=U_{1}-U_{2}\), which is independent of the sensitive attribute \(A\). On the other hand, this is informative for predicting \(Y\) due to \(\operatorname{Cov}(X_{1}-X_{2},Y)=2\operatorname{Var}(U_{1})-\operatorname{ Var}(U_{2})\neq 0\).

However, the true DAG and the corresponding structural equations are unknown in many real-world scenarios, which poses a great challenge to estimate the possible counterfactual treatment effects. To address this problem, an intuitive approach is to first find a Markov equivalence class over all vertices, which can be achieved using standard causal discovery methods, e.g., PC (Spirtes et al., 2000) and GES (Chickering, 2002b), and then to globally enumerate all the possible DAGs in the equivalence class and estimate their causal effects for each. However, as discussed in Section 7 of Zuo et al. (2022), this intuitive way to enumerate all DAGs is computationally expensive and unrealistic.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the abstract and the introduction, we accurately describe the paper's contributions from four aspects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We present two limitations in the conclusion. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We present detailed proofs in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The codes are provided in the supplemental material, and the results can be reproduced by running the provided code. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The codes are provided in the supplemental material and the used dataset is public available. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental details are presented in the experiment section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental results are reported with error bars. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: There is no requirement for the experiments, and we only use the laptop CPU to run all experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: There is no ethical problem with our code. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We present the broader impact in Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: There is no such risks about our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have included CC-BY 4.0 license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
