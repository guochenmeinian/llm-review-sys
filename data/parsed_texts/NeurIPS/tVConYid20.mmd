[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

work such as ThunkerKitten [51] and cuDNN 9 [39] has shown that with Hopper-specific instructions and tile-based abstractions, one can speedup attention computation and simplify the implementation.

More fundamentally, FlashAttention-2's algorithm adheres to a simplified synchronous model and makes no explicit use of asynchrony and low-precision in its design. Asynchrony is a result of hardware specialization to accelerate the most important operations in a ML workload: specific hardware units performing matrix multiplication (Tensor Cores) or memory loading (Tensor Memory Accelerator - TMA), separate from the rest of the CUDA cores performing logic, integer, and floating point computation. Low precision such as FP8 in Hopper and FP4 in Blackwell, continuing the trend of FP16 (Pascal in 2017) and BF16 (Ampere in 2020), is a proven technique to get double or quadruple throughput for the same power and chip area. We review the capabilities afforded by Hopper in these directions in SS2.2. The technical challenge is to redesign FlashAttention-2 to make use of these hardware features: asynchrony requires overlapping computation between matmul and softmax even though one depends on the output of the other, and low-precision requires care to minimize quantization error, especially in the case of outlier features in LLMs [20; 53].

To this end, we propose FlashAttention-3, which contributes and synthesizes three new ideas to further improve performance on newer GPU architectures:2

Footnote 2: We describe our results in the context of NVIDIA’s Hopper architecture. However, our algorithm is operative for any GPU architecture with sufficiently robust asynchronous execution and low-precision capabilities.

1. **Producer-Consumer asynchrony:** We define a warp-specialized software pipelining scheme that exploits the asynchronous execution of data movement and Tensor Cores by splitting producers and consumers of data into separate warps, thereby extending the algorithm's ability to hide memory and instruction issue latencies.
2. **Hiding softmax under asynchronous block-wise GEMMs:** We overlap the comparatively low-throughput non-GEMM operations involved in softmax, such as floating point multiply-add and exponential, with the asynchronous WGMMA instructions for GEMM. As part of this, we rework the FlashAttention-2 algorithm to circumvent certain sequential dependencies between softmax and the GEMMs. For example, in the 2-stage version of our algorithm, while softmax executes on one block of the scores matrix, WGMMA executes in the asynchronous proxy to compute the next block.
3. **Hardware-accelerated low-precision GEMM:** We adapt the forward pass algorithm to allow for targeting the FP8 Tensor Cores for GEMM, nearly doubling the measured TFLOPs/s. This requires bridging the different layout conformance requirements of WGMMA in terms of how blocks of FP32 accumulator and FP8 operand matrices are assumed to be laid out in memory. We use the techniques of block quantization and incoherent processing to mitigate the loss of accuracy that results from moving to FP8 precision.

To validate our method empirically, we benchmark FlashAttention-3 on the H100 SXM5 GPU over a range of parameters and show that (1) BF16 achieves 1.5-2.0x speedup over FlashAttention-2 in the forward pass (reaching up to 840 TFLOPs/s) and 1.5-1.75x in the backward pass, (2) FP8 achieves 1.3 PFLOPs/s, and (3) for large sequence length, BF16 outperforms and FP8 is on par compared to the state-of-the-art implementation of attention from NVIDIA's cuDNN library. We also validate that FP16 FlashAttention-3 yields the same numerical error as FlashAttention-2 and is better than the standard attention implementation as intermediate results (e.g., softmax rescaling) are kept in FP32. Moreover, FP8 FlashAttention-3 with block quantization and incoherent processing is 2.6x more accurate than standard attention with per-tensor quantization in cases with outlier features.

We open-source FlashAttention-3 with a permissive license3 and plan to integrate it with PyTorch to benefit the largest number of researchers and developers.

## 2 Background: Multi-Head Attention and GPU Characteristics

### Multi-Head Attention

Let \(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{K},\mathbf{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}\) be the query, key and value input sequences associated to a single head, where \(N\) is the sequence length and \(d\) is the head dimension. Then the attention output \(\mathbf{O}\) is computed as:

\[\mathbf{S}\!=\!\alpha\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^{\top}\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}, \quad\mathbf{P}\!=\!\mathrm{softmax}(\mathbf{S})\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}, \quad\mathbf{O}\!=\!\mathbf{PV}\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^{N\times d},\]

where softmax is applied row-wise and one typically sets \(\alpha\!=\!1/\sqrt{d}\) as the scaling factor. In practice, we subtract \(\mathrm{rowmax}(\mathbf{S})\) from \(\mathbf{S}\) to prevent numerical instability with the exponential function. For multi-head attention (MHA), each head has its own set of query, key and value projections, and this computation parallelizes across multiple heads and batches to produce the full output tensor.

Now let \(\phi\) be a scalar loss function and let \(\mathbf{d}(-)=\partial\phi/\partial(-)\) be notation for the gradient. Given the output gradient \(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}\), we compute \(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{Q}\), \(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{K}\), and \(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{V}\) according to the chain rule as follows:

\[\mathbf{d}\mathbf{V} =\mathbf{P}^{\top}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}, \mathbf{d}\mathbf{P} =\mathbf{d}\mathbf{O}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N},\] \[\mathbf{d}\mathbf{S} =\operatorname{dsoftmax}(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{P})\in\mathbb{R}^{N \times N}, \mathbf{d}\mathbf{Q} =\alpha\mathbf{d}\mathbf{S}\mathbf{K}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}, \mathbf{d}\mathbf{K}=\alpha\mathbf{d}\mathbf{S}^{\top}\mathbf{Q}\in\mathbb{R} ^{N\times d}.\]

Here, we have that \(\mathbf{d}s=(\operatorname{diag}(p)-p\,p^{\top})\mathbf{d}p\) for \(p=\operatorname{softmax}(s)\) as a function of a vector \(s\), and we write \(\operatorname{dsoftmax}(\mathbf{d}\mathbf{P})\) for this formula applied row-wise. Finally, this computation again parallelizes across the number of heads and batches for the backward pass of MHA.

### GPU hardware characteristics and execution model

We describe the aspects of the GPU's execution model relevant for FlashAttention-3, with a focus on the NVIDIA Hopper architecture as a concrete instantiation of this model.

Memory hierarchy:The GPU's memories are organized as a hierarchy of data locales, with capacity inversely related to bandwidth (Table 1)4. Global memory (GMEM), also known as HBM, is the off-chip DRAM accessible to all streaming multiprocessors (SMs). Data from GMEM gets transparently cached into an on-chip L2 cache. Next, each SM contains a small on-chip, programmer-managed highly banked cache called shared memory (SMEM). Lastly, there is the register file within each SM.

Footnote 4: Luo et al. [34] reports shared memory bandwidth of 128 bytes per clock cycle per SM, and we multiply that by 132 SMs and the boost clock of 1830 MHz.

Thread hierarchy:The GPU's programming model is organized around logical groupings of execution units called threads. From the finest to coarsest level, the thread hierarchy is comprised of threads, warps (32 threads), warpgroups (4 contiguous warps), threadblocks (i.e., cooperative thread arrays or CTAs), threadblock clusters (in Hopper), and grids.

These two hierarchies are closely interlinked. Threads in the same CTA are co-scheduled on the same SM, and CTAs in the same cluster are co-scheduled on the same GPC. SMEM is directly addressable by all threads within a CTA, whereas each thread has at most 256 registers (RMEM) private to itself.

Asynchrony and warp-specialization:GPUs are throughput processors that rely on concurrency and asynchrony to hide memory and execution latencies. For async memory copy between GMEM and SMEM, Hopper has the Tensor Memory Accelerator (TMA) as a dedicated hardware unit [38, SS7.29]. Furthermore, unlike prior architectures such as Ampere, the Tensor Core of Hopper, exposed via the warpgroup-wide WGMMA instruction [40, SS9.7.14], is also asynchronous and can source its inputs directly from shared memory.

Hardware support for asynchrony allows for warp-specialized kernels, where the warps of a CTA are divided into producer or consumer roles that only ever issue either data movement or computation. Generically, this improves the compiler's ability to generate optimal instruction schedules [4]. In addition, Hopper supports the dynamic reallocation of registers between warpgroups via setmaxnreg [40, SS9.7.17.1], so those warps doing MMAs can obtain a larger share of RMEM than those just issuing TMA (for which only a single thread is needed).

Low-precision number formats:Modern GPUs have specialized hardware units for accelerating low-precision computation. For example, the WGMMA instruction can target the FP8 Tensor Cores on Hopper to deliver 2x the throughput per SM when compared to FP16 or BF16.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|l|l|} \hline
**Hardware Level** & **Parallel Agent** & **Data Locale** & **Capacity @ Bandwidth** \\ \hline Chip & Grid & GMEM & 80 GiB @ 3.35 TB/s \\ GPC & Threadblock Clusters & L2 & 50 MiB @ 12 TB/s \\ SM & Threadblock (CTA) & SMEM & 228 KiB per SM, 31TB/s per GPU \\ Thread & Thread & RMEM & 256 KiB per SM \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Thread-Memory hierarchy for the NVIDIA Hopper H100 SXM5 GPU.

However, correctly invoking FP8 WGMMA entails understanding the layout constraints on its operands. Given a GEMM call to multiply \(A\times B^{\top}\) for an \(M\times K\)-matrix \(A\) and an \(N\times K\)-matrix \(B\), we say that the \(A\) or \(B\) operand is _mn-major_ if it is contiguous in the outer \(M\) or \(N\) dimension, and _k-major_ if is instead contiguous in the inner \(K\)-dimension. Then for FP16 WGMMA, both mn-major and k-major input operands are accepted for operands in SMEM, but for FP8 WGMMA, only the k-major format is supported. Moreover, in situations such as attention where one wants to fuse back-to-back GEMMs in a single kernel, clashing FP32 accumulator and FP8 operand layouts pose an obstacle to invoking dependent FP8 WGMMAs.

In the context of attention, these layout restrictions entail certain modifications to the design of an FP8 algorithm, which we describe in SS3.3.

### Standard Attention and Flash Attention

Following Dao et al. [16], we let **standard attention** denote an implementation of attention on the GPU that materializes the intermediate matrices \(\mathbf{S}\) and \(\mathbf{P}\) to HBM. The main idea of FlashAttention was to leverage a local version of the softmax reduction to avoid these expensive intermediate reads/writes and fuse attention into a single kernel. Local softmax corresponds to lines 18-19 of the consumer mainloop in Algorithm 1 together with the rescalings of blocks of \(\mathbf{O}\). The simple derivation that this procedure indeed computes \(\mathbf{O}\) can be found in [14, SS2.3.1].

## 3 FlashAttention-3: Algorithm

In this section, we describe the FlashAttention-3 algorithm. For simplicity, we focus on the forward pass, with the backward pass algorithm described in Appendix B.1. We first indicate how to integrate warp-specialization with a circular SMEM buffer into the base algorithm of FlashAttention-2. We then explain how to exploit asynchrony of WGMMA to define an overlapped GEMM-softmax 2-stage pipeline. Finally, we describe the modifications needed for FP8, both in terms of layout conformance and accuracy via block quantization and incoherent processing.

### Producer-Consumer asynchrony through warp-specialization and pingpong scheduling

Warp-specializationAs with FlashAttention-2, the forward pass of FlashAttention-3 is embarrassingly parallel in the batch size, number of heads, and query sequence length. Thus, it will suffice to give a CTA-level view of the algorithm, which operates on a tile \(\mathbf{Q}_{i}\) of the query matrix to compute the corresponding tile \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) of the output. To simplify the description, we first give the warp-specialization scheme with a circular SMEM buffer that does _not_ have in addition the GEMM-softmax overlapping. Let \(d\) be the head dimension, \(N\) the sequence length, and fix a query block size \(B_{r}\) to divide \(\mathbf{Q}\) into \(T_{r}=\lceil\frac{N}{B_{r}}\rceil\) blocks \(\mathbf{Q}_{1}\),..,\(\mathbf{Q}_{T_{r}}\).

For our implementation of Algorithm 1 on Hopper, we use setmaxreg for (de)allocations, TMA for loads of \(\mathbf{Q}_{i}\) and \(\{\mathbf{K}_{j},\mathbf{V}_{j}\}_{0\leq j<T_{c}}\), and WGMMA to execute the GEMMs in the consumer mainloop, with the SS or RS prefix indicating whether the first operand is sourced from shared memory or register file. For interpreting the execution flow of Algorithm 1, note that issuing TMA loads does not stall on the completion of other loads due to asynchrony. Moreover, in the producer mainloop, no waits will be issued for the first \(s\) iterations as the buffer gets filled.

Pingpong schedulingThe asynchronous nature of WGMMA and TMA, along with warp-specialization, opens up the opportunity to overlap the softmax computation of one warpgroup with the GEMM of another warpgroup. To motivate this, notice that non-matmul operations have much lower throughput than matmul operations on modern hardware accelerators. As an example, the H100 SXM5 GPU has 989 TFLOPS of FP16 matmul but only 3.9 TFLOPS of special functions such as exponential5 (necessary for softmax). For the attention forward pass in FP16 with head dimension 128, there are 512x more matmul FLOPS compared to exponential operations, but the exponential has 256x lower throughput, so exponential can take 50% of the cycle compared to matmul. The situation is even worse with FP8, where the matmul throughput doubles but the exponential throughput stays the same.

Since the exponential is performed by a separate hardware unit (the multi-function unit), ideally we'd want the exponential calculation to be scheduled when the Tensor Cores are performing the matmul. To do so, we use synchronization barriers (bar.sync instructions) to force the GEMMs (GEMM1 - \(\mathbf{PV}\) of one iteration, and GEMM0 - \(\mathbf{QK}^{\top}\) of the next iteration) of warpgroup 1 to be scheduled before the GEMMs of warpgroup 2. As a result, the softmax of warpgroup 1 will be scheduled while warpgroup 2 is performing its GEMMs. Then the roles swap, with warpgroup 2 doing softmax while warpgroup 1 doing GEMMs (hence, "pingpong" scheduling). This is illustrated in Fig. 1. Though in practice the pingpong scheduling is not as clean as depicted in the figure, we generally find this to improve performance (e.g., from 570 TFLOPS to 620-640 TFLOPS for FP16 forward with head dimension 128 and sequence length 8192).

Attention variantsFor multi-query attention [50] and grouped query attention [3], we follow the approach in FlashAttention-2 and adjust the tensor indexing to avoid duplicating \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\) in HBM.

Figure 1: Pingpong scheduling for 2 warpgroups to overlap softmax and GEMMs: the softmax of one warpgroup should be scheduled when the GEMMs of another warpgroup are running. The same color denotes the same iteration.

### Intra-wargroup overlapping GEMMs and softmax

Even within one warpgroup, we can overlap some instructions in the softmax with some instructions in the GEMMs. We describe one technique to do so.

In the attention algorithm, operations within the inner loop (main loop) have sequential dependencies that impede parallelization within a single iteration. For example, (local) softmax (lines 18 to 19) relies on the output \(\mathbf{S}_{i}^{(j)}\) of the first GEMM, while the second GEMM takes its result \(\widetilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}^{(j)}\) as an operand. Indeed, the wait statements in lines 17 and 21 of Algorithm 1 serialize the execution of softmax and GEMMs. However, we can break these dependencies by pipelining across iterations through additional buffers in registers. Pursuing this idea, we propose the following two-stage6 GEMM-softmax pipelining algorithm:

Footnote 6: Note that the number of stages of the overlapping scheme is bounded by, but need not equal, the number \(s\) of stages in the circular SMEM buffer.

**Algorithm 2** FlashAttention-3 consumer warpgroup forward pass

Algorithm 2 functions as a replacement for the consumer path of Algorithm 1 to comprise the complete FlashAttention-3 algorithm for FP16 precision. At a high-level, we use WGMMA as a metonym for asynchronous GEMM. Within the mainloop (lines 8 to 16), the second WGMMA operation of iteration \(j\) (line 11) is overlapped with softmax operations from iteration \(j+1\) (line 13).

While the pipelined structure illustrated above offers theoretical performance gains, there are several practical aspects to consider:

Figure 2: 2-stage WGMMA-softmax pipeliningCompiler reorderingThe pseudocode represents an idealized execution order but the compiler (NVCC) often rearranges instructions for optimization. This can disrupt the carefully crafted WGMMA and non-WGMMA operation pipelining sequence, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or diminished performance gains. An analysis of the SASS code shows that the compiler generates overlapped code as expected (Section B.2).

Register pressureTo maintain optimal performance, register spilling should be minimized. However, the 2-stage pipeline requires additional registers to store intermediate results and maintain context between stages. Specifically, an extra \(\mathbf{S}_{\text{next}}\) must be kept in registers, leading to extra register usage of size \(B_{r}\times B_{c}\times\)sizeof(float) per threadblock. This increased register demand may conflict with using larger block sizes (another common optimization), which is also register-hungry. In practice, trade-offs should be made based on profiling results.

3-stage pipeliningExtending the 2-stage algorithm described above, we propose a 3-stage variant that would further overlap the second WGMMA with softmax. While this approach offers the potential for even higher Tensor Core utilization, it requires even more registers due to an additional stage in the pipeline, making the trade-off between tile size and pipeline depth more difficult to balance. A detailed description of the 3-stage algorithm and its evaluation results can be found in Appendix B.3.

### Low-precision with FP8

Efficiency: FP8 layout for accumulator and operand.Computing the forward pass of FlashAttention-3 in FP8 precision poses two additional challenges not encountered for FP16 in terms of layout conformance. The first relates to the datatype conversion of the first WGMMA's FP32 accumulator to the second WGMMA's lower-precision (FP16 or FP8) operand, which was left implicit in Algorithm 1. Specifically, after downcasting to FP8, we need to transform the register ownership pattern from that depicted in Fig. 3 into Fig. 4, repeated per every four threads of the consumer warpgroups.

In Appendix B.7, we give a solution for this in code using shuffle instructions.

Secondly, the k-major constraint on FP8 WGMMA explained in SS2.2 entails clashing assumptions on how \(\mathbf{Q}\), \(\mathbf{K}\), and \(\mathbf{V}\) are laid out in global memory, since the TMA load cannot change the contiguous dimension. Namely, \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{K}\) should be contiguous in the head dimension, whereas \(\mathbf{V}\) should be contiguous in the sequence length dimension. We perform in-kernel transposition of the \(\mathbf{V}_{j}\) tiles in SMEM prior to invoking the second FP8 WGMMA, since in practice, \(\mathbf{V}\) is typically assumed to be contiguous in the head dimension. In Appendix B.8, we describe in details how to perform the \(\mathbf{V}\) transpose as part of the attention kernel itself.

Accuracy: block quantization and incoherent processing.With FP8 (e4m3) format, one only uses 3 bits to store the mantissa and 4 bits for the exponent. This results in higher numerical error than FP16/BF16. Moreover, large models typically have outlier values [20; 53] that are much larger in magnitude than most other values, making quantization difficult. One typically use per-tensor scaling [37] by keeping one scalar per tensor (e.g., one for \(\mathbf{Q}\), for \(\mathbf{K}\), and for \(\mathbf{V}\)). To reduce the numerical error of attention in FP8, we employ two techniques:

1. **Block quantization**: we keep one scalar per block, so that for each of \(\mathbf{Q}\), \(\mathbf{K}\), \(\mathbf{V}\) we split the tensor into blocks of size \(B_{r}\times d\) or \(B_{c}\times d\) and quantize them separately. This quantization can be fused with an operation right before attention (e.g., rotary embedding) with no additional slow down (since rotary embedding is memory-bandwidth bound). As the FlashAttention-3 algorithm naturally operates on blocks, we can scale each block of \(\mathbf{S}\) to account for this block quantization at no computation cost.

Figure 4: FP8 operand A register WGMMA layout – rows 0 and 8, threads 0-3, entries 0-7.

Figure 3: FP32 accumulator register WGMMA layout – rows 0 and 8, threads 0-3, entries 0-7.

2. **Incoherent processing**: to even outliers, we multiply \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{K}\) with a random orthogonal matrix \(\mathbf{M}\) before quantizing to FP8. Since \(\mathbf{M}\) is orthogonal, \(\mathbf{M}\mathbb{M}^{\top}=I\) and so \((\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{M})(\mathbf{K}\mathbf{M})^{\top}=\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^{\top}\), i.e., multiplying both \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(\mathbf{K}\) with \(\mathbf{M}\) does not change the attention output. This serves to "spread out" the outliers since each entry of \(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{M}\) or \(\mathbf{K}\) is a random sum of entries of \(\mathbf{Q}\) or \(\mathbf{K}\), thus reducing quantization error. In practice, we follow Chee et al. [8] and Tseng et al. [57] and choose \(\mathbf{M}\) to be the product of random diagonal matrices of \(\pm 1\) and a Hadamard matrix, which can be multiplied in \(O(d\log d)\) instead of \(O(d^{2})\), and can also be fused with the rotary embedding at no extra computation cost.

We validate that these two techniques reduces numerical error by up to \(2.6\times\) in SS4.3.

## 4 Empirical Validation

We use the primitives from CUTLASS [56] such as WGMMA and TMA abstractions to implement FlashAttention-3 and evaluate its efficiency and accuracy.

* **Benchmarking attention.** We measure the runtime of FlashAttention-3 across different sequence lengths and compare it to a standard implementation in PyTorch, FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-2 in Triton (which uses H100-specific instructions), as well as a vendor's implementation of FlashAttention-2 optimized for H100 GPUs from cuDNN. We confirm that FlashAttention-3 is up to \(2.0\times\) faster than FlashAttention-2 and \(1.5\times\) faster than FlashAttention-2 in Triton. FlashAttention-3 reaches up to 840 TFLOPs/s, 85% of the theoretical maximum TFLOPs/s on H100 GPUs.
* **Ablation study.** We confirm that our algorithmic improvements with warp-specialization and GEMM-softmax pipelining contribute to the speedup of FlashAttention-3.
* **Accuracy of FP8 attention.** We validate that block quantization and incoherent processing reduces the numerical error of FP8 FlashAttention-3 by \(2.6\times\).

### Benchmarking Attention

We measure the runtime of different attention methods on an H100 80GB SXM5 GPU for different settings (without / with causal mask, head dimension 64 or 128) for BF16 inputs. We report the results in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, showing that FlashAttention-3 is around \(1.5\)-\(2.0\times\) faster than FlashAttention-2 in the forward pass and \(1.5\)-\(1.75\times\) faster in the backward pass. Compared to a standard attention implementation, FlashAttention-3 can be up to \(3\)-\(16\times\) faster. For medium and long sequences (1k and above), FlashAttention-3 even surpasses the speed of a vendor's library (cuDNN - closed source) that has been optimized for H100 GPUs.

Benchmark settings:We vary the sequence length as \(512\), \(1\)k,..., \(16\)k, and set batch size so that the total number of tokens is \(16\)k. We set the hidden dimension to \(2048\), and head dimension to be either \(64\), \(128\), or \(256\) (i.e., \(32\) heads, \(16\) heads, or \(8\) heads). To calculate the FLOPs of the forward pass, we use:

\[4\cdot\mathrm{seqlen}^{2}\cdot\mathrm{head\ dimension}\cdot\mathrm{number\ of\ heads}.\]

With causal masking, we divide this number by \(2\) to account for the fact that approximately only half of the entries are calculated. To get the FLOPs of the backward pass, we multiply the forward pass FLOPs by \(2.5\) (since there are \(2\) matmuls in the forward pass and \(5\) matmuls in the backward pass, due to recomputation).

We also measure the runtime for FP8 for the forward pass under similar settings. We report the results for headdim \(256\) in Fig. 7 and give the full results in Appendix C.2.

### Ablation Study: 2-Stage Pipelining Experiments

We ablate both the 2-stage WGMMA-softmax pipelining and warp-specialization for non-causal FP16 FlashAttention-3 with fixed parameters \(\{\mathrm{batch,seqlen,nheads,hdim}\}=\{4,8448,16,128\}\). The result in Table 2 confirms that our algorithmic improvements (asynchrony with warp-specialization and overlapping between GEMM and softmax) lead to significant speedup, from \(570\) to \(661\) TFLOPs.

### Numerical Error Validation

As there has been interest in the numerical error [21] of FlashAttention, we compare FlashAttention-2, FlashAttention-3, and a standard implementation of attention against a reference implementation in FP64. To simulate outlier features and activations in LLMs [20; 53], we generate the entries of **Q**,**K**,**V** with the following distribution:

\[\mathcal{N}(0,\!1)\!+\!\mathcal{N}(0,\!100)\!\cdot\!\text{Bernoulli}(0.001).\]

That is, each entry is normally distributed with zero mean and standard deviation 1, but for 0.1% of entries we add an independent term that's normally distributed with standard deviation 10. We then measure the root mean squared error (RMSE) in Table 3. In FP16, both FlashAttention-2 and FlashAttention-3 achieves 1.7\(\times\) lower RMSE compared to the standard implementation since intermediate results (softmax) are kept in FP32. The baseline attention in FP8 uses per-tensor scaling, with

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline
**Configuration** & **Time** & **TFLOPs/s** \\ \hline FlashAttention-3 & 3.538 ms & 661 \\ \hline No GEMM-Softmax Pipelining, Warp-Specialization & 4.021 ms & 582 \\ \hline GEMM-Softmax Pipelining, No Warp-Specialization & 4.105 ms & 570 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Pipelining ablation measurements

Figure 5: Attention forward speed (BF16) on H100 GPU

matmul accumulator in FP32 and intermediate softmax results kept in FP16. Thanks to block quantization and incoherent processing, FlashAttention-3 in FP8 is 2.6\(\times\) more accurate than this baseline.

## 5 Dicussion, Limitations, Conclusion

With FlashAttention-3, we have demonstrated that new programming techniques and hardware features such as asynchrony and low-precision can have a dramatic impact on the efficiency and accuracy of attention. We are able to speed up attention by 1.5-2.0\(\times\) times compared to FlashAttention-2, and reduce FP8 numerical error by 2.6\(\times\) compared to standard per-tensor quantization. Some limitations of our work that we hope to address in the future include: optimizing for LLM inference, and understanding the effects of low-precision attention in large-scale training. Though we have focused on Hopper GPUs in this work, we expect that the techniques developed here will apply to other hardware accelerators. We hope that a faster and more accurate primitive such as attention will unlock new applications in long-context tasks.

Attention variants and distributed attentionEver since attention became popular with the Transformer architecture [58], there has been a large body of work on approximating attention to scale it to longer sequences. These approximation methods can generally be categorized into two classes: sparse and low-rank. Sparse attention only computes some entries of the attention matrix (\(\text{softmax}(\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^{T})\)) and assumes that other entries are zero. Different methods have different ways of choosing which entries should be zero, either with a fixed pattern [11], with a sliding window [6], or with a dynamic pattern through hashing [28] or routing [46]. The low-rank approach instead assumes that the attention matrix has a low-rank structure, and apply a pointwise nonlinearity to the query and key [27] with random projection [12; 44; 60]. One can also combine the sparse and low-rank approximation for better quality [9; 62]. However, these approximation methods typically do not offer the same model quality as standard attention [55], and so most large-scale models do not employ these techniques.

There are other variants of attention aimed at reducing the size of the KV cache to improve inference efficiency. Multi-query attention [50] and grouped query attention [3] tie different heads of \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\), and multiple query heads interact with the same key and value head. Multi-head latent attention [19] parameterizes the \(\mathbf{K}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\) as low-rank projections of a shared matrix to further reduce the KV cache size. However, all of these approaches do not change the core computation softmax\((\mathbf{Q}\mathbf{K}^{T})\mathbf{V}\) during training and simply change how \(\mathbf{Q}\),\(\mathbf{K}\),\(\mathbf{V}\) are obtained. As a result, any efficiency or accuracy improvement to the standard attention computation benefits these methods.

To extend to even longer context, attention computation can be distributed across multiple GPUs. Methods such as Ring attention [31; 32] and variants [7] can reach a context length of up to 1 million. They use FlashAttention (or FlashAttention-2) as a primitive, and so the improvement from FlashAttention-3 would benefit these distributed attention methods as well.

Alternative architecturesMotivated by the limitations of attention, a variety of alternative architectures have been proposed. They build on the connection between linear attention [27] and recurrent neural networks (RNNs). RWKV [42], H3 [17], MEGA [35], Retnet [54] enhance the expressivity of the simple cumulative sum in linear attention with more sophisticated recurrences. Mamba [22] and xLSTM [5] use learnable weighting for the recurrence and can match the quality of Transformers in language modeling at small or medium scale. These approaches can be connected to generalizations of linear attention through the lens of the structure of the token-mixing matrix [15]. These models have started to see some traction, seeing usage in some medium to large-scale models such as Jamba [2], Zamba [63], Megalodon [36], and Mamba2-hybrid [59]. For the highest quality, these SSM- and RNN-based models still employ many layers of attention. We expect that techniques to speed up attention presented in this work will be useful to speedup these alternative architectures.

Low-precision attentionQuantization is a promising approach to speed up attention, but they have mostly focused on reducing the space for KV cache for inference efficiency. QuIP [8] and QuIP#[57] use incoherent processing to reduce the quantization, and we adapted this technique for FP8 FlashAttention-3. Recent work suggests that for inference the KV cache is highly compressible down to 4-, 3-, or even 2-bits [26; 33]. However, quantization during training is still challenging as higher precision is typically required for stable training.

Hardware-aware AlgorithmsOur work presented in this paper focuses on the micro-architecture specific tuning to leverage new instruction sets and adopt a natively asynchronous programming model. There are other orthogonal axes for hardware-aware algorithm co-design being explored. A recent example of this is LeanAttention [48], which recognizes the poor GPU occupancy and high memory bandwidth requirements of the sequential token generation phase as primary bottlenecks for inference and optimizes it via a smarter load balancing strategy similar to Stream-K load balancing [41] to achieve nearly peak occupancy. There is a large literature on optimizing GEMM for specific hardware that employs many of the same techniques. As an example, Abdelfattah et al. [1] presents a high performance batched GEMM kernel on K40c Graphics Processing Units (GPU) for both fixed and variable sizes, proposing specialized GEMM designs and a comprehensive autotuning process to deliver state-of-the-art performance.

Addition Details on Algorithms

### Asynchrony Through Warp Specialization for the Backward Pass

Similar to the forward pass SS3.1, we use warp specialization to handle asynchrony. Instead of just a simple producer-consumer pattern in the forward pass, we add one extra role of a **dQ** writer, since we need to accumulate the value of **dQ** produced by each thread block to the global value of **dQ**. This **dQ** accumulation introduces memory contention (many thread blocks writing to the same location) so having a separate warp to handle this (along with asynchrony) will avoid blocking the rest of the warps in the thread block to perform the next computation (matmul).

We include the backward pass with warp specialization in Algorithm 3.

We make the following observations:

1. Softmax is reordered to the very beginning, even before the first WGMMA.
2. The first WGMMA is interleaved with softmax and FP32 \(\rightarrow\) FP16 datatype conversion of **S**. This indicates that WGMMA and non-WGMMAs are executed in parallel.
3. exp2, row\_sum, O rescaling and FP32 \(\rightarrow\) FP16 conversions are interleaved together.
4. The second WGMMA is not overlapped with other instructions, as expected.

Overall, SASS shows that the 2-stage pipelining idea works as expected.

### 3-Stage Pipelining Algorithm

We experiment with a 3-stage pipelining algorithm to parallelize the first WGMMA from iteration \(j+2\), softmax from iteration \(j+1\), and the second WGMMA from iteration \(j\). We describe this algorithm in Algorithm 4. This algorithm behaves worse than the 2-stage pipelining algorithm due to the reasons below:```
0: Matrices \(\mathbf{Q},\mathbf{K},\mathbf{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d}\) in HBM, block sizes \(B_{c}\), \(B_{r}\). Each warpgroup reads 1 block Qi of size \(B_{r}\times d\), \(T_{c}=\left\lceil\frac{N}{B_{c}}\right\rceil\) blocks \(\mathbf{K}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{K}_{T_{c}}\) and \(\mathbf{V}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{V}_{T_{c}}\) of size \(B_{c}\times d\). Each warpgroup writes 1 output block \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) of size \(B_{r}\times d\), and 1 logsumexp block \(L_{i}\) of size \(B_{r}\).
1: Initialization. Load \(\mathbf{Q}_{i}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM. Initialize \(\mathbf{O}_{i},\ell_{i},m_{i},scale\_o\).
2: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{K}_{0}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
3: Compute \(\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{K}_{0}^{T}\) using WGMMA. Commit and wait.
4: Compute \(m_{i}\), \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\), \(\ell_{i}\), \(scale\_o\) based on \(\mathbf{S}\).
5: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{K}_{1}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
6: Compute \(\mathbf{S}=\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{K}_{1}^{T}\) using WGMMA. Commit and wait.
7:for\(2\leq j<T_{c}-2\)do
8: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{K}_{j}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
9: Compute \(\mathbf{S}_{next}=\mathbf{Q}_{i}\mathbf{K}_{j}^{T}\) using WGMMA. Commit but do not wait.
10: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{V}_{j-2}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
11: Rescale \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) based on \(scale\_o\).
12: Compute \(\mathbf{O}_{i}=\mathbf{O}_{i}+\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\mathbf{V}_{j-2}\) using WGMMA. Commit but do not wait.
13: Compute \(m_{i}\), \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\_next\), \(\ell_{i}\), \(scale\_o\) based on \(\mathbf{S}\).
14: Wait for all previous WGMMAs.
15: Copy \(\mathbf{S}\_next\) to \(\mathbf{S}\).
16: Copy \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\_next\) to \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\).
17:endfor
18: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{V}_{T_{c}-2}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
19: Rescale \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) based on \(scale\_o\).
20: Compute \(\mathbf{O}_{i}=\mathbf{O}_{i}+\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\mathbf{V}_{T_{c}-2}\) using WGMMA. Commit and wait.
21: Compute \(m_{i}\), \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\), \(\ell_{i}\), \(scale\_o\) based on \(\mathbf{S}\).
22: Wait for the producer warpgroup loading \(\mathbf{V}_{T_{c}-1}\) from HBM to on-chip SRAM.
23: Rescale \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) based on \(scale\_o\).
24: Compute \(\mathbf{O}_{i}=\mathbf{O}_{i}+\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\mathbf{V}_{T_{c}-1}\) using WGMMA. Commit and wait.
25: Epilogue. Rescale \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) based on \(\ell_{i}\). Compute \(L_{i}\) based on \(\ell_{i}\) and \(m_{i}\). Write \(\mathbf{O}_{i}\) and \(L_{i}\) to HBM as the \(i\)-th block of \(\mathbf{O}\) and \(L\). ```

**Algorithm 4** FlashAttention 3-stage pipelining consumer warpgroup forward pass

Overlapping.We expected that softmax can be overlapped with (the first WGMMA + the second WGMMA). However, the compiler doesn't cooperate in this way. SASS code shows that only the first WGMMA is overlapped with softmax, while the second WGMMA is not. It's not clear why the compiler chooses to reorder instructions in this way.

Register pressure.This algorithm requires more registers compared to the 2-stage pipelining algorithm. In theory, it needs to store an extra \(\tilde{\mathbf{P}}_{i}\) and \(scale\_o\), which is of size \(B_{r}\times B_{c}\times\text{sizeof}(\text{input\_data\_type})+B_{r} \times\text{sizeof}(\text{float})\). As a result, a smaller block size needs to be chosen.

### Variable Sequence Length

Some optimizations mentioned above cannot be directly used for variable sequence lengths and require special handling.

TmaTo enable TMA to handle variable sequence lengths directly, additional steps are required. These include modifying a tensormap using the PTX instruction 'tensormap.replace' and store the

Figure 8: 3-Stage Pipelining

tensormap in global memory, which adds overhead and complexity. To address this, during the forward pass when loading Q, we make TMA consistently loads tile_size rows of data. For out-of-bound access, TMA sets zeros for rows beyond the original tensor, while S tensor masking masks out unused rows in a tile. When writing O, we leverage memory-coalesced writes directly, as this is the final step and does not require asynchrony. In the backward pass, a preprocess kernel pads each sequence in dQ, dPSum, and LSE tensors with an additional 128 (tile_size) elements, allowing us to utilize TMA store for efficient data transfer.

Threadblock cluster and TMA multi-castWe utilize TMA multi-cast with a cluster size of 2 for fixed sequence length data loads, allowing every 2 threadblocks processing the same sequence to collaboratively read KV tensors. However, this approach is not well-suited for variable sequence lengths or cases like causal masking and window attention, where some threadblocks may exit earlier and cannot collaborate with other threadblocks in the same cluster. Not utilizing clustering for variable sequence lengths results in a performance drop of around 2% compared to fixed sequence lengths.

### Masks: causal, local attention, variable sequence length

We apply masks to the S tensor to handle causal and local attention, as well as out-of-bound access for variable sequence lengths. Since masking is expensive, we apply it only when necessary. For instance, in the forward pass, the minimum and maximum KV block indices are calculated and iterated over in the main loop. For causal or variable sequence lengths, masking is applied only to the maximum K block index. For local attention, masking is applied only to the first and last few K block indices based on local attention configurations. Masking is skipped for other K block indices.

### Persistent Kernel

During the execution of the attention kernel, there is a prologue (loading \(Q\)) and epilogue (writing output) where the Tensor Cores are not running. To maximize efficiency, we implement a persistent kernel that can overlap the epilogue of one iteration with the prologue of the next iteration to reduce this overhead and keep the Tensor Cores busy. In particular, we launch as many thread blocks as there are streaming multiprocessors (e.g., 132 on the H100 SXM5) and implement a scheduler that assigns tiles to each of the thread block. Each thread block might perform attention for more than one tile.

### Register data exchange required for second WGMMA in FP8 FlashAttention-3

In code, we can effect the register-to-register data exchange that transforms the register ownership pattern of Fig. 3 into Fig. 4 through invoking a combination of the following two CUDA intrinsics:

* byte_perm: Given two 32-bit unsigned integers x and y and selector s, the **byte permute** instruction returns 4 bytes from the 8 input bytes as specified by s.
* shfl_sync: The **shuffle** instruction exchanges register data from a source lane index j into its own destination register.

Our method is illustrated in Fig. 9. First, we can swap the order of data held within a thread's registers by using byte permute as follows. Referring to the top row of Fig. 9, for a given thread let upper be the first 4 bytes (those in light and dark blue) and let lower be the last 4 bytes (those in light and dark yellow). Then for the data held by threads 1 and 2, we do the swap by calling byte_perm with the indicated selectors:

auto upper_mid = __byte_perm(upper, lower, Ox7654); auto lower_mid = __byte_perm(upper, lower, Ox3210);

Figure 9: Register data movement to satisfy layout conformance requirements of FP8 WGMMA.

Now between the second and third rows, we exchange data among threads by using shuffle instructions. Observe that the upper and lower blocks of 4 bytes should be each exchanged among themselves. Moreover, the shuffling of the upper blocks differs from that of the lower blocks, and both shuffles depend on the thread index (mod 4). We account for this using two pre-defined arrays to call __shfl_sync with the correct srcLane parameter as follows:

``` intupper_map[4]={0,3,1,2}; intlower_map[4]={1,2,0,3}; upper_mid=__shfl_sync(uint32_t(-1), upper_mid, upper_map[threadIdx.x%4], 4); lower_mid=__shfl_sync(uint32_t(-1), lower_mid, lower_map[threadIdx.x%4], 4); ```

Finally, between the third and fourth rows, we repeat the technique with byte_perm, but now for all four threads and with the selector depending on the thread index (mod 4). For threads 0 and 3, we have:

``` upper_last=__byte_perm(upper_mid, lower_mid, 0x5410); lower_last=__byte_perm(upper_mid, lower_mid, 0x7632); ```

whereas for threads 1 and 2, we have:

``` upper_last=__byte_perm(upper_mid, lower_mid, 0x1054); lower_last=__byte_perm(upper_mid, lower_mid, 0x3276); ```

### In-kernel transposition of V for FP8 FlashAttention-3

We describe how to fuse the memory transpose of **V** needed for the second FP8 WGMMA into FlashAttention-3. This is handled as an out-of-place SMEM to RMEM to SMEM transfer that is executed in the producer warpgroup.

Specifically, within the producer mainloop, after issuing the TMA load of a tile of **V**, the producer warpgroup waits for the load to complete. Then, producer warps effect the transpose by issuing LDSM (ldmatrix) and STSM (stmatrix) instructions, which involve a warp of threads collectively loading SMEM to RMEM and storing RMEM to SMEM at a granularity of 128 bytes. Finally, we have an additional pipeline object to manage synchronization between the producer warpgroup and consumers, since the producer pipeline for the TMA load of V now instead has the producer warpgroup as _its_ consumer.

We choose LDSM/STSM instructions as they are both register efficient, allowing us to execute them in the producer warpgroup even after register deallocation, and capable of transposing layouts when doing memory copy. Note that as SMEM requirements are first reduced by the smaller memory footprint of the FP8 datatype, we find that we have enough SMEM for the separate buffer used to store the transpose.

There is a technical obstacle to using LDSM and STSM in the context of FP8 datatype that is worth mentioning. Note that in the PTX documentation, LDSM/STSM are described as copying \(8\times 8\) matrices with 16-bit entries [40, SS9.7.13.4.15-16], but we can pack 8-bit entries two at a time to use LDSM/STSM in the context of FP8 precision. However, the transpose versions of LDSM/STSM cannot split packed 8-bit entries, which necessitates certain register movements in between LDSM and STSM to actually perform a tile-wise transpose. The use of byte permute to split and reorder packed 8-bit entries in between LDSM and STSM is depicted in the following code snippet:

``` cute::copy(tiled_copy_ldsm,tXsX,tXrX); autodata=tXrX.data(); #pragmaunroll for(intn=0;n<size(tXrX);n+=8){ uint32_t*data_32bit=reinterpret_cast<uint32_t*>(&data[n]); autoupper=data_32bit[0]; autolower=data_32bit[1]; data_32bit[0]=__byte_perm(upper,lower, 0x6420); data_32bit[1]=__byte_perm(upper,lower, 0x7531); } cute::copy(tiled_copy_stsm, tXrX, tXsX_out); ```

Since this permutes the eventual rows of the transposed **V** tile, we also need to modify the register movements on the consumer side that transform accumulator to operand **P**. We exploit the mathematical fact that \[\mathbf{P}\cdot\mathbf{V}=\text{colperm}^{\sigma}(\mathbf{P})\cdot\text{rowperm}^{ \sigma}(\mathbf{V})\]

for \(\sigma\) a permutation of the common inner dimension of \(\mathbf{P}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\). Moreover, for the modified register exchange, we can eliminate the use of warp shuffles, but not byte permute, as each thread will already own all the entries it needs for WGMMA.

### FlashAttention-3 for inference

For decoding inference, the query sequence length is much shorter than the key/value sequence length, typically on the order of one or a few tokens compared to the thousands stored in the KV cache. In this situation, attention becomes a memory-bound workload, and the relevant metric is not tensor core utilization as measured by FLOPs/s, but loading the KV cache as fast as possible as measured by memory bandwidth. Furthermore, since the FlashAttention-3 algorithm described in SS3.1 parallelizes over the query sequence length, it can suffer from a lack of parallelism for decoding.

We make two modifications to FlashAttention-3 to introduce more parallelism for decoding:

1. **Split KV** (or **Flash-Decoding**): We split the attention kernel along the key/value sequence length, with the number of splits determined by a heuristic at launch, and combine the resulting outputs using a separate post-processing reduction kernel. "Splitting" according to a parameter \(n\) means that \(n\) threadblocks load the same tile of \(\mathbf{Q}\) and \(n\) different segments of the KV cache, computing \(n\) different output tiles \(\mathbf{O}_{1},...,\mathbf{O}_{n}\) and \(\text{lse vectors}\ \mathbf{lse}_{1},...,\mathbf{lse}_{n}\), which we then use to compute \(\mathbf{O}\) in the reduction kernel. We also allow for early exit of threadblocks whose given segment of the KV cache doesn't contribute to the final output, in which case the threadblock writes out \(-\infty\) as its \(\mathbf{lse}\). This amounts to essentially the same implementation as described in [18].
2. **GQA packing**: For multi-query attention or grouped-query attention, we can restructure the attention mainloop in order to pack multiple query heads per KV head, where each threadblock now loads its \(\mathbf{Q}\) tile across different query heads. When query length is short, this achieves additional parallelism "for free" thanks to the large width of the first operand WGMMA tile, given as 64 per warpgroup. For example, we could have a model architecture with 16 query heads per KV head and a query sequence length of 8, in which case a threadblock can pack all 16 query heads into its \(\mathbf{Q}\) tile without any change to Algorithm 2. In practice, this yields up to \(N\mathbf{x}\) speedup over an implementation that doesn't do GQA packing, where \(N\) is the GQA ratio.

FlashAttention-3 for inference also features an implementation of PagedAttention [29] that was contributed by Kai Londenberg. Recall that PagedAttention is a memory optimization technique for efficiently storing the KV cache in terms of fixed-size pages. This entails separating the logical position of KV blocks from their physical addresses, with a _block table_ defining the address translation [29, SS4.2].

Now, prior implementations of TMA load in CUTLASS construct the tensor map object such that TMA tensor coordinates are determined using the physical GMEM tensor. To use a block table with TMA, Londenberg defines a new SM9O_TMA_LOAD_PAGED_OP class and a tensor map constructor that instead determines TMA tensor coordinates in terms of the virtual shape. The block table is then passed into the TMA copy method as an additional argument.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Abstract and intro reflects the paper's contribution. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Discussed in SS5 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Detailed information in Appendix C.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: The code will be released with a permissive license in the near future.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include training models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Not necessary for speed benchmarks since we already take average of a large number (30) of trials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.

* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix C.1 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: The paper focuses on foundational research and not tied to a particular application. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No release of high-risk data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new assets. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No crowdsourcing or human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: No crowdsourcing or human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
