###### Abstract

Model editing has become an increasingly popular method for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current approaches primarily focus on reliability, generalization, and locality, with many excelling across these criteria. Some recent studies have highlighted the potential pitfalls of these editing methods, such as knowledge distortion and conflicts. However, the general capabilities of post-edited language models remain largely _unexplored_. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various editing methods across different language models, and have the following findings. (1) Existing editing methods inevitably lead to performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that these methods can maintain the general capabilities of the model only within a limited number of edits. When the number of edits increases, the model's intrinsic knowledge structure may be disrupted or even completely destroyed. (2) Instruction-tuned models exhibit greater robustness to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language models with larger scale are more resistant to editing compared to smaller models. (4) The safety of the edited models is significantly compromised, even for models that were originally safety-aligned. Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods. The details of code and reproduction can be found in F.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT [1], Claude [2], and Llama [3; 4] have revolutionized the deep learning and demonstrated remarkable performance across various knowledge-intensive tasks [5; 6; 7]. However, the learned vast amount of knowledge in LLMs may be erroneous, harmful, or outdated [8]. While directly fine-tuning an LLM on calibrated knowledge can help mitigate this problem, which is prohibitive due to hardware constraints and resource budget [9; 10; 11]. To this end, _model editing_[12; 13; 14] has been proposed to efficiently update knowledge within LLM. Current studies in editing [15; 16; 17; 18] target at enabling efficient yet precise model behavior alterations on specific knowledge samples in the form of triplet within LLMs like modifying the wrong tuple (Tim Cook, is the CEO of, Google) to the correct one (Tim Cook, is the CEO of, Apple) persistently.

The primary goal of model editing is to impact the predictions for related inputs termed editing scope [19] generally, _without_ influencing behaviors on unrelated knowledge samples. The assessment of an editing method typically involves evaluation along three dimensions [14; 12]. First and foremost, the _reliability_ aims to ascertain the capability of the post-edited model to recall the specific editing fact accurately. Second, the _generalization_ seeks to validate the adaptability of the edited model by assessing its ability to recall the editing fact under diverse paraphrase prompts. The last dimension _locality_ (a.k.a., specificity) is employed to verify the robustness of the edited model by examining whether its output for unrelated inputs remains consistent after editing. Existing knowledge editing methods like SERAC [18], ROME [17], MEMIT [20], and IKE [15] work well on these evaluation criteria across various datasets on different LLMs.

Despite these successes in editing language models, recent works [21; 22; 23; 24] have disclosed the inevitable pitfalls of existing editing methods from different perspectives such as knowledge distortion [23], and catastrophic forgetting [25]. In sequential editing setting (see Section 2), as the number of edits increases, it is necessary to balance two aspects: the retention of the model's original knowledge and the preservation of newly acquired knowledge through updates. These two objectives are to some extent conflicting. The _general capabilities_ (Section 2) of LLMs is the foundation to solve the wide range of complex tasks. Changes in the model's general capabilities reflect the retention of its original knowledge. However, the general capabilities of post-edit language models are still _unexplored_, making current editing methods unreliable to be employed for real-world applications. Given this situation, it naturally motivates the following critical question to explore:

_How do sequential model editing affect the general abilities of language models?_

To close this gap, we make a comprehensive understanding and analysis of edited LLMs with various editing methods (In Section 3). In detail, we edit multiple LLMs with various editing methods and evaluate them across benchmarks to verify underlying factors that may affect the general abilities. It is worth noting that our focus is on the _general capabilities_ of the model (including world knowledge, reading comprehension, reasoning, safety, etc.), rather than the performance on _efficacy_, _generalization_ and _locality_ or downstream tasks like NER, QA, and NLI. These distinctions distinguish our work from some existing studies like [26; 25; 27]. Technically, we explore the impact of various underlying factors such as the number of edits, model scale, safety, different aspects of abilities, and instruction tuning on the general capabilities of edited LLMs after sequential editing.

The empirical results indicate that the majority of current editing methods do not significantly influence the fundamental capabilities of models within dozens of edits (Section 4.1). However, after nearly to hundred edits, some methods lead to rapid degradation, while other methods only slightly affect performance after several hundred edits or even thousands (MEND, PMET). When subjecting models to an extremely high number of edits (up to \(10k\)), we observe that the intrinsic knowledge structure of the models is thoroughly disrupted, leading to outputs of empty strings for any input. We refer to this phenomenon as the _muting effect_ in sequential language model editing.

Furthermore, we discovered that for the vast majority of current editing methods, the instruction-tuned models exhibit a slower rate of performance decline after edits (Section 4.2), and the smaller model is more vulnerable to deterioration caused by editing (Section 4.3). Moreover, results reveal that different model editing methods affect all aspects of a model's capabilities to a roughly equivalent extent (Section 4.4). Our research also explores the safety aspects of these edited models (Section 4.5), revealing that even with dozens of edits, safety can be compromised to a certain extent.

Figure 1: Illustration about the model editing and its pitfalls in retaining edited knowledge. Left panel: model editing methods can efficiently update knowledge within language models; Right panel: when scaling editing to thousands, the model canâ€™t retain edited knowledge, see [17] for details.

We hope our work can provide the research community with insightful perspectives to help advance studies in this field, systematically elucidating the impact of existing model editing methods on LLM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the _first_ to comprehensively evaluate and analyze the general capabilities of edited language models. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

* We conducted a detailed evaluation of the impact of different model editing methods on the general capabilities of LLM across various numbers of edits. We found that existing model editing methods are only suitable for a limited number of edits, generally not exceeding several dozens.
* Empirically, extensive explorations with different editing approaches were conducted to verify potential factors affecting the fundamental capabilities of edited models. These insights are broadly applicable across different editing methods and various models.
* Our empirical studies with various editing methods across different models reveal that even with only dozens of edits, the safety of LLMs can be compromised to a certain extent.
* Technically, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the side effects, operational efficiency, and deployment of edited LLM, and discussed their practical use in production.

## 2 Preliminary

In this section, we provide comprehensive preliminaries of model editing and LLM evaluation.

Model Editing.Model editing (also known as knowledge editing) aims to precisely adjust the behaviors of a language model \(M_{\theta}\) on some facts without influencing unrelated samples. Current works focus on editing knowledge tuple \(t=(s,r,o)\). The editing process inserts new tuples \((s,r,o^{*})\) in place of the current tuple \((s,r,o)\), where these two share the same \(s\) and \(r\). An editing operation is denoted as \(e=(s,r,o,o^{*})\) for brevity. Given \(n\) fact tuples \(T^{*}=(t_{1}^{*},t_{2}^{*},\ldots,t_{n}^{*})\) where \(t_{i}^{*}=(s_{i},r_{i},o_{i}^{*}),i=1,2,\ldots,n\), and a model \(M_{\theta}\), model editing yields an edited language model \(M_{\theta}^{e}\) via editing operations \(\mathcal{E}=\{e_{1},e_{2},\ldots\}\), where \(M_{\theta}^{e}(s_{j},r_{j})=o_{j}^{*}\) if \(t_{j}=(s_{j},r_{j},o_{j}^{*})\in T^{*}\), else \(M_{\theta}^{e}(s_{j},r_{j})=o_{j}\). To evaluate model editing methods, current works focus on three dimensions: _reliability_, _generalization_, and _locality_[19]. Please refer to Section 6 for a comprehensive survey.

General Capabilities of Language Models.In recent years, the field of LLM has experienced rapid growth, leading to the development of numerous models by various research institutions. These models differ significantly in terms of parameter size, architecture, corpora, and training methodologies. Consequently, it has become critically important to evaluate the capabilities of these models objectively, and comprehensively. Typically, this is achieved by evaluating the models on widely adopted benchmarks like MMLU [28], and BigBench [29] to compare their performance with their counterparts. Currently, the evaluation of the general capabilities of LLMs in both academia and industry focuses on several key areas: world knowledge, common sense reasoning, coding, reading comprehension, mathematical skills, and performance on mainstream benchmark datasets [30; 3; 4; 31; 32; 33]. This paper concentrates on the impact of editing on the inherent capabilities of LLM, rather than on downstream tasks like QA, NER, and NLI in work [26].

Model Editing Evaluation.The current evaluation protocol of model editing involves updating a model's knowledge, assessing the post-edit model, and restoring the update before editing. However, in real-world applications like _sequential editing_, models are expected to maintain preceding modifications before performing new edits. Scaling sequential editing capability is therefore crucial for model editing. In this paper, we mainly focus on whether the general abilities of LLM are hurt in sequential editing settings. Two orthogonal concepts of sequential editing are _single editing_ and _batch editing_. Batch editing refers to the model's ability to edit multiple editing samples (like MEMIT, PMET) at once, whereas the concept opposed to this is single editing, which means these methods (like ROME, GRACE, MEND) can only edit one sample at a time.

Formal Definition of Sequential Editing.Here, let's provide a formal definition of sequential editing. Assume we have an unedited model \(M_{0}\), and \(n\) editing samples\((x_{i},y_{i})\), where \(i=1,2,\ldots,n\) need to be incorporated into the language model \(M_{0}\). Suppose the editing operation is a function \(E(\cdot,\cdot)\), where the first parameter is the model to be edited and the second parameter is the editing samples. Assume we get the edited model \(M_{i}\) after the \(i\)-th editing operation. In sequential editing, \(M_{t}\) (model parameter after the \(t\)-th editing) is determined by the model weight \(M_{t-1}\) and the editing sample used in the \(t\)-th edit, like \(M_{t}=E(M_{t-1},S_{t})\), where \(S_{t}\) is the edit samples used in the \(t\)-thedit. For different index \(i\) and \(j\), \(S_{i}\cap S_{j}=\emptyset\); for every \(i\), we have \(\bigcup_{i}S_{i}=\{x_{j},y_{j}\}_{j=1}^{j=n}\). If we denote the size of \(S_{t}\) is \(n_{t}\), it satify \(n_{t}\geq 1\) for every \(t\) and satisfies \(n=\sum_{t}n_{t}\) for all edit batches.

## 3 Experimental Design

In this section, we present several critical parts of experimental setups (in Section 3.1) and research question designs (in Section 3.2). The results and analysis of research questions are left in Section 4. All of the details of reproducing our experiments can be found in Appendix F.

### Experimental Setups

Here, we list all of the experimental setups. For implementation details, please refer to Appendix C.

**Language Models.** We conduct experiments on various LLMs, including Llama2-7B (based and instruction-tuned) [4], Mistral-7B (based and instruction-tuned) [31], GPT2-XL [34], and 6 language models from Pythia [35] model families with varying parameter scale from 160M to 12B.

**Model Editing Methods.** To comprehensively investigate the potential impact on edited models, we compared multiple editing methods: (1) meta-learning based methods: MEND [16] (2) located-then-edit based method: KN [36], ROME [17], MEMIT [20], PMET [37], (3) retrival based methods: SERAC [18], (4) extra parameters based methods: GRACE [38]. It is imperative to note that the efficacy of edited models varies depending on the hyperparameters employed for each method, which can significantly impact the performance of the edited model. Therefore, our evaluation was confined to assessing only models supported by each editing method.

**Editing Datasets.** In this work, we employ the most widely adopted editing datasets **ZsRE**[39] and counterfactual[17] as editing datasets across all experiments in the work.

**Evaluation Benchmarks.** To effectively determine whether the model editing influences the overarching capabilities of LLMs, we utilized five distinct task categories as benchmarks. These include: _World Knowledge:_ MMLU [28] (5-shot), BBH [29] (3-shot), with the assessment based on the accuracy of multiple-choice answers. _Arithmetic:_ GSM8K [40] (8-shot), evaluated by the solve rate. _Commonsense Reasoning:_ CommonsenseQA [41] (7-shot), where performance is gauged by the accuracy of multiple choices. _Reading Comprehension:_TriviaQA [42] (0-shot), with the assessment based on the exact match from context. _Safety:_ TruthfulQA [43] (0-shot), evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy, and ToxiGen [44] (0-shot), where results are determined by the accuracy of two-way classification. For more details of these benchmarks, please refer to Appendix D.1.

**Editing Settings.** To investigate the potential impact on language models caused by editing, we mainly focus on sequential single editing in most of the research questions in this work.

### Research Questions

This paper aims to thoroughly examine the impacts of diverse model editing methods on various general abilities of edited models. It naturally motivates the following critical research questions (RQs) to be explored in this work based on the primary aim.

* **RQ1:** How does the number of undergone edits affect the abilities of models? (In Section 4.1)
* **RQ2:** Do instruction-tuned models exhibit differently than base counterparts? (In Section 4.2)
* **RQ3:** Does the general abilities of the edited model differ on model scales? (In Section 4.3)
* **RQ4:** How does editing affects different aspects of a model's capabilities? (In Section 4.4)
* **RQ5:** Does performing editing on language models compromise their safety? (In Section 4.5)

In the next section, we will address these research questions through detailed experimentation.

## 4 Results and Analysis

Summary.From the above research questions, we conclude that existing editing methods have inevitable pitfalls in editing LLMs, making them impractical in the production environment.

## 5 Further Discussion

In this section, we conduct discussions on the side effects, editing efficiency, and deployment issues of post-edit LLM, to further explore their practical use in production environments.

**Potential Impact on Inherent Knowledge within LLM.** Existing model editing methods claim that they can update specific knowledge within LLM without affecting other unrelated knowledge. However, existing research [26; 25] indicates that methods involving direct modification of model parameters can have unintended and potentially harmful impacts on the intrinsic knowledge of the model. Moreover, the updated knowledge is often challenging to utilize in knowledge-intensive downstream tasks, such as reasoning and knowledge-based question answering, exacerbating the model's hallucinations [22; 21]. As the quantity of edits escalates, the retention of updated knowledge within the LLM markedly diminishes [20]. Our series of experiments demonstrates that even with only hundreds of edits, the general capabilities of the model are severely compromised. When the number of edits reaches the thousands, the model's internal structure is thoroughly damaged. These findings highlight the deficiencies of current model editing methods.

**Editing Efficiency and Speed.** Existing editing methods claim to manipulate the inherent knowledge within model efficiently and rapidly while keeping the memory usage of LLMs close to that of vanilla model inference during deployment. These advantages make model editing seem highly appealing. However, inherent drawbacks severely impede their real-world applicability. Many existing editing methods heavily rely on hyperparameter settings, some even necessitating costly parameter searches. For instance, locate-then-edit approaches (see Section 6) like ROME [17], and PMET [37] require causal tracing to identify layers for editing. Moreover, certain editing methods entail pre-training (MEND [16], SERAC [18], KN [36]) or precomputation of intermediate cached key-value (MEMIT[20]), significantly prolonging pre-training or computational time and consuming hardware resources far beyond those required during editing, without targeted optimization for parallelization benefits. For example, utilizing the MEMIT for 10\(K\) edits on Llama2-7B [4] with an RTX A6000 48G RAM GPU demands approximately \(120\) hours. Hence, enhancing the efficiency of existing methods becomes paramount for real-world applications. See Table 8 for edit speed.

Figure 6: Safety evaluation of edited language models. We perform evaluation on TruthfulQA and Toxigen datasets with the Llama2-7B model. Results demonstrate that for most editing methods, even dozens of edits can compromise the safety of language models with they are aligned.

**Deployment and Serving.** As the scaling up of LLM, considerable deployment and serving challenges are presented [45; 10; 11]. To reduce the expenses of deployment and serving of LLMs, several specialized frameworks have been developed, including TensorRT-LLM [46], vLLM [47], and LightLLM [48], with high optimization for efficient LLM serving and deploying. However, some model editing methods, such as the GRACE [38], introduce additional modules to the edited models, or employ auxiliary models, like the SERAC [18], to handle queries involving updated knowledge. These modifications to the model architecture prevent the edited models from being directly deployed using these aforementioned serving frameworks, significantly limiting the practical adoption of editing methods. Furthermore, as the number of edits on LLM increases, for methods that introduce additional, the memory consumption for storing and the time cost for retrieval become increasingly prohibitive. This significantly impacts the throughput and inference latency during deployment and serving. For further details on these effects, please refer to Appendix D.2.

## 6 Related Work

In this section, we briefly review the related works in model editing and language model evaluation.

**Model Editing.** Model editing aims to precisely modify knowledge within a language model with fine grain. Existing methods can be divided into 3 different categories: Retrieval-based, Extra-parameters-based, and Locate-then-edit-based methods. Early works on editing focused on updating individual neurons using constrained fine-tuning [49; 50; 51], or hypernetworks [52]. A related line of work has focused on storing updates in an external memory [53]. Inspired by the linear associative memory property of FFN in transformers [54] and success with the approach in convolutional models [55], recent Locate-then-edit style works have proposed to edit MLP weights directly [17; 20; 37]. In the encyclopedic factual domain, work [17] proposed to edit single facts by fitting a Rank One Model Edit (ROME) to the parameters of an MLP layer and showed that it outperformed prior methods. While [56] concentrates on editing commonsense knowledge. Work [57] focuses on editing the encoder-decoder model. Work [12; 14; 19] make a comprehensive survey in model editing.

**Pitfalls of Model Editing.** Since the concept of model editing was introduced, there exist few works to discuss the drawbacks of existing methods. In [23], two kinds of pitfalls are discovered, named knowledge conflict and knowledge distortion. MEMIT-CSK [56] finds common sense knowledge can also be localized in FFN of LLM layers and both subject, object, and relation play important roles in recalling memory, but they only focus on classification tasks. [58] focus on mitigating the reversal curse in model editing for LLM. Some recent works [22; 59] try to evaluate the multi-hop reasoning of updated knowledge. Work [27; 21] tries to assess the underly impact caused by editing. What's more, some works [60; 61; 62; 63] discuss the knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning.

**Evaluation of LLM.** Evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs [3; 4; 31; 30; 64; 32; 33] involves a diverse array of tests, where models are assessed across various tasks, showcasing their capabilities. Among the benchmarks employed, Bigbench [65; 29], MMLU [28], and HELM [66] are notable. These benchmarks utilize a range of automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEURT [67] and others requiring meticulous annotation to ensure data quality for downstream applications [68; 69; 70]. Typically, these evaluations emphasize accuracy across multiple choices, which serves as the primary metric [71; 72]. Foundation models, often tested across broad linguistic tasks--both generative and multiple-choice--are analyzed to ensure rigorous assessment standards [73; 28; 74; 65]. These methods, however, may focus on the accuracy within confined options and might not effectively capture the nuances of more open-ended, practical applications where models generate free-form text. Moreover, assessing the safety of LLMs is essential. Safety evaluations concentrate on three key areas: truthfulness [43], toxicity [44], and bias [75].

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we systematically investigate the potential impact of model editing on language models. We employed various editing methods to modify multiple models, followed by evaluations across different benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that existing editing methods can preserve the general capabilities of the model within a limited number of edits, not exceeding a few dozen. When the number of edits is sufficiently large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model can be disrupted or even completely damaged. Additionally, we systematically investigated potential factorsthat might impact the performance of models post-editing and their potential effects on the model's basic capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that after only a few dozen edits, the safety of the model is compromised, including those models that have been aligned. Furthermore, we discuss the side effects, operational efficiency issues, and potential impacts brought by editing operations. We conclude that most of existing editing methods are only suitable for scenarios with no more than a few dozen updates. We are looking forward to future research addressing these challenges.

## Limitation

In this paper, we explore the potential impact of model editing on the general abilities of language models. We conduct evaluation on various language models across diverse benchmarks to answer research questions. However, there are still some limitations to be further addressed: (1) limited editing methods: we only evaluate 6 editing methods; (2) limited benchmarks: only 4 benchmarks are involved in main experiments ; (3) more deep analysis: further discussion and analysis are needed. We hope to address these problems in sequential works.

## Impact Statement

In this paper, we systematically investigate the general abilities of the edited language model. Our study highlights the potential impact caused by existing editing methods on language models. Given the prominent prospect of editing language models, our approach comprehensively evaluates edited language models. Consequently, this aids in reducing and mitigating the generation of harmful or biased content. On the other hand, editing methods could also be utilized to inject harmful information into open-source language model weights, potentially leading to significant societal impacts.

Case Study

In this section, we would like to present a detailed case study of each model editing method. Below instances are different editing methods applied to the Llama2-7B model, the experiment setting is aligned with section 3. The question is randomly picked from the GSM8K dataset, and query with 8 Chain-of-Thought prompts. Figure 7 shows the answer from vanilla Llama2-7B.

### 10 Edits

Figure 8 displays the answers generated by the Llama2-7B model after 10 edits using ROME, MEMIT, PMET, MEND, and KN methods. Observations indicate that after 10 edits using the KN method, the Llama2-7B model fails to produce content resembling human-like language, as its intrinsic knowledge structure was completely disrupted. We refer to this phenomenon as the _muting effect_ of model editing. And answers generated by the rest editing methods remain the same as the answer generated by vanilla Llama2-7B.

Figure 7: The question and ground truth are from GSM8K, and answer from vanilla Llama2-7B.

**Question: A new program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was three times as many as the downloads in the first month, but then reduced by 30% in the third month. How many downloads did the program have total over the three months?**

**ROME:**

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was 3 times as many as the downloads in the first month. So 60 * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. The number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the downloads in the second month. So 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads in the third month. The answer is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

**MEMIT:**

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was 3 times as many as the downloads in the first month. So 60 * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. The number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the downloads in the second month. So 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads in the third month. The answer is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

**PMT:**

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was 3 times as many as the downloads in the first month. So 60 * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. The number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the downloads in the second month. So 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads in the third month. The answer is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

**MEND:**

The program had 60 downloads in the first month. The number of downloads in the second month was 3 times as many as the downloads in the first month. So 60 * 3 = 180 downloads in the second month. The number of downloads in the third month was 30% less than the downloads in the second month. So 180 * 0.7 = 126 downloads in the third month. The answer is 60 + 180 + 126 = 366.

**KN:**

Figure 8: The answer generate by Llama2-7B after 10 times editing with different methods.

### 50 Edits

Figure 9 displays the answers generated by the Llama2-7B model after 50 edits using the ROME, MEMIT, PMET, and MEND methods. Observations show that after 50 edits using the ROME and MEMIT methods, the model produced incorrect answers, albeit in a human-readable format. Meanwhile, the answers generated by the PMET and MEND methods remain unchanged from those produced by the unedited Llama2-7B model.

### 100 Edits

Figure 10 displays the answers generated by the Llama2-7B model after 100 edits using the ROME, MEMIT, PMET, and MEND methods. Observations show that after 100 edits using the ROME methods, the _muting effect_ phenomenon happened. Meanwhile, the answers generated by the PMET and MEND methods remain unchanged from those produced by the unedited Llama2-7B model.

Evaluation Benchmark

### Dataset Details

For our evaluation benchmark, we employ seven datasets into two distinct evaluation methodologies: generation-based and sequence-based [76]. The generation-based method utilizes vLLM [47] inference framework and following the procedures outlined in Chain-of-Thought Hub [77] and Active-Prompt [78]. For sequence-based evaluations, we use the Language Model Evaluation Harness framework [79]. Detailed statistics for each benchmark dataset are provided in Table 6.

### Evaluation Efficiency

Certain model editing methods, such as GRACE [38] and SERAC [18], modify the model architecture, which can result in incompatibilities with serving frameworks like vLLM. To provide a clear understanding of the efficiency impact, Table 7 compares the time costs of running benchmarks with and without vLLM. The comparison highlights the significant reduction in time costs when using vLLM, demonstrating its efficiency. Specifically, for the Llama2-7B model, the MMLU benchmark shows a reduction from 840 minutes to 103 minutes, the GSM8K benchmark from 7 minutes to 5 minutes, and the CSQA benchmark from 42 minutes to 26 minutes.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline Dataset & Task Type & \# Few-shot & \# Test & Metric & Evaluation Method \\ \hline MMLU [28] & World Knowledge & 5 & 14,079 & Accuracy & Generation-Based \\ BBH [29] & World Knowledge & 3 & 6,511 & Accuracy & Generation-Based \\ GSM8K [40] & Arithmetic & 8 & 1,319 & Exact match & Generation-Based \\ CSQA* [41] & Commonsense & 7 & 1,221 & Accuracy & Generation-Based \\ TriviaQA [42] & Reading Comprehension & 0 & 17,900 & Exact match & Generation-Based \\ TruthfulQA [43] & Truthful & 0 & 817 & Accuracy & Sequence-Based \\ ToxiGen [44] & Hate Speech & 0 & 940 & Accuracy & Sequence-Based \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: The statistics of the datasets used in this paper. # Ex. are the number of few-shot chain-of-thought exemplars used to prompt each task in evaluation. # Test denote the number of training data and test data, respectively. *: CSQA do not have publicly available test set labels, so we simply follow the setting by [80; 78] to evaluate the performance of the development set.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c|c c} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Method} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{With vLLM} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Without vLLM} \\ \cline{2-7}  & MMLU & GSM8K & CSQA & MMLU & GSM8K & CSQA \\ \hline Llama2-7B & 103 & 5 & 26 & 840 & 7 & 42 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: **The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.** The checklist should follow the references and follow the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:

* You should answer [Yes], [No], or [NA].
* [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
* Please provide a short (1-2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

**The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.** They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

* **Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading "NeurIPS paper checklist"**,
* **Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.**
* **Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers**.

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: we do so. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: we do so.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
* The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
* The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
* The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
* The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: none Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the details for reproduction can be found in Appendix F. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: in appendix F Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). ** Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: in section 3 and appendix F Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: in section 4 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: in appendix F Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. ** The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: yes Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [TODO] Guidelines: after refernece * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: none Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: we do so. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: none Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: none Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: none Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
