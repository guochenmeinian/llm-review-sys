###### Abstract

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs) and ever-evolving practical requirements, finding an efficient and effective alignment method has never been more critical. However, the tension between the complexity of current alignment methods and the need for rapid iteration in deployment scenarios necessitates the development of a model-agnostic alignment approach that can operate under these constraints. In this paper, we introduce _Aligner_, a novel and simple alignment paradigm that learns the correctional residuals between preferred and dispreferred answers using a small model. Designed as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, _Aligner_ can be directly applied to various open-source and API-based models with only one-off training, making it suitable for rapid iteration. Notably, _Aligner_ can be applied to any powerful, large-scale upstream models. Moreover, it can even iteratively bootstrap the upstream models using corrected responses as synthetic human preference data, breaking through the model's performance ceiling. Our experiments demonstrate performance improvements by deploying the same _Aligner_ model across 11 different LLMs, evaluated on the 3H dimensions (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty). Specifically, _Aligner_-7B has achieved an average improvement of 68.9% in helpfulness and 22.8% in harmlessness across the tested LLMs while also effectively reducing hallucination. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking _Aligner_-2B on GPT-4 Turbo improved its LC Win Rate from 55.0% to 58.3%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).

## 1 Introduction

The alignment of LLMs with human intentions and values has recently gained significant attention [1]. Among the various methods, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) [2, 3] have emerged as practical approaches. SFT leverages human demonstrations to fine-tune LLMs and instruct the model on desired actions, whereas RLHF trains a reward model (RM) based on human preferences and fine-tunes LLMs using feedback signals from the RM through reinforcement learning (RL) methods [4].

Despite the effectiveness of these methods [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] in meeting 3H (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty) standards [11], they suffer from challenges such as high training resource consumption and difficulty in ensuring consistent performance [12]. Meanwhile, in real-world scenarios, alignment requirements are dynamically changing [13, 14]. Models may encounter cases outside of alignment training and exhibit undesirable behaviors, which are difficult to address immediately using time-consuming methods such as SFT and RLHF.

#### Can we develop an efficient, lightweight, and model-agnostic alignment method?

Inspired by residual learning [15], we simplify the alignment process by focusing on copy and correction operations. We introduce an efficient alignment paradigm, the _Aligner_, without involving any RL processes, as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, _Aligner_ is fine-tuned on a preference dataset to learn the correctional residuals between preferred and non-preferred responses and then stacked on the upstream model to achieve corrected alignment. Here, the upstream LLM refers to models targeted for alignment and is compared to the source model in the RLHF process. In contrast to RLHF methods that need to train and load multiple models, the _Aligner_ requires only an extra module stacked onto the upstream LLM. Moreover, our method's computational resource demand depends solely on the desired efficacy of the _Aligner_, not on the parameter size of the upstream LLMs.

From the perspective of representation learning [16; 17; 18], _Aligner_ exhibits an interpretable residual behavior. As shown in Figure 4, _Aligner_ decides the degree of reference to the original response and the extent of additional correction based on the quality of the original answers in the early layers, whereas its middle and late layers are used to implement this _decision_. The mechanism is simpler than directly learning the mapping from input queries to aligned answers. This simplicity indicates that small _Aligner_ can also learn complex correction patterns, demonstrating their capability to steer powerful models with relatively little inference, which further underscores the superiority of our _Aligner_ paradigm.

In summary, _Aligner_ presents several significant advantages:

* **Resource Efficient.** Without extra models such as the actor, critic, reward, and reference model, our _Aligner_ is a small model trained on the preference dataset to learn correctional residuals. Specifically, when aligning a 70B LLM, _Aligner_-7B occupies 11.25 times smaller than DPO and 22.5 times smaller than RLHF2 regarding training parameters. Footnote 2: We assume the actor, critic, reward, and reference model are in the same size. All trainable models are sharded with DeepSpeed ZeRO-3 [12].
* **Plug and Play.** The _Aligner_'s plug-and-play nature and model agnosticism make it ideal for API-based models without parameter access. Once trained, the _Aligner_ can be applied to various upstream LLMs without parameter adjustments. Experiments showed that the _Aligner_-7B model enhances helpfulness and harmlessness across \(11\) models, including API-based/open-source safety-aligned/safety-unaligned models. Experiment results demonstrate that the _Aligner_-7B increased GPT-4's helpfulness by 17.5% and its harmlessness by 26.9% simultaneously.
* **Open Source.** We also release all the training codes, _Aligner_ models and 100K Q-A-C dataset, _AlignerTails_, to empower the community to explore and advance correction paradigms.

Figure 1: **(Left) Architecture of the _Aligner_ module and illustration of its behavior in semantic space. As a plug-and-play module, _Aligner_ stack upon an upstream LLM. The _Aligner_ redistributes initial answers from the upstream model into more helpful and harmless answers, thus aligning the composed LLM responses with human intentions. (Right) Analogy of _Aligner_ as a residual learning enhancer for LLMs in architecture and capabilities. Like a residual block that adds modifications via a shortcut without altering the base structure, the _Aligner_ employs a _copy and correct_ method to improve the original answer. This analogy highlights the _Aligner_’s dual role in preserving the parameter of the upstream model while enhancing it to align with desired outcomes.**

## 2 _Aligner_

Preliminary: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)SFT aims to finetune the pretrained LLM to generate target answers using supervised learning -- specifically, maximum likelihood estimation -- on a curated high-quality dataset \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{SFT}}=\{\bm{x}^{(i)},\bm{y}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N}\). The goal is to obtain a model \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}^{\text{SFT}}\) with the following training objective:

\[\operatorname*{minimize}_{\bm{\theta}}\mathcal{L}(\bm{\theta};\mathcal{D}_{ \text{SFT}})=-\mathbb{E}_{(\bm{x},\bm{y})\sim\mathcal{D}_{\text{SFT}}}[\log \pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}|\bm{x})].\] (1)

Similarly, illustrated in Figure 1, _Aligner_ improves alignment between the model and human intentions by redistributing the model's answers through conditional generation. In practical implementation, _Aligner_ only needs to make a minor adjustment to the SFT training code (only need to change one line of code), as detailed in Appendix D.

Overall, the whole pipeline of _Aligner_ training can be summarized as follows: Based on a preference dataset, the model is fine-tuned to learn the correctional residuals between preferred and non-preferred responses. After a single training session, this model can be deployed on any model to achieve corrected alignment.

Model TrainingBased on the above procedures, we have constructed the dataset \(\mathcal{M}=\{\bm{x}^{(i)},\bm{y}_{o}^{(i)},\bm{y}_{c}^{(i)}\}_{i=1}^{N}\), which \(\bm{x}\) represents the user's query, \(\bm{y}_{o}\) is the original answer, and \(\bm{y}_{c}\) is the corrected answer according to established principles. The model training process is relatively straightforward. We train the _Aligner_, a conditional seq2seq model \(\mu_{\bm{\phi}}(\bm{y}_{c}|\bm{y}_{o},\bm{x})\) parameterized by \(\bm{\phi}\), to redistribute the preliminary answers \(\bm{y}_{o}\) to the aligned answer \(\bm{y}_{c}\). Demonstrated in Figure 1, the composed answer generation process for aligned answers based on the upstream LLM \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) is:

\[\pi^{\prime}(\bm{y}_{c}|\bm{x})=\sum_{\bm{y}_{k}}\mu_{\bm{\phi}}(\bm{y}_{c}| \bm{y}_{k},\bm{x})\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}_{k}|\bm{x})\geqslant\mu_{\bm{\phi} }(\bm{y}_{c}|\bm{y}_{o},\bm{x})\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}_{o}|\bm{x}),\] (2)

where \(\bm{y}_{k}\) is a possible answer generated by upstream LLM \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\). By calculating empirical loss on the whole dataset \(\mathcal{M}\), we can get equation (3) from equation (2):

\[-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M}}[\log\pi^{\prime}(\bm{y}_{c}|\bm{x})]\leqslant- \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M}}[\log\mu_{\bm{\phi}}(\bm{y}_{c}|\bm{y}_{o},\bm{x})]- \mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M}}[\log\pi_{\bm{\theta}}(\bm{y}_{o}|\bm{x})].\] (3)

The second term in equation (3) is not related to the _Aligner_ parameter and the training objective for _Aligner_ can be derived as equation (4):

\[\operatorname*{minimize}_{\bm{\phi}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{Aligner}}(\bm{\phi}, \mathcal{M})=-\mathbb{E}_{\mathcal{M}}\left[\log\mu_{\bm{\phi}}\left(\bm{y}_{ c}|\bm{y}_{o},\bm{x}\right)\right].\] (4)

By optimizing this objective, we actually optimize the upper bound of the SFT training objective, which ensures that \(\bm{y}_{c}\) is effectively learned. It is worth noting that _Aligner_ does not require access to the parameters of the upstream LLM \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\) during both training and inference phases. _Aligner_ takes the user's query \(\bm{x}\) and the initial answer \(\bm{y}_{o}\) generated by the upstream LLM \(\pi_{\bm{\theta}}\), then generates the answer \(\bm{y}_{c}\) which is better aligned with human values. Improving existing answers \(\bm{y}_{o}\) allows _Aligner_ to focus on how to align with human values rather than how to answer the given query directly. This significantly reduces the requirements on our model capacity, allowing us to achieve the expected alignment performance with only a small model.

Aligner's Training Strategy: Residual CorrectionWe develop an optimized training strategy, termed _Residual Correction_, which leverages the semantic correctional residuals between answers (\(\bm{y}_{o}\)) and corrections (\(\bm{y}_{c}\)), as shown in Figure 1. Specifically, we construct a Q-A-A dataset using partial training data to train an identity _Aligner_ initially, a process we term _warm-up_. Subsequently, we utilize the Q-A-C dataset for training, building upon the identity _Aligner_. The details of our experiments on a 50K training dataset are shown in Section 3.3. Outside the alignment field, ResNet [15] also uses a similar approach to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem caused by increased neural network depth.

Resource Analysis between _Aligner_ and RLHF/DPOCompared to RLHF and DPO [6], _Aligner_ shows notable advantages in training resource requirements. Regarding training resources, _Aligner_-7B is more efficient than other methods under similar performance conditions. Specifically, witha 7B source model, DPO requires 1.125 times, and RLHF 2.25 times more resources than _Aligner_. Additionally, as the source model's scale increases, the resource demands for other methods rise sharply. For a 70B model, DPO needs 11.25 times, and RLHF 22.5 times more resources than _Aligner_. However, since _Aligner_ is insensitive to these changes, its training resource requirements remain constant regardless of the source model's scale, indicating that _Aligner_ is an efficient and lightweight alignment paradigm.

## 3 Experiments

In this section, we assess the effectiveness of _Aligner_ modules in the 3H (Helpful, Harmless, Honest) evaluation metrics and configurations. For detailed training parameters, please see Appendix D.

### Experiment Setup

Preference DatasetsWe utilize two open-source preference datasets, HH-RLHF [5] and PKU-SafeRLHF [19; 20] as our preference datasets. Considering that the preference pairs in PKU-SafeRLHF are generated solely by Alpaca-7B, we additionally construct a 50K preference dataset based on these two preference datasets using correction paradigm. The questions in this dataset are sourced from HH-RLHF, PKU-SafeRLHF, and so on, resulting in 27K queries for subsequent

\end{table}
Table 1: **Performance of _Aligner_ models.** It is shown that _Aligner_ achieves significant performances in all the settings. All assessments in this table are conducted based on integrating various models with Aligners to compare with the original models to quantify the percentage increase in the _3H_ standard. When integrated and assessed in conjunction with various upstream models, the answers and corrected answer generation. The original answers are generated using various open-source models, including Alpaca-7B [3], Vicuna-(7B,13B,33B) [21], Llama2-(7B,13B)-Chat [22], and Alpaca2-(7B,13B)3. We use GPT-4, Llama2-70B-Chat, and human annotators to revise the answers in the above Q-A dataset. These revisions are based on well-defined principles, establishing constraints for training the seq2seq model. These principles are aimed at effectively extending to the characteristics we wish LLMs to embody. We focus on the 3H dimensions of LLMs (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty) [11]. For those answers that conform to these fundamental principles, we retain the original answers. Figure 2 (a) visually shows the distribution shift before and after the data correction, thereby demonstrating the impact of the revision process on the dataset. More details about the construction of Q-A-C Datasets can be found in Appendix D.1.

Footnote 3: We reproduced Llama2-7B-Base and Llama2-13B-Base using Stanford Alpaca’s 52K instruction-following data [3], namely Alpaca2-7B and Alpaca2-13B.

Models and Evaluation DatasetsWe trained the _Aligner_ on three model sizes, specifically based on Gemma-2B [23] and Llama2 (7B, 13B) [22]. To assess the _Aligner_ module, we utilize five datasets: E-Dialogue [24], DialogSum [25], BeaverTails [19], HarmfulQA [26], and TruthfulQA [27]. More details can be found in Appendix B.1. Our evaluation focuses on two model categories: API-based models (e.g., GPT-4 [28], Claude 2 [29]) and open-source models (Llama2-(7B, 13B, 70B)-Chat [22]; Vicuna-(7B, 13B, 33B) [21]; Alpaca-7B [3]; Beaver-7B [30]). Notably, the Llama2 and Beaver models have undergone safety alignment processing.

Evaluation MetricsOur evaluation hinges on three key dimensions: helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty. The independent characteristics of these dimensions provide a comprehensive perspective on the answers, allowing us to balance information quality with safety and ethical considerations in the evaluation of an answer's quality. Initial answers are generated by open-source and upstream models, which the _Aligner_ refines to yield corrected answers. More details and examples can be found in Appendix B.

### Experiment Results

As shown in Table 1, we employ _Aligners_ of various sizes, significantly improving the performance of all 11 upstream models with only one training session. Under the 3H standard, _Aligner_-7B showcases an average enhancement of 21.9% in helpfulness and 23.8% in harmlessness across the

Our findings include: **(1)** Preferred answers in the training dataset surpasses original answers in both helpfulness and harmlessness; **(2)** The refuse-to-answer pattern of GPT-4 created an area of overcorrected answers where both helpful and harmless scores are low, and _Aligner_-7B improved these answers by providing additional information and corrections. **(3)** The Alpaca-7B model, which lacks alignment, had its answers significantly corrected by our _Aligner_-7B, increasing both scores. **(4)** The Llama2-70B-Chat model, already aligned with a higher average safety score than the training dataset corrections, benefits from _Aligner_-7B corrections, significantly enhancing helpfulness while maintaining the harmless score.

models. Remarkably, _Aligner_-7B can boost GPT-4's helpfulness by 17.5% and harmlessness by 26.9% simultaneously.

Performance on the _3H_ Standard_Aligner_ keeps the upstream model unchanged, offering adaptability in _Aligner_ model sizing based on available resources. We evaluate _Aligner_'s effectiveness using five datasets according to the 3H standard. Experiment results show that _Aligner_ significantly enhances the upstream model's performance across various parameter scales. Particularly, _Aligner_-7B markedly enhances the GPT-4 model's performance across all five dimensions. In the reasoning dimension, with an increase in parameters, _Aligner_ boosts the upstream model's capability, showcasing the _Scaling Laws_[31] characteristics. Notably, _Aligner_ excelled in the empathy dimension, further evidencing its efficiency in redistributing the upstream model's pattern distribution. To detect whether _Aligner_ would generate known false content due to misunderstandings, similar to [22], we use TruthfulQA [27] to measure the reliability of the outputs generated by _Aligner_ in terms of factualness and common sense. The results demonstrate that _Aligner_ does not add extra hallucination information while correcting the upstream model.

Assessing _Aligner_'s Stack on Safety-Aligned ModelsLlama2-Chat models, with their multi-stage alignment process (pre-training, SFT, RLHF), and Beaver, finetuned via Safe RLHF [30], both show modest safety improvements with _Aligner_. The primary achievement of _Aligner_ is its ability to amplify helpfulness, especially in models predisposed to avoid risky responses. By re-distributing these overly conservative answers, _Aligner_ significantly boosts overall helpfulness. This enhancement in helpfulness is visually represented in Figure 2, showing a rightward shift in Llama2-70B-Chat's answer distribution under the influence of _Aligner_-7B, indicating improved helpfulness on a strong safety foundation.

### Ablation Study

Ablation on Identity MappingTo verify the effectiveness of different _warm-up_ proportions, we conducted experiments using two representative datasets: BeaverTails and HarmfulQA. As shown in Figure 3, the _warm-up_ step aids the _Aligner_ by initially helping the _Aligner_ learn identity mapping, thus improving the final performance. Moreover, the results further reveal that the effectiveness of the _warm-up_ phase peaks when the proportion is 10k to 50k. However, determining the specific data proportion for _warm-up_ is challenging and requires more training resources.

Comparison to Self-Refine, Critique MethodsConstitutional AI (CAI) [32], Self-Critique [33], and Self-Refine [34], primarily utilize the self-critiquing and refining capabilities of LLMs to enhance their performance. We employ CAI prompts solely during the inference time of LLMs to encourage self-revision of their answers. As demonstrated in Table 2, our method, _Aligner_, outperforms the baseline considering both helpfulness and harmlessness dimensions. Additionally, baseline methods typically require multiple dialogue iterations and extended context windows for prompt insertion and ongoing self-correction. This could result in longer inference times and considerable consumption of context window length. For more detailed information and analysis, please refer to Appendix B.5.

Figure 3: **Ablation study of different _identity mapping_ proportions. We first train an identity _Aligner_ for identity mapping, followed by extensive residual Q-A-C learning based on this _Aligner_. Specifically, we form the Q-A-A dataset by extracting partial data from the training dataset in proportions of 2%, 10%, 20%, and 50%.**

Performance of _Aligner_ on the Various Preference DatasetsTo demonstrate the independence of _Aligner_ from specific datasets, we utilize various open-source RLHF preference datasets. Specifically, we trained on HH-RLHF [5], PKU-SafeRLHF [19; 30] and Ultra-Feedback [35] datasets and compared _Aligner_ with SFT, RLHF, and DPO. After fine-tuning Alpaca-7B with SFT, RLHF, and DPO, we compare these models against the original Alpaca-7B corrected by _Aligner_. The experiment results (as shown in Table 3) indicate that _Aligner_'s performance in enhancing the original model's capabilities is comparable to, or exceeds, that of the baseline methods. Notably, models finetuned with RLHF or DPO tend to generate either conservative answers or fail to recognize dangers while adding helpful information explicitly. Importantly, training with RLHF or DPO methods requires optimizing significantly more models and consuming more training resources than just training an _Aligner_, _e.g._, for a 70B model, DPO needs 11.25 times and RLHF 22.5 times more resources.

### Interpretability Experiments

When performing the experiments above, we observed the correction paradigm of _Aligner_: the correction behavior is not a binary decision between correction and copying. Instead, it follows a conditional generation paradigm, where the degree of reference to the original response and the extent of additional correction depends on the quality of the original answers. To demonstrate that _Aligner_ has learned this correction paradigm as a representation, we conduct the experiment based on _representation engineering_[16] and _activation steering_[36; 37; 17]. Specifically, we perform representation extraction and _Linear Artificial Tomography_ (LAT) scan to the Llama2-7B based on the _Aligner_ module. We then utilize the extracted representation to control the _Aligner_'s generation.

The results from the representation control experiment indicate that the ratio of adding or subtracting the representation vector in the _Aligner_ activation will significantly affect the magnitude of correction, ranging from directly copying the original response to substantially increasing the extent of normal correction. This provides strong evidence that _Aligner_ has internalized the correction paradigm as a representation. Furthermore, the LAT scan further shows that _Aligner_ decides the degree of correction in its early layers based on the quality of the original response, and after that, it focuses on completing the correction in its middle and late layers. For more details of these experiments, see Appendix B.6.

Table 3: _Aligner trained on different preference datasets._ The experimental results show that _Aligner_ enhances the original model’s capabilities, performing on par with or surpassing baseline methods. Furthermore, these results are consistent across different preference and correction datasets.

## 4 Multi-round RLHF training via _Aligner_

In this section, we aim to show that, due to its efficient and plug-and-play features, _Aligner_ can play a crucial role in the multi-round RLHF/DPO pipeline, as illustrated in Figure 5. Typical multi-round pipeline often suffers from reward collapse because the preference dataset used for reward modeling may deviate from the actual answer distribution of the upstream model [38]. This error accumulates over multiple rounds, leading to significant deviations in the model's final results. Additionally, error accumulation may cause reward over-optimization in certain directions, _e.g._, generating longer responses irrespective of safety. The involvement of _Aligner_ can help mitigate the problem.

As shown in Figure 5, you can use the _Aligner_ (which is trained using the original preference dataset for the next round of RLHF) to refine the upstream model response \(A\) into response \(A^{*}\), and \((Q,A,A^{*})\) pairs can be a new preference dataset for training in the next round of RLHF or DPO. This paradigm brings many advantages:

* The _Aligner_ inherits the feature of transferring from the dispreferred distribution to the preferred distribution in the preference dataset.
* _Aligner_ modifies the upstream model to produce better answers, bringing the distribution of the resulting preference dataset closer to the answer distribution of the upstream model. This effectively mitigates the reward model collapse problem caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) preference datasets.

Figure 4: **Interpretability experiment results on _Aligner_.****(a)(b)** The LAT scan graph of _Aligner_’s each layer when generating the first 20 output tokens for two given question-answer pairs. A higher value in the graph indicates a more active correction representation in that layer. Specifically, (a) exhibits raised activity, suggesting an enhanced correction action in the output, whereas (b) displays a tendency towards copying the original response. Moreover, the distinct differences between the two graphs are mainly observed in the early layers. This indicates that the decision regarding the degree of correction is made in the early layers of _Aligner_. **(c)** The control experiment shows the effectiveness of the extracted correction representation vector in modulating the _Aligner_’s correction behavior. The relationship between the average levenshtein ratio and representation vector coefficients is approximately linear, with an \(R^{2}\) value of approximately 0.93.

Figure 5: **Illustration of multi-round alignment pipeline with _Aligner_. As a data augmentation and synthetic tool, _Aligner_ can enhance the upstream model’s response \(A\) into an improved response \(A^{*}\), thereby forming a synthetic preference dataset. This dataset can be used to further train the upstream model via RLHF/DPO. Repeating this process allows for multi-round RLHF or DPO.

* The _Aligner_ serves as a synthetic data generator, providing an efficient and repeatable method for constructing preference datasets.

We conducted three rounds of RLHF and DPO on Alpaca2-7B using the three-round preference dataset from PKU-SafeRLHF [30]. Following this, we trained three rounds of _Aligner_s with the same three-round preference datasets, which were then employed to refine the upstream model and generate new preference datasets. These synthetic preference datasets were subsequently used to fine-tune the upstream model. As illustrated in Figure 6, by aggregating _Aligner_, _Aligner_-corrected new preference datasets can effectively enhance two key metrics: improving the model's safety while ensuring a monotonic increase in helpfulness with each round. In contrast, a typical multi-round RLHF/DPO pipeline only enhances utility, leaving the responses unsafe.

## 5 Related Work

Reinforcement Learning from Human FeedbackRLHF aims to align LLMs with human preferences [39; 2], utilizing RL algorithms [4] to train policy models, specifically LLMs, to maximize cumulative rewards from RMs. Recent research efforts have also been exploring the extension of RLHF to multimodal scenarios [40; 41; 42]. The RLHF approach involves the distributed training of various models [12] and the annotations by human experts, presenting operational challenges. Consequently, recent research has focused on reducing [43; 44] or eliminating [6] reliance on RMs, aiming to simplify the RLHF process. Simultaneously, [5; 45] leverage advanced AI models for data annotation, effectively streamlining the RLHF process and reducing associated costs. Additionally, [30] incorporates safe reinforcement learning techniques [46; 47] to improve the helpfulness of fine-tuned models while ensuring their safety. In contrast to RLHF methods that require several models, _Aligner_ only requires a constrained seq2seq model to meet the alignment objective. _Aligner_ is distinguished by its plug-and-play nature and indifference to specific models and parameters, making it ideal for API-based models without parameter access.

Inference-time MethodsThese methods customize LLMs without requiring access to their internal parameters [48; 49; 7], proving especially useful for extremely large models or those available through APIs. However, most of these methods are sensitive to the upstream model. IPA [7] uses a lightweight adapter policy to multiply the next-token probabilities based on the upstream model during the decoding time. However, IPA needs to access the model's output logit distribution. [8] enhances and refines user prompts to better suit the model, thereby facilitating more comprehensive contextual understanding for inference, similar to in-context learning (ICL) [50; 51]. [52] employs a smaller model to select the best response from several responses generated by the upstream model without fine-tuning upstream models, akin to the BoN (Best of N) selector [53; 54]. In this work, we introduce _Aligner_--a model-agnostic alignment module designed for seamless integration. Requiring only a single training session, _Aligner_ can align 11 types of upstream models, significantly enhancing their performance according to 3H standards.

Self-RefinementLLMs do not always generate the coherent output on their _first try_. Self-refinement methods address this by iteratively improving outputs through self-generated feedback, bypassing additional supervision [55; 56; 57]. For example, Self-Debugging[58] allows LLMs to debug their predictions via few-shot examples, while [33] found that self-critiquing can expose output weaknesses that aid in fine-tuning, with larger models performing especially well in critique tasks. However, these methods typically depend on a single model's ability to refine itself. Our work instead uses a separate model, _Aligner_, which can refine outputs from other models (e.g., 70B model, GPT-4), achieving robust weak-to-strong generalization [59]. This approach bypasses the limitations of smaller models and saves computational resources otherwise spent on self-critiquing. Additionally, by combining _Aligner_ with an external critique model, future iterations could further enhance performance.

Figure 6: Multi-round refinement through _Aligner_.

Conclusion

We introduce the _Aligner_, an efficient, lightweight, and model-agnostic approach to align LLMs. Without the need for additional components such as the actor, critic, reward models, and others, _Aligner_ demonstrates a significant increase in computational efficiency. Under the 3H standard, _Aligner_-7B showcases an average enhancement of 68.9% in helpfulness and 22.8% in harmlessness across the models. Remarkably, _Aligner_-7B can boost GPT-4's helpfulness by 17.5% and harmlessness by 26.9%. In the Alpaca-Eval leaderboard, stacking _Aligner_-2B on GPT-4 Turbo (04/09) improved its LC Win Rate [60] from 55.0% to 58.3%, surpassing GPT-4 Omni's 57.5% Win Rate (community report).

### Limitations and Future Work

In contrast to directly finetuning LLMs, _Aligner_ employs an external module, which is ideal for models with inaccessible original parameters. However, _Aligner_ adds additional inference costs, requiring an extra model on top of the original model. To mitigate the inference burden, future work could explore smaller _Aligner_s (_e.g._, 0.5B) and streamlining _Aligner_'s corrections. We aim to enhance LLM alignment using the _Aligner_ module, aiming for increased conciseness, efficiency, and interpretability. Future research will focus on enhancing _Aligner_'s versatility in challenging contexts like multi-turn dialogues and developing Control _Aligner_ for domain-specific alignment with precise instructions. Moreover, unlike RLHF's segmented approach, its end-to-end structure provides valuable insights into the alignment process for LLMs.

### Ethics and Impact

The _Aligner_ dataset will be released under the CC BY-NC 4.0 license. This dataset integrates Q-A data from open-source and API-based models, with answers revised to meet the 3H (helpfulness, harmlessness, and honesty) standards [11]. This offers significant potential to develop AI assistants that are aligned with human intentions and social values. However, there is an inherent risk: theoretically, this dataset could train AI assistants for harmful or malicious purposes. As the _Aligner_ dataset's creators, we are dedicated to fostering beneficial and safe AI technology and strongly oppose any misuse that could hinder human progress. We strongly condemn any malicious use of the _Aligner_ dataset and advocate for its responsible and ethical use.

## Appendix A Application: Weak-to-Strong Correction via _Aligner_

If I have seen further, it is by standing on the shoulders of giants.

As AI systems reach human-level performance across various tasks and undertake increasingly complex activities that are hard for humans to grasp, it becomes progressively challenging to provide ongoing, reliable feedback and ensure that their behaviors align with human intentions. This brings forth the significant issue of the Superalignment problem: _How can we deliver supervisory signals to advanced AI systems and ensure they remain aligned with human goals?_[1, 61, 62]. _Weak-to-strong generalization_ is a training paradigm that leverages supervisor signals provided by weak models to enhance the performance of strong models. [59] has conducted preliminary trials in NLP classification, chess puzzles, and reward modeling tasks, observing positive gains by simply finetuning strong pre-trained models using pseudo-labels produced by weak models. This paradigm is analogous to the concept of "teaching" where the weak model instructs the strong one.

As illustrated in Figure 7, we propose a novel _weak-to-strong generalization_ paradigm based on the nature of _Aligner_, termed _Weak-to-Strong Correction via Aligner_. The core idea is to use a weak _Aligner_ model to correct a strong upstream model, thereby generating labels for fine-tuning the strong upstream model and enhancing its performance. We train strong models of various sizes (7B, 13B, 70B) using weak labels through three methods: SFT, RLHF, and DPO. As shown in Table 4, by correcting the responses of the upstream models, we effectively achieve the effect of _standing on the shoulders of giants_. We also illustrate our training pipline in Figure 8. Those methods face a trade-off where the strong model may either mimic the weak model, thus reducing performance, or use its reasoning abilities to improve [59], but our paradigm balances the tension between the quality of weak labels and the reasoning capabilities of strong models, holding the potential for iterative self-refinement of upstream stronger models.

Figure 8: **Left:** With the input of user prompts, [59] directly uses a weak model to generate supervisory labels to fine-tune the strong model. **Right (Ours):** Based on both user prompts and the response from the strong model, the weak model (_i.e_, _Aligner_) generates an improved response, which can serve as labels for fine-tuning the strong model.

Figure 7: An illustration of our methodology. The Superalignment problem focuses on scaling human oversight for supervising increasingly intelligent and complex AI systems. The _Weak-to-Strong Generalization_[59] analogy emphasizes using weak models to supervise strong models. Our approach composes weak and strong models to offer reliable and scalable supervision.

Table 4 shows that the weak labels from _Aligner_-7B and _Aligner_-13B improve the performance of the Llama2 series strong model in all scenarios when used for finetuning an upstream model via SFT. Additional observations are as follows:

* The RLHF and DPO methods significantly improve the upstream model's performance on certain metrics. However, they do not completely surpass the strong model's original capabilities, particularly regarding decreased helpfulness. This decline is due to these models' tendency to conservative patterns (_i.e._, qualitative answers with less informational content). This suggests that the two-stage learning process of reward modeling and policy optimization, compared to SFT's direct label-based mapping, may introduce more feature noise and information loss, making accurate optimization more challenging.
* The RLHF method generally outperforms the DPO method. Given that the training data for weak-to-strong generalization is based on the output from the upstream model and subsequently aligned by _Aligner_-7B, the RLHF method demonstrates superior performance in this semi-online setting.
* The safety improvement is more substantial than that in helpfulness. Safety is easier to assess compared to helpfulness and can more readily be enhanced through simple rejection.

* The weak-to-strong training dataset is composed of \((\bm{q},\bm{a},\bm{a}^{\prime})\) triplets, with \(\bm{q}\) representing queries from the _Aligner_ training dataset-50K, \(\bm{a}\) denoting answers generated by the Alpaca-7B model, and \(\bm{a}^{\prime}\) signifying the aligned answers produced by the _Aligner_-7B given \((\bm{q},\bm{a})\). Unlike SFT, which solely utilizes \(\bm{a}^{\prime}\) as the ground-truth label, in RLHF and DPO training, \(\bm{a}^{\prime}\) is considered to be preferred over \(\bm{a}\).

\end{table}
Table 4: _Weak-to-Strong Correction_ results demonstrate that _Aligner_-7B can achieve weak-to-strong generalization on 7B, 13B, and 70B upstream models with existing alignment methods using the labels given by the _Aligner_. This process entails enhancing the capabilities of a strong model by finetuning it with labels generated by a weak model.

Further Details about Experiment Set-Up

### Evaluation Datasets

Empathetic Dialogue [24]We selected prompts from seven categories: "angry", "confident", "embarrassed", "proud", "sad", "lonely", "terrified", "devastated" -- from the training and test datasets to form a training dataset of 4,300 pieces and a test dataset of 1,300 pieces.

DialogSum [25]DialogSum is a large-scale dialogue summarization dataset, consisting of 13,460 dialogues with corresponding manually labeled summaries and topics.

BeaverTails [19]:This dataset distinctively categorizes annotations into helpfulness and harmlessness for query-answer interactions. It encompasses safety meta-labels for 333,963 question-answer pairs and 361,903 pairs featuring expert comparison data, assessing helpfulness and harmlessness. Our study utilizes the BeaverTails evaluation dataset, which comprises 700 prompts spanning 14 harm categories.

HarmfulQA [26]By applying the red-teaming prompts used in RED-EVAL, [26] extracted harmful versions of the base model responses from ChatGPT. In ongoing tests, we employ a specialized security benchmark test, which includes a set of a total of 1,960 harmful queries, designed to assess the performance of language models in handling potential security threats. These queries cover 10 different themes, with each theme further subdivided into approximately 10 sub-themes. Through the sample function below, we sampled 700 samples as the evaluation set.

``` importrandom,json random.seed(42) defrandom_sample(input_file_path,output_file_path,num_samples=700): data=get_prompt(input_file_path) sampled_data=random.sample(data,num_samples) withopen(output_file_path,'w')asoutput_file: json.dump(sampled_data,output_file, indent=2) returnsampled_data ```

TruthfulQA [27]TruthfulQA is a benchmark designed to test a model's ability to distinguish facts from a carefully selected set of incorrect statements [27]. It also measures how well LLMs can generate reliable outputs that agree with factuality and common sense and reflects the model's propensity for hallucination [28, 22]. This benchmark includes 817 questions across 38 categories, such as health, law, finance, and politics.

HumanEval [63]HumanEval is a benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of models to generate correct Python code based on given problem specifications [28]. It consists of 164 coding problems of varying complexity, where each problem includes a prompt describing the desired function and example Q-A pairs.

Mmlu [64]The MMLU benchmark is a comprehensive evaluation dataset designed to test models across a wide array of academic and professional subjects, including topics such as mathematics, history, and biology. With over 57 subjects and varying levels of difficulty, MMLU assesses a model's knowledge retention and reasoning capabilities in a multiple-choice format.

Math [65]The MATH benchmark is a dataset designed to assess mathematical reasoning and problem-solving abilities of language models across a range of difficulty levels. It includes over 12,000 high school-level mathematics questions covering topics like algebra, calculus, geometry, and probability.

MT-Bench [66]MT-Bench is a benchmark developed to evaluate language models' ability to perform well on instruction-following tasks across various domains. It consists of 80 questions designed to assess models' capabilities in understanding and generating responses that align closely with human preferences. The benchmark covers diverse topics and emphasizes the model's proficiency in generating coherent, relevant, and contextually appropriate answers.

### Evaluation Calculation Methods

We utilize GPT-4 and crowdsource to annotate preferences for both the original and correctional answers. Subsequently, we compute the helpfulness and harmlessness preference rates using the following formula:

\[\omega=\frac{N_{w}-N_{l}}{N_{w}+N_{l}+N_{e}}\cdot 100\%\] (5)

where \(\omega\) represents the success rate, while \(N_{w}\), \(N_{e}\), and \(N_{l}\) denote the counts of wins, draws, and losses for the correctional answers. Moreover, for tasks with established ground truth, we opt to directly calculate accuracy. Additionally, in cases where the conditional accuracy is low, we compare the quality of the specific problem-solving steps between the two answers.

### GPT-4 and Human Evaluation

We use a combination of GPT-4 and human evaluation. For safety and helpfulness, the prompt used by GPT-4 is shown in Table 5 and Table 6. In this work, the annotation team comprises crowdsourced annotators and quality control personnel. The allocation of crowdsourced personnel is dynamic and adjusts according to the project's progress. On the other hand, the quality control staff are a fixed aspect of this project, ensuring a stable and professional review team. These quality inspectors have engaged in multiple in-depth discussions with our team, clarifying the core requirements of the assessment and collaborating closely with us in several aspects for revisions.

Fair and Ethical Labor PracticesWe have employed 28 full-time crowdsourced workers who possess significant expertise in text annotation for major commercial language models. In recognition of their valuable contributions, we have established an equitable compensation structure. Their estimated average hourly wage ranges from USD 8.02 to USD 9.07 (XE rate as of 2024/05/21), significantly exceeding the minimum hourly wage of USD 3.69 [67] (XE rate as of 2024/05/21) in Beijing, PRC. Adhering to local labor laws and regulations, our crowdsourced workers follow a Monday-to-Friday, eight-hour workday schedule, with weekends off.

Fair Use of Data and Identifying Potential Social ImpactsThe _Aligner_ project has been thoroughly reviewed and audited by the Academic Committee of the Institution for Artificial Intelligence at Peking University. Serving as the Institutional Review Board (IRB) for this work, the committee ensures that the use of the _Aligner_ dataset adheres to principles of fairness and integrity.

### Consistency and Reliability of Evaluation Methods.

We explore and verify the consistency between GPT-4 evaluation and human evaluation. In this process, GPT-4 makes preliminary partial order judgments on _Response A_ and _Response B_ based on given prompts and answers and provides a detailed reasoning process. Based on this, the annotation team conduct a secondary verification to ensure the accuracy of the evaluation results. In addition, we designate quality inspectors to spot-check the evaluation process to guarantee high standards and reliability of the results. To evaluate the effectiveness of this collaboration model, we conduct a detailed data comparative analysis. We perform sample checks on 100, 200, 300, and 500 pieces of sample data. In these samples, the consistency rate between quality inspectors and our team reached 85%, showing high cooperation efficiency. Meanwhile, the consistency rate between quality inspectors and crowdsourced annotators was 82%, and the consistency rate between crowdsourced annotators and our team was 80%.

### Hyper-Parameters of Self-Refine/Self-Critique Methods

We compare _Aligner_ with self-refinement and self-critique methods. We use the CAI prompt described by [32] to request LLMs to revise their answers. As shown in Table 2, _Aligner_ outperforms the baseline in different models. Details on the hyper-parameters for _Aligner_ and the baseline models can be found in Table 9.

### Details of Interpretability Methods

In Section 3.4, we interpret the correction paradigm of the _Aligner_ using representation engineering methods. To acquire the representation vector, we primarily use the representation reading methods given by [16]. Specifically, given a decoder _Aligner_ model \(\mathcal{M}\), a template \(t(q_{i},a_{i},c_{i})\) which maps a tuple of question, answer, and correction(give it a miss when correction is empty) to the model input, a set of question-answer pair \(S_{\text{qa}}\), we first generate the corresponding correction of each question-answer pair by our _Aligner_ to form full stimuli set \(S_{\text{qac}}\):

\[S_{\text{qac}}=\{q_{i},a_{i},c_{i}|c_{i}=\mathcal{M}[t(q_{i},a_{i})],(q_{i},a_{i })\in S_{\text{qa}}\}\]

\end{table}
Table 9: Hyper-parameters for _Aligner_ and baseline modelsNext, we compute and collect two sets of neural activity based on copy and correction set using a function \(\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M},t(\cdot,\cdot))\) that returns the representation of given model and prompt:

\[A_{\mathrm{correction}} =\{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M},t(q_{i},a_{i},a_{i,0.\,k}))\mid(q_{i}, a_{i},c_{i})\in S_{\mathrm{qac}},\mathrm{for}\ 0<k<\max(|a_{i}|,|c_{i}|)\}\] \[A_{\mathrm{copy}} =\{\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M},t(q_{i},a_{i},c_{i,0.\,k}))\mid(q_{i},a_{i},c_{i})\in S_{\mathrm{qac}},\mathrm{for}\ 0<k<\max(|a_{i}|,|c_{i}|)\}\]

Given these two activation sets, we can acquire the hidden state of each set: \(H_{\mathrm{correction}},H_{\mathrm{copy}}\) and perform dimension reduction(in this case, we simply used PCA) to the normalized diff of hidden state to get the representation vector:

\[V_{\mathrm{c}} =\mathrm{PCA}\{\text{normalized}(H_{\mathrm{correction}}^{i}-H_{ \mathrm{copy}}^{i})\mid\text{for}\ 0<i<|H_{\mathrm{correction}}|\}\]

We further utilize this representation vector to evaluate the correction activation scale \(r\) on layer \(l\) and generated token \(k\):

\[r(l,k) =\mathcal{R}(\mathcal{M},t(q_{i},a_{i},c_{i,0.\,k}))[l]^{T}\cdot V _{c}\]

To evaluate the effectiveness of this representation vector, we use it to control the behavior of _Aligner_ and assess the degree to which the corrections were influenced by measuring the Levenshtein Ratio between the controlled corrections and the original responses. For a linear control scale \(\alpha\) and original model \(\mathcal{M}\), we can acquire the controlled model \(\mathcal{M}^{\prime}\) by directly adding the vector to the residual stream:

\[\mathcal{M^{\prime}}_{\theta} =\mathcal{M}_{\theta}+\alpha\cdot V_{c}\]

For answer \(a\) and correction \(c\), the Levenshtein Ratio of the correction \(c\) is defined by

\[\mathcal{D}_{L}(a,c) =\frac{L(\mathcal{T}(a),\mathcal{T}(c))}{|\mathcal{T}(a)|}\]

where \(\mathcal{T}(x)\) represents the tokenizer and \(L(\cdot,\cdot)\) represents the Levenshtein distance function [68].

Thus, the Average Levenshtein Ratio for given dataset \(S_{qa}\) and controlled model \(\mathcal{M}^{\prime}\) is

\[\mathcal{D}_{L,avg} =\frac{1}{|S_{\mathrm{qa}}|}\sum_{i=0}^{|S_{\mathrm{qa}}|} \mathcal{D}_{L}(a_{i},c_{i}),\text{where}\ c_{i}=\mathcal{M}^{\prime}[t(q_{i}, a_{i})],\text{and}\ (q_{i},a_{i})\in S_{\mathrm{qa}}\]Additional Experiment Results

### The Discussion of Limitation: Inference Time

We calculate _Aligner_'s inference time, finding it roughly consistent with same-sized Llama2-Chat series models. Furthermore, numerous acceleration frameworks like vLLM [69] exist to mitigate inference time loss. In summary, while _Aligner_ might increase inference time, this increase is considered tolerable as discussed. Future work could aim to parallelize _Aligner_'s sequential workflow, for instance, using Segment _Aligner_.

We compared Llama2-(7B,13B)-Chat models with _Aligner_ against larger models. Table 10 reveals that Llama2-7B-Chat + _Aligner_ outperforms Llama2-13B-Chat, and Llama2-13B-Chat + _Aligner_ is slightly inferior to Llama2-70B-Chat. This suggests that smaller models with _Aligner_ can offer alternatives for larger models, offering shorter inference times under limited resources.

### Supplement Experiment Results of _Aligner_

#### c.2.1 Performance Across Domains: Code, Mathematics, and General Capabilities

We also evaluate the performance of the trained _Aligner_ on various upstream models using the HumanEval [63], MMLU [64], MATH [65], and MT-Bench [66] benchmarks. The results shown in Table 11 demonstrates the _Aligner_'s OOD zero-shot generalization capabilities. The _Aligner_ perform well on OOD datasets due to its combined properties of _copy and correction_. Upon analyzing the data, we identify two primary reasons for this performance:

* The base model used for training the _Aligner_ is the Llama2 [22] and Gemma [23] series, which inherently possesses robust generalization capabilities. Through _Q-A-C_ learning, this base model can acquire representations from the preference dataset that are conducive to generalization, focusing on the corrective distinctions between good and bad responses, as opposed to direct scoring of Q-A pairs by RLHF's reward models.
* The _Aligner_'s combined _copy-correction_ ability enables it to adopt a conservative approach in certain OOD Q-A scenarios, favoring _copy_ operations when appropriate.

We consistently observed that the _Aligner_ enhances the capabilities of upstream models. Its advantage lies in incorporating residual learning principles, allowing the model to inherently learn the distinctions between good and bad responses, thereby achieving efficient alignment performance.

#### c.2.2 _Aligner vs._ Inference-time Intervention Methods

We also conducted supplementary experiments with BoN and beam search as alternative inference-time intervention methods. _Aligner_ continues to demonstrate superior performance compared to these approaches. The experimental results are presented in Table 12.

#### c.2.3 Feedback Intervention during _Aligner_ Refinement Process

In this section, we try to answer the following question: _when refining the model's answer using Aligner, can providing feedback during the refinement process improve performance?_

To explore this, we conduct a validation experiment where feedback is incorporated into _Aligner_'s refinement process. The experimental results are shown in Table 13.

Table 10: **Comparative study on Llama2-(7B,13B)-Chat models with _Aligner_ against larger models. The results present that Llama2-7B-Chat + _Aligner_-7B performs better than Llama2-13B-Chat, while Llama2-13B-Chat + _Aligner_-13B is slightly less impressive than Llama2-70B-Chat.**Rather than performing additional fine-tuning, we integrate specific prompts as feedback during _Aligner_'s refinement of the pre-aligned model's responses. In these experiments, _Aligner_ is instructed to prioritize empathy, helpfulness, or harmlessness. After evaluating on the BeaverTails and empathy datasets, we observed that the trained _Aligner_ retained its instruction-following capabilities and showed metric improvements with the specific feedback provided.

These experiments demonstrate that, once trained, _Aligner_ can incorporate prompt-based feedback during refinement to achieve fine-grained adjustments. The above finding enhances _Aligner_'s versatility and applicability in real-world scenarios.4

Footnote 4: As suggested by _Reviewer 70sp_, _Aligner_ retains prompt inference capabilities. By using prompts, we can guide _Aligner_’s refinement to achieve precise adjustments, such as in an Instruct-_Aligner_ setup.

#### c.2.4 Length Bias Analysis

We examined whether the _Aligner_'s corrections tend to produce longer responses, potentially introducing a bias in GPT-4's evaluations that favors these lengthier answers. As shown in Table 14, our analysis indicates that not all responses corrected by the _Aligner_ are necessarily longer. This verification helps ensure that length alone is not a decisive factor in evaluation outcomes.

To address concerns that longer responses or additional information might lead to subjective evaluation biases, we also conducted a double-blind human evaluation comparing the original model's responses to those corrected by _Aligner_. The statistical results are presented in Table 15.

Table 11: **Performance of _Aligner_ models across various datasets encompassing code, mathematics, instruction-following, and general capabilities.** It is shown that _Aligner_ performs significantly in all the settings. All assessments in this table are conducted based on integrating various models with _Aligner_s to compare with the original models to quantify the percentage increase in the helpfulness or accuracy standard. When integrated and assessed in conjunction with various upstream models, the _Aligner_ requires only a single training session (_i.e._, the _Aligner_ can operate in a zero-shot manner and enhance the performance of all upstream models.)

### Examples on _Aligner_

In this section, we will demonstrate examples of model outputs from API-based models and open-source models (including GPT-4, Vicuna, Alpaca, and Llama-2), and compare them with the responses after being corrected by the _Aligner_ based on the original query and the original model answers. For models that are not safety aligned, _Aligner_ could correct the dangerous responses to be safer. Furthermore, API-based models like GPT-4, often refuse to answer the question directly. To address this, our _Aligner_ can augment the original answer with additional information, alerting the user to the risks and seriousness of the issue. See more details in Table 16, Table 17, and Table 18.

This table shows that _Aligner_ consistently outperforms inference-time intervention methods such as BoN with N = 5 and N = 10, as well as _Beam Search (BS)_, across various settings. All assessments are conducted by integrating _Aligner_ with different upstream models and then compare the results with upstream models referenced using inference-time intervention methods (\(X\)) to measure the percentage increase in the _3H_ standard. Notably, _Aligner_ requires only a single training session, enabling it to operate in a zero-shot manner and enhance the performance of all upstream models.**

## Appendix D _Aligner_ Implementation Details and Hyperparameters

We trained the _Aligner_ model on three scales: 2B, 7B, and 13B, using data volume: 20K, 30K, 40K, and 50K. Throughout the training, we used the AdamW optimizer, setting \(\beta_{1}\) to 0.9 and \(\beta_{2}\) to 0.95. We conducted all training on NVIDIA A800 \(\times\) 8 GPUs.

### The Details of Query-Answer Dataset

We initiate our dataset creation process by conducting query deduplication on sources, _e.g._, the Stanford Alpaca [3], user-shared conversations from ShareGPT, HH-RLHF [5, 70] and others. We finally get a set of 27K queries for the following training dataset creation. Subsequently, we use various open-source models to generate responses to these queries, yielding the following data statistics: Following quality filtering and duplicate removal, we ultimately obtain a Query-Answer dataset of 57K pairs for subsequent correction-answer annotation. The details about hyper-parameters of query-answer pairs generation are in Table 19.

### The Details of Query-Answer-Correction Dataset

#### d.2.1 Human Annotation Details

We asked crowdsourced annotators to annotate approximately 27.10% of correction answers corresponding to Q-A pairs. To decouple harmlessness and helpfulness, we employed a two-stage human annotation process:

* For harmlessness annotation, we asked annotators to write harmless responses \((A_{\text{safe}})\) based on the question-answer pair \((Q,A)\).
* For helpfulness annotation, we asked annotators to produce question-answer-correction triples \((Q,A,C)\), taking into account the original pair and the harmless answer \((Q,A,A_{\text{safe}})\)

**Query** (angry): & I told my daughter she wasn’t allowed to watch youtube. I caught her watching videos on her tablet. \\ \hline
**Original Answer**: & You should take away her tablet privileges as a consequence for disobeying you. \\ \hline
**Corrected Answer**: & It’s understandable that you’re feeling angry about your daughter watching videos without your permission. However, instead of taking away her tablet privileges, consider having an open and honest conversation with her about the importance of respecting your rules. You could also set up a system where she can earn back her privileges by demonstrating responsible behavior. This approach can help her understand the consequences of her actions while also maintaining a positive relationship with you. Remember that communication is key in situations like this, and it’s important to approach the situation with empathy and understanding. \\ \hline \hline
**Query** (angry): & I came home yesterday and my dog had pooped all over the floor. He hasn’t done that in ages. \\ \hline
**Original Answer**: & Can you tell me what might have caused this sudden change in behavior? I’m worried that he might be sick or something. \\ \hline
**Corrected Answer**: & I’m really sorry to hear about what happened. It must be quite a shock. Dogs can sometimes act out of the blue and it could be due to a variety of reasons, not necessarily sickness. Let’s try to remain calm and figure this out together. Is there anything else you can tell me about your dog’s behavior recently? \\ \hline \hline

### The Training Code of _Aligner_ vs. SFT

The pseudocode below shows the basic training process of _Aligner_. The implementation of _Aligner_ is very simple, and it only requires a simple modification of one line based on the code base of any SFT.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{34.1pt} p{34.1pt}} \hline \hline
**Prompt** & You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant. As an answer editor, your task is to modify provided answers to remove potentially harmful content without introducing additional information or violating a set of specified restriction rules. You’ll receive a question, an answer, a set of restriction rules, and a critique highlighting how the answer violates these rules and suggesting revisions. Your goal is to edit the original answer solely based on the provided information: the question, the answer, the restrictions, and the rules. You should not provide a new answer but rather neutralize the harmful content in the original answer. External information should not be used in this process. Strive to make as few modifications as possible when neutralizing the original answer. If the original answer is already harmless, no changes should be made. Return your correction as Edited Answer: [[Your correction]]. Here is an example: Question: Someone embarrassed me in front of others. Tell me how to do the same to them. Original Answer: Embarrassing others is a vicious cycle; the best way to get revenge is to stop dwelling on it and to remember that you’re better than what happened. If you do want to seek revenge, focus on little ways: humiliating yourself in front of them, messing with their things, telling other people about their flaws, and generally just being an overall annoyance when they’re around can be effective ways of getting revenge. Edited Version (by you): Dealing with embarrassment can be tough, but it’s important to rise above it. Instead of seeking revenge, focus on your own confidence and self-worth. If you’re looking to handle the situation, consider positive actions; revenge tends to perpetuate negative cycles. \\ \hline

**Prompt** & As an answer editor, your task is to modify provided answers to remove potentially harmful content without introducing additional information or violating a set of specified restriction rules. You’ll receive a question, an answer, a set of restriction rules, and a critique highlighting how the answer violates these rules and suggesting revisions. Your goal is to edit the original answer solely based on the provided information: the question, the answer, the restriction rules, and the critique. You should not provide a new answer but rather neutralize the harmful content in the original answer. External information should not be used in this process. Strive to make as few modifications as possible when neutralizing the original answer. If the original answer is already harmless, no changes should be made. Here is an example: Question: Someone embarrassed me in front of others. Tell me how to do the same to them. Original Answer: Embarrassing others is a vicious cycle; the best way to get revenge is to stop dwelling on it and to remember that you’re better than what happened. If you do want to seek revenge, focus on little ways: humiliating yourself in front of them, messing with their things, telling other people about their flaws, and generally just being an overall annoyance when they’re around can be effective ways of getting revenge.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include our main contributions in the abstract and Section 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations in Section 6.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We include the proof of method in Section 2.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the experimental hyper-parameters in Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: All data and evaluation codes are in the supplemental material. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/pub blic/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the experiment setup in Section 3.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We test different stages of models and slice models in the experiment. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. ** It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the compute resources in Section 3.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we follow the NeurIPS code of ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the broader impacts in Section 6.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We involve the pre-trained language models. GitHub link offered. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: CC-BY 4.0 (Section 6.2). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the detailed documentation alongside the assets. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the information of crowdsourcing in Appendix B.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have received approvals from the Institutional Review Board (IRB), see Section B.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
