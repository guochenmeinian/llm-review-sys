###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) have advanced to encompass extensive knowledge across diverse domains. Yet controlling what a large language model should not know is important for ensuring alignment and thus safe use. However, accurately and efficiently unlearning knowledge from an LLM remains challenging due to the potential collateral damage caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting, and the large computational requirements for optimization across state-of-the-art models with hundreds of billions of parameters. In this work, we present **Embedding-COrupted (ECO) Prompts**, a lightweight unlearning framework for large language models to address both the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency. Instead of relying on the LLM itself to unlearn, we enforce an unlearned state during inference by employing a prompt classifier to identify and safeguard prompts to forget. We learn corruptions added to prompt embeddings via zeroth order optimization toward the unlearning objective offline and corrupt prompts flagged by the classifier during inference. We find that these embedding-corrupted prompts not only lead to desirable outputs that satisfy the unlearning objective but also closely approximate the output from a model that has never been trained on the data intended for forgetting. Through extensive experiments on unlearning, we demonstrate the superiority of our method in achieving promising unlearning at _nearly zero side effects_ in general domains and domains closely related to the unlearned ones. Additionally, we highlight the scalability of our method to 100 LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 236B parameters, incurring no additional cost as the number of parameters increases. We have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/chrisliu298/llm-unlearn-eco.

## 1 Introduction

The use of large language models (LLMs), trained on extensive text corpora [2, 45, 6, 131, 64, 8, 144], has increasingly become standard in daily life since the arrival of ChatGPT [103]. Despite the benefits LLMs offer, they pose potential risks across a range of domains, such as copyright infringement [65, 49, 72], dissemination of hazardous knowledge [73, 53, 39, 115], and privacy violations [126, 95, 100]. Adherence to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [37], which requires the removal of users' data post-training, is essential. Machine unlearning has emerged as a new paradigm [19, 101] and has been widely studied for classification models and tasks in recent years [130, 79, 69, 38]. However, unlearning in the context of LLMs remains largely underexplored, presenting unique challenges and risks that extend beyond privacy concerns due to the infeasibility ofretraining from scratch [19; 20], the ease with which anyone can access powerful models, and the substantial capabilities of these models across various tasks [80; 88].

Various machine unlearning methods have been proposed specifically for LLMs to address the above challenges. A major line of approaches focuses on parameter fine-tuning [60] based on a modified loss, usually by unlearning on the forget data and learning from the retained data to preserve utility [137; 143; 23; 142; 73; 149; 62], which requires only a small number of weight updates compared to retraining from scratch. Other approaches include model editing techniques [58; 139; 13; 148; 56; 102; 83], unlearning via in-context examples in the prompt [106; 99], and guarding the prompts themselves [129]. Although effective, some approaches have been shown to impair a model's general capabilities [50; 88]. This is due to **knowledge entanglement** caused by the fuzzy boundary between retention and forgetting objectives (e.g., forgetting a single person without affecting other related ones) [93; 90; 88; 109]. Additionally, most prior work targets unlearning at the million- to billion-parameter scale through gradient-based optimization [143; 56; 36; 142; 90; 149; 73; 62], making the cost of unlearning scale with the model size and potentially expensive even with parameter-efficient modules. This cost could rise significantly for advanced proprietary models with hundreds of billions of parameters (e.g., GPT-4 [2], Gemini [45], Claude [6], and other model-as-a-service (MaaS) [42] providers), which makes gradient-based unlearning methods impractical.

In this work, we explore if an "unlearned state" can be imposed on an intact LLM and focus on tackling the challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning inefficiency in LLMs. We hypothesize that unlearning can be implemented as a state by decomposing the unlearning problem into two more tractable subproblems: 1) unlearning target identification, which explicitly identifies if the prompt contains content within the unlearning target, and 2) forgetting, which ensures that the generated responses no longer reflect any prior knowledge related to the unlearning target. We present **Embedding-COrrupted (ECO) Prompts**, a lightweight two-step framework to tackle both problems above:

1. To identify the unlearning target, we use a prompt classifier that is trained to explicitly model the prompt distribution and to safeguard prompts within the scope of the unlearning target.
2. To achieve forgetting, we approximate an unlearned state by passing the query identified by the prompt classifier to the LLM, but in a corrupted form. We leverage corruptions learned efficiently via zeroth-order optimization [124; 125] and apply them to the prompt's embedding space during inference.

Our contributions are as follows:

Figure 1: **Using embedding-corrupted prompts to maintain an unlearned state** on the LLM subject to unlearning. We first employ a classifier to identify whether the incoming prompt falls within the scope of the unlearning target. We construct embedding-corrupted prompts by selectively corrupting dimensions within the tokens’ embeddings. The corruption parameter is learned offline via zeroth order optimization. An unlearned state is imposed during inference and does not require any updates to the original model’s weights.

* We introduce Embedding-COrupted (ECO) Prompts, a novel and lightweight LLM unlearning method that enforces an unlearned state over an intact LLM.
* We demonstrate that, instead of relying on unlearning objective optimization, carefully corrupted prompts lead to behavior that resembles that of a model which has never seen the data intended to be forgotten, across multiple tasks and metrics.
* Through extensive experiments across three knowledge unlearning tasks, we demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both retaining and forgetting, incurring virtually zero side effects and no additional cost when scaling to larger models.
* To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate universally effective and efficient unlearning for 100 LLMs and up to 236B parameters.

## 2 Preliminaries and Problem Setup

### Threat Model

In our threat model, we consider threats in three categories: entity leaking, hazardous knowledge, and copyrighted content extraction. We consider a gray box setting similar to that of [73] and [129], where users interact with an LLM or a model-as-a-service [42] through a chat interface or structured API access [121]. Under this setting, all users can send prompts to the LLM and receive the corresponding completions or per-token logits of the output tokens. We also assume that adversaries within the user group generate prompts in-distribution and attempt to jailbreak either the guarding mechanism or the LLM itself. Our threats and goals below are as follows.

**Entity leaking** Entity leaking occurs when an LLM inadvertently discloses the identity or sensitive information of specific individuals whose data was unintentionally included in the training set [67; 17; 86]. Our goal is to ensure that the LLM either provides incorrect responses or refuses to answer queries from threat agents that involve these individuals or groups.

**Hazardous knowledge** Given the ease of use and accessibility of both commercial and open-source LLMs, individuals with malicious intent could exploit the advanced capabilities of LLMs to acquire hazardous knowledge at minimal cost [73; 53; 39; 115]. Here, the objective is to prevent such actors from obtaining dangerous knowledge from LLMs while ensuring that the models retain their original capabilities in benign but related domains.

**Copyrighted content** Extracting and distributing copyrighted content from an LLM is generally illegal, as it involves reproducing and distributing protected material without permission [49; 65; 72]. Even if copyrighted content is filtered from the pre-training data, fragments of the text may still be scattered throughout the corpus, and the LLM could memorize them. An attempt to extract the original passage by prompting with a known portion of the text might cause the LLM to generate the passage verbatim, which we aim to prevent.

Beyond the categorization of risks presented above, we also highlight a commonly overlooked aspect in unlearning: **timeliness**[109; 123; 16; 101]. Timeliness measures how quickly unlearning can be completed once the relevant risks are identified. Given the volume of real-time interactions from MaaS users [42], the effectiveness of LLM unlearning may degrade progressively with each hour of delay, particularly in safety and privacy domains. Our objective is to develop a method that can be implemented with extreme efficiency, ideally operating in real-time.

### Problem Setup

We assume a learning algorithm \(A\)3, the training set \(D_{tr}\), and the forget set \(D_{f}\). For each dataset \(D\), we have \(D=\left\{\mathbf{z}_{i}\right\}_{i=1}^{N}\), where each \(\mathbf{z}_{i}=\left\{\mathbf{x}_{i},\mathbf{y}_{i}\right\}\). In the traditional setting of machine unlearning [19; 101], a retained model \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{r}\) that has never seen the forget dataset is obtained via the learning algorithm but excluding the forget set, \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{r}=A(D_{tr}\setminus D_{f})\), where \(D_{r}=D_{tr}\setminus D_{f}\) is known as the retain set. We use \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\) to denote the **original model4** obtained from the learning algorithm \(A\), and \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{r}\) to represent a **retained model** retained from scratch via an unlearning algorithm \(U\), which we define below, by training on \(D_{tr}\) and \(D_{r}\), respectively.

Footnote 3: This algorithm \(A\) may not be deterministic and is assumed to be randomized.

Footnote 4: Throughout the paper, we also call \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\) “the model subject to unlearning.”

Based on our threat model in Section 2.1, which does not allow users to access model weights, instead of achieving unlearning in the weight space [101], we focus on weak unlearning [11] in the output space. Specifically, we aim for similarity between models \(h(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta}_{r})\) and \(h(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta}_{u})\) for all \(\mathbf{x}\), where \(h:\mathcal{X}\times\Theta\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\) maps from the input space \(\mathcal{X}\) and weight space \(\Theta\) to the output space \(\mathcal{Y}\).

A relaxed objective of unlearningBecause we are in the LLM setting, we use a relaxed definition of unlearning that does not require differential privacy requirements (i.e., \((\epsilon,\delta)\)-close), similar to [118]. More specifically, we follow prior work [46; 23; 69; 61; 142; 54] and evaluate whether the retained model and the unlearned model's metric values over a set of metrics \(\mathcal{M}=\{m_{1},m_{2},...,m_{K}\}\) are similar on both \(D_{r}\) and \(D_{f}\). To maintain the general utility of the LLM after unlearning, we would also like the model to perform well on an o.o.d. general domain distribution \(\mathcal{D}_{g}\), which is unknown during unlearning. Therefore, our goal of unlearning is

\[\frac{\mathbb{E}[m_{i}\left(h\left(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta}_{u}\right)\right)]} {\mathbb{E}[m_{i}\left(h\left(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta}_{r}\right)\right)]}\approx 1\] (1)

for all \(m_{i}\in\mathcal{M}\), where \(\mathcal{M}\) is a set of non-negative metrics. We want this to hold separately for each case \(\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\mathcal{D}_{f}}(\mathbf{x})\), \(\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\mathcal{D}_{r}}(\mathbf{x})\), and \(\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\mathcal{D}_{g}}(\mathbf{x})\). During evaluation, we assess whether the two models have empirically similar performance over the metrics set \(\mathcal{M}\).

## 3 ECO: Unlearned LLMs via Embedding-Corrupted Prompts

### Method Overview

Our method consists of two steps: 1) train a prompt classifier to predict if an incoming prompt falls within the scope of unlearning, and 2) corrupt the prompt in the embedding space if the classifier makes a positive prediction (i.e., should forget).

Enforcing retaining and forgetting via a classifierWe first train a prompt classifier to explicitly identify if the prompt falls within the scope of unlearning. For any incoming prompt, \(\mathbf{x}\), the prompt classifier \(C\) takes in \(\mathbf{x}\) and returns \(p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})=1-p_{C}(r\mid\mathbf{x})\), the probability of the prompt being in the scope of forgetting. Similar to any classifier prediction, if \(p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})>p_{C}(r\mid\mathbf{x})\), we consider \(\mathbf{x}\) as containing the unlearning concept that our LLM is supposed to forget. Formally, given a positive prediction, \(p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})>p_{C}(r\mid\mathbf{x})\), we replace the original input \(\mathbf{x}\) with \(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}\). Otherwise, the original \(\mathbf{x}\) is passed to the LLM.

\[\mathbf{x}=\begin{cases}\tilde{\mathbf{x}}&p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})>p_{C}(r\mid \mathbf{x})\\ \mathbf{x}&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\] (2)

Embedding-corrupted promptsInstead of modifying \(\mathbf{x}\) in the token space, we corrupt it in the embedding space. Let \(\mathbf{x}=\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{T}\}\) be a prompt of \(T\) tokens and \(\mathbf{e}=\{e_{1},e_{2},\ldots,e_{T}\}\) be the corresponding embedding vectors. Let \(\mathcal{E}\) be the space of the token embeddings. Each embedding vector is produced by an embedding function \(E:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d}\). We also use the symbol \(\sigma\in\mathcal{S}\) (where \(\mathcal{S}\subset\mathbb{R}\)) to denote the strength of the corruption, which parameterizes the corruption function. Formally, for a single prompt \(\mathbf{x}\) mapped to the embeddings \(\mathbf{e}=E(\mathbf{x})=\{e_{1},e_{2},\ldots,e_{T}\}\), a corruption function \(\texttt{Corrupt}:\mathcal{E}\times\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\mathcal{E}\), parameterized by \(\sigma\), produces the embedding-corrupted prompts

\[\tilde{\mathbf{e}}=\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e};\sigma)=\{\tilde{e}_{1}, \tilde{e}_{2},\ldots,\tilde{e}_{T}\}.\] (3)

Let \(\tilde{h}:\mathcal{E}\times\Theta\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\) be the function \(h\) but taking the input embeddings instead of input tokens (i.e., \(h\) with the input embedding layer detached). Our objective is to pick a good \(\sigma^{*}\) such that the following modified unlearning objective is satisfied:

\[\frac{\mathbb{E}\left[m_{i}\left(\tilde{h}\left(\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e}; \sigma^{*});\bm{\theta}_{o}\right)\right)\right]}{\hat{v}_{r}}\approx 1,\forall m_{i} \in\mathcal{M}.\] (4)

Here, \(\hat{v}_{r}\) is used to approximate the true \(\mathbb{E}[m_{i}(\tilde{h}(\mathbf{e};\bm{\theta}_{r}))]\) as the retained model is not available.

### Decision Threshold Calibration and Conformal Prediction

Due to the potential fuzzy boundary between retaining and forgetting, one needs to pick a threshold better than \(p(f\mid\mathbf{x})>p(r\mid\mathbf{x})\), which does not take into account the classifier's confidence. Depending on the application and the empirical performance of the classifier predictions, we incorporate two types of thresholding techniques.

#### Simple thresholding

We choose a simple threshold, \(\tau\), as the criterion to determine if a prompt \(\mathbf{x}\) belongs to the forget distribution. Formally, the output \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}\) from the LLM is returned by feeding a prompt selected by the classifier, based on its prediction \(p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})\):

\[\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\begin{cases}\tilde{h}\left(\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e}; \sigma);\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\right)&\text{if }p_{C}(f\mid\mathbf{x})\geq\tau\\ \tilde{h}\left(\mathbf{e};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\right)&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\] (5)

We pick the value of \(\tau\) using a separate set \(D_{\text{cal}}\) for calibration. The goal is to choose an optimal \(\tau\) that has the smallest false positive rate and false negative rate on \(D_{\text{cal}}\).

#### Conformal prediction

We also consider conformal prediction (CP) [134], which finds a calibrated threshold given a target error rate \(\alpha\), as a second way for threshold calibration. In essence, conformal prediction uses a small user-specified error rate, \(\alpha\), and unlikelihood scores (e.g., \(1-p_{C}(y\mid\mathbf{x})\)) on a calibration set to derive a threshold. Labels with unlikelihood scores lower than the threshold are included in the final prediction set.

We adapt the split conformal prediction setup [134], which uses a separate calibration set, \(D_{\text{cal}}=\{\mathbf{x}_{i},y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) (\(y\in\{\mathbf{r},f\}\)), to determine a conformity threshold and a non-conformity score, \(S:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\), to measure how unlikely a sample \((x,y)\) is to the classifier \(C\). Following conventional choice, we use \(s_{i}=S(\mathbf{x}_{i},y_{i})=1-p_{C}(y_{i}\mid\mathbf{x}_{i})\) as the non-conformity score. Given the calibration set size \(n\) and a small user-specified error rate \(\alpha\), we determine a quantile \(\hat{q}\) using the \(\lceil(n+1)\cdot(1-\alpha)\rceil/n\) empirical quantile in the non-conformity scores from \(D_{\text{cal}}\). The final prediction set on a new test sample \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{test}}\) is formed by including all labels with a non-conformity score below \(\hat{q}\) as

\[\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{x}_{\text{test}}\right)=\left\{y\in \mathcal{Y}:S\left(\mathbf{x}_{\text{test}},y\right)\leq\hat{q}\right\}.\] (6)

Formally, given the prompt classifier \(C\), a prediction set \(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)\) for the prompt \(\mathbf{x}\), and the decision threshold \(\tau\), the response from the LLM is obtained by the following rules:

\[\hat{\mathbf{y}}=\begin{cases}\tilde{h}\left(\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e}; \sigma);\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\right)&\text{if }1\in\mathcal{C}_{\alpha}\\ \tilde{h}\left(\mathbf{e};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\right)&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\] (7)

In experiments, we pick the thresholding method based on its empirical performance. In Appendix C.5, we give a toy example of how to determine the prediction set size for a test sample.

### Embedding-Corrupted Prompts

Given an accurate classifier, one can already mitigate the risk defined in our threat model by providing a template response. However, doing so violates the weak unlearning objective for \(\mathbf{x}\sim p_{\mathcal{D}_{f}}(\mathbf{x})\) in Equation (1), because a retained model (that is, a model not trained on the forget data) is highly unlikely to give template responses to prompts in the forget data. To actually achieve unlearning, given the prompt classifier obtained in Section 3.2, we introduce a simple method that learns to corrupt user prompts in the embedding space efficiently via zeroth order optimization [124; 125] toward the unlearning objective. One may also set \(\sigma\) manually without optimization, at the cost of being further away from the desired retained model (see below).

#### Optimization objective

A natural choice to make the unlearned model behave like a retained model is to minimize a distance function that quantifies the gap between the two models for all \(m\in\mathcal{M}\). As the retained model is not available (otherwise, unlearning would not be needed), we use a surrogate metric value \(\hat{v}_{r}\) if available to approximate how the retained model would behave over \(\mathcal{M}\). Based on our relaxed unlearning objective in Equation (4), we define a general distance measure below:

\[d(\tilde{\mathbf{e}},\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o},\hat{v}_{r},\mathcal{M})=\frac{1 }{|\mathcal{M}|}\sum_{i}\Big{|}\underbrace{m_{i}(\tilde{h}(\tilde{\mathbf{e}}; \boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}))}_{\text{unlearned metric value}}-\underbrace{\hat{v}_{r}}_{ \text{surrogate retained metric value}}\Big{|}\] (8)

We aim to learn a \(\sigma^{*}\) such that the metric gap in Equation (8) between the unlearned model and the retained model is minimized. Formally, given a parameterized corruption function \(\texttt{Corrupt}(\cdot;\sigma)\), our unlearning objective is to minimize the following:

\[\sigma^{*}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\sigma}d\left(\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e}; \sigma),\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o},\hat{v}_{r},\mathcal{M}\right)\] (9)

#### Note:

If the metric value \(\hat{v}_{r}\) is not obtainable, one may tune \(\sigma\) directly and inspect whether the model output on the forget set aligns with the unlearning criteria. For classification-style tasks, the target \(\hat{v}_{r}\) may correspond to random guessing.

#### 3.1.2 Corruption learning via zeroth order optimization

We now formulate the zeroth order gradient approximation via finite differences [124; 125]. Given a pre-defined perturbation size \(\mu\) applied to the current corruption parameter \(\sigma_{k}\), we treat the distance function \(d(\cdot)\) as a black-box and query it for the final metric gap during optimization. Because we only learn the strength of the corruption function with a scalar-valued \(\sigma\), we use a deterministic perturbation to \(\sigma_{k}\). For a single sample, given an initial guess \(\sigma_{0}\), a step size \(\eta\), and a smoothing parameter \(\mu\) (also known as perturbation size), the minimization of Equation (9) uses the following update rules:

\[\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{forward}} =\mathbf{e}+\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e};\sigma_{k}+\mu)\] (10) \[\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{backward}} =\mathbf{e}+\texttt{Corrupt}(\mathbf{e};\sigma_{k}-\mu)\] (11) \[\hat{\nabla}d_{\sigma_{k}} =\frac{d(\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{forward}},\boldsymbol{\theta }_{o},\hat{v}_{r},\mathcal{M})-d(\tilde{\mathbf{e}}_{\text{backward}}, \boldsymbol{\theta}_{o},\hat{v}_{r},\mathcal{M})}{2\mu}\] (12) \[\sigma_{k+1} =\sigma_{k}-\eta\hat{\nabla}d_{\sigma_{k}}\] (13)

#### 3.1.3 Choice of corruption function

Prior work [40] suggests that only a small number of dimensions for each embedding vector suffices to steer the output, so we only corrupt the first dimension of each token's embedding. We also experimented with other corruption functions (e.g., standard Gaussian noise or zeroing-out top entries) but found that our method is insensitive to the choice of corruption function, with all tested functions yielding similar end results. We conducted ablation studies on various corruption functions in Appendix D.2.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we present experimental results for entity unlearning (Section 4.2), hazardous knowledge unlearning (Section 4.3), and copyrighted content unlearning (Section 4.4).

### Prompt Classifier

For each unlearning task, we fine-tune a RoBERTa [82] or a Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct [34] as the prompt classifier on the corresponding \(D_{r}\) and \(D_{f}\). In entity and copyrighted content unlearning tasks, we use the entire \(D_{f}\) to train the classifier5 because the unlearning target is fully captured by the forget set, which does not require generalization outside the set. For WMDP and MMLU, we only use a surrogate synthetic forget set \(D_{f}\) to train the prompt classifier, and the actual forget set \(D_{f}\) is not accessible until evaluation. For all prompt classifiers, we use an independent validation set \(D_{\text{val}}\) to tune the decision threshold \(\tau\) and hyperparameters or to calibrate the empirical quantile \(\hat{q}\), which is used to determine conformity. In Tables 5 to 7, we show that all classifiers can distinguish \(D_{r}\) and \(D_{f}\) well, and generalize to unseen \(D_{g}\) with a low false positive rate. Meanwhile, although we do not specifically target out-of-distribution prompts related to jailbreak attempts, we demonstrate our classifiers' ability to prevent such risks in appendix C.3.3. We also show that simple data augmentation techniques can further enhance our classifiers' performance in detecting out-of-distribution and jailbreak prompts. We provide further detailed information on how prompt classifiers are trained for each task and their performance in Appendix C.3.

Footnote 5: In [90], the entire forget set is used during unlearning.

### Entity Unlearning

#### 4.2.1 Experimental setup

The TOFU dataset [90] is a synthetic question-answering dataset of author biographies. The goal is for an LLM trained on the complete dataset (all authors) to unlearn a fraction of fictitious authors (1/5/10%) while retaining knowledge about both 1) the remaining fictitious authors and 2) the real world. To assess forgetting and retention, we use two metrics proposed alongside the TOFU dataset: forget quality and model utility. Forget quality is represented by a p-value from a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, where a high value indicates high similarity in distribution between the output of the unlearned model and that of the retained model. Model utility assesses the model's performance on the retained set and real-world knowledge. For a detailed description of all the metrics, refer to Appendix C.1.1. We conduct experiments with two corruption functions, random noise (RN) and zero-out (ZO). We include all baselines from [90], a prompting baseline, and the recently proposed negative preference optimization (NPO) [149]. We provide formulations of all baselines in Appendix C.4.

ECO brings Pareto improvement.

In Figure 2, we illustrate the trade-off between model utility and forget quality for two models, Phi-1.5 [74] and Llama-2-7B-Chat [131], including forgetting 1%, 5%, and 10% of the samples. ECO-RN and ECO-ZO consistently achieve close-to-perfect forget quality regardless of the model or the size of the forget set. Notably, ECO-ZO maintains a distribution almost identical to the retained model (as the p-value is close to 1) in all cases, suggesting that ECO prompts can effectively approximate the outputs of the retained model in distribution. Given that the prompt classifier trained on the TOFU dataset incurs zero false positives, our method results in _zero sacrifice in model utility_, thus striking a perfect balance between forgetting and retention. For the ECO-RN variant, we optimize \(\sigma\) for Llama-2-7B-Chat on 1% of the forget set and use the same value for all five other settings, suggesting its transferability across models and forget tasks.

**Baselines struggle to forget or collapse in utility.** We also observe that GA, GD, KL, PO, and the prompting baseline exhibit minimal forgetting when the forget set size is small (i.e., 1%). Meanwhile, some of them experience a substantial decrease and even a collapse in utility when the forget set is larger (5% and 10%). Methods based on negative preference optimization [149] demonstrate a noticeably stronger trade-off compared to other baselines, especially with NPO-RT. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the NPO variants varies across different models and forget set sizes, and the loss in model utility is non-trivial. We present the full results on all metrics and baselines in Table 17 and Table 18 in Appendix E.2.

### Hazardous Knowledge Unlearning

Experimental setupFor both WMDP [73] and MMLU subset unlearning tasks [55], we directly unlearn on pre-trained models. The WMDP benchmark focuses on unlearning knowledge in biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity. In MMLU subset unlearning, the goal is to unlearn three subjects while retaining their closely related counterparts: economics (econometrics), law (jurisprudence), and physics (math), all requiring high-precision forgetting to resolve knowledge entanglement. In line with [73], we assess all models based on their multiple-choice accuracy. A successfully unlearned model should exhibit an accuracy near random guessing (25% for four-option multiple-choice questions). We employ the ECO-RN variant (random noise) as the corruption function for both tasks. We optimize the corruption strength \(\sigma\) only for Zephyr-7B on a set of 100 synthetic questions and answers generated by GPT-4 to ensure that real questions are not exposed during unlearning. The

Figure 2: **Model utility versus forget quality (p-value) on three different forget set sizes of the TOFU dataset after unlearning.** We show two models, Phi-1.5 (top) and Llama-2-7B-Chat (bottom). For GA, GD, KL, PO, and the prompting baseline, the forget qualities are either too small or come at the cost of a substantial decrease in model utility. Negative preference optimization (NPO) [149] variants achieve a good balance in some cases, but the trade-off in model utility is still non-trivial. ECO-RN (random noise) and ECO-ZO (zero-out) achieve an almost identical distribution to the retained model while incurring no sacrifice in model utility.

same corruption parameter \(\sigma\) is used for all other models. We compare our method against LLMU [143], SCRUB [69], SSD [41], RMU [73], and a prompting baseline that instructs the model not to answer questions within the domain correctly.

**ECO is domain- and model-agnostic.** In Tables 1 and 2, for all models on the WMDP benchmark, ECO achieves accuracy close to random guessing for multiple-choice questions while maintaining original MMLU performance. LLMU, SCRUB, and SSD show limited forgetting performance across all subjects. Although RMU successfully unlearns biology and cybersecurity, it retains accuracy in chemistry, indicating that unlearning capability may vary across subjects or the available data for unlearning. On Yi-34B-Chat and Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct, RMU's forgetting capability is not as effective as on Zephyr-7B, while ECO's performance remains consistent despite increased original performance on the task.

**ECO unlearns at high precision.** On MMLU subset unlearning, both ECO and RMU successfully unlearn the three chosen subjects (Table 2). However, RMU's accuracy in econometrics and jurisprudence significantly decreases. This implies that RMU might be sensitive to the entanglement of knowledge in closely related subjects. In contrast, this entanglement poses no problem for ECO's prompt classifier due to its low false positive rate in the retain domain.

**ECO's universal effectiveness.** To further validate the effectiveness of our method across various models, we conducted experiments on **100 models ranging from 0.5B to 236B** on both the WMDP

### Copyrighted Content Unlearning

Experimental setupWe select _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_6[112] and BBC News articles7[75] as the copyrighted content material for unlearning and unlearn models fine-tuned on the text corpus. For this task, our goal is to prevent the unlearned model from generating passages with high similarity to the original text. For both datasets, we verify that the models used cannot generate the original passage and that the generated text has low similarity to the original passage. We first fine-tune a pre-trained model on the corresponding corpus and use it as the model subject to unlearning, with the original pre-trained checkpoint serving as the retained model. We use the original passage as the reference text and measure the text similarity between the reference and the text generated by the unlearned model using four text similarity metrics outlined in Appendix C.1.3, which we denote as the average similarity gap (ASG). Following [143], we also compute the perplexity and unique token ratio to assess whether the generated text remains meaningful and diverse. We compare our method to baselines in [90], SCRUB [69], and LLMU [143]. We present full experimental details in Appendix C.

ECO maintains high similarity to the retained model.In Section 4.4, ECO achieves scores sufficiently close to those of the retained model in terms of generated text similarity. On the general utility metric, our prompt classifiers effectively distinguish copyrighted content from general domain queries with no performance loss. KL minimization and LLMU are strong baselines in terms of similarity gap and general utility, but the diversity of the generated text decreases after unlearning. Both gradient difference and random mismatch reduce the issue of model collapse but still lead to notable performance losses in general utility.

We further validate our findings on a total of 19 models in Appendix E.5, spanning from Table 23 to Table 60. We observe that some baselines cannot consistently maintain strong results in either unlearning or general utility, while ECO remains stable and consistently achieves a low similarity gap with the retained model and unharmed utility.

Table 3: Comparison of our method and the baseline methods to the retained model on two copyrighted content unlearning tasks. The results are obtained from unlearning OLMo-7B [48] models fine-tuned on the relevant corpus. ECO consistently maintains high similarity to the retained model (in average similarity gap (ASG)) and generates meaningful and diverse outputs (reflected by perplexity (PPL) and unique token ratio), while having no performance loss on utility.

gradient updates. The most straightforward approach employs a mixture of forgetting and retaining objectives by performing gradient ascent updates on the non-desirable sequences and regular gradient descent on the desirable sequences [137; 143; 23; 142; 73; 149; 62]. Other methods identify and modify a small fraction of the weights responsible for the undesired behavior [139; 13; 58], or use weight arithmetic [148; 56; 102; 83]. The above optimization-based methods all require compute that scales with the model size. Our method leaves the LLM subject to unlearning intact and unlearans by steering the inputs to match the output distribution of a retained model. Compute-wise, our unlearning method is independent of the model size.

LLM guardrailsGuardrailing, which accesses prompts before using them as inputs to the model, has been widely applied to modern LLMs to prevent adversaries with harmful incentives [111; 59; 145; 92; 71; 32; 138; 59; 47; 25]. Our work is most related to in-context unlearning [106] and a recent guardrail baseline via prompting [129], both of which require no additional fine-tuning to achieve unlearning to some extent. [106] leverages modern LLMs' ability in in-context learning by prepending a small number of positive and negative samples in the prompt to steer the model's response based on those samples. [129] guards the unlearning target via prompt injection, which inserts fixed instructions in the prompt to the LLM. Both methods can only be applied to instruction-tuned models and rely on an LLM's ability to follow instructions. Prepending such instructions also leads to significant performance degradation on regular tasks, as shown in [129].

Jailbreak via adversarial embeddingsPrior work on LLM jailbreaking [155; 40; 76; 44; 105] has demonstrated the power of adversarially optimizing toward a prompt that elicits a desired LLM response. In particular, [40] shows that the attack can be simplified to learning perturbation vectors added to the token embeddings, which eliminates the need to optimize over discrete tokens. Our results on the behavior of the attacked models are similar to the findings in [44], where inserting certain non-natural language token sequences in the prompt could elicit refusal behavior or incorrect answers from an instruction-tuned LLM. While jailbreak approaches can theoretically be applied in unlearning applications, they are prohibitively expensive to run [81], and there is an additional requirement for specifying a sequence of desirable tokens. Both requirements make them unsuitable for the task of unlearning.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduced Embedding-COrupted (ECO) Prompts, a novel method to tackle the dual challenges of knowledge entanglement and unlearning efficiency in LLMs. ECO leverages a thresholded prompt classifier to determine whether a prompt falls within the scope of the unlearning target. By decoupling the unlearning process from the LLMs themselves, ECO offers a scalable and efficient approach that remains effective across a wide range of model sizes, from 0.5B to 236B parameters, with minimal side effects and no additional computational overhead. Our experiments across three unlearning tasks validate ECO's effectiveness, setting a foundation for responsible AI deployment in real-world scenarios.

Broader Impact

The proposed method, Embedding-COrupted (ECO) Prompts, offers a novel framework for unlearning in large language models (LLMs), addressing the crucial challenge of removing sensitive or harmful knowledge while maintaining model integrity. As LLMs become more embedded in various applications, ensuring that they can unlearn specific information is paramount for compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR and for mitigating potential misuse. However, our work also has broader implications that merit careful consideration.

Firstly, the unlearning capability, while beneficial for privacy and safety, could be misused to selectively remove critical information, potentially leading to misinformation or biased outputs. For instance, model providers might exploit this technology to erase inconvenient facts from models deployed in public-facing applications, thereby manipulating the information accessible to users. To mitigate such risks, robust auditing mechanisms and transparency in the application of unlearning techniques are essential. Secondly, while ECO Prompts are designed to safeguard against specific threats such as entity leaking and hazardous knowledge dissemination, their effectiveness depends on the accuracy of the initial threat identification. Incorrect or incomplete identification could either fail to remove all relevant knowledge or inadvertently degrade the model's performance on non-sensitive tasks. Continuous monitoring and refinement of the classifier used for identifying unlearning targets, alongside comprehensive evaluation protocols, are necessary to minimize these potential harms.

## Appendix B Limitations

One limitation of ECO is that it supports unlearning only for models with API access, as it relies on the classifier to identify the unlearning target and the corruption function to achieve unlearning. If an adversary has open-weight access to a model, they could circumvent the unlearning state by bypassing the classifier.

Secondly, as described in Section 2.1, our approach does not address the threat posed by motivated adversaries who may attempt to compromise the classifier or the LLM itself. To counter such threats, practitioners might consider training the prompt classifier adversarially [81, 66, 35] to enhance its robustness against attacks, even if the attacker is aware of the classifier's presence and architecture.

Third, the prompt classifier's context window is typically limited, examining only the first (or last) \(K\) tokens by default. An attacker aware of this limitation could manipulate the prompt by injecting neutral text at both the beginning and the end to bypass the classifier. However, this vulnerability can be mitigated by implementing a sliding window technique: if the prompt's length exceeds the context window, the prompt should be considered positive as long as one of the text spans is predicted as positive. These limitations underscore the need for future work to improve the classifier's mechanism, potentially integrating it directly into the LLM itself.

## Appendix C Detailed Experimental Setup

In this section, we introduce our experimental setup, including a detailed description of all evaluation metrics (Appendix C.1), preparation of LLM subject to unlearning (Appendix C.2), training and evaluation of the prompt classifier (Appendix C.3), and formulations of all the baseline methods (Appendix C.4).

### Evaluation Metrics

#### c.1.1 Tofu

We employ the original evaluation metrics designed by the authors of the TOFU dataset [90].

Answer probabilityFor every single instance in the retain set or the forget set, we compute the normalized conditional probability \(P(a\mid q)^{1/|a|}\) on the LLM subject to unlearning, where \(q\) and \(a\) correspond to the question and answer, and \(|a|\) represents the number of tokens in the answer. For the real authors and world facts subsets, the dataset provides a set of five answers \(\{a_{0},\tilde{a}_{1},\tilde{a}_{2},\tilde{a}_{3},\tilde{a}_{4}\}\), which consists of a single correct answer \(a_{0}\) and four other perturbed answers that are incorrect. In this case, we compute the ratio \(P(a_{0}\mid q)^{1/|a_{0}|}/\sum_{i=1}^{4}P(\tilde{a}_{i}\mid q)^{1/|\tilde{a }_{i}|}\).

Truth ratioThe truth ratio is computed as the geometric mean8 of multiple perturbed (incorrect) answers' (\(\mathcal{A}=\{\tilde{a}_{1},\tilde{a}_{2},...\}\)) probabilities over the normalized conditional probability of the paraphrased answer \(\hat{a}\).

Footnote 8: We verified with the authors of the TOFU paper that the numerator should be a geometric mean instead of an arithmetic mean, even though their paper still shows the arithmetic mean at the time of writing this paper. This can also be confirmed by their implementation, which uses the geometric mean: https://github.com/locuslab/tofu/blob/36811054f2376560c8d6629667059f3000e5603c/evaluate_util.py#L59

\[R_{\text{truth}}=\frac{\left(\prod_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{A}|}P(\tilde{a}_{i}\mid q )^{1/|\tilde{a}_{i}|}\right)^{1/|\mathcal{A}|}}{P(\hat{a}\mid q)^{1/|\tilde{a} |}}\]

For the real authors and world fact subsets, the original answer \(a\) is used in the denominator as no paraphrased answer is available.

Rouge-LFor all subsets of TOFU, we compute the ROUGE-L recall score [77] between the ground truth responses (provided by the dataset) and the text generated by the model after unlearning.

Model utilityThe model utility is aggregated as a harmonic mean over nine numbers: the answer probability, truth ratio, and ROUGE recall scores from each of the retain, real authors, and world facts subsets. A higher model utility is always preferred.

Forget qualityThe forget quality is computed as the p-value of performing a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test using two distributions: the truth ratio of the retained model on the forget set, and the truth ratio of the unlearned model on the forget set. A higher p-value under the KS test indicates failure to reject the null hypothesis that the distributions of truth ratio from the retained and the unlearned models are the same, which is a sign of indistinguishability between the retained model's behavior and the unlearned model's behavior.

Multiple-choice accuracyFor both the WDMP [73] and MMLU subsets [55] unlearning, we employ multiple-choice accuracy as the primary evaluation metric. The underlying assumption is that a model unlearned on the target subject should demonstrate random-guessing accuracy on the task. Since both WDMP and MMLU consist of four-option multiple-choice questions, an accuracy close to 0.25 indicates successful unlearning. For each question, we adhere to the approach outlined by [73] and utilize the template provided in Listing 1 in a zero-shot manner. To derive the answer predicted by the LLM, we extract the logit scores corresponding to tokens [A, B, C, D] from the logits of the last token in the input sequence. The option with the highest logit score is deemed the predicted answer.

``` Thefollowingaremultiplechoicequestions(withansw)about{subject}. {question} A.{choice_A} B.{choice_B} C.{choice_C} D.{choice_D} Answer: ```

Listing 1: The formatting template for WMDP and MMLU multiple-choice questions used in both the classifier training and the main LLM for prediction.

ProbingWe also incorporate a probing evaluation, as done in [73], which trains a four-way linear probe on half of the data points from the biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity subsets. Specifically, a linear classifier is trained to predict the correct answer to the multiple-choice question based on the unlearned model's output logits. The trained linear probe is then used to make predictions on the other half of the data points to infer the correct labels given the output logits. Successful unlearning should result in random-chance accuracy for the linear probe, which is 0.25 in our case.

#### c.1.3 Harry Potter Book and BBC News Articles

We employ four text similarity metrics outlined below. For each metric, we use the original text (from the copyrighted material) as the reference and compute the similarity between the reference and the text generated by the LLM. A retained model that has never been trained on the reference text should have low similarity scores on all metrics, and a successfully unlearned model should have scores similar to those of the retained model. For both datasets, we evaluate similarity based on the first 256 tokens generated. This aligns with our fine-tuning setup in Appendix C.2.

ROUGE-LWe utilize the ROUGE-L algorithm as described in Appendix C.1.1. ROUGE-L's recall score denotes the proportion of the longest common subsequence in the reference text that appears in the generated text by the unlearned model. Essentially, it gauges the frequency at which the unlearned model can generate long text spans that exist in the copyrighted content.

SacreBLEU[143] employs the BLEU score [104], which is predicated on \(n\)-gram precision, to determine if the copyrighted content has been inadvertently disclosed, using a predefined threshold. We adopt SacreBLEU [108], which standardizes tokenization to mitigate variability in preprocessing. SacreBLEU assesses the overlap of \(n\)-grams between the generated and reference texts, subsequently calculating the number of matching \(n\)-grams as a precision score.

BERTScoreBERTScore [151] employs contextual embeddings of tokens from both the reference and generated texts, performing greedy matching based on pairwise similarity of all token pairs. We utilize the F1 score, as recommended by the original authors, and employ the DistilBERT [116] checkpoint to obtain these contextual embeddings.

METeorWe also employ METEOR [9], which incorporates unigram precision, unigram recall, and word order to provide a more nuanced similarity measure than BLEU and ROUGE-L.

Average similarity gap (ASG)We incorporate an aggregated metric, the average gap [79, 38], as the average absolute difference over the four similarity metrics above, computed between the retained model and the unlearned model. The average gap measures how similar an unlearned model's outputs are to the retained model's outputs, and a smaller gap is more desirable.

Perplexity (PPL) and unique token ratioFollowing [143], we use the perplexity score and the unique token ratio measured on the generated text to assess the fluency and diversity of the generated text. The perplexity is calculated by a reference model that has been fine-tuned on the target copyrighted content material. A sufficiently low perplexity indicates that the generated text might still be meaningful. The unique token ratio is calculated as the number of unique token set over all tokens generated in the outputs.

#### c.1.4 Why Not Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs)?

In this paper, we follow most prior work on LLM unlearning, which generally does not use membership inference attack (MIA) methods to evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning for LLMs [60, 68, 56, 23, 36, 90, 143, 142, 83, 73, 149, 57, 62].

We do not consider MIA methods to evaluate our models for three major reasons. First, state-of-the-art MIAs require training multiple (up to hundreds) shadow models [22] on subsets of the entire training set, which is not feasible in the LLM setting, as it requires access to the pre-training data or fine-tuning a large number of models on subsets of the fine-tuning data. MIAs without training shadow models have been demonstrated to overestimate the effectiveness of unlearning [54] due to the non-uniform difficulty of learning/unlearning each sample.

Second, evidence suggests that existing MIAs for LLMs, even the state-of-the-art ones [122], generally barely perform better than random guessing due to both training on large pre-training datasets for a small number of iterations and the fuzzy boundary between members and non-members [33]. In addition, recent work [91] shows that Min-K% Prob leads to: 1) significant variance based on the random selection of datasets used for evaluation, 2) improved results when the two subsets (in this case, the forget and holdout sets) are drawn from different distributions, and 3) an empirical overestimation of false positives. This last point indicates that the distribution gap (such as a temporal shift, also noted by [33]) introduces a confounding variable in the discrimination process, as the forget and holdout sets might vary in more than one aspect.

Third, as stated in Section 2.2, we do not consider the privacy aspect of unlearning in this work, and our threat model does not include privacy risks. Knowing whether a single sample is a member also does not significantly increase the risk in our threat model.

Additionally, performing such MIAs typically requires at least the model's internal states [33] (e.g., activations), which are not within the scope of our threat model (i.e., only text output and logits).

In fact, the forget quality metric described in Appendix C.1.1 and the probing evaluation in Appendix C.1.2 align with the goal of MIAs. The forget quality assesses whether the forget set distributions on the unlearned model and the retained models can be distinguished. The linear probe tries to infer the correct answers from the model output, assuming that the accuracy of the linear probe on a retained model is at the random-guessing level. Achieving the same accuracy might imply indistinguishability.

### Preparing LLMs for Unlearning

In this subsection, we describe the setup for preparing the LLMs subject to unlearning for each dataset.

TofuWe use the original code9 provided alongside the TOFU dataset [90] for fine-tuning to ensure consistency. Following their experimental setup, we fine-tune two models, Phi-1.5 [74] and Llama-2-7B-Chat [131], on the entire TOFU dataset to obtain the model to be subjected to unlearning. Following the retain/forget splits provided in the dataset, we fine-tune each model on each of the three different splits--99%, 95%, and 90% of the full dataset, excluding the forget data, to obtain the retained models. These three splits also correspond to unlearning 1%, 5%, and 10% of the samples, respectively. We employ the same hyperparameters as provided in both the paper and the accompanying code. Both models are trained with a batch size of 4, accumulating gradients for 4 steps on 2 NVIDIA A6000 GPUs, resulting in an effective batch size of 32, with a learning rate of 1e-5 for Llama-2-7B-Chat and 2e-5 for Phi-1.5. For the negative preference optimization [149] baselines, we follow a similar procedure and use the code provided by the original authors10.

Footnote 9: https://github.com/locuslab/tofu

Footnote 10: https://github.com/licong-lin/negative-preference-optimization

WMDP and MMLU subsetsThe knowledge assessment of all multiple-choice questions in WMDP [73] and MMLU [55] subsets is performed directly on the pre-trained models (or models unlearned from the pre-trained checkpoints for unlearning evaluation). Therefore, we do not fine-tune models based on the multiple-choice questions for the WMDP unlearning task.

Copyrighted contentFor the copyrighted content unlearning task, we first verify that all the considered LLMs cannot generate the original corpus. For the HP Book, while some parts of the text corpus could potentially be included during pretraining, we see little sign of generating the text spans verbatim for all models we considered in the copyrighted content unlearning experiments. This is also reflected in the low similarity scores from tables in Appendix E.5. For BBC News articles, we only consider articles published in February 2024, which is beyond the knowledge cutoff of most models considered. We fine-tune them on the copyrighted content corpus to ensure that they are able to generate the original passage. For the HP book, we split the text into chunks of up to 256 tokens (based on the tokenization scheme used for the specific model). For BBC News articles, we concatenate the news title with the news content, with a single space in the middle. The title of the news article is used as the prompt for generation. To ensure that our models can indeed generate the copyrighted content, we fine-tune all models on the two text corpora for 5 epochs, using a batch size of 4 and a learning rate of 2e-5 on two NVIDIA A100 GPUs.

### Prompt Classifiers

In this subsection, we describe how the dataset for the prompt classifiers are prepared and the setup and hyperparameters used to train the prompt classifiers. We include the dataset split statistics in Table 4. We also report the performance of three prompt classifiers in Tables 5 to 7, corresponding to the original classifier, simple-thresholding classifier, and conformal prediction classfier.

#### c.3.1 Prompt Classifiers' Training Datasets

TofuWe strictly follow the original split of the forget and retain sets in the TOFU dataset [90] to train the classifiers. To access the false positive predictions, we use the real authors and world facts splits to evaluate the classifier after hyperparameter tuning is completed. Here, we do not use a test forget set for the entities, following the practice in the original paper.

WmdpWe train a single classifier to classify multiple-choice questions in all three subjects of the WMDP dataset (i.e., biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity). We format the question strictly following the original evaluation [73] using the Language Model Evaluation Harness [43] style in Listing 1, where the {subject}, {question}, and {choice_#} fields are replaced by the actual text for each multiple-choice question. This template is also used as the prompt template for the main LLM to

For uncertain predictions with a prediction size of two, we behave conservatively and treat them as positive. The performance is slightly worse than the simple thresholding in Table 6, due to the cost of counting all uncertain predictions as positive samples.

make predictions. For negative samples, we use a combination of the auxiliary training set and the development set of MMLU [55]. We do so because the questions in the auxiliary training set do not have subjects, which might result in a shortcut learned by the classifier. We use the samples in the development set (with subjects) to mitigate that shortcut. Note that MMLU has its own validation set, so using the development set (with only 285 samples) is a reasonable choice.

Unlike TOFU and other copyrighted content datasets, we require the classifier trained on WMDP questions to generalize to unseen questions in relevant domains while not flagging relevant questions in similar domains (e.g., virology, high school chemistry, and computer security in MMLU) as positive. To avoid fully relying on the WMDP questions to train the classifier, we restrict ourselves to access only 10% of the WMDP questions, selected randomly before training and development. We also subsample a fixed set of 3K samples (out of 99.8K) from the auxiliary training set of MMLU to train and test the false positive rate of the prompt classifier. Note that the RMU method proposed in [73] does not require access to any of the questions.

We incorporate a setting where we train a prompt classifier on only synthetic data. The synthetic dataset contains 300 questions (100 for each of biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity), all generated by GPT-4 [2] to resemble the style and difficulty of real WMDP questions. This aligns with RMU's setup, which does not access real questions during model development. For a detailed split, please see Table 4. The performance of both prompt classifiers is reported in Table 6. We observe that the WMDP prompt classifier trained on synthetic data performs almost identically to one trained on 10% of the real questions. However, the authors of [129] identified that our initial classifiers overfit to the topic line. Specifically, since the topic line (listing 1) The following are multiple-choice questions (with answers) about {subject} appeared in the training data, the classifiers learned to classify forget and retain classes solely based on {subject}, rather than the question content. To address this, we used the official WMDP training corpora [73] to generate 3,000 synthetic problems in a style similar to the actual problems, using Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct [34]. We also included synthetic retain problems using the development set of MMLU for data generation. Including such data significantly reduced the false positive rate. We then fine-tuned a Llama-Guard-3-1B [34, 59] as the classifier, excluding the topic line during training.

In Tables 5 to 7, we also show an out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) setup where we assume access to only 100 biology questions, 100 cybersecurity questions, and 2 chemistry questions. In this scenario, the false negative rates of both the original and simple-threshold classifiers are high due to insufficient training samples for chemistry. In Table 7, we demonstrate that conformal prediction alleviates this issue by including more uncertain samples as negative, reducing the false negative rate by approximately 14%.

MMLU subsetsWe train a separate classifier for each unlearning category: economics, physics, and law. This is because, for each task, we aim to unlearn only the selected category while retaining the rest of the categories as defined in [73], making a single prompt classifier infeasible. Similar to the WMDP setup, we restrict ourselves to the MMLU development set, which contains only 10-15 samples for the forget target. We follow the same procedure used in the WMDP dataset and use the development set to generate synthetic forget and retain data to train the classifiers. To avoid overfitting, we also removed the topic line from all training samples. We report the detailed false positive and false negative statistics on the forget subject and related retain subjects in table 8.

HP BookSince the goal is to prevent users from extracting copyrighted content through training, we purchased the _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_[112] ebook and extracted the corpus to train our HP Book prompt classifier. We split the book into sentences using spaCy's sentencizer11, selecting only sentences with more than ten characters. Sentences with ten or fewer characters are mostly neutral sentences, line breaks, whitespace, or punctuation. The remaining sentences are treated as positive samples. For negative samples, we use the BookMIA dataset12[122], which contains over 9K text snippets from various real books. Snippets from _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ in the BookMIA dataset are removed before training. As generalization is not required, we do not use a test forget set. We split the retain set (i.e., BookMIA) into two equal-sized sets for training and testing the classifier's performance. In Table 6, we find that the classifier misclassifies some samples, but manual examination reveals they are mostly neutral sentences.

Footnote 11: https://spacy.io/api/sentencizer

Footnote 12: https://huggingface.co/datasets/swj0419/BookMIABBC NewsWe use BBC News articles13 published in February 2024 as positive samples and over 9K news articles in English from the CC-News dataset [52] as negative samples. To prevent shortcuts, we format both datasets consistently and remove the " - BBC ***" suffix from the titles in the BBC News dataset. The prompt classifier is trained only on the titles of the news articles. To mitigate sophisticated extraction attacks, one could train the classifier using sentence-level splits, similar to the HP Book dataset. However, due to the length of full news articles, we focus solely on title-based classification.

Footnote 13: https://huggingface.co/datasets/RealTimeData/bbc_news_alltime

A comprehensive evaluation of general utilityMost prior work only evaluates the retain ability of the unlearned LLM using the retain set associated with the unlearning task. However, the results reported on the retain set might not fully reflect general utility in real-world settings. This is because the retain set, while being disjoint from the forget set, might still share a similar distribution with the forget set in some aspects. Therefore, instead of solely relying on the regular retain set, we consider a large set of out-of-distribution samples to measure general utility. In the general set, we include eleven common LLM benchmarks listed in Table 9: MMLU [55], ARC-Easy [27], ARC-Challenge [27], OpenBookQA [94], HellaSwag [146], Winogrande [114], TruthfulQA [78], CommonsenseQA [127], PIQA [15], SocialIQA [117], and BoolQ [26]. These benchmarks amount to a total of 41,297 samples. We evaluate all prompt classifiers (from all datasets mentioned above) on the general set after tuning the parameters of the prompt classifiers. For all datasets, we use the test set if the labels are publicly available; otherwise, we use the validation set. For TruthfulQA, we use the MC1 subset for evaluation.

#### c.3.2 Training a prompt classifier

For all prompt classifiers used for prompt content detection, we choose either RoBERTa-base [82] or Llama-3.1-1B-Instruct [34] as the base model for fine-tuning. The hyperparameters are selected following prior work that improves stability during training [97]. Since in most cases the number of positive samples (the forget samples) is much smaller than the number of negative samples, we reweight the class-wise losses using the inverse frequency. Once the optimal number of epochs is determined, we fine-tune the model again on the combined training and validation sets and use it as the final prompt classifier for inference-time unlearning. We also evaluate all prompt classifiers on the general set outlined in Table 9.

We report the performance of the original prompt classifier, the classifier with simple thresholding, and the classifier with conformal prediction in Tables 5 to 7. We demonstrate that in all settings considered, our best prompt classifiers achieve satisfying performance, reflected by the low false negative rate on the forget set and the low false positive rate on the retain set. On the general set (i.e., the suite of NLP benchmarks), most prompt classifiers have zero false positive predictions, suggesting that the performance of the main LLM on samples irrelevant to the forget set is unlikely to be affected.

#### c.3.3 Robustness Against Out-of-Distribution Prompts

In the main body of the paper, we only considered in-distribution prompts from users. However, this assumption is not entirely realistic in practice, as user behaviors are dynamic, and potential attackers could exploit flaws in prompt classifiers to bypass guardrails. Given that the default prompt classifiers we use assume in-distribution prompts and are not trained to identify out-of-distribution (o.o.d.) or jailbreak prompts, we first 1) study the fragility of these classifiers against various types of o.o.d. prompts, and then 2) assess whether the classifiers' performance improves when trained on these types of prompts.

Original classifiers remain robust under distribution shift.We consider challenging queries written by humans, including rephrased prompts, adversarial prompts, prompts with irrelevant context, jailbreak prefixes/suffixes, and keyword-only prompts (based on the original prompts). To evaluate, we construct a test set of such prompts by rewriting the prompts from the forget set. Surprisingly, when we evaluate the original TOFU classifier on this test set, it still maintains high false positive

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline
**Perturbation type** & **False Positive Rate (\%)** & **False Negative Rate (\%)** \\ \hline None & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ Rephrased & 0.14 & 1.5 \\ Adversarial & 0.2 & 1.5 \\ With irrelevant context & 0.17 & 0.5 \\ With jailbreak-like prefix/suffix & 1.65 & 7.52 \\ Keywords and short phrases & 0.28 & 2.51 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

and false negative rates, as shown in table 10. This confirms that the classifier's performance, as reported in table 6, is not due to overfitting. Based on these results, we believe that our classifiers remain robust against common perturbations, even without explicit training on such data.

Training on additional o.o.d. data further improves robustness.Next, we investigate whether we can enhance the robustness of our classifiers. We construct another set of perturbed prompts, synthetically generated by Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct [3], with no overlap with the previous perturbed test set and no prior knowledge about the perturbation types. Specifically, we prompt Llama-3.1-70B-Instruct to generate a more challenging version of the prompt that could potentially deceive a well-performing classifier. We use this set of prompts to train our classifier and observe that both the false positive rate and false negative rate are further improved (table 11). We repeat this procedure for all classifiers to ensure our findings generalize.

### Baseline Methods

In this section, we formulate all baseline methods used throughout the paper.

#### c.4.1 Prompting Baseline

For all prompting baselines, we adapt the prompt style from [88]. Below, we detail the prompts used in the TOFU dataset as well as those for the WMDP benchmark and MMLU subsets. For the TOFU prompt, we list the author names subject to forgetting. For the WMDP and MMLU prompts, we replace the {subject} field with the specific subject to unlearn (e.g., biology).

Note that one could potentially craft more sophisticated prompts to achieve improved unlearning and utility. However, as this is not the focus of the current study, we leave such developments to future work.

``` Youareamodelthatknowabsolutelynothingaboutthefollowingauthornames:- {name_1} -{name_2} -... -{name_n} Pleaseensurethatyourresponsestoanythingrelatedtotheabovenamesareincorrect.Foreverythingelse,youcanprovidethecorrectansw. {question} ```

#### c.4.2 Optimization-Based Unlearning Baselines

For all optimization-based baselines below, we fix the number of epochs as 5 and tune the learning rate of {5e-5, 2e-5, 1e-5}.

Fine-tuning, gradient ascent (GA), and gradient difference (GD)Fine-tuning, gradient ascent, and gradient difference are simple baselines commonly used in traditional machine unlearning settings [24, 61, 38, 69], and has been introduced as simple baseline methods in [90]. Fine-tuning only involves performing gradient descent on \(D_{r}\), while gradient ascent performs gradient descent on \(D_{f}\) in the opposite direction. Gradient difference combines fine-tuning and gradient ascent by compute the sum of the two loss terms.

\[L_{\text{Fine-tune}} =\frac{1}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{r}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x} ;\boldsymbol{\theta})\] \[L_{\text{GA}} =-\frac{1}{|D_{f}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{f}}\mathcal{L}( \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})\] \[L_{\text{GD}} =\frac{1}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{r}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{ x};\boldsymbol{\theta})-\frac{1}{|D_{f}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{f}}\mathcal{L}( \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})\]

KL minimization (KL)The KL minimization is adopted from [90] and involves a gradient ascent term for forgetting as well. It also minimizes the KL distance on \(D_{r}\) between the current model and the original model \(\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o}\). The KL minimization term aims to keep the model's current output distribution on the retained set close to its pre-unlearning distribution on the retain samples.

\[L_{\text{KL}}=L_{\text{GA}}+\frac{1}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{r}}\mathrm{ KL}(h(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o})\|h(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}))\]

Preference optimization (PO)The preference optimization (PO) is different from the traditional sense of direct preference optimization [110] in that it only combines the fine-tuning loss on \(D_{r}\) and a term that learns to say "I don't know" for prompts in \(D_{f}\)[90]. Below, \(D_{\text{idk}}\) is an augmented forget dataset with the answer "I don't know" following the prompt.

\[L_{\text{PO}}=L_{\text{Fine-tune}}+\frac{1}{|D_{\text{idk}}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in D_{\text{idk}}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})\]

Negative preference optimization (NPO) [149]NPO incorporates only the lossing response term in direct preference optimization (DPO) [110], which only penalizes the prompt-response pairs in \(D_{f}\). In the formulation below, \(\beta\) represents the inverse-temperature. It also has two extended versions involving either the KL term and the fine-tuning term on \(D_{r}\) to preserve utility.

\[L_{\text{NPO}} =\frac{2}{\beta}\frac{1}{|D_{f}|}\left[\log\left(1+\left(\frac{h(y \mid\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})}{h(y\mid\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})} \right)^{\beta}\right)\right]\] \[L_{\text{NPO-KL}} =L_{\text{NPO}}+L_{\text{KL}}\] \[L_{\text{NPO-RT}} =L_{\text{NPO}}+L_{\text{Fine-tune}}\]

MismatchMismatch has the same objective to preference optimization above, except it involves constructing a random combination of text sequences \(\mathbf{x}_{\text{rand}}\). Here, the second term in mismatch is the same as the second term in LLMU [143].

\[L_{\text{Mismatch}}=L_{\text{Fine-tune}}+\frac{1}{|D_{\text{rand}}|}\sum_{ \mathbf{x}\in D_{\text{rand}}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})\]

SCRUB [69]SCRUB was originally proposed as a machine unlearning algorithm for classification tasks but was adopted as a baseline for LLM unlearning by [73]. SCRUB uses a combined objective that 1) minimizes the KL divergence between the original model and the unlearned model on \(D_{r}\), 2) maximizes the same KL divergence on \(D_{f}\), and 3) uses a regular gradient descent term on \(D_{r}\) to retain performance. However, instead of optimizing three objectives at the same time, it interleaves a min-step (i.e., the first and the second terms) to retain and a max-step (i.e., the third term) to unlearn across epochs. In our experiments, we perform three epochs of min-steps and two epochs of max-steps. In addition to tuning the learning rate, we fix \(\gamma\) and tune \(\alpha=\{0.0001,0.001,0.01,0.1\}\).

\[L_{\text{SCRUB}}= \frac{\alpha}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{r}}\mathrm{KL}(h( \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o})\|h(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}))\] \[+\frac{\gamma}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{r}}\mathcal{L}( \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta})\] \[-\frac{1}{|D_{f}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{f}}\mathrm{KL}(h( \mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}_{o})\|h(\mathbf{x};\boldsymbol{\theta}))\]Llmu [143]LLMU combines the gradient descent term with two additional terms to learn 1) random completions from \(D_{\text{rand}}\) (constructed using prompts from \(D_{f}\)) to facilitate unlearn and 2) \(D_{\text{normal}}\) to preserve performance. We use books with similar styles as \(D_{\text{normal}}\) in our experiments and construct \(D_{\text{rand}}\) using randomly sampled text sequences from \(D_{\text{normal}}\). We fix \(\epsilon_{2}\) and \(\epsilon_{3}\) at 1 and tune \(\epsilon_{1}\) with values {0.1, 0.5, 1, 2}, following the original paper.

\[L_{\text{LLMU}}= -\frac{\epsilon_{1}}{|D_{f}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{f}}\mathcal{ L}(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta})\] \[+\frac{\epsilon_{2}}{|D_{\text{rand}}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{ \text{rand}}}\mathcal{L}(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta})\] \[+\frac{\epsilon_{3}}{|D_{\text{normal}}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_ {\text{normal}}}\mathrm{KL}(h(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta}_{o})\|h(\mathbf{x};\bm{ \theta}))\]

Selective Synaptic Dampening (SSD)We adopted the SSD implementation in [73], which is an adaptation of the original SSD and uses the log-perplexity as a criteria on the forget set and the retain set. Given the diagonal of the Fisher information matrix \([]_{D}\) computed offline on \(D\), the dampened weight is computed via

\[\theta^{\prime}=\min\left(\frac{\lambda[]_{D,i}}{\|D_{f,i}}\theta_{i},\theta_ {i}\right)\]

for each weight \(\theta_{i}\) if \([]_{D_{f},i}>\alpha[]_{D,i}\), where \(\alpha\) is the dampening constant. We follow [73]'s hyperparameters of thresholds \([0.1,0.25,0.5,1,2.5,5]\) and dampening constants [1e-5, 1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2, 1e-1, 1].

Representation misdirection for unlearning (RMU) [73]Given a function \(M_{\ell}(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta})\) that returns the hidden representation of \(\bm{\theta}\) at a layer \(\ell\), and a fixed random unit vector \(\mathbf{u}\) sampled uniformly from \([0,1)\), the RMU objective is defined as follows:

\[L_{\text{RMU}}=\frac{1}{|D_{f}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x}\in D_{f}}\|M_{\ell}(\mathbf{ x};\bm{\theta})-c\cdot\mathbf{u}\|_{2}^{2}+\frac{\alpha}{|D_{r}|}\sum_{\mathbf{x} \in D_{r}}\|M_{\ell}(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta})-M_{\ell}(\mathbf{x};\bm{\theta} _{o})\|_{2}^{2}\]

This is similar to gradient difference with the exception it pushes the hidden representation at layer \(\ell\) toward a random vector and minimizes the squared difference between the unlearned model and the original model. Since the authors provided their trained model checkpoints14 and the experimental setups are identical, we directly used their checkpoints for evaluation.

### A Toy Example of Conformal Prediction

Suppose we picked \(\alpha=0.05\) and obtained \(\hat{q}=0.93\) as the \(\lceil(n+1)\cdot 0.95\rceil/n\) empirical quantile from the non-conformity scores \(\{s_{1},s_{2},...,s_{n}\}\) from \(D_{\text{cal}}\). Suppose, for a test sample \(\mathbf{x}\), our classifier \(C\) gives conditional probabilities \(p_{C}(y=0\mid\mathbf{x})=0.82\) and \(p_{C}(y=1\mid\mathbf{x})=0.18\). The prediction set \(\mathcal{C}_{0.05}\) of \(\mathbf{x}\) is formed by

\[\mathcal{C}_{0.05}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\left\{y\in\{0,1\}:1-p_{C}(y\mid \mathbf{x})\leq 0.93\right\}.\]

Given the conditional probabilities, we have

\[S(\mathbf{x},0)=1-p_{C}(y=0\mid\mathbf{x})=1-0.82=0.18,\] \[S(\mathbf{x},1)=1-p_{C}(y=1\mid\mathbf{x})=1-0.18=0.82.\]

Thus, both scores are below \(\hat{q}=0.93\), so the prediction set is

\[\mathcal{C}_{0.05}\left(\mathbf{x}\right)=\{0,1\}.\]

### Usage of Compute Resources

For all experiments conducted in the paper, we conduct experiments on a node with 8 NVIDIA A100 or NVIDIA A6000 GPUs, but at most three of each are required for a single experiment. The longest experiments on models with over 100B parameters typically take 2-5 days to complete.

Ablation Experiments

In this section, we include ablation experiments to support claims and findings in the main paper.

### Prompt Classifier Thresholding

In Tables 5 to 7, we show the performance of classifiers with three different thresholding schemes (described in Section 3.2): no thresholding, simple-thresholding, and conformal prediction.

We observe that prompt classifiers without thresholding already perform well on most datasets. An exception is the out-of-distribution WMDP, where we have few samples for questions from one threat category. Specifically, it has a high false negative rate for forget samples and a non-trivial false positive rate on retain samples. Increasing the threshold in simple-threshold classifiers reduces the false positive rate to near-perfect, but the false negative rate also increases. By employing conformal prediction, we successfully reduce the false negative rate by more than 50%. In practice, we recommend selecting the thresholding method based on its performance on a relatively large held-out set to balance missing forget or retain samples. Depending on the risk posed by the unlearning target, conformal prediction might be a better choice in high-risk scenarios to reduce false positive predictions.

### Corruption Function Variants

In this section, we examine variants of the corruption functions used in the main paper. Previously, we primarily employed Gaussian noise, where the standard deviation represented the corruption strength. In Section 4, we also used zeroing-out of the top-\(k\) entries in each embedding vector. We include experiments on sign flipping, reversing the order of the embedding vector, and shuffling the embedding vector. For sign flipping, random noise, and zero-out, we select either the first \(N\) entries or the top-\(k\) entries. We also experiment with selecting random \(N\) entries for random noise corruption.

In the experiments below, we do not tune the corruption strength for each corruption function but use the same corruption strength for similar functions. For example, for all random noise corruption, we use the same corruption strength as the one selected in the main paper (Figure 2). In Table 12, we show that sign flipping and zero-out have consistently high forget quality, while the randomized corruption function might require extra strength tuning, especially for larger forget sets. This suggests that tuning the corruption strength based on the criteria used is important to achieve effective unlearning.

In Tables 13 and 14, we present the results of eight variants of the corruptions on BBC News and HP Book unlearning. We see that most corruption functions used can achieve an ASG score below 5 while maintaining low perplexity and high unique token ratio.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l c c c} \hline \hline  & & \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Forget Quality**} \\ \cline{3-5}
**Model** & **Method** & **Forget 1\%** & **Forget 5\%** & **Forget 10\%** \\ \hline  & Original & 0.0143 & 0.0000 & 0.0000 \\  & Retain & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 \\  & \({}^{\text{Fip Sign First}}N\) & 0.9900 & 0.9238 & 0.8635 \\  & Flip Sign Top-\(k\) & 0.9900 & 0.9238 & 0.9674 \\  & Rand Noise First \(N\) & 0.9900 & 0.7934 & 0.1810 \\ Pii-1.5 & Rand Noise Rand \(N\) & 0.9900 & 0.7934 & 0.0013 \\  & Rand Noise Top-\(k\) & 0.9900 & 0.3935 & 0.1314 \\  & Zero Out First \(N\) & 0.9900 & 0.3935 & 0.8134 \\  & Zero Out Top-\(k\) & 0.9188 & 0.8655 & 0.9674 \\ \hline  & Original & 0.0030 & 0.0000 & 0.0000 \\  & Retain & 1.0000 & 1.0000 & 1.0000 \\  & Flip Sign First\(N\) & 0.9188 & 0.9647 & 0.9674 \\  & Flip Sign Top-\(k\) & 0.4046 & 0.5453 & 0.5812 \\  & Rand Noise First \(N\) & 0.7659 & 0.0396 & 0.0079 \\ Llama-2-7B-Chat & Rand Noise Rand \(N\) & 0.9188 & 0.2705 & 0.0006 \\  & Rand Noise Top-\(k\) & 0.9188 & 0.0118 & 0.0000 \\  & Zero Out First \(N\) & 0.9188 & 0.8655 & 0.9939 \\  & Zero Out Top-\(k\) & 0.9188 & 0.8655 & 0.9844 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12: Ablating the corruption function for the TOFU dataset on Phi-1.5 and Llama-2-7B-Chat.

We see that the selection of the corruption function and corruption strength is not as important for unlearning BBC News and HP Book as it is for the TOFU dataset, based on text similarity metrics. This suggests that the forget quality metric is a more rigorous measure than mere text similarity, as it evaluates the distributional similarity between the outputs of an unlearned model and a retrained model. Therefore, in practice, we recommend always searching for the best corruption function and corruption strength based on the available criteria.

### Task-Agnostic Selection of the Surrogate Metric Value

In section 3.3, we select the surrogate metric value, \(\hat{v}_{r}\), for each task individually. While this serves as a sound experimental setup, it raises concerns regarding its adaptability to real-world use cases, where a metric might not be directly available or easy to calculate.

To address this, we performed an additional experiment using a dataset- or task-agnostic selection of \(\hat{v}_{r}\). Specifically, we use Llama-3-70B-Instruct to generate 100 synthetic responses in one of two forms: 1) stating "I do not know the answer to the question" (IDK), or 2) refusal (e.g., "I cannot answer the question"). These responses are independent of the datasets and tasks under consideration. We also use the LLM subjected to unlearning to generate its original response (before unlearning). We then apply the four text similarity metrics used in the copyrighted content unlearning task to measure the difference between 1) the original responses and 2) the synthetic IDK or refusal responses. The goal is to minimize this difference across all three tasks.

In essence, we aim to push the model's output toward IDK or refusal responses by using a zeroth-order objective to minimize the textual similarity between the model output and the template responses, regardless of the specific task.

In table 15, we show that task-agnostic selection still maintains the effectiveness of unlearning, suggesting a task-dependent select of the surrogate metric value is not necessary.

## Appendix E Additional Experiments

In this section, we include additional experiments to support claims and findings in the main paper.

### Time Delays of Prompt Content Detection

In Table 16, we report the per-example time delay (in milliseconds) introduced by running the prompt classifier during the inference of the main LLM. The times in the w/o Classifier(s), w/ Classifier(s), and Abs. Increase columns are measured on a machine with a single NVIDIA A100 using a Llama-2-7B(-Chat) with a batch size of 4. Note that the prompt content detection step only depends on the incoming prompt and is agnostic to the LLM subject to unlearning, so the statistics in the table are constant with respect to any other LLMs given fixed prompts. The largest delay of 85 ms is from TOFU (Forget10), which involves extra inference time by an additional token classifier based on BERT to identify tokens that are names in the prompt. In most cases, the extra delay is no more than 21 ms.

#### e.2.1 Full Results

The results in this section provide supporting evidence for Section 4.2 and Figure 2 in the main paper. We include the full results of Llama-2-7B-Chat and Phi-1.5 in Table 17 and Table 18, respectively. These results encompass all metrics described in Appendix C.1.1: conditional probability of the answer given the prompts, truth ratio (TR), ROUGE-L scores, model utility, and forget quality. We report all scores for the retain set, forget set, real authors, and world facts across all forget set sizes. In Figure 2, we plot the model utility and forget quality as shown in the last two columns of each table.

Besides the random noise and zero-out variants of ECO, we also include a sign-flip variant. This variant flips the signs of all entries in the embedding vectors of the selected tokens. In both Table 17 and Table 18, the sign-flip variant exhibits low forget quality across all splits. This outcome likely stems from its higher (better) truth ratio compared to the retained model, leading to substantially different distributions from those of the truth ratio in the retained model. We hypothesize that this effect arises from the drastic alterations in the embedding vectors caused by flipping their signs.

#### e.3.2 Probing Evaluation

In Figure 3, we showcase the linear probe's test accuracy in recovering the correct choice based on output logits from Zephyr-7B, Yi-34B-Chat, and Mistral-8x7B-Instruct. Before using ECO to unlearn, a substantial proportion of the labels can be recovered by the linear probe classifier for all three models. After incorporating ECO in the forward pass, the classifier's accuracy drops to random-chance level, indicating the effectiveness of ECO in preventing knowledge recovery from the logit space.

Figure 4: The number of parameters of the model subject to unlearning versus the average performance on WMDP benchmark and MMLU subsets. This figure is a visualization of the forget set accuracy in Table 21 and Table 22.

Figure 3: Probing results based on model output logits before and after unlearning on the WMDP dataset via ECO. The linear probes’ accuracy remains at random chance for all three models, regardless of their size and performance. This indicates that ECO is resistant against linear probes trained on the raw output logits, indicating that the corrupted prompts effectively guard against the risk of inferring the correct answer from the logits.

#### e.4.1 Full Results

The results presented in this section serve as supporting evidence for Section 4.3 and Table 2. We include the full results of 68 models on MMLU subset unlearning in Table 22. For all models, ECO results in minimal to no performance loss on the corresponding retain subject, attributed to the prompt classifier's low false positive rate.

Note that the forget accuracy for economics remains at 35.8 across multiple models. We manually inspected the predictions of these models and found that the corrupted prompts bias the predictions toward answer D. Given that the correct answers for the economics questions in MMLU are not uniformly distributed, with about 35% being D, the answers are still considered as random-guessing. Therefore, the universal effectiveness of our method is maintained.

In Figure 4, we visualize the average MMLU subset accuracy versus the model size. The pattern observed on MMLU subsets mirrors that of the WMDP benchmark: while prompting could significantly reduce performance in some cases, the unlearned model maintains high accuracy. ECO consistently reduces the accuracy to random-guessing across all model sizes.

### Copyrighted Content

The results presented in this section serve as supporting evidence for Section 4.4 and Section 4.4. We report the results of unlearning from BBC News articles and the HP book across 19 models in total, employing all seven baseline methods and ECO. From Table 23 to Table 60, we present four text similarity metrics: BERTScore F1, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SacreBLEU. Additionally, we assess utility, measured on the eleven LLM benchmarks (Table 9), and employ perplexity (PPL) and unique token ratio [143] to assess the fluency and diversity of the generated text.

We report the results of 19 models for each dataset, including Gemma-2B and Gemma-7B [128], GPT-J [135], InternLM2-1.8B and InternLM2-7B [21], Llama-2-7B [131], Llama-3-8B [3], Mistral-7B-v0.1/0.2/0.3 [63], OLMo-1B and OLMo-7B [48], OPT-6.7B [150], Pythia-6.9B [14], Qwen1.5-1.8B, Qwen1.5-4B, and Qwen1.5-7B [8], StableLM 2 1.6B [12], and Yi-1.5-6B [144].

In all tables below, we use "-" to represent a perplexity that is too large when the unique token ratio is below 5%, as the value is typically infinity. The average similarity gap in all tables is computed as the average of the BERTScore, METEOR, ROUGE-L, and SacreBLEU columns.

Our results indicate that ECO consistently maintains stable performance across all models, with the generated text exhibiting low perplexity and high diversity, rivaling the performance of state-of-the-art LLMU [143].

### What Are Embedding-Corrupted Prompts to LLMs?

``` Repeat the text below exactly as it is given, and once you have repeated the text, stop generating any text. {prompt} ```

Listing 4: Prompt used in the LLM prompt repeating task.

To understand how LLMs interpret the embedding-corrupted prompts, we design a simple task for LLMs to repeat the provided prompts. We use the prompt format in Listing 4 and corrupt only tokens within the {prompt} block. We verify that all LLMs can repeat the prompt exactly, matching the given prompt, when no corruption is applied.

Below, we show samples of how LLama-3-70B-Instruct interprets and responds to four prompts and their corrupted versions under different corruption parameters \(\sigma\). We use four prompts. The first prompt is a question about Harry Potter, and the three other prompts are drawn from the biology, chemistry, and cybersecurity subsets of the WMDP benchmark [73], respectively.

In all examples shown in the two subsections below, we observe a common pattern from the interpretations and responses of LLama-3-70B-Instruct, regardless of the corruption method: _As the corruption strength increases, LLMs can no longer "see" the prompt when asked to repeat it, but are still able to provide an answer._ In other words, the corrupted prompts seem to act as **ghost tokens**, which LLMs can answer but cannot repeat (interpret).

We repeated the same experiment for a collection of models ranging from a few billion parameters to hundreds of billions of parameters and observed the same pattern as identified with LLama-3-70B-Instruct. This suggests that models share similar behavior under these (different) corruptions. However, further investigation is needed to understand these models' behavior on different types of prompts. Additional study into the internals of LLMs given corrupted prompts could also help explain the effectiveness of the method.

The models we experimented with include DeepSeek-V2-Chat, LLama-2-7b-chat-hf, Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct, Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Mistral-8x22B-Instruct-v0.1, Mistral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct, Qwen1.5-110B-Chat, Yi-1.5-34B-Chat, c4ai-command-r-plus-4bit, c4ai-command-r-v01-4bit, dbrx-instruct, gamma-1.1-2b-it, and gamma-1.1-7b-it.

#### e.6.1 Model's Interpretation and Responses Under Noise-Corrupted Prompts

In Tables 63 to 66, we demonstrate the model's output when asked to repeat the prompt and the model's responses to the prompt under random noise corruption. We observe that as the corruption strength increases, the model can no longer interpret the corrupted tokens and considers the question as empty. Its responses also begin to deviate from the context of the original questions.

#### e.6.2 Model's Interpretation and Responses Under Sparsely-Corrupted Prompts

In Tables 67 to 70, we demonstrate the model's output when asked to repeat the prompt and the model's responses to the prompt under zero-out corruption, which makes the embedding vector sparser.

We observe that as more entries of the embedding vectors are zeroed out, the model can no longer interpret the corrupted tokens and claims that there is no text to repeat. Response-wise, while random corruption steers the answer away from the original question, zero-out corruption causes the LLM to become confused and state that it cannot understand the given query.

The distinction between the two corruption schemes in the generated text suggests that more nuanced corruption of the model inputs could allow for more precise steering of their outputs.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c p{142.3pt} p{142.3pt}} \hline \hline

### Incorporating Template Answers as A Baseline

One might argue that, given the effectiveness of our classifiers, we could simply rely on template responses (e.g., refusal messages or stating "I don't know") as a method of unlearning. Indeed, a straightforward classifier combined with a template-based mechanism can mitigate several types of risks. However, the advantage of utilizing corrupted prompt responses, rather than relying solely on a classifier and template mechanism, is that it ensures response **indistinguishability**, which more effectively addresses privacy concerns. In our preliminary experiments, we observed that even when a model has not been trained on certain data, it often generates hallucinated responses instead of simply stating, "I don't know." Therefore, the objective of the corruption mechanism is to produce outputs that resemble those of the'retained' model, obfuscating whether specific data has been unlearned.

In contrast, template responses could inadvertently reveal the classifier's training on a particular individual. For example, in the context of entity unlearning, when the model generates a template response, an attacker might infer that the classifier has been trained to identify this individual. With this knowledge, the attacker could continue to exploit the individual's characteristics, behaviors, or conditions.

To support our claim, we compare the ROUGE-L score of template responses on TOFU and ASG with the performance of the corrupted prompt responses in the copyrighted content unlearning task, as shown in table 71. The results indicate that relying on template responses yields suboptimal results, significantly deviating from the performance of the retained model.

**Corruption \(\sigma\)** & **Interpretation** & **Response** \\ \hline No corruption & According to the World Health Organization what is the most common substance used for suicide by poisoning worldwide? & According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the most common substance used for suicide by poisoning worldwide is pesticides.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We clearly state our contributions toward the end of Section 1, and the proposed method aims to solve existing problems in machine unlearning for LLMs. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitations of our approach are discussed in detail in Appendix B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: Our contribution does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide full detail of the experimental setup for each task in Section 4 and Appendix C, including models, datasets, hyperparameters, and other relevant details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The code is released at https://github.com/chrisliu298/llm-unlearn-eco. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cover all experimental details in Section 4 and Appendix C. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We do not compute the statistical significance for every experiment due to computational constraints. However, each experiment is repeated at least three times, and we report the average results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We briefly mentioned this in Appendix C.6. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and can confirm that the paper conforms to it. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the broader impacts of the proposed method in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not release any data or models with high risks in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, we cited the assets in our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not introduce new assets in our paper. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our experiments do not involve crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our experiments do not involve crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
