###### Abstract

Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviours, such as generating untruthful or biased content. Editing their internal representations has been shown to be effective in mitigating such behaviours on top of the existing alignment methods. We propose a novel _inference-time_ editing method, namely spectral editing of activations (SEA), to project the input representations into directions with _maximal_ covariance with the positive demonstrations (e.g., truthful) while _minimising_ covariance with the negative demonstrations (e.g., hallucinated). We also extend our method to non-linear editing using feature functions. We run extensive experiments on benchmarks concerning truthfulness and bias with six open-source LLMs of different sizes and model families. The results demonstrate the superiority of SEA in effectiveness, generalisation to similar tasks, as well as computation and data efficiency. We also show that SEA editing only has a limited negative impact on other model capabilities.1

## 1 Introduction

While large language models (LLMs) have taken a central place in the development of full-fledged natural language processing (NLP) applications, there is a fundamental problem that prevents them from being fully trusted in real-world deployment: LLMs still generate inaccurate or biased information that does not align with human preferences [25; 20; 22; 45; 33; 21; 7; 10; 29].

Previous work suggests that LLMs "know" more than what they "say" [21; 4]; their internal representations encode rich state information [35]. In fact, examples of positive and negative LLM generations tend to define partly separate clusters within the activation space, as shown in Figure 1. Furthermore, Li et al. [21] trained a linear probe on the output representations from a subset of attention heads and achieved \(65.1\%\) accuracy in predicting whether an LLM is hallucinating or not. Inspired by these observations, we aim to steer LLMs' behaviour (e.g., to generate more truthful or less biased content) by editing their internal activations.

The idea of editing LLM activations by training a _target module_--e.g., a vector of shifts [21; 5] or an entire expert model

Figure 1: t-SNE plot of LLaMA-2-chat-7B’s activations for positive (blue) and negative (red) demonstrations from HaluEval and BBQ.

[22; 45]--then transforming the LLM activations during inference, has recently emerged as a prominent editing technique.

However, most of these methods require an expensive iterative optimisation to find such a _target module_. In contrast, we propose a novel _training-free_ method, spectral editing of activations (SEA), which edits activations by keeping them highly correlated with activations associated with positive behaviour (e.g., truthful) and decorrelated with negative behaviour (e.g., hallucinated). Our editing projections can be found with a closed-form spectral decomposition.

In practice, we first keep track of the LLM activations during inference for several demonstrations. For a given prompt, we extract the _neutral_ activations for a completion generated by the LLM. We also collect negative and positive activations for pairs of completions labelled as negative and positive, respectively. We then apply singular value decomposition (SVD) on the covariance matrices between the neutral and negative activations and between the neutral and positive activations. We then find the editing projections that prune highly co-varying directions between the neutral and negative ones while saving the highly co-varying directions between the neutral and positive ones in the latent projection space. However, SVD only allows for _linear_ editing. To overcome this limitation, we show that using an invertible non-linear feature function can perform the editing in a non-linear feature space and then transform the edited activations back to the original activation space. Finally, when the LLM is prompted with a new user query at inference time, we use these editing projections to find a representative of the model's activations that co-varies the _least_ with the negative demonstrations and the _most_ with the positive demonstrations, essentially removing the negative information from the LLM activations while retaining the positive information.

We conduct our experiments by evaluating two desirable properties of LLMs: truthfulness [23] and fairness [27]. We observe SEA's advantages in improving these desirable properties while maintaining high inference efficiency. For example, applying linear SEA on the 7B LLaMA-2-chat model improves the MC1 score on TruthfulQA from 36.96 to 39.41 while only slightly increasing the inference time (\(+3.67\%\)). Moreover, non-linear SEA enhances the accuracy of the 7B LLaMA-2-chat model from 43.02 to 56.17 on the BBQ dataset. More broadly, we evaluate SEA in combination with six distinct LLMs of different sizes and architectures, and observe consistent improvements for both linear and non-linear SEA. Only 25 demonstrations are sufficient to yield a noticeable improvement in the model's truthfulness and fairness, which demonstrates SEA's data efficiency. We also show that editing LLMs' activations using SEA does not degrade other model capabilities such as commonsense or mathematical reasoning.

## 2 Method: Spectral Editing of Activations

We turn now to introducing our method for editing LLM activations. We first illustrate the framework of spectral decomposition to edit the model activations (SS2.1). We then detail the preparation (SS2.2) of the model activations for positive and negative demonstrations as well as neutral activations for calculating the editing projections (SS2.3). We finally apply the editing matrices to new LLM queries (SS2.4). An overview of SEA is given in Figure 2.

### Spectral Decomposition for Editing Activations

**Background and Notation.** For an integer \(N\), \([N]\) is the set \(\{1,\ldots,N\}\). For a vector \(\mathbf{v}\), we denote by \(\|\mathbf{v}\|_{2}\) its \(\ell^{2}\)-norm. Matrices and vectors are in boldface font (with uppercase or lowercase letters, respectively). Random variables are denoted by uppercase boldface letters. Given a matrix \(\mathbf{A}\), we denote its \(j\)th column by \(\mathbf{A}_{j}\) (or by \(\mathbf{A}_{i:j}\) the matrix with columns \(\mathbf{A}_{q}\) for \(q=i,\ldots,j\)). All vectors

Figure 2: An overview of Spectral Editing of Activations (SEA). The method consists of two stages: (Left) the offline calculation of the editing projections using spectral decomposition with positive, negative and neutral demonstrations. (Right) the application of the calculated editing projections during LLM inference, thus manipulating predictions.

are assumed to be column vectors unless specified. We define a _demonstration_ as a (textual) prompt with a completion. There are three types of demonstrations: negative (a prompt with an undesirable completion), positive (a prompt with its desirable completion) and neutral (a prompt and a natural LLM completion). We assume three random vectors: \(\mathbf{H}^{+},\mathbf{H}^{-},\mathbf{H}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) with mean zero, where \(\mathbf{H}^{+}\) (or \(\mathbf{H}^{-}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\)) are the last-token activations for a positive (or a negative and a neutral) demonstration. Our objective is to maximise the covariance between \(\mathbf{H}^{+}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\), while minimising the covariance between \(\mathbf{H}^{-}\) and \(\mathbf{H}\). We assume \(n\) samples of \((\mathbf{H}^{+},\mathbf{H}^{-},\mathbf{H})\), denoted by \((\mathbf{h}^{+(i)},\mathbf{h}^{-(i)},\mathbf{h}^{(i)})\) for \(i\in[n]\).

**Editing Framework.** Let \(\mathbf{H}^{A}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{B}\) be two random vectors. The matrix of cross-covariance between \(\mathbf{H}^{A}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{B}\) is \(\mathbf{A}=\mathbb{E}[\mathbf{H}^{A}(\mathbf{H}^{B})^{\top}]\) where \(\mathbf{A}_{ij}=Cov(\mathbf{H}^{A}_{i},\mathbf{H}^{B}_{j})\) for \(i,j\in[d]\).

The high-level intuition behind spectral decomposition for editing activation is to use the cross-covariance between two random activation vectors to search principal directions which maximise their covariance and project these two variables to those directions. Formally, we identify \(\mathbf{U}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\), and the objective of finding these two matrices (by columns) is formulated as:

\[\text{Cov}(\mathbf{U}^{\top}_{i}\mathbf{H}^{A},\mathbf{V}^{\top}_{i}\mathbf{H }^{B})=\max_{(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\in\mathcal{O}_{i}}\text{Cov}(\mathbf{a}^ {\top}\mathbf{H}^{A},\mathbf{b}^{\top}\mathbf{H}^{B}),\] (1)

where \(\mathcal{O}_{i}\) is the set of all valid pairs of \((\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b})\) such that \(\|\mathbf{a}\|_{2}=\|\mathbf{b}\|_{2}=1\), while \(\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b}\) are orthogonal to other column vectors in \(\mathbf{U},\mathbf{V}\), respectively. We can use SVD on \(\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{\top}\) to solve this maximisation problem and find the needed matrices \(\mathbf{U}\) and \(\mathbf{V}\), where \(\mathbf{U}_{i},\mathbf{V}_{i}\) are the vectors projecting each feature of \(\mathbf{H}^{A},\mathbf{H}^{B}\) into the joint space such that they maximally covary, and the squared singular value along the diagonal matrix \(\Sigma\) (denote the singular values \(\sigma_{i}=\Sigma_{ii}\)), can be interpreted as the "importance" of \(\mathbf{U}_{i}\) and \(\mathbf{V}_{i}\). Now, we can use the largest or smallest left singular vectors of \(\mathbf{U}\) as \(\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}\) to project \(\mathbf{H}^{A}\), thus using the cross-covariance to find a representation of \(\widetilde{\mathbf{H}}^{A}\) that co-varies the _most_ or _least_ with \(\mathbf{H}^{B}\). Additionally, since \(\mathbf{U}\) is orthogonal, we can simply use the transpose of \(\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}\) to project the representation of \(\mathbf{H}^{A}\) in that joint space back to the original space, \(\widetilde{\mathbf{H}}^{A}=\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}\widetilde{\mathbf{U}}^{ \top}\mathbf{H}^{A}\), which essentially keeps the maximal or minimal covariance of \(\mathbf{H}^{A}\) with \(\mathbf{H}^{B}\) while minimising the editing, \(\mathbb{E}[\|\mathbf{H}^{A}-\widetilde{\mathbf{H}}^{A}\|_{2}]\), to preserve model performance after editing its activations.

### Preparing the LLM Activations

To perform the spectral editing of activations, we need to define \((\mathbf{H}^{+},\mathbf{H}^{-},\mathbf{H})\) where \(\mathbf{H}^{+},\mathbf{H}^{-}\) are the activations encoding the model's positive and negative behaviours, and \(\mathbf{H}\) denote the model's "default" activations. Then we can use the described method to edit \(\mathbf{H}\) to co-vary with \(\mathbf{H}^{+}\) the most while co-varying with \(\mathbf{H}^{-}\) the least. To maintain the training-free advantage of our method, we produce \((\mathbf{H}^{+},\,\widetilde{\mathbf{H}}^{-},\mathbf{H})\) by feeding positive and negative demonstrations and prompts to LLMs and track its internal activations. However, it is also possible to separately train a pair of expert and anti-expert models to produce such activations [22; 45; 28].

Formally, assuming we have \(n\) positive and negative paired demonstrations \(\{(x_{1},y_{1}^{+}),\ldots,(x_{n},y_{n}^{+})\}\) and \(\{(x_{1},y_{1}^{-})...,(x_{n},y_{n}^{-})\}\), we first send each demonstration separately to the LLM to obtain the activations at the last token position for \(y\), capturing the latent states from the final part of each demonstration. Following [24], we target the output of each MLP layer of the Transformer block as the latent activations to edit. These captured activations from \(\mathbf{H}^{+}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{-}\) are then considered as attributes summarising LLM's positive and negative behaviours. We then compute the neutral activations, \(\mathbf{H}\), by simply forwarding the prompt of demonstration \(x\) to the LLM, and again obtaining the last-token activations from the LLM output.

### Finding the Editing Projections

As depicted in Figure 2(a), once we have \((\mathbf{H}^{+},\,\mathbf{H}^{-},\mathbf{H})\), we are ready to calculate the projections to edit the activations of the LLM. We first estimate their empirical cross-covariance through:

\[\mathbf{\Omega}^{+}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{h}^{(i)}(\mathbf{h}^{+(i)}) ^{\top},\quad\mathbf{\Omega}^{-}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbf{h}^{(i)}( \mathbf{h}^{-(i)})^{\top}.\] (2)The matrices \(\bm{\Omega}^{+},\bm{\Omega}^{-}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) represent the cross-covariance for \((\mathbf{H},\,\mathbf{H}^{+})\) and \((\mathbf{H},\,\mathbf{H}^{-})\), respectively. The number of demonstrations is \(n\). We then perform SVD on \(\bm{\Omega}^{+},\bm{\Omega}^{-}\) to obtain the decompositions \((\mathbf{U}^{-},\bm{\Sigma}^{-},\mathbf{V}^{-}),(\mathbf{U}^{+},\bm{\Sigma}^{ +},\mathbf{V}^{+})\), respectively.

As our target is to edit \(\mathbf{H}\), we then sort the left singular values and keep the largest singular-valued vectors, as \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}=\mathbf{U}^{+}_{(1:k^{+})}\), to preserve the maximal covariance between \(\mathbf{H}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{+}\). Similarly, we preserve the smallest left singular-valued vectors of \(\mathbf{U}^{-}\), as \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}=\mathbf{U}^{-}_{(k^{-}:d)}\), to remove the maximal covariance between \(\mathbf{H}\) and \(\mathbf{H}^{-}\). To decide the thresholds of selections, \(k^{+}\) and \(k^{-}\), we select the smallest integer \(k\) such that the sum of the normalised squared singular value, \(\sigma_{k}^{2}\), to be larger than a predefined hyperparameter \(K\), i.e., \(k=\min_{k}\left\{k\in[d]\,\middle|\,\sum_{j=1}^{k}\frac{\sigma_{j}^{2}}{\sum_{ i=1}^{d}\sigma_{j}^{2}}\geq K\right\}\), which can be interpreted as we keep the top-\(K\%\) and bottom-\(K\%\) of the explained variance ratio for \(\bm{\Omega}^{+}\) and \(\bm{\Omega}^{-}\), separately. Finally, we can use the editing matrices, \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}^{\top}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}^{\top}\) to edit \(\mathbf{H}\) and project it back into the original space.

### Editing Activations during Inference

We demonstrate the editing during inference in Figure 2(b). During this phase, we apply the paired editing matrices, \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}^{\top}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}^{\top}\), in parallel to the outputs of the MLP in each of the last \(L\) Transformer layer for every token position. Let \(T\) be the number of such tokens in a prompt and its completion, and let \(L\) be the number of layers such that \(\mathbf{z}_{\ell}^{(t)}\) is the vector of activations for \(t\in[T]\) and \(\ell\in[L]\). Then, we define: \(\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{\ell}^{(t+)}=\overline{\mathbf{U}^{+}}\cdot\overline{ \mathbf{U}^{+}}^{\top}\mathbf{z}_{\ell}^{(t)},\quad\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{ \ell}^{(t-)}=\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}^{-}}^{\top} \mathbf{z}_{\ell}^{(t)}\). (3)

The vectors \(\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{\ell}^{(t+)},\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{\ell}^{(t-)}\) are the activations after editing negatively and positively in the \(\ell\)-th layer. These two vectors are merged together to get the final edited activation vectors as follows, where \(i\) ranges over the coordinates of the vectors:

\[\overline{z}_{\ell,i}^{(t)}=(\overline{z}_{\ell,i}^{(t+)}+\overline{z}_{\ell, i}^{(t-)})\times\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^{T}(z_{\ell,i}^{(t)})^{2}}}{\sqrt{\sum_{t=1}^{T}( z_{\ell,i}^{(t+)}+z_{\ell,i}^{(t-)})^{2}}}.\] (4)

### Non-linear Editing in Richer Space

Up to now, our SEA algorithm has been constrained to be linear, using SVD to maximise or minimise covariance. As depicted in Figure 1, the model activations exhibit linear separability on particular behaviours such as generating hallucinations (see the top panel of Figure 1); however, some model behaviours, e.g., producing biased responses, may not exhibit linear separability within the model's activation space (see the bottom panel of Figure 1).

To generalise SEA to a non-linear scenario, we introduce an invertible non-linear feature function, \(\phi\), to first map the activations into \(\phi\)'s non-linear space, where \(\bm{\Phi}=\phi(\mathbf{H})\). Once we apply the edits with the corresponding cross-covariance matrices of the \(\phi\)-transformed activations (rather than the activations themselves), we apply the inverse of the non-linear function, \(\phi^{-1}\), to transform the edited activations back to the original space.2

Footnote 2: See discussion by [34] of using such \(\phi\) with cross-covariance matrices in the context of kernel learning. For simplicity, we encode the features directly rather than using an implicit kernel.

In practice, we can apply SEA on \(\bm{\Phi}\) rather than \(\mathbf{H}\) to obtain the editing matrices, \(\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{+}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{+}}^{\top}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{-}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{-}}^{\top}\). Again, we first calculate the covariance \(\bm{\Omega}_{\phi}^{+},\bm{\Omega}_{\phi}^{-}\) for \((\bm{\Phi},\bm{\Phi}^{+})\) and \((\bm{\Phi},\bm{\Phi}^{-})\) following Eq. 2. Afterwards, we find \((\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{+},\bm{\Sigma}_{\phi}^{+},\mathbf{V}_{\phi}^{+})\) and \((\mathbf{U}^{-},\bm{\Sigma}_{\phi}^{-},\mathbf{V}_{\phi}^{-})\) using SVD. Finally, we can obtain the editing projections, \(\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{+}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{+}}^{\top}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{-}}\cdot\overline{\mathbf{U}_{\phi}^{-}}^{\top}\). During inference, once we have edited the activations, \(\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{\phi,\ell}^{-}\) and \(\overline{\mathbf{z}}_{\phi,\ell}^{+}\), we apply the inverse of \(\phi\) to transform the edited activations to the original activation space. Below, we experiment with three various non-linear feature functions,

\[\phi(\mathbf{z})=\begin{cases}\exp\left(-\frac{\mathbf{z}^{2}}{2\alpha^{2}}\right)& \text{for squared-exponential}\\ \frac{\exp(\mathbf{z})-\exp(-\mathbf{z})}{\exp(\mathbf{z})+\exp(-\mathbf{z})}& \text{for tanh}\\ \text{ELU}(\mathbf{z})=\begin{cases}\mathbf{z},&\text{if x}\geq 0\\ \alpha(\exp(\mathbf{z})-1),&\text{if x}<0\end{cases}&\text{for ELU},\end{cases}\] (5)

where \(\alpha\) is the hyperparameter for each feature function, respectively. We slightly modify their inverses to be a "pseudo" inverse, \(\hat{\phi}^{-1}(\cdot)\), thus avoiding the numerical problem as follows,3

Footnote 3: We similarly use \(\widehat{\text{ELU}}^{-1}\) to denote the function we present is close to being an inverse of ELU.

\[\hat{\phi}^{-1}(\mathbf{z})=\begin{cases}-2\alpha^{2}\log(\max\{ \mathbf{z},\varepsilon\})&\text{for squared-exponential}\\ \frac{1}{2}\log\left(\frac{1+\min\{\max\{\mathbf{z},-1+\varepsilon\},1- \varepsilon\}}{1-\min\{\max\{\mathbf{z},-1+\varepsilon\},1-\varepsilon\}} \right)&\text{for tanh}\\ \widehat{\text{ELU}}^{-1}(\mathbf{z})=\begin{cases}\mathbf{z},&\text{if }x \geq 0\\ \log\left(\frac{\max\{\mathbf{z},-1+\varepsilon\}}{\alpha}+1\right),&\text{if }x<0 \end{cases}&\text{for ELU},\end{cases}\] (6)

where \(\varepsilon\) is a very small threshold we use to project the inputs of the inverse function to the nearest point in the valid range. We refer to our nonlinear editing method as \(\Phi\)-SEA.

## 3 Experiments

We apply SEA to explore two critical attributes that make large language models useful: 1) truthfulness; and 2) unbiasedness. Truthfulness and bias evaluation are well-suited to activation editing techniques because they are editable phenomena that can be partially adjusted without re-training [35; 21]. In addition, these two attributes, unlike other attributes such as style or fluency, allow us to obtain the polarised positive and negative demonstrations required by SEA.

### Truthfulness

**Datasets.** We evaluate all compared methods on TruthfulQA [23], which consists of 817 questions in 38 subcategories, each paired with a single _best answer_, and multiple _correct/incorrect answers_. TruthfulQA contains two evaluation protocols: multiple-choice question answering, and generation. We mainly use the first to ensure the comparability with previous work [21; 22; 7]. We show an example of a TruthfulQA data instance together with the demonstrations we used in Appendix M.

Since TruthfulQA only provides questions for testing (and not training) purposes, we do not calculate the editing projections based on it. Instead, we use the instances from HaluEval [20] to calculate editing projections as Zhang et al. [45], then evaluate SEA on TruthfulQA. Each example of HaluEval contains a user query paired with factual and hallucinated LLM responses annotated by human evaluators. We randomly sample the questions from HaluEval and concatenate their factual and hallucinated responses as the positive and negative demonstrations applied to SEA.

**Evaluation Metrics.** Following [45], we conduct the evaluation on both the multiple-choice question answering and generation track. In the first track, we use MC-1/2 from TruthfulQA: MC1 assesses whether the model allocates the highest predicted likelihood to the _best answer_, while MC2 evaluates whether the normalised likelihood of all correct answers surpasses the incorrect ones. In the generation track, we follow Li et al. [21] to train two separate evaluators, GPT-Truth and GPT-Info. Each of evaluators predicts a score from \(0\) to \(1\) indicating the truthfulness and informativeness of a given response, respectively. Additionally, we report the Info*Truth metric which assesses a response if it is both informative and truthful. We also report the inference and training time for LoRA and SEA for the efficiency comparison between the gradient-based method and ours.

**Baselines.** We compare SEA against several baselines: 1) **In-Context Learning** (ICL): ICL shows that LLMs can learn from demonstrations in the prompt. Here, we test if LLMs can learn to generate truthful responses from the positive demonstrations. 2) **LoRA Fine-tuning** (LoRA-FT; Hu et al. 15): we use the same training data for SEA to construct an Alpaca-style [38] instruction-tuning dataset, and then we further fine-tune the LLM on this dataset with LoRA [15]. 3) **Inference-time Intervention** (ITI; Li et al. 21): ITI trains a shifting module to capture truthfulness and then applies it to LLM's activations during inference. 4) **DoLa**[7] attempts to improve the model's factuality by contrasting the model's predicted logits based on various layers' activations. 5) **Contrastive Decoding** (CD; Li et al. 22) manipulates the model's predicted logits by penalising the ones similar to a smaller model. 6) **Induce-then-Contrast Decoding** (ICD; Zhang et al. 45) follows the intuition of CD, but ICD replaces the small model with an induced hallucinated model. We use a prompt-based induced hallucinated model here for a fair comparison.

### Bias

**Dataset.** We assess the model bias on the Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ; Parrish et al. 27), which is widely adopted in LLM evaluation [18; 31; 2]. BBQ formulates bias evaluation as a question-answering task, allowing us to easily construct the paired positive and negative demonstrations. BBQ contains 29,246 questions covering 11 diverse types of common bias. We randomly sampled 5,246 questions for evaluation, and the rest were used for training and validation purposes. We use the disambiguated version for a more comprehensive evaluation, providing the model with sufficiently informative contexts. This approach enables us to assess whether the model biases influence its selection of a correct answer choice. See Appendix M for example demonstrations.

**Evaluation Metric.** We use _accuracy_ as the main metric in bias evaluation [27]: the model gets credit for assigning the highest predicted likelihood to the only correct answer. To understand the model's behaviour in a more fine-grained way, we rely on the _unknown-answer rate_ to measure the model's usefulness: there is always a correct answer that the model should predict in the non-ambiguous version of BBQ. Hence, the model should never predict the "unknown" candidate as its prediction. We further use two bias-related metrics: 1) _bias score_[27] measures the frequency of the model predicting a biased answer when it makes a non-unknown prediction. 2) _Stereotypical response rate_ measures the percentage of the model's stereotypical predictions on questions whose gold answer is anti-stereotypical.

**Baselines.** While truthfulness assessment methods have been extensively studied, strategies to alleviate model bias during inference have remained relatively overlooked. Thus, our primary comparison involves SEA, ICL, and the LoRA-FT baseline. We explore the utility of both linear and nonlinear SEA in mitigating bias.

## 4 Results and Discussions

### Truthfulness Evaluation

**Main results.** Table 1 illustrates the results of various inference-only techniques aimed at boosting the performance of a 7B LLaMA-2 model on TruthfulQA. We observe a significant enhancement of the base LLaMA-2 model when further trained with the conversation-style alignment (LLaMA-2-Chat), as described in [40]. On the other hand, we do not observe an improvement with LoRA, which indicates the difficulty in improving a well-trained model with LoRA-style fine-tuning.

In the multiple-choice track, the best result is from our proposed SEA method, which outperforms ICL by 2.45 and 2.47 points for MC1 and MC2, respectively. In the generation track, SEA has the better truthfulness compared with ICL and LoRA. The positive improvement is also observed in the Best-of-N distribution. When compared to alternative approaches, SEA achieves the highest MC1 score while incurring the _minimal_ sacrifice in inference speed when we only modify the last four layers. SEA has only a 3.67% increase in inference speed, contrasting with the larger increases of 18.78%, 14.29%, and 97.34% for ITI, DoLA, and ICD, respectively. We also highlight the training efficiency, i.e., computing editing projections, of SEA compared to gradient-based optimisation methods (e.g., LoRA), an advantage that becomes more significant with an increasing number of demonstrations.

**Ablation study.** We then conduct an ablation study on TruthfulQA to show the positive contribution of each individual design of SEA. Our first group of analysis is to only use the positive or negative editing projection (see Positive Editing Only and Negative Editing Only in Table 2), rather than combining both edited activations. However, we observe a significant drop in both experiments. This observation suggests that the activations edited with positive and negative projections may complement each other, compensating for any information lost during the editing process. This is because, in the positive projection, we retain the top \(K\%\) of covariance information, whereas in the negative projection, we retain the top \((1-K)\%\) of covariance information as we discussed in SS2.3.

Our second group of analysis is to confirm the advantage of using feature normalisation. We alter the combination of positively and negatively edited activations by simply averaging each neuron's activation between the two. We note a decrease in MC1 from 39.41 to 35.86, affirming the impact of our proposed normalisation technique. One potential explanation for this decline in performance is that basic averaging might disrupt the correlation between activations, thereby hindering subsequent layers of the model from processing the edited activations normally.

Finally, to ascertain whether SEA's positive and negative editing projections effectively capture information relevant to controlling the model's factual or hallucinated responses, we reverse the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & **MC1** & **MC2** \\ \hline SEA & 39.41 & 57.15 \\ \hline Positive Editing only & 26.56 & 53.32 \\ Negative Editing only & 34.88 & 52.61 \\ Averaging Merging & 35.86 & 54.01 \\ Top-3 Layers Editing & 38.43 & 55.77 \\ Bottom-3 Layers Editing & 36.23 & 54.56 \\ Reverse Editing & 35.13 & 53.38 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 3: Left: Accuracy of all methods on each group of bias type in BBQ. Right: results on BBQ’s testing set. All methods are applied on LLaMA-2-Chat-7B. For accuracy (**A%**\(\uparrow\)), higher values are better; for unknown-answer response rate (**U%\(\downarrow\)**), bias score (**BS%\(\downarrow\)**) and stereotypical response rate (**SR%\(\downarrow\)**), lower is better. We use **bold** font for the best result in each column, and mark the methods that improve ICL. \(\uparrow\): significant improvements on ICL in **A%** by pair-wise t-test with \(p<0.05\).

editing projections and assess if this reversal leads to a performance decline. In detail, we apply the editing projections aimed at preserving maximal covariance between the neutral and negative activations, denoted as \((\mathbf{H},\mathbf{H}^{-})\), while minimising covariance between the neutral and positive activations, denoted as \((\mathbf{H},\mathbf{H}^{+})\), which essentially encourages the model to be more hallucinated while less factual. We observe a decrease in MC1 from 39.41 to 35.13, which falls below the LLaMA-2-Chat baseline at 36.96. This ablation proves that our positive and negative projections indeed capture information regarding the model behaviour from positive and negative demonstrations.

### Bias Evaluation

**Main Results.** We present the results on BBQ in Figure 3. Similarly to the truthfulness evaluation, LoRA only marginally improves the accuracy on BBQ. The accuracy enhancement achieved by linear SEA in BBQ is modest, exhibiting a mere increase of 0.78%. However, this observation may stem from the inferior separability between positive and negative demonstrations in BBQ within the activation space, as emerges from Figure 1. Furthermore, we observe significant accuracy improvements with \(\Phi\)-SEA incorporating three nonlinear feature functions. The best \(\Phi\)-SEA with the squared-exponential feature function resulted in accuracy enhancements of 13.15%. The drops in unknown-answer rate (27% \(\rightarrow\) 8.1%) and bias metrics (bias score: 5.8% \(\rightarrow\) 2%; stereotypical response rate: 54% \(\rightarrow\) 42.6%) further prove that the boosted accuracy comes from the improvement on usefulness and fairness. Detailed accuracy scores across each bias type in BBQ reveal that SEA yields benefits across all genres of bias, while LoRA results in a decline in Physical_appearance, Race_ethnicity, Race_x_SES, and Race_x_gender.

### Generalisation across Various LLMs

We show the results on TruthfulQA and BBQ of applying ICL, Linear SEA and \(\Phi\)-SEA on six LLMs with different model families and sizes in Table 3. Specifically, we test them on the LLaMA-2 family [40], Gemma family [39] and Mistral 7B [17], which represent the state-of-the-art open-source LLMs. Linear SEA shows generalisable improvements across all tested LLMs on TruthfulQA. On BBQ, we observe a general trend across different LLMs that linear SEA can marginally improve accuracy, but the other two metrics are mixed. \(\Phi\)-SEA shows promising performance and can gain increased accuracy, lower unknown-answer rate and stereotypical response rate across all LLMs, except a negligible higher stereotypical response rate for Gemma-it-2B.

### Scaling the Number of Demonstrations

In Figure 4, we plot the 7B LLaMA-2-Chat model performance by varying the number of used demonstrations in calculating the editing projections. Our first observation is that SEA can start to increase MC1 with only 25 demonstrations. With even fewer demonstrations (e.g., 25), the model can positively improve the accuracy of BBQ. Both results demonstrate the data efficiency of SEA. Secondly, we show that SEA generally benefits from more demonstrations just like ICL [3]; however, unlike ICL, the offline calculations of SEA are not limited by the context length supported by an LLM. This advantage provides a new strategy for using demonstrations to better guide LLMs' generation.

### Post-Editing Performance on Control Tasks

We then leverage six additional control tasks to analyse the editing effects of SEA on other LLM capabilities in Table 4. These tasks include MMLU [14], which serves as the most general benchmark. We then use HellaSwag [19] and Natural Questions [43] to assess the model's commonsense reasoning and question answering. We use GSM8K [8] and MathQA [1] to verify the model's ability to solve mathematical tasks. We rely on ToxiGen [13] for assessing the model's toxicity.

**Editing a model's activations has only a limited impact on other capabilities.** We first note that linear editing almost does not hurt the model's other capabilities (e.g., in commonsense and maths). The non-linear editing causes a small drop in performance in maths tasks, but we observe a more visible decrease in common-sense QA. We attribute this to the limitation mentioned in SS2.5, namely that the non-linear projection using feature functions is not theoretically lossless. Qualitative examples in Appendix G also show the high quality and fluency in outputs of SEA-edited models.

### Generalisation of Editing Effects to Similar Tasks

**SEA's editing effect can be generalised to other similar tasks.** Finally, we observe that the post-editing improvements can be generalised across new tasks, provided they share some similarities. For example, we observe a strong improvement of the 7B LLaMA-2-Chat model in ToxiGen in Table 4, after projecting the activations towards the less biased directions.

We further assess all SEA methods using BBQ's demonstrations on the CrowS-Pairs dataset [26], which evaluates a model's propensity to generate biased outputs (Table 5). We report the percentage of stereotypical sentences rated as more likely than non-stereotypical ones, where a lower percentage indicates less bias. Results demonstrate that both SEA variants effectively reduce model bias across most categories, with \(\Phi\)-SEA notably decreasing the generation of stereotypical sentences by 7%.

Figure 4: MC1 scores of SEA by using a different number of demonstrations. A higher score indicates a better performance. We find that SEA can start to positively improve the baseline with only 25 demonstrations on both TruthfulQA and BBQ for the 7B LLaMA-2-Chat model.

### Spectral Analysis for the Source of Model Behaviours

We now present an analysis to substantiate why editing the top-\(L\) layers proves to be more precise compared to other editing schemes, such as the bottom-\(L\) layers. We follow [11; 46; 47] which proposed interpreting the _signature_ as the sum of singular values resulting from an SVD of the cross-covariance for two variables, indicating the degree of correlation between them. We extend this to identify which layers' activations contain the most information regarding the model's behaviour. The calculation of the signature value is in Appendix A.

In Figure 5, we depict the layer-wise normalised signatures of various LLMs calculated on HaluEval. Most LLMs exhibit a trend where the top layers contain the truthfulness information, aligning with recent findings suggesting that bottom layers capture fundamental linguistic features, while top layers contribute to high-level tasks [47]. However, Gemma stands out, as both bottom and top layers hold significant truthfulness-related information. This suggests that LLMs, possibly due to variations in data mixtures, may distribute truthfulness information across layers differently.

To the same end, we also conduct an ablation, reported in Table 2. Comparing settings exclusively editing the top three layers with those editing the bottom three layers, we find that the first yields superior performance. We also find an advantage in editing more top layers, which is in line with the exponential trend we observe for LLaMA-2-Chat-7B in Figure 5.

## 5 Related Work

Modifying the activations of a trained model, thus altering the model's behaviour [30; 16; 24; 49; 6; 44] or internal knowledge [9], represents a lightweight method to control the model's generation. Li et al. [21] probes LLM's attention heads which are accountable for hallucinations, then edits activations toward truthful directions. Another way is extracting latent vectors directly from the trained model and leveraging these vectors to regulate the model's inference [41; 37; 32; 49]. Recently, Singh et al. [35] demonstrated the efficacy of fitting an optimal transport from negative to positive activations to facilitate effective non-linear editing. Activation editing finds application in decoding as well, either by contrasting activations from various layers [7] or by using a weaker model to edit activations from a stronger model [22; 45]. Distinct with previous works that use probing [21], contrasting activations [6; 49; 45; 22], or optimal transfer [35], we use the covariance information to find the editing directions for LLM's activations.

## 6 Conclusion

We present SEA, a new training-free activation editing method. This is aimed at guiding LLMs to generate desirable outputs through spectral decomposition. Our findings indicate that linear SEA yields improvements in truthfulness and bias over several baselines while imposing minimal additional computation overheads. We also extend SEA to incorporate non-linear capabilities through feature functions and their pseudo-inverse. An intriguing property of our method is that it can leverage an increased number of demonstrations without being constrained by context length. Finally, we establish that our approach generalises across LLMs of varying model sizes and families, without incurring degradation of other LLM capabilities.

Calculation of Signature Value

Formally, we mix \(n\) positive and negative activations as \(\mathbf{H}^{\pm}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times 2n}\), we then create a label matrix, \(\mathbf{L}\in\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2n}\), where we mix all positive and negative demonstrations, and each column is a one-hot vector encoding the positive/negative label. We then calculate the empirical cross-covariance for \((\mathbf{H}^{\pm},\mathbf{L})\) following Eq. 2. Finally, we apply SVD on the cross-covariance and get \((\mathbf{U}^{\pm},\mathbf{\Sigma}^{\pm},\mathbf{V}^{\pm})\). The sum of values, \(\sum_{i}[\Sigma_{\ell}]_{ii}\), can now be readily used to describe a signature of the \(\ell\)-th layer activations in relation to the model's behaviour label.

## Appendix B Spectrum of the Covariances

We visualise the spectrum for LLaMA-2-Chat-7B model's covariance matrices on all layers in Figure 6. We observe the general trend that the singular values exponentially decay from left to right (i.e., from the main to less important directions).

## Appendix C Visualisation for Activations Editing

We also provide a visualisation for \(\Phi\)-SEA editing on BBQ in Figure 7. We visualise the activations of LLaMA-2-Chat-7B's 17th layer for the positive (i.e., positive) and negative (i.e., negative) demonstrations, and the activations before (i.e., base) and after applying \(\Phi\)-SEA (i.e., sea).

This visualisation provides the intuition to explain \(\Phi\)-SEA's editing which removes the directions co-varied with the negative demonstrations while retaining the positive directions on LLM's base activations.

## Appendix D Analysis in the Effect of \(K\)

In this section, we explore the impact of hyperparameter \(K\) on the performance of the SEA-edited LLaMA-2-Chat-7B model (MC-1/2) on TruthfulQA. Specifically, we vary \(K\) across values of \(\{95\%,99\%,99.5\%,99.99\%\}\), alongside \(L\) values from \(\{1,2,3,4,5\}\), and present the corresponding MC1 and MC2 scores for each experimental configuration.

Our analysis reveals a consistent pattern: as \(K\) increases, the model's performance initially improves, reaching its peak around 99.5%, before declining thereafter. We interpret this trend as follows: below a certain threshold, increasing \(K\) allows SEA's projections to capture more information related to positive demonstrations and less information related to negative demonstrations. However, as \(K\) surpasses the turning point, the heightened emphasis on positive signals leads to the incorporation of noise in the positive demonstrations, also diminishing performance by reducing task-related information from negative demonstrations.

Figure 6: Visualisation for the spectrum of the covariances of activations for LLaMA-2-Chat-7B model. Y-axis values are the index for LLM’s layers. X-axis index are for all directions after SVD. A brighter cell indicates that the singular value in the corresponding direction is more significant.

Figure 7: t-SNE visualisation for the \(\Phi\)-SEA editing on BBQ.

## Appendix E Joint Editing for the Truthfulness and Fairness

We conducted an additional experiment merging both positive and negative demonstrations for truthfulness and fairness, then applied the SEA editing method to compute a joint pair of projection matrices that simultaneously target truthfulness and fairness on LLaMA-2-Chat-7B.

Compared to the original LLaMA-2-Chat-7B, we observed that the joint projection enhances both truthfulness and fairness. However, this joint projection is less effective than specialised editing for individual targets when using the same number of demonstrations. We hypothesise that this may be due to differing directions and magnitudes required for editing in various targets. Evidence for this comes from analysing the spectrum of the covariances of activations on HaluEval and BBQ as presented in Figure 6.

## Appendix F Ablation on the Types of LLM's Activations

We conduct an ablation study to compare different methods for extracting LLM activations. Specifically, we evaluate activations taken from 1) the last-position token, 2) mean pooling across all

\end{table}

Values in the y-axis represent the model performance in MC1 (top panel) and MC2 (bottom panel). \(K\) values are on the x-axis, chosen form {95%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.99%}. We also alter the number of editing layers (\(L\)) to verify if the observation can be generalised to different settings. The used LLM in this analysis is the LLaMA-2-Chat-7B.

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline
**LLM’s Activations** & **MC1** & **MC2** \\ \hline Last-position & 39.41 & 57.15 \\ Mean & 36.96 & 54.55 \\ Random & 36.96 & 53.6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

tokens in the demonstrations, and 3) a randomly selected token. These methods are tested on the LLaMA-2-Chat-7B model with TruthfulQA.

As expected, using the last-position activations yields the best results. We believe this is because completions in TruthfulQA, especially in QA tasks with short answers, are generally shorter than the instruction-containing prompts. Mean pooling over all tokens in the sequence may amplify the prompt's signal rather than that of the shorter positive/negative completions. Additionally, in a decoder-only model, prompt tokens do not attend to the completion during encoding, so contrasting prompt tokens in positive and negative demonstrations captures less meaningful covariance information between neutral activations and different demonstrations.

## Appendix G Qualitative Analysis

We qualitatively analysed two cases of open-end generation of LLaMA-2-7B on TruthfulQA and BBQ. We first noticed that both responses from LLaMA-2-7B+SEA remained of high quality and fluency after editing.

In the first example on TruthfulQA, we find that the baseline, LLaMA-2-Chat-7B, produces the non-factual claim that _flight of bumblebees is not possible_; however, our method successfully removes this claim and produces the explanation _The wings of a bumblebee are adapted to produce lift through a combination of flapping and gliding motions._ which is closer to the correct answer.

In the second BBQ example, LLaMA-2-Chat-7B refuses to answer the question according to our provided context. After being equipped with SEA, the model can identify the opinions of Jack Barnes and Zeinab al-Balushi and provide the correct answer that Jack Barnes's position supports terrorism. A full description of the examples is provided in Table 11.

## Appendix H Implementation Details

**Gemma-it 7B Model.** For the best linear SEA setting, we use 1000 pairs of demonstrations randomly sampled from our training split of BBQ to obtain the editing projections for fairness. We set the hyperparameter \(K=99.9\%\) and we edit the top 2 layers. For the best \(\Phi-\)SEA setting, we use squared-exponential feature function, \(K=99.99\%\), edit the top 3 layers, and use 1000 pairs of demonstrations.

**Mistral 7B Model.** For the best linear SEA setting, we use 1000 pairs of demonstrations randomly sampled from our training split of BBQ to obtain the editing projections for fairness. We set the hyperparameter \(K=99.9\%\) and we edit the top 1 layer. For the best \(\Phi-\)SEA setting, we use squared-exponential feature function, \(K=99.99\%\), edit the top 1 layer, and use 1000 pairs of demonstrations.

### Used Prompt Templates for Varied LLM Families

Given the variety of LLM families in our experiment, each employs distinct prompt templates. We adhere to the provided template for each family, as outlined in Table 8.

### Experiments Setup for Control Tasks

We conduct our experiments on all control tasks with the lm-evaluation-harness code [12]. We introduce the setup for the evaluation on each control task in this section.

For HellaSwag, MathQA, MMLU, and ToxiGen, we adopt the default evaluation protocol provided by lm-evaluation-harness. This framework casts evaluation as a multiple-choice question answering task, selecting the candidate with the highest predicted likelihood as the model's response. The evaluation metric is accuracy, and we use the prompt following the default configuration. We employ a 4-shot evaluation for MathQA and a zero-shot evaluation for other tasks.

Regarding Natural Questions and GSM8K, we adhere to the default evaluation procedure in lm-evaluation-harness, framing the assessment as open-ended generation tasks. Exact match serves as the metric to evaluate whether the model responds correctly to the given prompts. We utilise the default prompts and conduct an 8-shot evaluation for GSM8K, while employing a 5-shot evaluation for Natural Questions.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline
**LLM Family** & **Prompt Template** \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{LLaMA} & [INST]*SYS* \\  & [system prompt] \\  & */SYS* \\  & [user message][/INST] \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{Gemma} & [start\_of\_turn>user \\  & [user message]<end\_of\_turn> \\  & [start\_of\_turn>model \\ \hline Mistral & [INST] \{user message\} [/INST] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Prompt templates used in our experiments. {system prompt} refers to the provided system prompt for LLaMA-2-Chat model in [40], whereas {user message} refers to our actual input prompts.

Compute Resources

All experiments for LLaMA-2-Chat-7B are conducted on a single CPU machine (Intel(r) Xeon(r) Platinum 8360Y CPUs), utilising 32 cores per experiment, with one 40GB NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU.

**Calculation of Editing Projections.** When run on a GPU, the computation time for calculating the 21-layer linear SEA for truthfulness is approximately 2 minutes and 32 seconds. The computation time for the 3-layer \(\Phi\)-SEA for fairness is approximately 20 seconds.

**Inference on Benchmarks.** For TruthfulQA, the overall inference time of SEA-edited 7B LLaMA-2-Chat model is approximately 10 minutes. For BBQ, the overall inference time for the linear and non-linear SEA is approximately 19 and 21 minutes, respectively.

**Using SEA with Other LLMs.** Applying SEA to other LLMs incurs minimal additional computational overhead. For the 13B model, SEA implementation necessitates only two A100 40G GPUs. Similarly, for the 70B model, SEA requires just two A100 80G GPUs. These requirements are the same as the usage of LLMs without applying SEA.

## Appendix J Limitations

While we observe minimal performance degradation on control tasks with the linear-edited model, we identify a limitation of our approach, namely the performance degradation of non-linear SEA editing on control tasks. This observation persists despite our efforts, as discussed in Section 4.5, where we highlight that the "pseudo-inverse" transformation of our feature functions for non-linear SEA is not lossless. This occurs because not all nonlinear functions possess a rigorous inverse. In cases where an inverse is not present, we project the function's output onto the nearest valid point along its inverse function. A potential avenue for future research involves exploring methods to extend SEA editing to incorporate non-linear transformations with reduced impact on control task performance.

## Appendix K Broader Impact

Large language models (LLMs) have had a transformative impact on natural language processing, but their tendency to generate inaccurate or biased content has been a major obstacle to trusted real-world deployment. Our proposed spectral editing of activations (SEA) method aims to improve the truthfulness and fairness of LLMs while maintaining high inference efficiency. If successful, this could help mitigate the spread of misinformation and promote more equitable AI systems.

Improving the factual accuracy of LLM generations has great potential for positive societal impact. Misinformation and disinformation spread via natural language can cause significant harm, eroding trust in institutions, fomenting social divides, and enabling the proliferation of conspiratorial thinking. By making LLMs more truthful, SEA could help curb the flow of inaccurate information from AI systems as they become more widely deployed for language tasks. Additionally, enhancing fairness and reducing encoded biases in LLMs promotes AI that is more inclusive and does not unfairly disadvantage or discriminate against certain groups based on attributes like race or gender.

However, there are also potential negative impacts to consider. Any technology that can steer language model outputs, even with the positive intent of improving truthfulness and fairness, could potentially be misused to amplify or instil other undesirable traits. There are security implications if the editing of LLM activations enables new attack vectors or model vulnerabilities. Care must also be taken with the human demonstrations used to exemplify positive and negative behaviours, as these could perpetuate societal biases present in the data.

While this work is primarily foundational research into a novel model editing technique, we acknowledge the need for proactive consideration of potential negative impacts. As the work progresses towards application, it will be critical to implement robust monitoring, evaluation, and mitigation strategies to uphold principles of responsible AI development and deployment. This includes carefully auditing the data used for supervision, testing outputs across different demographic groups, and implementing appropriate controls against misuse or unintended negative consequences.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction include claims made in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations of SEA in Appendix J. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the implementation details and hyperparameters for reproducing results for all LLMs in Section H. To maximise the reproducibility, we will also release the code for reproducing SEA, together with all editing projections we have calculated in this paper to the supplementary material and the public. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will release the code for reproducing SEA, together with all editing projections we have calculated in this paper to the supplementary material and the public following the code submission policy. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe the core setup of experiments in Section 3. We have also provided the full experiment settings and details of hyperparameters in Appendix H. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report the significance of SEA's improvement in truthfulness (MC-1/2) compared to the baseline, LLaMA-2-Chat-7B in Table 1. We also report the significance of improvements in accuracy for all SEA variants over LLaMA-2-Chat-7B in BBQ (Table 3). These tests in significance further support our main claim that SEA can improve LLM's faithfulness and fairness in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the type of compute workers CPU and GPU, with the relevant memory in Appendix I.
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will make sure to follow the NeurIPS code of ethics and the policy that preserves anonymity. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss both potential positive and negative societal impacts in Appendix K. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We plan to release only the editing projections, not the models. We don't see a risk of dual-use of the projections, and we will require that users adhere to usage guidelines. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The datasets/models used in this paper are properly cited, and all usage in this paper is only for research. We include the version and licenses for existing assets in Appendix L. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We properly provide the documentation for the releasing code and our calculated editing projections used in this paper, together with the necessary license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
