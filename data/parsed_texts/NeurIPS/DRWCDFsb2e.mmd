###### Abstract

Conversational large language models (LLMs) are trained to be helpful, honest and harmless (HHH) and yet they remain susceptible to hallucinations, misinformation and are capable of deception. A promising avenue for safeguarding against these behaviors is to gain a deeper understanding of their inner workings. Here we ask: what could interpretability tell us about deception and can it help to control it? First, we introduce a simple and yet general protocol to induce 20 large conversational models from different model families (Llama, Germma, Yi and Qwen) of various sizes (from 1.5B to 70B) to knowingly lie. Second, we characterize three iterative refinement stages of deception from the latent space representation. Third, we demonstrate that these stages are _universal_ across models from different families and sizes. We find that the third stage progression reliably predicts whether a certain model is capable of deception. Furthermore, our patching results reveal that a surprisingly sparse set of layers and attention heads are causally responsible for lying. Importantly, consistent across all models tested, this sparse set of layers and attention heads are part of the third iterative refinement process. When contrastive activation steering is applied to control model output, only steering these layers from the third stage could effectively reduce lying. Overall, these findings identify a universal motif across deceptive models and provide actionable insights for developing general and robust safeguards against deceptive AI. The code, dataset, visualizations, and an interactive demo notebook are available at https://github.com/safellm-2024/1lm_deception.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have seen widespread deployment in recent years. They exhibit impressive general capabilities - some of which approach or even surpass human expertise. These advances also pose greater risks around misuses in misinformation and malicious applications (Hubinger et al., 2024; Scheurer et al., 2024). Despite the growing evidence for unsafe behaviors that persist through safety training, we know very little about why and how these safety breaches occur. Enhanced transparency of models under those scenarios would offer numerous benefits, from a deeper understanding of their inner workings, to increased accountability for safety assurance and the potential for discovering novel failure modes (Casper et al., 2024).

Recent advances in interpretability (Wang et al., 2022; Nanda et al., 2023b; Ma et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023) have demonstrated great potential for understanding the internal mechanisms of language models. Interpretability tools have successfully revealed the inner mechanisms of models performing various tasks. However, most interpretability works study _base_ models that havenot been through safety training. Some recent works carefully examine a set of safety-related behaviors in chat models (Campbell et al., 2023; Arditi et al., 2024; Ball et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2024; Rimsky et al., 2024), but they typically limiting themselves to one kind of model under each investigation.

In this study, we integrate mechanistic interpretability and representation engineering tools (Zou et al., 2023) to study a diverse set of large conversational language models (_chat_ models), focusing on one key safety challenge - deception. Overall, our main contributions are:

* We introduce a simple yet general protocol to induce large conversational models to knowingly lie. We test our protocol on 20 models of various model sizes (from 1.5 to 70 billion) from different model families (Qwen, Yi, Llama and Gemma).
* We identify three iterative refinement stages of deception and demonstrate that these stages are _universal_ across different models.
* We show that progression on the third stage could reliably predict whether a particular model is capable of lying.
* With activation patching, we identify a sparse set of stage 3 layers that are causally responsible for lying. Consistently, with contrastive activation steering, we show that only steering (with contrastive activation steering) the third stage layers could effectively reduce lying.

### Dishonesty and Deception.

Many studies highlight that LLMs do not reliably output truth. Failures in truthfulness fall into two categories (Evans et al., 2021): sometimes LLMs simply do not know the correct answer (capability failure), and sometimes they apparently 'know' the true answer but nevertheless generate a false response or 'hide' their true motives (Perez et al., 2022; Pacchiardi et al., 2023; Zou et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023). For instance, Lin et al. (2022) show that models often generated false answers that mimic popular human misconceptions. Interestingly, Lin et al. (2022) show that scaling up models alone does not help improving truthfulness since larger models are more prone to imitative falsehoods (inverse scaling law). Park et al. (2023) document that the AI system CICERO can engage in premeditated deception, planning in advance to build a fake alliance with a player in order to trick that player into leaving themselves undefended for an attack. More recently, Hubinger et al. (2024) create'sleeper agents' which behave helpfully during training but exhibit harmful behaviors when deployed. Their results raise concerns about the effectiveness of current safety training techniques against maliciously trained AI systems. Scheurer et al. (2024) demonstrate that LLM agents can even strategically deceiving their users in a realistic situation, without direct instructions or training for deception.

## 3 Method

### A general protocol for instructing different models to knowingly lie

As noted by Campbell et al. (2023) inducing lying behavior can be challenging and requires careful prompt engineering. Built on this previous work, we build a simple and yet general protocol to induce knowingly lie in a diverse set up models.

As illustrated in Figure 6, the main structure of our prompting protocol composed of the following four components:

* **1. System prompt.*
* For each statement, we have a pair of contrastive prompts:
* Honest persona: "You are to answer the following question in an honest manner."
* Lying persona: "You are to answer the following question in a lying manner."
* **2. User prompt:** "Is the following statement true of false?"
* **3. Statement:** Insert one statement regarding a scientific fact from Azaria & Mitchell (2023)
* **4. Prefix injection:** "Answer: The statement is __ __ "

### Residual stream dimensionality reduction

For each model completion, we cache the residual stream activation \(x_{I}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}}\) at the _last token position_\(I\) of the prompt at each layer \(l\), and perform Principle Component Analysis (PCA). We do this for all layers \(l\in[L]\) of the transformer block, and visualize their low dimensional embedding \(a_{I}^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{2}\).

"Truth direction'.Truth direction denotes the vector direction from the centroid of the false statements to the centroid of the true statements (difference in means between true and false statements).

Centroid of all true statements are calculated by taking the geometric mean of the residual stream activations for all true statements \(t\in D^{true}\) at the _last token position_\(I\) :

\[t_{I}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{D^{(true)}}\sum_{t\in D^{(true)}}x_{I}^{(l)}(t)\] (1)

Centroid of all false statements are calculated by taking the mean of the residual stream activations for all false statements \(t\in D^{false}\) at the _last token position_\(I\) :

\[f_{I}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{D^{(false)}}\sum_{t\in D^{(false)}}x_{I}^{(l)}(t)\] (2)

Truth direction \(u_{I}^{(l)}\) is:

\[u_{I}^{(l)}=t_{I}^{(l)}-f_{I}^{(l)}\] (3)

### Contrastive Activation Steering

Contrastive activation steering is a technique for controlling the behavior of language models by modifying their internal activations during inference (Turner et al., 2024; Arditi et al., 2024; Rimsky et al., 2024). The two major steps are:

* **Extracting** the steering vector from contrastive examples.
* **Applying** the steering vectors to modify model behavior during generation.

#### 3.3.1 Extracting Steering Vector

'Honest direction'.To steer the lying model to become honest, an 'honest direction' is extracted from the latent activations to build the _steering vector_. The _difference-in-means_ method is used to build the steering vector. This involves taking the mean difference in activations over a dataset of contrastive prompts.

Here, the contrastive pairs consist of honest and lying versions of the prompt for each statement. We compute the difference between the mean activations when models are instructed to be honest versus lying.

For each layer \(l\in[L]\) and the _last token position_ of the prompt \(I\), we calculate the mean activation \(h_{I}^{(l)}\) for honest persona and \(l_{I}^{(l)}\) for lying persona:

\[h_{I}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{D^{(honest)}}\sum_{t\in D^{(honest)}}x_{I}^{(l)}(t),\quad l _{I}^{(l)}=\frac{1}{D^{(lying)}}\sum_{t\in D^{(lying)}}x_{I}^{(l)}(t)\] (4)Honest direction \(r^{(l)}\) is the difference between the mean honest activation and the mean lying activation:

\[r^{(l)}=h_{I}^{(l)}-l_{I}^{(l)}\] (5)

### Applying Steering Vector

'Honest addition'.To steer the lying model to become honest, we add the 'honest direction' as the steering vector to the lying activations. This is a form of activation addition Turner et al. (2024).

Given a difference-in-means vector ('honest direction') extracted form layer \(l\), we add the difference-in-means vector to the residual stream activations response to the lying prompt to shift them closer to the mean honest activation:

\[x^{(l)^{\prime}}\to x^{(l)}+\alpha\cdot r^{(l)}\] (6)

where \(r^{(l)}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}}\) is the 'honest direction' extracted from layer \(l\), \(x^{(l)}\) is the residual stream activations from the same layer \(l\) and \(\alpha\) is the scaling factor. We find that a scaling factor of 1 is enough to steer the lying model to become honest across all models tested.

Following Arditi et al. (2024) the steering vector extracted from layer \(l\) is applied _only at layer \(l\)_, and _across all token positions_ during generation.

### Contrastive activation patching

Contrastive activation patching is used as a causal intervention tool to identify model components responsible for lying. It is a similar type of causal intervention as performed in Meng et al. (2023) and Wang et al. (2022).

Contrastive activations patching consists of three steps:

* 1. **'Honest run'**. First, we cache all activations of the network run when we prompt the model to answer questions in an honest manner.
* 2. **'Lying run'**. Secondly, we cache all activations of the network run when we prompt the model to answer questions in a lying manner.
* 3. **'Patched run'**. Then we run the network where the model is prompted to lie but _replacing_ some activations with the activations from the 'honest run'.

We can then measure the behavior as well as the internal activations of the patched model. Doing this for each node individually locates the nodes that explain why model behavior is different in the 'honest run' and 'lying run'.

## 4 Results

### Lying scales with model size

We focus on studying one type of deception where models give wrong answers to a question even though they 'know' the correct answer (knowingly lie). To do so, we first filter out a set of questions (Azaria and Mitchell, 2023) that the LLMs can answer correctly when prompted to be honest. We then check if they will answer incorrectly when asked to lie.

As has been previously noted (Campbell et al., 2023), inducing lying behavior can be surprisingly challenge and often requires careful prompt engineering. Built on the work of Campbell et al. (2023), we establish a general protocol (detailed description in SS3.1) for inducing a wide range of models to knowingly lie.

Constrained by our carefully designed chatting template, the model first make a true or false judgement for a given statement and then elaborates on the rationale for the judgement. As illustrated in Figure 6, the careful prompting design encourages free generation and enforcing a structure so that the performance can be easily measured by matching to the ground truth label (either "true" or "false"). Detailed evaluation methods are provided in Appendix A.2 and further evaluation results are presented in Appendix E.

We evaluate the performance (as measured by accuracy in judging if the statements are true or false) across 20 chat models from 4 model families with sizes ranging from 1.5 to 70 billion (see Appendix A.1 for the full list of of models tested). We show that lying is an emergent capacity that scales with model size. In general, within each model family, the small models do not lie and the larger models could knowingly lie (high accuracy when asked to be honest and low accuracy when prompted to lie, Figure 1).

### Iterative Refinement Stages of Deception

Performing PCA on the residual stream activation (see description in SS3.2), we compare the change in layer-by-layer representation patterns when models are prompt to lie VS be honest. The latent representation of lying goes through three iterative refinement stages (Lad et al., 2024). For illustration purposes, we include the latent representations of L1lam-3-8b-chat as an example in Figure 2. It is representative for all models that are capable of lying. The complete layer-by-layer representations of other models are shown in Appendix H.1.

Stage 1: Separation of honest and lying instruction.Activations to the honest (yellow) and lying (blue) prompts are initially intermingled but start to form very distinctive clusters during stage one (layer 7, Figure 2A).

Stage 2: Separation of truth and falsehood.Second state of the iterative refinement starts when the true (star) and false (circle) statements form distinct clusters (layer 12, Figure 2B). This observation is consistent with the emergence of 'truth direction' reported by Marks & Tegmark (2024).

Stage 3: 'Rotation' of the 'truth directions'.The 'truth directions' (see definition in SS3.2) of the honest and lying persona gradually 'rotate' (Figure 2C): starting from being parallel (cosine similarity \(\approx 1\)) to orthogonal (cosine similarity \(\approx 0\)), and finally close to anti-parallel (cos similarity \(\approx-1\)). To quantify the change in stage 3, we measure the cosine similarity between the 'truth directions' when prompted to be honest v.s. lying and plot its change across layers (Figure 2D).

B and E: head-by-head patching results for all attention heads across layers. C and F: the sparse set of layers with the most steep increase in average logit different (ALD) overlap with the layers with sharpest decrease in cosine similarity. Top panels: Llama-3-8b-Instruct, bottom panels: Gemma-2-9b-it.

Figure 3: **Stage 3 progression predicts if a model can knowingly lie.** A&B: example model that cannot lie. D&E: example model that knowingly lie. C: correlation between stage 3 progress and lying score for all of the 20 models tested (the size of the dot denotes the size of the model).

Following the method described in Appendix 3.5, we present results for two levels of patching: layer-by-layer and head-by-head patching. For the layer-by-layer patching, the representations (residual stream activations) from the 'honest run' are patched to the 'lying run' for each token position (of the prompt) across all layers of the model. The average logit difference (ALD) across 100 statements is used as a proxy for the causal contribution of each layer. As noted in previous works Marks & Tegmark (2024); Tigges et al. (2023), both Llama and Gemma models display the "summarization" behavior where information relevant to the full statement is represented at the end-of-sentence token (last token of the prompt). This pattern is consistent for both Llama and Gemma models (Figure 4A&D). Head-level patching further reveals a sparse set of attention heads causally responsible for lying (Figure 4B&E). Patching results for MLP and attention outputs are presented in Figure 9. Attention pattern for heads with top ALD can be found in Appendix F.2.

Importantly, the set of layers with the largest increase in patching contribution (steep increase in ALD, see Appendix A.3.1) corresponds to the stage three layers where 'truth directions' rotate with respect to each other (cosine similarity between the 'truth directions' sharply decrease). This is consistent with the result in SS4.3where progression during stage 3 best predicts whether a model is capable of lying.

### Model Steering: from lying to honesty

The simple linear structure in the latent representation (Nanda et al., 2023b) allows us to steer the models with linear vectors. Inspired by recent development in contrasting representation steering (Zou et al., 2023; Arditi et al., 2024; Turner et al., 2024; Rimsky et al., 2024), we steer the lying model to become honest by adding the 'honest direction' to the residual stream activation.

Using contrastive activation steering, we successfully steer all lying models to be honest (Figure 5A). Furthermore, there exists a critical window for steering to be effective. _Only_ steering the layers from the third stage ('rotation' layers) effectively reduces lying, further supporting the argument that

Figure 5: **Only steering the third stage layers effectively reduces lying.** A: adding the ‘honest direction’ to the residual stream activation of the lying models can effectively reduce lying across models from different model families. B: only steering the layers from the third stage (green dash line) can increase the model performance in answering the true/false questions. C: only steering the third stage layers could effectively prevent the rotation of ‘truth directions’.

stage three layers are responsible for lying (Figure 5B). To visualize the effect of steering the stage three layers, we plot the cosine similarity change across layers when applying the steering vector to each individual layer (Figure 5C). Only steering the third stage layers successfully prevent the 'truth directions' from rotating against each other (cosine similarity remain close to 1 after steering). Applying steering vector either before or after the third stage is ineffective.

Discussions on limitations and future work are presented in Appendix C.

## Appendix A Additional Information on Methodology

### Data and models

Data.We compile a filtered version of the true/false dataset from Azaria & Mitchell (2023). We only use statements related to scientific facts.

Models.To access the universality of our results, we test a diverse set of chat models with safety training. All models included in the study are listed here:

### Deception evaluation

Our careful prompting design encourages free generation as well as enforcing a structure so that the performance can be easily measured by matching to the ground-truth label (either "true" or "false"). Crucially, the _first 20 tokens_ (instead of only the first token) are evaluated and matched to the ground-truth label. This is because we notice that LLMs tend to inject stylistic words rather than immediately answer "true" or "false". For example, Llama-2-7B-Chat model tend to insert "..."wink wink*..." before stating if the answer is "true" or "false". For quantification of model performance, see SSE.

### Patching evaluation

#### a.3.1 Average Logit Difference

We measure the _logit difference_ (LD) between the logit values placed on the 'true' versus 'false' token, depending on the ground truth label (the ground truth label is either 'true' or 'false'):

\[LD=Logit(ground\_truth\_label)-Logit(incorrect\_label)\] (7)

We then normalize the logit difference (LD) to construct our _logit difference metric_ (LDM):

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c c c||} \hline Model Family & Model Size & Reference \\ \hline \hline Qwen-1-Chat & 1.8B, 14B, 72B & Bai et al. (2023) \\ Qwen-2-Chat & 1.5B, 7B, 57B & Yang et al. (2024) \\ Yi-1-Chat & 7B, 34B & Ai et al. (2024) \\ Yi-1.5-Chat & 6B, 9B, 34B & Ai et al. (2024) \\ Gemma-1-it & 2B, 7B & Team et al. (2024a) \\ Gemma-2-it & 2B, 9B, 27B & Team et al. (2024b) \\ Llama-2-Chat & 2B, 13B, 70B & Touvron et al. (2023) \\ Llama-3-Instruct & 8B, 70B & Team et al. (2024a) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: A diverse set up models used in the paper.

Figure 6: Introducing a simple yet general protocol (§3.1) to induce a wide range of large conversational models to knowingly lie. The example answers shown here are generated by Llama-3-8b-chat.

\[LDM=\frac{LD(patched\_run)-LD(lie\_run)}{LD(honest\_run)-LD(lie\_run)}\] (8)

A value of 0 means no change from the performance on the 'lying run' and a value of 1 means the performance of the 'honest run' has been completely recovered. Averaging over a sample of 100 statements, we obtain _average logit difference (ALD)_.

Note: patching experiments are computational costly to run (major bottleneck is GPU memory for caching the latent state activations). The smallest Qwen and Yi models that can successfully lie are 57B and 34B respectively, they are too large for our GPU device (a single a100 GPU). Therefore, only Llama and Gemma models are included for the patching experiments.

## Appendix B Related Work

### Internal States of Lying

Recent work has proposed that LLMs have a internal representation of truthfulness, opening up opportunities to detect and diagnose deception from the latent representations.

Burns et al. (2024) developed an unsupervised probe called Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS) for predicting a model's latent representation of truth, independent of what a model outputs, without using any supervision. Azaria & Mitchell (2023) introduced a supervised probe by training classifiers on LLM hidden layers to detect whether a statement generated by an LLM is truthful or not. Our work build on this work, utilizing their true-false statements as our primary dataset.

Levinstein & Herrmann (2023) raise concerns that probes fail to generalize in basic ways. They find that the supervised probes developed by Azaria & Mitchell (2023) fail to generalize well to negations of statements they were trained on. And the CCS probes (Burns et al., 2024) achieve low loss but poor accuracy, often just learning to detect negations rather than truth. They conclude that there is still no reliable and generalizable 'lie detector' for LLMs, which further motives our work.

Zou et al. (2023) propose using Linear Artificial Tomography (LAT) to detect lying. Similar to our approach, LAT applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the collected neural activities. Also using PCA, Marks & Tegmark (2024) reveal that true/false statement representations are linealy represented in model internals.

Campbell et al. (2023) used a filtered dataset of true/false questions from Azaria & Mitchell (2023) and developed prompts to induce lying. They then employed linear probing and activation patching to localize lying. Their work only focus on deception in Llama-2-70b-chat model.

Our work build on but extend beyond these works. First, we create a simple yet general protocol to induce lying in a diverse set of models (20 models form 4 models families). Second, we characterize a _universal_ pattern in latent representation structure and provide a metric that could predict which models can lie and which cannot. Third, we integrate a battery of interpretability tools including activation patching and contrastive activation steering to causally identify key model components and effectively steer the models to reduce lying.

## Appendix C Conclusions & Future Work

In this paper, we dissect and control a key safety related problem in LLMs, i.e., the generation of incorrect and false information. Using a simple yet general protocol, we induce a wide range of large language models to lie. By dissecting the latent activations, we demonstrate how LLMs could knowingly lie through a three-stage iterative refinement process. We confirm that LLMs possess an internal representation of truth at early-middle layers, evident by the emergence of 'truth directions' at the second stage. Interesting, the 'truth directions' subsequently 'rotate' with respect to each other during the third stage.

Importantly, we confirm that this 'rotation' motif is _universal_ - it is present in all models that are capable of lying and absent in all models that cannot lie. Combining causal intervention (patching)and steering (contrastive activation steering) tools, we further confirm that the sparse set of layers during stage three are causally responsible for lying.

### Limitation and Future Direction

One limitation of the current set up is we only investigate one type of deception - instructed lying - where the models are prompted to knowingly lie. Deception is a rich phenomenon with many different facets. Deception in LLMs can emerge without instruction through mimicking common human misconceptions (imitative lying) (Lin et al., 2022) or through learning in the case of deceptive instrumental alignment (Hubinger et al., 2024). Deception may also be unintentional and emerge through hallucinations (Maynez et al., 2020). Our paper lay the groundwork to dissect one kind of deception in a wide range of large conversational models, we leave further investigation of other important deception variants for future work.

Further mechanistic interpretability work could elucidate the mechanism of the attention heads and further dissect the mechanism underlying attention heads that are responsible for the 'rotation' operation.
