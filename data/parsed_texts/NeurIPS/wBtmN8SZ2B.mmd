###### Abstract

Most real-world datasets consist of a natural hierarchy between classes or an inherent label structure that is either already available or can be constructed cheaply. However, most existing representation learning methods ignore this hierarchy, treating labels as permutation invariant. Recent work [104] proposes using this structured information explicitly, but the use of Euclidean distance may distort the underlying semantic context [8]. In this work, motivated by the advantage of hyperbolic spaces in modeling hierarchical relationships, we propose a novel approach HypStructure: a Hyperbolic Structured regularization approach to accurately embed the label hierarchy into the learned representations. HypStructure is a simple-yet-effective regularizer that consists of a hyperbolic tree-based representation loss along with a centering loss. It can be combined with any standard task loss to learn _hierarchy-informed_ features. Extensive experiments on several large-scale vision benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of HypStructure in reducing distortion and boosting generalization performance, especially under low-dimensional scenarios. For a better understanding of structured representation, we perform an eigenvalue analysis that links the representation geometry to improved Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection performance seen empirically. The code is available at https://github.com/uiuctml/HypStructure.

## 1 Introduction

Real-world datasets, such as ImageNet [72] and CIFAR [45], often exhibit a natural hierarchy or an inherent label structure that describes a structured relationship between different classes in the data. In the absence of an existing hierarchy, it is often possible to cheaply construct or infer this hierarchy from the label space directly [64]. However, the majority of existing representation learning methods [43, 7, 95, 29, 87, 33, 27, 39] treat the labels as permutation invariant, ignoring this semantically-rich hierarchical label information. Recently, Zeng et al. [104] offer a promising approach to embed the tree-hierarchy explicitly in representation learning using a tree-metric-based regularizer, leading to improvements in generalization performance. The approach uses a computation of shortest paths between two classes in the tree hierarchy to enforce the same structure in the feature space, by means of a **C**ophenetic **C**orrelation **C**officient (CPCC) [79] based regularizer. However, their approach uses the \(\ell_{2}\) distance in the Euclidean space, distorting the parent-child representations in the hierarchy [70, 50] owing to the bounded dimensionality of the Euclidean space [8].

Hyperbolic geometry has recently gained growing interest in the field of representation learning [66; 67]. Hyperbolic spaces can be viewed as the continuous analog of a tree, allowing for embedding tree-like data in finite dimensions with minimal distortion [44; 73; 75; 24]. Unlike Euclidean spaces with zero curvature and spherical spaces with positive curvature, the hyperbolic spaces have negative curvature enabling the length to grow exponentially with its radius. Owing to these advantages, hyperbolic geometry has been used for various applications such as natural language processing [52; 73; 16], image classification [40; 103; 18], object detection [46; 21], action retrieval [55], and hierarchical clustering [100]. However, the aim of using hyperbolic geometry in these approaches is often to _implicitly_ leverage the hierarchical nature of the data.

In this work, given a label hierarchy, we argue that accurately and _explicitly_ embedding the hierarchical information into the representation space has several benefits, and for this purpose, we propose HypStructure, a hyperbolic label-structure based regularization approach that extends the proposed methodology in [104] for semantically structured learning in the hyperbolic space. HypStructure can be easily combined with any standard task loss for optimization, and enables the learning of discriminative and _hierarchy-informed_ features. In summary, our contributions are as follows:

* We propose HypStructure and demonstrate its effectiveness in the supervised hierarchical classification tasks on three real-world vision benchmark datasets, and show that our proposed approach is effective in both training from scratch, or fine-tuning if there are resource constraints.
* We qualitatively and quantitatively assess the nature of the learned representations and demonstrate that along with the performance gains, using HypStructure as a regularizer leads to more interpretable as well as tree-like representations as a side benefit. The low-dimensional representative capacity of hyperbolic geometry is well-known [6], and interestingly, we observe that training with HypStructure allows for learning extremely low-dimensional representations with distortion values lower than even their corresponding high-dimensional Euclidean counterparts.
* We argue that representations learned with an underlying hierarchical structure are beneficial not only for the in-distribution (ID) classification tasks but also for Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection tasks. We empirically demonstrate that learning ID representations with HypStructure leads to improved OOD detection on 9 real-world OOD datasets without sacrificing ID accuracy [106].
* Inspired by the improvements in OOD detection, we provide a formal analysis of the eigenspectrum of the in-distribution _hierarchy-informed_ features learned with CPCC-style structured regularization methods, thus leading to a better understanding of the behavior of structured representations in general.

## 2 Preliminaries

In this section, we first provide a background of structured representation learning and then discuss the limited representation capacity of the Euclidean space for hierarchical information, which serves as the primary motivation for our work.

### Background

Structured representation learning [104] breaks the permutation invariance of flat representation learning by incorporating a hierarchical regularization term with a standard classification loss. The regularization term is specifically designed to enforce class-conditioned grouping or partitioning in the feature space, based on a given hierarchy.

More specifically, given a weighted tree \(\mathcal{T}=(V,E,e)\) with vertices \(V\), edges \(E\) and edge weights \(e\), let us compute a tree metric \(d_{\mathcal{T}}\) for any pair of nodes \(v,v^{\prime}\in V\), as the weighted length of the shortest path in \(\mathcal{T}\) between \(v\) and \(v^{\prime}\). For a real world dataset \(\mathcal{D}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\), we can specify a _label tree_\(\mathcal{T}\) where a node \(v_{i}\in V\), \(v_{i}\) corresponds to a subset of classes, and \(\mathcal{D}_{i}\subseteq\mathcal{D}\) denote the subset of data points with class label \(v_{i}\). We denote dataset distance between \(\mathcal{D}_{i}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{j}\) as \(\rho(v_{i},v_{j})=d\left(\mathcal{D}_{i},\mathcal{D}_{j}\right)\), where \(d(\cdot,\cdot)\) is any distance metric in the feature space, varied by design.

With a collection of tree metric \(d_{\mathcal{T}}\) and dataset distances \(\rho\), we can use the Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient (CPCC) [79], inherently a Pearson's correlation coefficient, to evaluate the correspondence between the nodes of the tree, and the features in the representation space. Let \(\overline{d_{\mathcal{T}}},\overline{\rho}\) denote the mean of the collection of distances, then CPCC is defined as

\[\text{CPCC}(d_{\mathcal{T}},\rho):=\frac{\sum_{i<j}(d_{\mathcal{T}}(v_{i},v_{j} )-\overline{d_{\mathcal{T}}})(\rho(v_{i},v_{j})-\overline{\rho})}{(\sum_{i<j} (d_{\mathcal{T}}(v_{i},v_{j})-\overline{d_{\mathcal{T}}})^{2})^{1/2}(\sum_{i<j }(\rho(v_{i},v_{j})-\overline{\rho})^{2})^{1/2}}.\] (1)

For the supervised classification task, we consider the training set \(\mathcal{D}_{\text{tr}}^{\text{in}}=\{(\bm{x}_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\) and we aim to learn the network parameter \(\theta\) for a feature encoder \(f_{\theta}:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Z}\), where \(\mathcal{Z}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}\) denotes the representation/feature space. For structured representation learning, the feature encoder is usually followed by a classifier \(g_{w}\), and the parameters \(\theta,w\) are learnt by minimizing \(\mathcal{L}\) along with a standard _flat_ (non-hierarchical) classification loss, for instance, Cross-Entropy (CE) or Supervised Contrastive (SupCon) [39] loss, with the structured regularization term as:

\[\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})=\sum_{(\bm{x},y)\in\mathcal{D}}\ell_{\text{Flat}}(\bm {x},y,\theta,w)-\alpha\cdot\text{CPCC}(d_{\mathcal{T}},\rho).\] (2)

Using a composite objective as defined in Equation (2), we can enforce the distance relationship between a pair of representations in the feature space, to behave similarly to the tree metric between the same vertices. For instance, consider a simple label tree with a root node, a coarse level, and a fine level, where subsets of fine classes share the same coarse parent. For this hierarchy, we would expect the fine classes of the same parents (e.g., _apple_ and _banana_ are _fruits_) to have closer representations in the feature space, whereas fine classes with different coarse parents (e.g., an _apple_ is a _fruit_ and a _tulip_ is a _flower_) should be further apart. The learned structure-informed representations reflect these hierarchical relationships and lead to interpretable features with better generalization [104].

### \(\ell_{2}\)-Cpcc

Equation (1) offers the flexibility of designing a metric to measure the similarity between two data subsets, and [104] define the _Euclidean dataset distance_ as \(\rho_{\ell_{2}}(\mathcal{D}_{i},\mathcal{D}_{j}):=\|\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{i} |}\sum_{\bm{x}\in\mathcal{D}_{i}}f(\bm{x})-\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{j}|}\sum_{ \bm{x}^{\prime}\in\mathcal{D}_{j}}f(\bm{x}^{\prime})\|_{2}\). The distance between datasets is thus the \(\ell_{2}\) distance between two Euclidean _centroids_ of their class-conditioned representations, which is unsuitable for modeling _tree-like_ data [8]. Additionally, this regularization approach in [104] is applied only to the leaf nodes of \(\mathcal{T}\) for efficiency. However, this leaf-only formulation of the CPCC offers an _approximation_ of the structured information, since the distance between non-leaf nodes is not restricted explicitly by the regularization. This approximation, therefore, leads to a loss of information contained in the original hierarchy \(\mathcal{T}\). Actually, it is impossible to embed \(d_{\mathcal{T}}\) into \(\ell_{2}\) exactly. Or more formally, there exists no bijection \(\varphi\) such that \(d_{\mathcal{T}}(\varphi(\bm{z}_{i}),\varphi(\bm{z}_{j}))=\|\bm{z}_{i}-\bm{z}_{j }\|_{2}\) irrespective of how large the feature dimension \(d\) is. We provide two such examples for a toy label tree in Figure 1, below.

**Example 1.** We intend to embed all nodes in \(\mathcal{T}\), including purple internal nodes. Notice that \(G,C,D,E\) is a star graph centered at \(G\). Since \(CG=DG=1,CD=2\), by triangle inequality \(C,D,G\) must be on the same line where \(G\) is the center of \(CD\). Similarly, \(G\) must be at the center of \(DE\). Hence, the location of \(E\) must be at \(C\), which contradicts the uniqueness of all nodes in \(\mathcal{T}\).

**Example 2.** As an easier problem, let us only embed leaf nodes into the Euclidean space as shown in Figure 1. Since \(CD=DE=CE=2\), they must be on a plane with an equilateral triangle \(\triangle_{CDE}\) in Euclidean geometry. Then all the green classes have the same distance \(4\) to each yellow class. Therefore, \(A,B\) must be on the line the plane with \(O\), which is the barycenter of \(\triangle_{CDE}\). Due to the uniqueness and symmetry of \(A,B\), we must have \(AO=BO=1\) to satisfy \(AB=2\). \(AO=1,OE=\frac{2\sqrt{3}}{3},AE=4\) which contradicts the Pythagorean Theorem.

Since we cannot embed an arbitrary tree \(\mathcal{T}\) into \(\ell_{2}\) without distortion, it would also affect the optimization of the \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC in a classification problem, where the tree weights encode knowledge

Figure 1: (left) An unweighted label tree with two coarse nodes: \(F\), \(G\). \(F\) contains two fine classes \(A,B\) and \(G\) contains three fine classes \(C,D,E\). We cannot embed this in \(\ell_{2}\) exactly (right).

of class similarity. To verify our claims, we consider the optimization of \(512\)-dimensional \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC structured representations for CIFAR10 [45]. The CIFAR10 dataset consists of a small label hierarchy as shown in Figure 2 (left). The optimal CPCC is achieved when each tree metric value corresponds to a single \(\rho_{\ell_{2}}\). However, in Figure 2 (right), even with an optimization of the \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC loss for the entire tree, we observe a sub-optimal train CPCC less than \(1\), where the distance between two coarse nodes, _transportation_ and _animal_, is far away from the desired solution. Furthermore, optimization of the CPCC loss for only the leaf nodes, leads to an even larger distortion of the tree metrics.

## 3 Methodology

Hyperbolic spaces are more suitable for embedding hierarchical relationships with low distortion [75] and low dimensions. Hence, motivated by the aforementioned challenges, we propose a **Hyperbolic Structured** regularizer for _hierarchy-informed_ representation learning. We begin with the basics of hyperbolic geometry, followed by the detailed methodology of our proposed approach.

### Hyperbolic Geometry

Hyperbolic spaces are non-Euclidean spaces with negative curvature where given a fixed point and a line, there exist infinitely many parallel lines that can pass through this point. There are several commonly used isometric hyperbolic models [4]. For this work, we mainly use the Poincare Ball model.

**Definition 3.1** (Manifold).: A _manifold_\(\mathcal{M}\) is a set of points \(\bm{z}\) that are locally Euclidean. Every point \(\bm{z}\) of the manifold \(\mathcal{M}\) is attached to a _tangent space_\(\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathcal{M}\), which is a vector space over the reals of the same dimensionality as \(\mathcal{M}\) that contain all the possible directions that can tangentially pass through \(\bm{z}\).

**Definition 3.2** (Poincare Ball Model).: Given \(c\) as a constant, the Poincare ball model \((\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d},\mathfrak{g}_{B})\) is defined by a manifold of an open ball \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}=\{\bm{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}:c\|\bm{z}\|^{2}<1\}\) and metric tensor \(\mathfrak{g}_{B}\) that defines an inner product of \(\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\). The model is equipped with the distance [88] as

\[d_{\mathbb{B}_{c}}(\bm{z}_{1},\bm{z}_{2})=\frac{2}{\sqrt{c}}\tanh^{-1}\left( \sqrt{c}\left\|\frac{-(1+2c\left\langle-\bm{z}_{1},\bm{z}_{2}\right\rangle+c \|\bm{z}_{2}\|^{2})\bm{z}_{1}+(1-c\|\bm{z}_{1}\|^{2})\bm{z}_{2}}{1-2c\left\langle \bm{z}_{1},\bm{z}_{2}\right\rangle+c^{2}\|\bm{z}_{1}\|^{2}\|\bm{z}_{2}\|^{2}} \right\|\right).\] (3)

For \(c\to 0\), we can recover the properties of the Euclidean geometry since \(\lim_{c\to 0}d_{\mathbb{B}_{c}}(\bm{z}_{1},\bm{z}_{2})=2\|\bm{z}_{1}-\bm{z}_{2}\|\). Since \(\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\), we can connect vectors in Euclidean space and hyperbolic space with the bijection between \(\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) and \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\)[88]. For \(\bm{z}=\bm{0}\), the _exponential map_\(\exp_{\bm{0}}^{c}:\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\to\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) and _logarithm map_\(\log_{\bm{0}}^{c}:\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\to\mathcal{T}_{\bm{z}}\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) have the closed form of

\[\exp_{\bm{0}}^{c}(\bm{v})=\tanh\left(\sqrt{c}\|\bm{v}\|\right)\frac{\bm{v}}{ \sqrt{c}\|\bm{v}\|},\quad\log_{\bm{0}}^{c}(\bm{u})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}\tanh^{-1 }\left(\sqrt{c}\|\bm{u}\|\right)\frac{\bm{u}}{\|\bm{u}\|}.\] (4)

Alternatively, to guarantee the correctness of Poincare distance computation, we can also process any Euclidean vector with a clipping module [66]

\[\text{clip}^{c}(\bm{v})=\begin{cases}\bm{v},&\text{if }\|\bm{v}\|<1/\sqrt{c}\\ \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{c}}-\epsilon\right)\frac{\bm{v}}{\|\bm{v}\|},&\text{ otherwise}\end{cases},\] (5)

so the clipped vector is within the Poincare disk. We set \(\epsilon\) as a small positive number in practice.

Figure 3: Lines on different models for \(2\)-dimensional hyperbolic space.

Figure 2: Using \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC for structured representation on CIFAR10. CIFAR10 hierarchy (left) has a three level structure with \(13\) vertices. For a \(512\)-dimensional embedding, we apply \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC either for the full tree (middle) or the leaf nodes only (right) and plot the ground truth tree metric against pairwise Euclidean centroid distances of the learnt representation. The optimal train CPCC is \(1\).

**Definition 3.3** (Klein Model).: Klein model \((\mathbb{K}_{c}^{d},\mathfrak{g}_{K})\) consists of an \(1/\sqrt{c}\)-radius open ball \(\mathbb{K}_{c}^{d}=\{\bm{z}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}:c\|\bm{z}\|^{2}<1\}\) and a metric tensor \(\mathfrak{g}_{K}\) different from \(\mathfrak{g}_{B}\). Similar to the mean computation in Euclidean space, let \(\gamma_{i}=1/\sqrt{1-c\|\bm{z}_{i}\|^{2}}\), the Einstein midpoint of a group of Klein vectors \(\bm{z}_{1},\ldots\bm{z}_{n}\in\mathbb{K}_{c}^{d}\) has a simple expression of a weighted average

\[\text{HypAve}_{K}(\bm{z}_{1},\ldots\bm{z}_{n})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{i}\bm{z}_ {i}\bigg{/}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{i}.\] (6)

We illustrate the relationship between the different hyperbolic models in Figure 3. The hyperboloid space models \(d\)-dimensional hyperbolic geometry on a \(d+1\)-dimensional space. When \(d=2\), the Klein model is the tangent plane of the hyperboloid model at \((0,0,1)\), and the Poincare disk shares the same support as the Klein disk, although shifted downwards and centered at the origin. Given a triangle on the hyperboloid model, its projection on the Klein model preserves the straight sides, but the projection of a line on the Poincare model is a part of a circular arc or the diameter of the disk. Let \(\bm{z}_{\mathbb{B}},\bm{z}_{\mathbb{K}}\) be coordinates of \(\bm{z}\) under Poincare and Klein model respectively, the prototype operations on \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) require transformations between \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) and \(\mathbb{K}_{c}^{d}\) as

\[\bm{z}_{\mathbb{B}}=\frac{\bm{z}_{\mathbb{K}}}{1+\sqrt{1-c\|\bm{z}_{\mathbb{K }}\|^{2}}},\quad\bm{z}_{\mathbb{K}}=\frac{2\bm{z}_{\mathbb{B}}}{1+c\|\bm{z}_{ \mathbb{B}}\|^{2}}.\] (7)

For example, in Figure 3, \(O^{\prime}\) is the HypAve\({}_{K}\) of \(A^{\prime},B^{\prime},C^{\prime}\), and can be mapped back to the Poincare disk to get the Poincare prototype (HypAve\({}_{\mathbb{B}}\)) \(O\) of points \(A,B,C\) by a change of coordinates.

### HypStructure: Hyperbolic Structured Regularization

At a high level, HypStructure uses a combination of two losses: a Hyperbolic Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient Loss (HypCPCC)), and a Hyperbolic centering loss (HypCenter) for embedding the hierarchy in the representation space. Below we describe the two components of HypStructure. The pseudocode of HypStructure is shown in Algorithm 1 in Appendix B.2.

**HypCPCC (Hyperbolic Cophenetic Correlation Coefficient):** We extend the \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC methodology in [104] to the hyperbolic space in HypCPCC. Three major steps of HypCPCC are (i) map Euclidean vectors to Poincare space (ii) compute class prototypes (iii) use Poincare distance for CPCC. Specifically, we first project each \(\bm{z}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) to \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\), and compute the Poincare centroid for each vertex of \(\mathcal{T}\) using hyperbolic averaging as shown in Equation (6) and Equation (7). Alternatively, we can also compute Euclidean centroids \(\overline{\bm{z}}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{D}_{i}|}\sum_{\bm{z}\in\mathcal{D}_{i}} \bm{z}\) for each vertex, and project each \(\overline{\bm{z}}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) to \(\mathbb{B}_{c}^{d}\) either by \(\exp_{0}^{\mathrm{c}}\) or clip\({}^{c}\). After the computation of hyperbolic centroids, we use the pairwise distances between all vertex pairs in \(\mathcal{T}\) in the Poincare ball, to compute the HypCPCC loss using Equation (1) by setting \(\rho=d_{\mathbb{B}_{c}}\).

**HypCenter (Hyperbolic Centering):** Inspired by Sarkar's low-distortion construction [75] that places the root node of a tree at the origin, we propose a centering loss for this positioning, that enforces the representation of the root node to be close to the center of the Poincare disk, and the representations of its children to be closer to the border of Poincare disk. We enforce this constraint by minimizing the norm of the hyperbolic representation of the root node as \(\ell_{\text{center}}=\|\text{HypAve}_{B}(\exp_{0}^{\mathrm{c}}(\bm{z}_{1}), \ldots,\exp_{0}^{\mathrm{c}}(\bm{z}_{N}))\|\). Alternatively, for centroids computed in the Euclidean space and mapped to the Poincare disk, we minimize \(\ell_{\text{center}}=\left\|1/N\sum_{i=1}^{N}f_{\theta}(\bm{x}_{i})\right\|\) directly due to the monotonicity of \(\tanh(\cdot)\) in the exponential map.

Finally, for \(\alpha,\beta>0\), we can learn the _hierarchy-informed_ representations by minimizing

\[\mathcal{L}(\mathcal{D})=\sum_{(\bm{x},y)\in\mathcal{D}}\ell_{\text{Flat}}(\bm {x},y,\theta)-\alpha\cdot\text{HypCPCC}(d_{\mathcal{T}},d_{\mathbb{B}_{c}})+ \beta\cdot\ell_{\text{center}}(\bm{x},\theta),\] (8)

where \(\ell_{\text{Flat}}\) is a standard classification loss, such as the CE loss or the SupCon loss.

**Time Complexity:** In a batch computation setting with a batch size \(b\) and the number of classes (leaf nodes) as \(k\), the computational complexity for a HypStructure computation to embed the full tree will still be \(O(d\cdot\min\{b^{2},k^{2}\})\), which is the same as the complexity of a Euclidean _leaf-only_ CPCC. The additional knowledge gained from internal nodes allows us to reason about the relationship between higher-level concepts, and the hyperbolic representations help in achieving a low distortion of hierarchical information for better performance in downstream tasks.

Experiments

We conduct extensive experiments on several large-scale image benchmark datasets to evaluate the performance of HypStructure as compared to the Flat and \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC baselines for hierarchy embedding, classification, and OOD detection tasks.

Datasets and SetupFollowing the common benchmarks in the literature, we consider three real-world vision datasets, namely CIFAR10, CIFAR100 [45] and ImageNet100 [59] for training, which vary in scale, number of classes, and number of images per class. We construct the ImageNet100 dataset by sampling 100 classes from the ImageNet-1k [72] dataset following [59]. For CIFAR100, a three-level hierarchy is available with the dataset release [45]. Since no hierarchy is available for the CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets, we construct a hierarchy for CIFAR10 manually in Figure 2. For ImageNet100, we create a subtree from the WordNet [19] given 100 classes as leaves. More details regarding the datasets, network, training and setup are provided in the Appendix B.4.

### Quality of Hierarchical Information

First, to assess the _tree-likeness_ of the learnt representations, we measure the Gromov's hyperbolicity \(\delta_{rel}\)[23, 1, 38, 40] of the features in Table 1. Lower \(\delta_{rel}\) indicates higher tree-likeness and a perfect tree metric space has \(\delta_{rel}=0\) (more details in Appendix B.5). To also evaluate the correspondence of the feature distances with ground truth tree metrics, we compute CPCC on test sets. We observe that HypStructure reduces distortion of hierarchical information over Flat by upto **59.4%** and over \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC by upto **45.4%**, while also consistently improving the test CPCC for most datasets.

We also perform a qualitative analysis of the learnt representations from HypStructure on the CIFAR10 dataset, and visualize them in a Poincare disk using UMAP [57] in Figure 4(a). We can observe clearly that the samples for fine classes arrange themselves in the Poincare disk based on the hierarchy tree as seen in Figure 2, being closer to the classes which share a _coarse_ class parent.

To examine the impact of feature dimension on the representative capacity of the hyperbolic space, we vary the feature dimension for HypStructure and compute the \(\delta_{rel}\) for each learnt feature. Comparing the distortion of features with the Flat and \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC settings in Figure 4, we observe that \(\delta_{rel}\) decreases consistently with increasing dimensions, implying that high dimension features using HypStructure are more tree-like, and better than Flat and \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCCs' \(512\)-dimension baselines.

### Classification

Following [104], we treat leaf nodes in the hierarchy as _fine_ classes and their parent nodes as _coarse_ classes. To evaluate the quality of the learnt representations, we perform a classification task on the fine and coarse classes using a kNN-classifier following [27, 95, 5, 110] and report the performance on the three datasets in Table 1. We observe that HypStructure leads to upto **2.2%** improvements over Flat and upto **0.8%** improvements over \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC on both fine and coarse accuracy. We also visualize the learnt test features from Flat vs HypStructure on the CIFAR100 dataset using Euclidean t-SNE [89] and show the visualizations in Figure 4(b) and Figure 4(c) respectively. We observe that HypStructure leads to sharper and more discriminative representations in Euclidean space. Additionally, we see that the fine classes belonging to a coarse class (the same shades of colors)

which are semantically closer in the label hierarchy, are grouped closer and more compactly in the feature space as well, as compared to Flat. We also perform evaluations using the linear evaluation protocol [39] and observe an identical trend in the accuracy, we report these results in Appendix C.1.

### OOD Detection

In addition to leveraging the hierarchy explicitly for the purpose of learning tree-like ID representations, we argue that a structured separation of features in the hyperbolic space as enforced by HypStructure is helpful for the OOD detection task as well. To verify our claim, we perform an exhaustive evaluation on 9 real-world OOD datasets and demonstrate that HypStructure leads to improvements in the OOD detection AUROC. We share more details below.

#### 4.3.1 Problem Setting

Out-of-distribution (OOD) data refers to samples that do not belong to the in-distribution (ID) and whose label set is disjoint from \(\mathcal{Y}^{\text{in}}\) and therefore should not be predicted by the model. Therefore the goal of the OOD detection task is to design a methodology that can solve a binary problem of whether an incoming sample \(\bm{x}\in\mathcal{X}\) is from \(P_{\mathcal{X}}\) i.e. \(y\in\mathcal{Y}^{\text{in}}\) (ID) or \(y\notin\mathcal{Y}^{\text{in}}\) (OOD).

**OOD datasets** We evaluate on 5 OOD image datasets when CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 are used as the ID datasets, namely SVHN[65], Places365[109], Textures[9], LSUN[102], and iSUN[99], and 4 large scale OOD test datasets, specifically SUN[102], Places365[109], Textures[9] and iNaturalist[90] when ImageNet100 is used as the ID dataset. This subset of datasets is prepared by [59] and is created with overlapping classes from ImageNet-1k removed from these datasets to ensure there is no overlap in the distributions.

**OOD detection scores** While several scores have been proposed for the task of OOD detection, we evaluate our proposed method using the Mahalanobis score [76], computed by estimating the mean

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

As seen in Figure 6(a), we observe a significant improvement in the OOD detection performance using HypStructure with the Mahalanobis score eq. (9). After training a composite loss with CPCC till convergence, let us denote the matrix of the normalized in-distribution trained feature as \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\). Naturally, we inspect the eigenvalue properties of \(\Sigma\) (i.e, \(Z\)), and observe that \(K=ZZ^{\top}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\) exhibits a hierarchical block structure (Figure 7(a)) where the diagonal blocks have a significantly higher correlation than other off-diagonal values, leading us to the following theorem.

**Theorem 5.1** (**Eigenspectrum of Structured Representation with Balanced Label Tree**).: _Let \(\mathcal{T}\) be a balanced tree with height \(H\), such that each level has \(C_{h}\) nodes, \(h\in[0,H]\). Let us denote each entry of \(K\) as \(r^{h}\) where \(h\) is the height of the lowest common ancestor of the row and the column sample. If \(r^{h}\geq 0,\forall h\), then: (i) For \(h=0\), we have \(C_{0}-C_{1}\) eigenvalues \(\lambda_{0}=1-r^{1}\). (ii) For \(0<h\leq H-1\), we have \(C_{h}-C_{h+1}\) eigenvalues \(\lambda_{h}=\lambda_{h-1}+(r^{h}-r^{h+1})\frac{C_{0}}{C_{h}}\). (iii) The last eigenvalue is \(\lambda_{H}=\lambda_{H-1}+C_{0}r^{H}\)._

We defer the eigenspectrum analysis for an arbitrary label tree to Appendix A. Theorem 5.1 implies a **phase transition pattern** in the eigenspectrum. There always exists a significant gap in the eigenvalues representing each level of nodes in the hierarchy, and the eigenvalues corresponding to the coarsest level are the highest in magnitude. CIFAR100 has a balanced three-level label hierarchy where each coarse label has five fine labels as its children. In Figure 7(b), we visualize the eigenspectrum of CIFAR100 for HypStructure, \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC and the Flat objective. We observe a significant drop in the eigenvalues for features learnt from two hierarchical regularization approaches, \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC and HypStructure, at approximately the 20th largest eigenvector (which corresponds to the number of coarse classes), whereas these phase transitions do not appear for standard flat features. We also observe that the magnitude of coarse eigenvalues are approximately at the same scale.

In summary, Theorem 5.1 helps us to formally characterize the difference between flat and structured representations. CPCC style (eq. (1)) regularization methods can also be treated as dimensionality reduction techniques, where the structured features can be explained mostly by the coarser level features. For the OOD detection setting, this property differentiates the ID and OOD samples at the coarse level itself using a lower number of dimensions, and makes the OOD detection task easier. We visualize the OOD detection AUROC on SVHN (OOD) corresponding to the CIFAR100 (ID) features with the top\(-k\) principal component for different methods, in Figure 7(c). We observe that for features learnt using HypStructure, accurately embedding the hierarchical information leads to the top \(20\) eigenvectors (corresponding to the coarse classes) being the most informative for OOD detection. Recall that CIDER [61] is a state-of-the-art method proposed specifically for improving OOD detection by increasing inter-class dispersion and intra-class compactness. We note that CPCC style (eq. (1)) methods can be seen as a generalization of CIDER on higher-level concepts, where the same rules are applied for coarse labels as well, along with the fine classes. When the ID and OOD distributions are far enough, using coarse level feature might be sufficient for OOD detection.

## 6 Related Work

Learning with Label Hierarchy.Several recent works have explored how to leverage hierarchical information between classes for various purposes such as relational consistency [14], designing specific hierarchical classification architectures [101; 25; 68], hierarchical conditioning of the logits [13], learning order preserving embeddings [15], and improving classification accuracy [91; 86; 48; 49; 108; 34]. The proposed structural regularization framework in [104] offers an interesting approach to embed a tree metric to learn structured representations through an _explicit_ objective term, although they rely on the \(\ell_{2}\) distance, which is less than ideal for learning hierarchies.

Hyperbolic Geometry.[66] first proposed using the hyperbolic space to learn hierarchical representations of symbolic data such as text and graphs by embedding them into a Poincare ball. Since then, the use of hyperbolic geometry has been explored in several different applications. [40] proposed a hyperbolic image embedding for few-shot learning and person re-identification. [20] proposed hyperbolic neural network layers, enabling the development of hybrid architectures such as hyperbolic convolutional neural networks [78], graph convolutional networks [12], hyperbolic variational autoencoders [56] and hyperbolic attention networks [24]. Additionally, these hybrid architectures have also been explored for different tasks such as deep metric learning [18; 100], object detection [46] and natural language processing [16]. There have also been several investigations into the properties of hyperbolic spaces and models such as low distortion [75], small generalization error [84] and representation capacity [62]. However, none of these works have leveraged hyperbolic geometry for _explicitly_ embedding a hierarchy in the representation space via structured regularization, and usually attempt to leverage the underlying hierarchy _implicitly_ using hyperbolic models.

## 7 Discussion and Future Work

In this work, we introduce HypStructure, a simple-yet-effective structural regularization framework for incorporating the label hierarchy into the representation space using hyperbolic geometry. In particular, we demonstrate that accurately embedding the hierarchical relationships leads to empirical improvements in both classification as well as the OOD detection tasks, while also learning _hierarchy-informed_ features that are more interpretable and exhibit less distortion with respect to the label hierarchy. We are also the first to formally characterize properties of _hierarchy-informed_ features via an eigenvalue analysis, and also relate it to the OOD detection task, to the best of our knowledge. We acknowledge that our proposed method depends on the availability or construction of an external hierarchy for computing the HypCPCC objective. If the hierarchy is unavailable or contains noise, this could present challenges. Therefore, it is important to evaluate how injecting noisy hierarchies into CPCC-based methods impacts downstream tasks. While the current work uses the Poincare ball model, exploring the representation trade-offs and empirical performances using other models of hyperbolic geometry in HypStructure, such as the Lorentz model [67] is an interesting future direction. Further theoretical investigation into establishing the error bounds of CPCC style structured regularization objectives is of interest as well.

This appendix is segmented into the following key parts.

1. **Section A** continues the analysis of the eigenspectrum of CPCC-optimized representation matrix and generalizes it for an arbitrary label tree.
2. **Section B** discusses additional details about our proposed method HypStructure, its implementation and broader impact of our work.

3. **Section C** reports ablation studies, detailed results on OOD detection and provides additional experimental results and visualizations not included in the main paper due to lack of space.

## Appendix A Details of Eigenspectrum Analysis

In this section, we first introduce some notations, discuss the setup for our analysis, followed by preliminary lemmas, and then characterize the eigenspectrum of CPCC-based structured representations in Theorem A.2 for an arbitrary label tree and Theorem 5.1 for a balanced tree presented in the main body.

Proof SketchThe proof of Theorem A.2 and Theorem 5.1 relies on the important observation of a _hierarchical_ block structure of the covariance matrix of CPCC-regularized features, as shown in Figure 7(a), which will also be supported by Lemma A.1 and Corollary A.1. Theorem A.1 [3] and Lemma A.2 characterize the eigenvalues of a block correlation matrix induced from a basic tree where the matrix only has three types of values: diagonal values of \(1\)s, one for within group entry, and another for across group entry. Larger within group entries lead to the larger eigenvalues. Theorem A.1 [3] and Lemma A.2 are then used as the base case for the induction proof of Theorem 5.1. For an arbitrary tree, in Theorem A.2, we use Weyl's Theorem [93] to bound the gap between within group entries and across group entries that leads to the phase transition of eigenvalues.

Setup detailsAfter training with the HypStructure loss till convergence, let us denote the feature matrix as \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\), where each row of \(Z\) is a \(d\)-dimensional vector of an in distribution training sample, and the CPCC is maximized to \(1\). We let \(C_{0}=n,C_{1},C_{2},\ldots,C_{H}=1\) be the number of class labels at height \(h\) of the tree \(\mathcal{T}\). Following the standard pre-processing steps in OOD detection [76], we assume that the features are standardized and normalized so that \(\mathbb{E}[Z]=\mathbf{0}\) and \(\|Z_{i}\|_{2}=1,\forall i\). Besides, we assume that in \(\mathcal{T}\), the distance from root node to each leaf node is the same. Otherwise, following [74], we can insert dummy parents or children into the tree to make sure vertices at the same level have similar visual granularity. We then apply CPCC to each node in the extended tree, where each leaf node is one sample. We note that although this is slightly different from the implementation where the leaf nodes are fine class nodes, the distance for samples within fine classes are automatically minimized by classification loss like cross-entropy and supervised contrastive loss.

Given these assumptions, we want to analyze the eigenspectrum of the inverse sample covariance matrix \(\frac{1}{n-1}Z^{\top}Z\), which is the same as investigating the eigenvalues of \(K=ZZ^{\top}\) where \(Z\) is ordered by classes at all levels, i.e., samples having the same fine-grained labels and coarse labels should be placed together. This is because the matrix scaling and permutation will not change the order of singular values.

Since CPCC (eq. (1)) is a correlation coefficient, when it is maximized, the \(n\) by \(n\) pairwise Poincare distance matrix is perfectly correlated with the ground truth pairwise _tree-metric_ matrix, where each entry is the tree distance between two samples on the tree, no matter we apply CPCC to leaves or all vertices. This implies that in the similarity matrix \(K\), the relative order of entries are the opposite of tree matrix, and it is trivial to show it as follows

**Lemma A.1**.: The relative order of entries in \(K\) will be the reverse of the order in tree distance.

Proof.: When \(\|u\|=\|v\|=1\), \(\ell_{2}(u,v)^{2}=\|u-v\|_{2}^{2}=\|u\|^{2}+\|v\|^{2}-2\langle u,v\rangle=2-2 \langle u,v\rangle\). Now considering the CPCC computation, if the CPCC is maximized, the pairwise Euclidean matrix is of

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

**Theorem A.1** ([3]).: Let \(R\) be a \(p\times p\) full-rank correlation matrix that has a \(k\)-group block structure, with groups of size \(p_{i}\) (\(i=1:k\), \(\sum\limits_{i=1}^{k}p_{i}=p\)). Let \(r_{ii}\) be the correlation for any pair of different variables within group \(i\). Let \(r_{ij}\) be the common correlation between any variable in group \(i\) and \(j\). Denote the mean of the \(i\)-th diagonal block of \(R\) by \(\overline{R_{i}}=(1/p_{i})(1+(p_{i}-1)r_{ii})\). Then:

1. \(R\) has \(p_{i}-1\) eigenvalues \(1-r_{ii}\) (\(i=1:k\)).
2. The rest of the eigenvalues are those from \(k\times k\) symmetric matrix \(A\) whose diagonal elements are \(a_{ii}=p_{i}\overline{R_{i}}\) and whose off-diagonal elements are \(a_{ij}=\sqrt{p_{i}\cdot p_{j}}r_{ij}\).

**Lemma A.2**.: Given \(d\) by \(d\) matrix \(M\) where \(M_{ii}=1\), \(\forall i\in[d]\), and \(M_{ij}=p\) otherwise, i.e.,

\[M=\begin{bmatrix}1&p&\dots&\dots&p\\ p&\ddots&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&1&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&\ddots&p\\ p&\dots&\dots&p&1\end{bmatrix}\]

it has eigenvalues \(\lambda_{1}=1+p(d-1)\) and \(\lambda_{2}=\dots=\lambda_{d}=1-p\).

Proof.: Using the definition of eigenvalues, we want to compute the determinant of matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}1-\lambda&p&\dots&\dots&p\\ p&\ddots&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&1-\lambda&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&&\ddots&p\\ p&\dots&\dots&p&1-\lambda\end{bmatrix}\]

Adding the second till the last row to the first row, we have

\[\begin{bmatrix}1-\lambda+(d-1)p&1-\lambda+(d-1)p&\dots&\dots&1-\lambda+(d-1)p \\ p&\ddots&&&&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&1-\lambda&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&&&&\ddots&p\\ p&\dots&\dots&p&1-\lambda\end{bmatrix}\]

Dividing the first row by \(1-\lambda+(d-1)p\), we now have

\[\begin{bmatrix}1&1&\dots&\dots&1\\ p&\ddots&&&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&1-\lambda&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&&&&\ddots&p\\ p&\dots&\dots&p&1-\lambda\end{bmatrix}\]

Figure 9: Subtree corresponds to the shown submatrix of \(K\).

Subtracting the second till the last row by \(p\) times the first row results in an upper triangular matrix

\[\begin{bmatrix}1&1&\cdots&\cdots&1\\ 0&1-\lambda-p&&&0\\ \vdots&&1-\lambda-p&&\vdots\\ \vdots&&&\ddots&0\\ 0&\cdots&\cdots&0&1-\lambda-p\end{bmatrix}\]

Thus, \(\det(M-\lambda I)=(1-\lambda+(d-1)p)(1-\lambda-p)^{d-1}\). 

Notice that Lemma A.2 is a special case of Theorem A.1 where the label tree is a two level basic tree with the root node and \(d\) leaves in the second label all being the direct children of the root node. Now we can leverage Theorem A.1 and Lemma A.2 to investigate the eigenspectrum of \(K\) by proving the following theorem:

**Theorem A.2** (**Eigenspectrum of CPCC-based Structured Representation**).: If \(\mathcal{T}\) is a tree whose root node has height \(H\) where each level has \(C_{h}\) nodes, \(h\in[0,H]\). \(K=ZZ^{\top}\) is a block structured correlation matrix as a result of CPCC optimization, where each off-diagonal entry \(\in[-1,1]\) can be written as \(r^{h}\) and \(h\) is the height of the lowest common ancestor of the \(i\)-th row and the 00\(j\)-th column sample. Let \(\Delta=r^{1}-r^{h}\), \(p_{i},i\in[C_{h}]\) be the number of children for nodes at height \(h\), and \(p_{\text{max}}\) be the maximum. For any \(h\geq 1\), if \(r^{h}\geq M\geq 0\), \(r^{h+1}\leq m\), then

1. We have \(C_{0}-C_{h}\) eigenvalues, that come from the eigenvalues of a \(C_{0}\times C_{0}\) matrix sharing the same \(C_{h}\) of \(p_{i}\times p_{i}\) diagonal blocks from \(K\) subtracting \(r^{h}\), and off diagonal values are all zero.
2. The rest of \(C_{h}\) eigenvalues come from a \(C_{h}\times C_{h}\) matrix, whose diagonal entries are the mean of each \(p_{i}\times p_{i}\) diagonal block from \(K\), and the off diagonal entries are \(\sqrt{p_{i}p_{j}}r_{ij}\) where \(r_{ij}\) is the correlation between node \(i\) and node \(j\) of height \(h\).
3. If \(m\leq\frac{M-2\Delta(p_{\text{max}}-1)}{p_{\text{max}}(C_{h}-1)}\), \(C_{0}-C_{h}\) eigenvalues are all smaller than \(C_{h}\) eigenvalues.

Proof.: Part (i) and (ii) can be extended from the proof of Theorem A.1. Let \(G\) be the \(n\times C_{h}\) matrix where \(G_{ij}=1\) if the \(i\)-th sample is in group \(j\), otherwise \(G_{ij}=0\). For any \(n-C_{h}\) eigenvectors in the orthogonal complement of the column space of \(G\), the eigenvector of \(K\) is also the eigenvector of

\[\begin{bmatrix}K_{1}&\mathbf{0}&\cdots&\mathbf{0}\\ \mathbf{0}&K_{2}&\cdots&\mathbf{0}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \mathbf{0}&\mathbf{0}&\cdots&K_{k}\end{bmatrix}\]

where due to the hierarchical structure of block matrix, \(K_{i}\) has the format of

\[\begin{bmatrix}1-r^{h}&r^{1}-r^{h}&\cdots&r^{j}-r^{h}&0&\cdots&0\\ r^{1}-r^{h}&1-r^{h}&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots&&\vdots\\ r^{j}-r^{h}&0&\cdots&1-r^{h}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0&1-r^{h}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&1-r^{h}\end{bmatrix}\]

The rest of \(C_{h}\) eigenvectors come from the symmetric \(C_{h}\times C_{h}\) matrix \(A=(G^{\top}G)^{-1/2}(G^{\top}KG)(G^{\top}G)^{-1/2}\), by some basica algebra, we know \(a_{ij}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_{i}}}\cdot(\text{sum of all }r_{ij}\text{ entries in }p_{i}\times p_{j}\text{ block})\cdot\frac{1}{\sqrt{p_{j}}}\). For more details, we refer the reader to Theorem 3.1 in [3] where \(C_{1}=k\) using their notation.

Since the largest absolute value of \(K\)'s eigenvalues, is bounded above by the largest row sum of the absolute values of \(K\)[35], first \(n-C_{h}\) eigenvectors are bounded above by \(U=\max_{i}(1-r^{h})+(p_{i}-1)(r^{1}-r^{h})=(1-r^{h})+(p_{\text{max}}-1)\Delta\).

On the other hand, for the rest of \(C_{h}\) eigenvalues, we analyze matrix \(A\):

\[A \leq A_{1}+A_{2}\] \[:=\begin{bmatrix}1+(p_{1}-1)r^{h}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&1+(p_{2}-1)r^{h}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&1+(p_{k}-1)r^{h}\end{bmatrix}\] \[+\begin{bmatrix}(p_{\text{max}}-1)(r^{1}-r^{h})&p_{\text{max}}m& \cdots&p_{\text{max}}m\\ p_{\text{max}}m&(p_{\text{max}}-1)(r^{1}-r^{h})&\cdots&p_{\text{max}}m\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ p_{\text{max}}m&p_{\text{max}}m&\cdots&(p_{\text{max}}-1)(r^{1}-r^{h})\end{bmatrix}\]

The inequality comes from the effect of the maximization of CPCC that \(r^{1}\geq\cdots r^{h}\geq r^{h+1}\geq\cdots r^{H}\) and \(r^{h}\leq m\). The eigenvalues of \(A_{1},A_{2}\) have the analytical form, where \(A_{1}\)'s eigenvalues have the form of \(1+(p_{i}-1)r^{h}\) and \(A_{2}\)'s eigenvalues can be derived by Lemma A.2. By Weyl's inequality [93], the minimum of these \(C_{h}\) eigenvalues is at least \(L=(1+(p_{\text{min}}-1)r^{h})-[(p_{\text{max}}-1)\Delta-p_{\text{max}}m+kp_{ \text{max}}m]\geq(1+(1-1)r^{h})-[(p_{\text{max}}-1)\Delta-p_{\text{max}}m+kp_{ \text{max}}m]\).

To guarantee eigenvalues from Part (ii) are larger, we want \(L\geq U\). We solve this inequality with \(m\), and we will get the desired range of \(m\). 

When \(r^{h}=r^{1}\) in Theorem A.2, we have \(\Delta=0\). Therefore, for a three level basic tree with only \(r^{1},r^{2}\), if \(m\leq M/(p_{\text{max}}(C_{1}-1))\), \(C_{0}-C_{1}\) eigenvalues are all smaller than \(C_{1}\) eigenvalues. In general, we have shown that when \(m\), i.e., the across group similarity is sufficiently small, the eigenvalue gap always exists. When the label tree \(\mathcal{T}\) is balanced, we can further specify the expression of each eigenvalue and the amount of eigenvalue gaps.

We now formally restate the Theorem 4.1 from the main paper and give its proof.

**Theorem 5.1** (**Eigenspectrum of Structured Representation with Balanced Label Tree**).: _Let \(\mathcal{T}\) be a balanced tree with height \(H\), such that each level has \(C_{h}\) nodes, \(h\in[0,H]\). Let us denote each entry of \(K\) as \(r^{h}\) where \(h\) is the height of the lowest common ancestor of the row and the column sample. If \(r^{h}\geq 0,\forall h\), then: (i) For \(h=0\), we have \(C_{0}-C_{1}\) eigenvalues \(\lambda_{0}=1-r^{1}\). (ii) For \(0<h\leq H-1\), we have \(C_{h}-C_{h+1}\) eigenvalues \(\lambda_{h}=\lambda_{h-1}+(r^{h}-r^{h+1})\frac{C_{0}}{C_{h}}\). (iii) The last eigenvalue is \(\lambda_{H}=\lambda_{H-1}+C_{0}r^{H}\)._

Proof.: From Corollary A.1, we know that \(K\in\mathbb{R}^{C_{0}\times C_{0}}\) has a block-wise structure.

Since all statements are presented recursively, we prove the theorem by structural induction on the height of the tree.

The base case is Lemma A.2 with a two level hierarchy tree where only (i) and (iii) are applicable, and \(p=r^{1},C_{0}=d,C_{1}=1\). By Lemma A.2, \(K\) has \(C_{0}-1\) eigenvalues as \(\lambda_{0}=1-r^{1}\), and one eigenvalue as \(\lambda_{1}=1+(C_{0}-1)r^{1}=(1-r^{1})+r^{1}/C_{0}^{-1}\).

Let us now assume that the theorem is true for the balanced tree whose root node is at height \(H-1\). Then if we have a tree with height \(H\). We call the resulting matrix \(K_{H}\).

By the first bullet point of Theorem A.1 we directly get \(\lambda_{0}\) from (i). Then by the second bullet point of Theorem A.1, the rest of the eigenvalues are from the symmetric matrix \(A_{H-1}\in\mathbb{R}^{C_{1}\times C_{1}}\) whose diagonal elements are \(\gamma=1+(C_{0}/C_{1}-1)r^{1}\) and whose off diagonal elements are \(C_{0}/C_{1}\cdot r^{j}\) for \(j\geq 2\).

The key is to observe that \(A_{H-1}\) is still a block structured matrix. After \(A_{H-1}\) is scaled by \(\gamma\), the resulting matrix can be also seen as a result of maximizing CPCC where the off diagonal blocks have smaller values.

Applying the hypothesis induction, we then know the expression of eigenvalues for \(A_{H-1}\) as * we have \(C_{1}-C_{2}\) eigenvalues of the form \[\lambda_{1} =\gamma(1-\frac{r^{2}C_{0}/C_{1}}{\gamma})\] \[=\gamma-\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}r^{2}\] \[=1+(\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}-1)r^{1}-\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}r^{2}\] \[=1-r^{1}+\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}(r^{1}-r^{2})\] \[=\lambda_{0}+\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}(r^{1}-r^{2})\]
* For \(0<h\leq H-2\), we have \(C_{h+1}-C_{h+2}\) eigenvalues of the form \[\lambda_{h+1}-\lambda_{h} =\gamma\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}\left(\frac{r^{h+1}}{\gamma}-\frac{r^{h +2}}{\gamma}\right)\frac{C_{1}}{C_{h+1}}\] \[\lambda_{h+1} =\lambda_{h}+(r^{h+1}-r^{h+2})\frac{C_{0}}{C_{h+1}}\]
* The last eigenvalue is \[\lambda_{H}-\lambda_{H-1} =C_{1}r^{H}/\gamma\cdot\frac{C_{0}}{C_{1}}\gamma\] \[=C_{0}r^{H}\]

Therefore, we proved the theorem by showing the induction step from \(K_{H-1}\) to \(K_{H}\) holds. 

Note that the true symmetric covariance matrix \(K^{\prime}\) might not be having the exact format as \(K\), but it can be seen as a perturbation of \(K\) where \(\|K^{\prime}-K\|\leq\epsilon\), \(\epsilon\) is a small constant. By Weyl's inequality [93], the approximation error of each eigenvalue is bounded by \([\lambda_{i}-\epsilon,\lambda_{i}+\epsilon]\).

## Appendix B Additional Algorithm and Experimental Details

In this section, we first provide an overview of our algorithm, followed by a discussion on the choice of the _flat_ loss and additional experimental details about the training and evaluation metrics.

### Broader Impact Statement

Our work proposes HypStructure, a structured hyperbolic regularization approach to embed hierarchical information into the learnt representations. This provides significant advancements in understanding and utilizing hierarchical real-world data, particularly for tasks such as representation learning, classification and OOD detection, and we recognize both positive societal impacts and potential risks of this work. The ability to better model hierarchical data in a structured and interpretable fashion is particularly helpful for domains such as AI for science and healthcare, where the learnt representations will be more reflective of the underlying relationships in the domain space. Additionally, the low-dimensional capabilities of hyperbolic geometry can lead to gains in computational efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint in large scale machine learning. However, real-world hierarchical data often incorporates existing biases which may be amplified by structured representation learning, and hence it is important to incorporate fairness constraints to mitigate this risk.

### Pseudocode for HypStructure

The training scheme for our HypStructure based structured regularization framework is provided in Algorithm 1. At a high level, in HypStructure, we optimize a combination of the following two losses: (1) a _hyperbolic CPCC_ loss to encourage the representations in the hyperbolic space to correspond with the label hierarchy, (2) a _hyperbolic centering_ loss to position the representation corresponding to the root of the node at the centre of the Poincare ball and the children nodes around it.

### Choice of Flat loss

We use the Supervised Contrastive [39] (SupCon) loss as the first choice for a _flat_ loss in our experimentation. Let \(q_{y}\) be the one-hot vector with the \(y\)-th index as 1. The Cross Entropy (CE) loss, defined between the predictions \(g\circ f_{\theta}(\bm{x})\) and the labels \(y\), as \(\ell_{\text{CE}}(g\circ f(\bm{x}),y):=-\sum_{i\in[k]}q_{i}\log(g(f(\bm{x}))_{i})\) has been used quite extensively in large-scale classification problems in the literature [10; 11; 43; 98]. However, several shortcoming of the CE loss, such as lack of robustness [81; 107] and poor generalization [17; 54] have been discovered in recent research. Contrastive learning has emerged as a viable alternative to the CE loss, to address these shortcomings [7; 95; 29; 87; 33; 27]. The underlying principle for these methods is to _pull_ together embeddings for positive pairs and _push_ apart the embeddings for negative samples, in the feature space. In the absence of labels, positive samples are created by data augmentations of images and negative samples are randomly chosen from the minibatch. However, when the labels are available, the class information can be leveraged to extend this methodology as a Supervised Contrastive loss (SupCon) by _pulling_ together embeddings from the same class, and _pushing_ apart the embeddings from different classes. This offers a more stable solution for a variety of tasks [39; 76; 83].

**Definition B.1** (SupCon Loss).: Given a training sample \(\bm{x}_{i}\), feature encoder \(f_{\theta}(\cdot)\) and a projection head \(h(\cdot)\), we denote the normalized feature representations from the projection head as:

\[u_{i}=\frac{h\left(f_{\theta}(\bm{x}_{i})\right)}{\|h(f_{\theta}(\bm{x}_{i})) \|_{2}},\] (10)

For the \(N\) training samples \(\{(\bm{x}_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\), we denote the training batch of \(2N\) (augmented) pairs as \(\{(\tilde{\bm{x}}_{i},\tilde{y}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{2N}\) and define the SupCon loss as:

\[\ell_{\text{SupCon}}=\frac{1}{2N}\sum_{i=1}^{2N}-\log\frac{\frac{1}{2N_{y_{i}} -1}\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\mathbbm{1}(k\neq i)\mathbbm{1}(\tilde{y}_{k}=\tilde{y}_{i} )e^{\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\cdot\bm{u}_{k}/\tau}}{\sum_{k=1}^{2N}\mathbbm{1}(k\neq i)e^ {\bm{u}_{i}^{T}\cdot\bm{u}_{k}/\tau}},\] (11)

where \(N_{y_{i}}\) refers to the number of images with label \(y_{i}\) in the batch, \(\tau\) is the temperature parameter, \(\cdot\) refers to the inner product, and \(\bm{u}_{i}\) and \(\bm{u}_{k}\) are the normalized feature representations using Equation (10) for \(\tilde{\bm{x}}_{i}\) and \(\tilde{\bm{x}}_{k}\) respectively.

While the numerator in the formulation in Equation (11) only considers the samples (and its augmentations) belonging to the same class, the denominator sums over all the negatives as well. Overall, this encourages the network to closely align the feature representations for _all_ the samples belonging to the same class, while _pushing_ apart the representations of samples across different classes.

We note that our proposed method HypStructure is not limited to the choice of euclidean classification losses as \(\ell_{\text{Flat}}\) and we report additional results with hyperbolic classification losses in Sections C.8 and C.9 respectively, demonstrating the wide applicability of our approach.

### Implementation Details

#### b.4.1 Software and Hardware

We implement our method in PyTorch 2.2.2 and run all experiments on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX-A6000 GPU. The code for our methodology will be open sourced for a wider audience upon acceptance, in the spirit of reproducible research.

#### b.4.2 Architecture, Hyperparameters and Training

We use the ResNet-18 [28] network as the backbone for CIFAR10, and ResNet-34 as the backbone for CIFAR100 and ImageNet100 datasets. We use a ReLU activated multi layer perceptron with one hidden layer as the projection head \(h(.)\) where its hidden layer dimension is the same as input dimension size and the output dimension is 128. We follow the original hyperparameter settings from [39] for training the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 models from scratch with a temperature \(\tau=0.1\), feature dimension 512, and training for 500 epochs with an initial learning rate of 0.5 with cosine annealing, optimizing using SGD with momentum 0.9 and weight decay \(10^{-4}\), and a batch size of \(512\) for all the experiments. For ImageNet100, we finetune the ResNet-34 for 20 epochs following [61] with an initial learning rate of 0.01 and update the weights of the last residual block and the nonlinear projection head, while freezing the parameters in the first three residual blocks. We use the same \(\alpha\) values as the regularization parameters for the CPCC loss in Equation (2) (\(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC) and in Equation (8) (our proposed method HypStructure) for a fair comparison and find that the default regularization hyperparameter for the CPCC loss \(\alpha=1.0\) for both \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC and HypStructure performs well for the experiments on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets. We observe that the experiments on the IMAGENET100 dataset benefit from a lower \(\alpha=0.5\). Additionally, we set the hyperparameter for the centering loss in our methodology as \(\beta=0.01\) for all the experiments. We use the default curvature value of \(c=1.0\) for the mapping and distance computations in the Poincare ball.

#### b.4.3 Datasets and Hierarchy

We use the following three datasets for our primary experimentation and training in this work

1. **CIFAR10** ([45]). It consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images from 10 different classes.
2. **CIFAR100**([45]). It also consists of 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images, however the images belong to 100 classes. Note that the classes are not identical to the CIFAR10 dataset.
3. **ImageNet100**([72]). This dataset is created as a subset of the large-scale ImageNet dataset following [59]. The original ImageNet dataset consists of 1,000 classes and 1.2 million training images and 50,000 validation images. We construct the ImageNet100 dataset from this original dataset by sampling 100 classes, which results in 128,241 training images and 5000 validation images. We mention the specific classes used for sampling below.

Following [59], we use the below 100 class id's for creating the ImageNet100 subset: n03877845, n03000684, n03110669, n03710721, n02825657, n02113186, n01817953, n04239074, n02002556, n04356056, n03187595, n03355925, n03125729, n02058221, n01580077, n03016953, n02843684, n04371430, n01944390, n03887697, n04037443, n02493793, n01518878, n03840681, n04179913, n01871265, n03866082, n03180011, n01910747, n03388549, n03908714, n01855032, n02134084, n03400231, n04483307, n03721384, n02033041, n01775062, n02808304, n13052670, n01601694, n0413633, n0272562, n03898566, n03995372, n06785654, n02118889, n03447721, n0366591, n04376876, n0392985, n02128757, n02236432, n07614500, n0169506, n02484975, n02105412, n04090263, n03127925, n04550184, n04606251, n02488702, n03404251, n03633091, n02091635, n03457902, n02233338, n02483362, n04461696, n02871525, n01689811, n01498041, n02107312, n01632458, n03394916, n04147183, n04418357, n03218198, n01917289, n02102318, n02088364, n09835506, n02095570, n03982430, n04041544, n04562935, n0393393, n01843065, n02128925, n02480495, n03425413, n03935335, n02971356, n02124075, n07714571, n03133878, n02097130, n02113799, n09399592, n03594945.

In addition to the training and validation images, we also require the label hierarchy for each of these datasets for the CPCC computation in \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC and HypStructure approaches. For CIFAR100, we use the three-level hierarchy provided with the dataset release3. We show this hierarchy in Table 3, where the top-level is the root of the tree.

Footnote 3: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/ kriz/cifar.html

Since no hierarchy is available for the CIFAR10 and ImageNet100 datasets, we construct a hierarchy for CIFAR10 manually, as seen in Figure 2. For ImageNet100, we create a subtree from the WordNet 4 hierarchy, given the 100 aforementioned classes as leaves. We consider the classes which are one level above the leaf nodes in the hierarchy as the coarse classes, following [104].

Footnote 4: https://www.nltk.org/howto/wordnet.html

For the task of OOD detection, we use the following five diverse OOD datasets for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 as ID datasets, following the literature [83]: SVHN[65], Textures[9], Places365[109], LSUN[102] and iSUN[99]. When ImageNet100 is used as the ID dataset, we use 4 diverse OOD datasets as the ones in [37], namely subsets of iNaturalist[90], SUN[96], Places[109] and Textures[9]. These datasets have been processed so that there is no overlap with the ImageNet classes.

### Delta Hyperbolicity Metrics

We use Gromov's \(\delta_{rel}\) to evaluate the tree-likeness of the data in Section 4.1, following [40]. For an arbitrary metric space \(\mathcal{X}\) with metric \(d\), for any three points \(\bm{x},\bm{y},\bm{z}\in\mathcal{X}\), we can define the Gromov product as

\[(\bm{y},\bm{z})_{\bm{x}}=\frac{1}{2}(d(\bm{x},\bm{y})+d(\bm{x},\bm{z})-d(\bm{ y},\bm{z}))\]

Then, \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity can be defined as the minimum value of \(\delta\) such that for any four points \(\bm{x},\bm{y},\bm{z},\bm{w}\in\mathcal{X}\), the following condition holds:

\[(\bm{x},\bm{z})_{\bm{w}}\geq\min((\bm{x},\bm{y})_{\bm{w}},(\bm{y},\bm{z})_{ \bm{w}})-\delta\]

It can be shown that equivalently, there exists a geometric definition of \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity. A geodesic triangle in \(\mathcal{X}\) is \(\delta\)-sim if each of its side is contained in the \(\delta\)-neighbourhood of the union of the other two sides. We define \(\delta\)-hyperbolicity as the minimum \(\delta\) that guarantees any triangle in \(\mathcal{X}\) is \(\delta\)-sim. From Figure 10, when the curvature of the surface increases, the geodesic triangle converges to a tree/star graph, and \(\delta\) gradually reduces to \(0\).

Following [40], we use the scale-invariant metric \(\delta_{rel}=\frac{2\delta}{\text{diam}(\mathcal{X})}\) for evaluation, so that the \(\delta_{rel}\) is normalized in \([0,1]\), and the \(\text{diam}(\cdot)\) is the set diameter or the maximal pairwise distance.

## Appendix C Additional Experimental Results

### Results using Linear Evaluation

We also perform an evaluation of the _fine_ classification accuracy following the common linear evaluation protocol [39] where a linear classifier is trained on top of the normalized penultimate layer features. We report these accuracies for the models trained on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 datasets in Table 4 for the leaf-only variants of the models. We observe that the relative trend of accuracies is identical to the ones reported using the kNN evaluation in Table 1 and our proposed method HypStructure outperforms the _flat_ and \(\ell_{2}\)-CPCC methods on both the datasets.

### Component-wise Ablation Study of HypStructure

To understand the role of each component in our proposed methodology HypStructure, we perform a detailed ablation study with the different components and measure the _fine_ and the _coarse_ accuracies on the CIFAR100 dataset. Specifically, we examine

1. the role of embedding all internal nodes in the label hierarchy (eq. (8) and line 10 in Algorithm 1), as opposed to only using leaf nodes as in [104]. We refer to the inclusion of internal nodes as \(\mathcal{T}_{\text{int}}\).
2. the role of hyperbolic class centroids computation using hyperbolic averaging (eq. (6) and line 8 in Algorithm 1), as opposed to the Euclidean computation of class prototypes as in [104]. We refer to the hyperbolic class centroid computation as \(\omega_{\text{hyp}}\).
3. the role of the hyperbolic centering loss in our proposed methodology (eq. (8) and line 11 in Algorithm 1), as opposed to not using a centering loss. We refer to the inclusion of the centering loss as \(\ell_{\text{center}}\).

We ablate over the aforementioned settings, where a \(\bigvee\) denotes the inclusion of that setting, and report the results on the CIFAR100 dataset in Table 5. Firstly, we observe that while the centering loss \(\ell_{\text{center}}\) improves the coarse accuracy only by a small increment, it leads to a significant improvement in the fine accuracy (rows \(1\to 2\) and \(4\to 5\)), indicating that the centering of the root in the poincare disk allows for a better relative positioning of the fine classes within the coarse class groups. Secondly, we observe that both the inclusion of internal nodes \(\mathcal{T}_{\text{int}}\), and the hyperbolic computation of the class centroids \(\omega_{\text{hyp}}\) is critical for accurately embedding the hierarchy, and removing either of these components (i.e. rows \(5\to 3\) for \(\mathcal{T}_{\text{int}}\) and rows \(5\to 2\) for \(\omega_{\text{hyp}}\)), leads to a degradation in both the fine as well as the coarse accuracies. The best overall performance is observed when all three of the components are included (row \(5\)).

### OOD detection

#### c.3.1 Related Work and Methods

The goal of prior works in the OOD literature is the supervised setting of learning an accurate classifier for ID data, along with an ID-OOD detection methodology and this task has been explored in the generative model setting [42, 63, 71, 77, 97], and more extensively in the supervised discriminative model setting [2, 30, 36, 37, 51, 53, 82, 60]. The methods in this setting can be categorized into four sub-categories following [106], primarily:

Post-Hoc InferenceThese methods design post-processing/scoring mechanisms on base classifiers such as MSP [30], ODIN [51], ReAct [82], SSD+ [76], KNN+ [83] and RankFeat [80].

Training without outlier dataThese methods involve training-time regularization or different objective functions for improving OOD detection capabilities such as G-ODIN [36], CSI [85], LogitNorm [92] and CIDER [61].

Training with outlier dataThese methods assume access to auxiliary OOD training samples such as OE [31] and MixOE [105].

Data AugmentationThese methods improve the generalization ability of image classifiers such as StyleAugment [22], AugMix [32] and RegMixup [69].

Our proposed work can be considered primarily in the **Training without outlier data** category, and we note that none of the prior works use any additional structural regularization term in the objective functions.

### Effect of Label Hierarchy Weights

Compared to ranking-based hyperbolic losses [66], our HypCPCC factors in absolute values of the node-to-node distances. The learned hierarchy with HypCPCC will not only implicitly encode the correct parent-child relations, but can also learn more complex and weighted hierarchical relationships more accurately. To demonstrate this, we modify the CIFAR10 tree hierarchy, and gradually increase the weight for the left transportation branch to 2\(\times\) and 4\(\times\) and use new weighted trees for the CPCC tree distance computation. We visualize the learnt representations in Figure 16 and we can observe that in the learned representations from left to right, the distance between the transportation classes (blue) are larger as compared to other classes, as expected.

### Effect of Klein Averaging

We experiment with the two HypCPCC variants, using Klein Averaging or Euclidean mean for centroid computation, as mentioned in Section 3.2 and report the results in Table 9. We empirically observe that using the Klein averaging leads to performance improvements across datasets.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and the introduction both clearly state the claims made by the paper, along with a clear description of the contributions, assumptions and limitations. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the limitations of the current work as well as the avenues for future improvements to the current work can be found in Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Yes, for all the main results of the paper in Section 5, a full set of assumptions and a complete proof is provided in Section A in the Appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the paper discloses all the necessary details about the implemented architectures used, hyperparameters for each setting, algorithm pseudocode and other experimental details to reproduce all the experiments in the paper. These details can be found in Section B in the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper includes the specific instructions to access the datasets used for all the experimentation. These can be found in Section B in the Appendix. The code for this project is released to the public. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the paper uses standard data splits from publicly available benchmark sources and provides details regarding the choice of hyperparameters, optimizer and other decisions necessary for understanding the results. These details can be found in Section B in the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the paper reports the error bars and other information about the statistical significance of the results in the Section 4 in the main paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the paper provides details about the compute resources, hardware and software needed to reproduce the experiments in Section B of the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, the research conducted in this paper conforms in every respect, with the NeurIPS code of ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We discuss the potential positive and negative societal impacts of our work in Section B.1 of the Appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper uses publicly available datasets, and does not release any data or code that have a risk of misuse. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have appropriately cited the original owners of data and code which is used in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.

* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release any new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing, nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
