###### Abstract

The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance has gained increasing interest in the machine learning community in recent years, as it allows for the comparison of measures in different metric spaces. To overcome the limitations imposed by the equal mass requirements of the classical GW problem, researchers have begun exploring its application in unbalanced settings. However, Unbalanced GW (UGW) can only be regarded as a discrepancy rather than a rigorous metric/distance between two metric measure spaces (mm-spaces). In this paper, we propose a particular case of the UGW problem, termed Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW). We establish that PGW is a well-defined metric between mm-spaces and discuss its theoretical properties, including the existence of a minimizer for the PGW problem and the relationship between PGW and GW, among others. We then propose two variants of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for solving the PGW problem and show that they are mathematically and computationally equivalent. Moreover, based on our PGW metric, we introduce the analogous concept of barycenters for mm-spaces. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our PGW metric and related solvers in applications such as shape matching, shape retrieval, and shape interpolation, comparing them against existing baselines.

## 1 Introduction

The classical optimal transport (OT) problem [1] seeks to match two probability measures while minimizing the expected transportation cost. At the heart of classical OT theory lies the principle of mass conservation, which aims to optimize the transfer between two probability measures, assuming they have the same total mass and strictly preserving it. Statistical distances that arise from OT, such as Wasserstein distances, have been widely applied across various machine learning domains, ranging from generative modeling [2, 3] to domain adaptation [4] and representation learning [5]. Recent advancements have extended the OT problem to address certain limitations within machine learning applications. These advancements include: 1) facilitating the comparison of non-negative measures that possess different total masses via unbalanced [6] and partial OT [7], and 2) enabling the comparison of probability measures across distinct metric spaces through Gromov-Wasserstein distances [8], with applications spanning from quantum chemistry [9] to natural language processing [10].

Regarding the first aspect, many applications in machine learning involve comparing non-negative measures (often empirical measures) with varying total amounts of mass, e.g., domain adaptation [11]. Moreover, OT distances (or dissimilarity measures) are often not robust against outliers and noise, resulting in potentially high transportation costs for outliers. Many recent publications have focused on variants of the OT problem that allow for comparing non-negative measures with unequal mass. For instance, the optimal partial transport problem [7, 12, 13, 14], Kantorovich-Rubinstein norm [15, 16, 17], and the Hellinger-Kantorovich distance [18, 19]. These methods fall under the broad category of "unbalanced optimal transport". In this regard, we also highlight [20, 21, 22], which enhance OT's robustness in the presence of outliers.

Regarding the second aspect, comparing probability measures across different metric spaces is essential in many machine learning applications, ranging from computer graphics, where shapes and surfaces are compared [23; 24], to graph partitioning and matching problems [25]. Source and target distributions often arise from varied conditions, such as different times, contexts, or measurement techniques, creating substantial differences in intrinsic distances among data points. The conventional OT framework necessitates a meaningful distance across diverse domains, a requirement that is not always achievable. To circumvent this issue, the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances were proposed in [8; 24] as an adaptation of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance, which measures the discrepancy between two metric spaces [26; 27; 28; 29]. The GW distance [8; 30] extends OT-based distances to metric measure spaces (mm-spaces) up to isometries. Its invariance across isomorphic mm-spaces makes the GW distance particularly valuable for applications like shape comparison and matching, where invariance to rigid motion transformations is crucial.

The main computational challenge of the GW metric is the non-convexity of its formulation [8]. The conventional computational approach relies on the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm [31; 32]. Optimal transport (OT) computational methods [15; 33; 34; 35; 36; 37; 38; 39; 40], such as the Sinkhorn algorithm, can be incorporated into FW iterations, which yields the classical GW solvers [41; 42; 43].

Given that the GW distance is limited to the comparison of probability mm-spaces, recent works have introduced unbalanced and partial variations [44; 45; 46]. These variations have been applied in diverse contexts, including partial graph matching for social network analysis [47] and the alignment of brain images [48]. Although solving these unbalanced variants of the GW problem yields notions of _discrepancies_ between mm-spaces, their _metric_ properties remain unclear in the literature.

Motivated by the emerging applications of the GW problem in unbalanced settings, this paper focuses on developing a metric between general (not necessarily probability) mm-spaces and providing efficient solvers for its computation. Our proposed metric arises from formulating a variant of the GW problem for unbalanced contexts, rooted in the framework provided by [44], which we named the _Partial Gromov-Wasserstein_ (PGW) problem. In contrast to [44], which introduces a KL-divergence penalty and a Sinkhorn solver, we employ a total variation penalty, demonstrate the resulting metric properties, and provide novel, efficient solvers for this problem. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first metric for non-probability mm-spaces based on the GW distance.

**Contributions.** Our specific contributions in this paper are:

* **GW metric in unbalanced settings.** We propose the Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem and prove that it gives rise to a metric between arbitrary mm-spaces.
* **PGW solver.**Analogous to the technique presented in [12], we show that the PGW problem can be turned into a variant of the GW problem. Based on this relation, we propose two mathematically equivalent, but distinct in numerical implementation, Frank-Wolfe solvers for the discrete PGW problem. Inspired by the results of [32], we prove that similar to the Frank-Wolfe solver presented in [45], our proposed solvers for the PGW problem converge linearly to a stationary point.
* **Numerical experiments.** We demonstrate the performance of our proposed algorithms in terms of computation time and efficacy on a series of tasks: shape-matching with outliers between 2D and 3D objects, shape retrieval between 2D shapes, and shape interpolation using the concept of PGW barycenters. We compare the performance of our proposed algorithms against existing baselines for each task.

## 2 Background

In this section, we review the basics of OT theory, one of its variants in unbalanced contexts called Partial OT (POT), and their connection as established in [12]. We then introduce the GW distance.

### Optimal Transport and Partial Optimal Transport

Let \(\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{d}\) be, for simplicity, a compact subset of \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\), and \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\) be the space of probability measures defined on the Borel \(\sigma\)-algebra of \(\Omega\).

**The Optimal Transport (OT) problem** for \(\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\), with transportation cost \(c(x,y):\Omega\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\) being a lower-semi continuous function, is defined as:

\[OT(\mu,\nu):=\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\gamma(c),\qquad\text{ where }\quad\gamma(c):=\int_{\Omega^{2}}c(x,y)\,d\gamma(x,y)\] (1)and where \(\Gamma(\mu,\nu)\) denotes the set of all joint probability measures on \(\Omega^{2}:=\Omega\times\Omega\) with marginals \(\mu,\nu\), i.e., \(\gamma_{1}:=\pi_{1}\#\gamma=\mu,\gamma_{2}:=\pi_{2}\#\gamma=\nu\), where \(\pi_{1},\pi_{2}:\Omega^{2}\to\Omega\) are the canonical projections \(\pi_{1}(x,y):=x,\pi_{2}(x,y):=y\). A minimizer for (1) always exists [1, 49] and when \(c(x,y)=\|x-y\|^{p}\), for \(p\geq 1\), it defines a metric on \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\), which is referred to as the "\(p\)-Wasserstein distance":

\[W_{p}^{p}(\mu,\nu):=\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\int_{\Omega^{2}}\|x-y\|^{p }d\gamma(x,y).\] (2)

**The Partial Optimal Transport (POT) problem**[6, 13, 50] extends the OT problem to the set of Radon measures \(\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega)\), i.e., non-negative and finite measures. For \(\lambda>0\) and \(\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega)\), the POT problem is defined as:

\[POT(\mu,\nu;\lambda):=\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega^{2})}\gamma(c)+ \lambda(|\mu-\gamma_{1}|+|\nu-\gamma_{2}|),\] (3)

where, in general, \(|\sigma|\) denotes the total variation norm of a measure \(\sigma\), i.e., \(|\sigma|:=\sigma(\Omega)\). The constraint \(\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega^{2})\) in (3) can be further restricted to \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\):

\[\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu):=\{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega^{2}):\,\gamma_{1}\leq \mu,\gamma_{2}\leq\nu\},\]

denoting \(\gamma_{1}\leq\mu\) if for any Borel set \(B\subseteq\Omega\), \(\gamma_{1}(B)\leq\mu(B)\) (respectively, for \(\gamma_{2}\leq\nu\)) [7]. Roughly speaking, the linear penalization indicates that if the classical transportation cost exceeds \(2\lambda\), it is better to create/destroy' mass (see [40] for further details).

**The relationship between POT and OT.** By using the techniques in [12], the POT problem can be transferred into an OT problem, and thus, OT solvers (e.g., network simplex) can be employed to solve the POT problem.

**Proposition 2.1**.: _[_12, 40_]_ _Given \(\mu,\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\Omega)\), construct the following measures on \(\hat{\Omega}:=\Omega\cup\{\hat{\infty}\}\), for an auxiliary point \(\hat{\infty}\):_

\[\hat{\mu}=\mu+|\nu|\delta_{\hat{\infty}}\quad\text{ and }\quad\hat{\nu}=\nu+| \mu|\delta_{\hat{\infty}}.\] (4)

_Consider the following OT problem_

\[\text{OT}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})=\min_{\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{ \nu})}\hat{\gamma}(\hat{c}),\qquad\text{where}\quad\hat{c}(x,y):=\begin{cases} c(x,y)-2\lambda&\text{if }x,y\in\Omega,\\ 0&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}\] (5)

_Then, there exists a bijection \(F:\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\to\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})\) given by_

\[F(\gamma):=\gamma+(\mu-\gamma_{1})\otimes\delta_{\hat{\infty}}+\delta_{\hat{ \infty}}\otimes(\nu-\gamma_{2})+|\gamma|\delta_{\hat{\infty},\hat{\infty}}.\] (6)

_such that \(\gamma\) is optimal for the POT problem (3) if and only if \(F(\gamma)\) is optimal for the OT problem (5)._

It is worth noting that instead of considering the same underlying space \(\Omega\) for both measures \(\mu\) and \(\nu\), the OT and POT problems can be formulated in the scenario where \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) are defined on different metric spaces \(X\) and \(Y\), respectively. In this setting, one needs a cost function \(c:X\times Y\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\) to formulate the OT and POT problems. However, in practice it is usually difficult to define reasonable 'distance' or _ground cost_\(c(\cdot,\cdot)\) between the two spaces \(X\) and \(Y\). In particular, the \(p\)-Wasserstein distance cannot be adopted if \(\mu,\nu\) are defined on different spaces. To relax this requirement, in the next section, we will review the fundamentals of the _Gromov-Wasserstein_ problem [8].

### The Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) Problem

A metric measure space (mm-space) consists of a set \(X\) endowed with a metric structure, that is, a notion of distance \(d_{X}\) between its elements, and equipped with a Borel measure \(\mu\). As in [8, Ch. 5], we will assume that \(X\) is compact and that \(\operatorname{supp}(\mu)=X\). Given two probability mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), with \(\mu\in\mathcal{P}(X)\) and \(\nu\in\mathcal{P}(Y)\), and a non-negative lower semi-continuous cost function \(L:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\) (e.g., the Euclidean distance or the KL-loss), the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) matching problem is defined as:

\[GW^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\gamma^{\otimes 2 }(L(d_{X}(\cdot,\cdot),d_{Y}(\cdot,\cdot))),\] (7)

where, for brevity, we employ the notation \(\gamma^{\otimes 2}\) for the product measure \(d\gamma^{\otimes 2}((x,y),(x^{\prime},y^{\prime}))=d\gamma(x,y)d\gamma(x^{\prime}, y^{\prime})\). If \(L(a,b)=|a-b|^{p}\), for \(1\leq p<\infty\), we denote \(GW^{L}(\cdot,\cdot)\) simply by \(GW^{p}(\cdot,\cdot)\). In this case, the expression (7) defines an equivalence relation \(\sim\) among probability mm-spaces, i.e.,\(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) if and only if \(GW^{p}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\)1. A minimizer of the GW problem (7) always exists, and thus, we can replace \(\inf\) by \(\min\). Moreover, similar to OT, the above GW problem defines a distance for probability mm-spaces after taking the quotient under \(\sim\). For details, we refer to [8, Ch. 5 and 10].

Footnote 1: Moreover, given two probability mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}\) and \(\mathbb{Y}\), \(GW(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\) if and only if there exists a bijective isometry \(\phi:X\to Y\) such that \(\phi_{\#}\mu=\nu\). In particular, the GW distance is invariant under rigid transformations (translations and rotations) of a given probability mm-space.

## 3 The Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) Problem

The Unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein (UGW) problem for general (compact) mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu),\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), with \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X),\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(Y)\), studied in [44] is defined as:

\[UGW_{\lambda}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X \times Y)}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(L(d_{X},d_{Y}))+\lambda(D_{\phi}(\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}\parallel\mu^{\otimes 2})+D_{\phi}(\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}\parallel\nu^{ \otimes 2})),\] (8)

where \(\lambda>0\) is a fixed linear penalization parameter, and \(D_{\phi}\) is a Csiszar or \(\phi\)-divergence. The above formulation extends the classical GW problem (7) into the unbalanced setting (\(\mu\) and \(\nu\) are no longer necessarily probability measures but general Radon measures).

We underline two points: First, as discussed in [44], while the above quantity allows us to 'compare' the mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}\) and \(\mathbb{Y}\), its _metric_ property is unclear. Secondly, when \(D_{\phi}\) is the KL divergence, a Sinkhorn solver has been proposed in [44]. However, a solver for general \(\phi\)-divergences has not yet been proposed.

In this paper, we will analyze the case when \(D_{\phi}\) is the total variation norm. Specifically, for \(q\geq 1\), we consider the following problem, which we refer to as the _Partial Gromov-Wasserstein_ (PGW) problem:

\[PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X \times Y)}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(L(d_{X}^{q},d_{Y}^{q}))+\lambda(|\mu^{\otimes 2}- \gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}|).\] (9)

**Remark 3.1**.: _Given \(\gamma\in\Gamma\leq(\mu,\nu)\), the above cost functional can be rewritten as \(\gamma^{\otimes 2}(L(d_{X}^{q},d_{Y}^{q}))+\lambda(|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}|)=\gamma^{\otimes 2} \left(L(d_{X}^{q},d_{Y}^{q})-2\lambda\right)+\underbrace{\lambda\left(|\mu|^{2} +|\nu|^{2}\right)}_{\text{does not depend on $\gamma$}}.\)_

**Proposition 3.2**.: _Given mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu),\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), the minimization problem (9) can be restricted to the set \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)=\{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y):\,\gamma_{1} \leq\mu,\gamma_{2}\leq\nu\}\). That is,_

\[PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu, \nu)}\gamma^{\otimes 2}\left(L(d_{X}^{q},d_{Y}^{q})-2\lambda\right)+\lambda(|\mu|^{2} +|\nu|^{2}).\] (10)

For the proof, inspired by [50], we direct the reader to Appendix B.

We notice that a similar Partial Gromov-Wasserstein problem (and its solver) has been studied [45]. Indeed, in [45], the \(\lambda\)-penalization in the optimization problem (10) is avoided, but the constraint set is replaced by the subset of all \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) such that \(|\gamma|=\rho\) for a fixed \(\rho\in[0,\min\{|\mu|,|\nu|\}]\). We will call this formulation the _Mass-Constrained Partial Gromov-Wasserstein_ (MPGW) problem. In Appendix L, we explore the relations between PGW and MPGW, and in Section 5 and Appendices N, O, P, we analyze the performance of the different solvers through different experiments.

**Proposition 3.3**.: _If \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{p}\), for \(p\in[1,\infty)\), we use \(PGW_{\lambda,q}^{p}\) to denote \(PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}\). In this case, (9) and (10) admit a minimizer._

The proof is given in Appendix C: Its idea extends results from [8] from probability mm-spaces to arbitrary mm-spaces.

Next, we state one of our main results: The PGW problem gives rise to a metric between mm-spaces. The rigorous statement as well as its proof is given in Appendix D.

**Proposition 3.4**.: _Let \(\lambda>0\), \(1\leq q,p<\infty\) and \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{p}\). Then \((PGW_{\lambda,q}^{p}(\cdot,\cdot))^{1/p}\) defines a metric between mm-spaces._

Finally, for consistency, we provide the following result when the penalization tends to infinity. Its proof is given in Appendix E.

**Proposition 3.5**.: _Consider probability mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), that is, \(|\mu|=|\nu|=1\). Assume that \(L\) is a continuous funtion. Then \(\lim_{\lambda\to\infty}PGW_{\lambda,1}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=GW^{L}( \mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\)._

## 4 Computation of the Partial GW Distance

In the discrete setting, consider mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{X}\delta_{\mathcal{E}_{i}})\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\sum_{j=1}^{m}q_{j}^{Y}\delta_{y_{j}})\), where \(X=\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}\}\), \(Y=\{y_{1},\ldots,y_{m}\}\), the weights \(p_{i}^{X}\), \(q_{j}^{Y}\) are non-negative numbers, and the distances \(d_{X}\), \(d_{Y}\) are determined by the matrices \(C^{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\), \(C^{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}\) defined by

\[C^{X}_{i,i^{\prime}}:=d_{X}^{q}(x_{i},x_{i^{\prime}})\quad\forall i,i^{\prime} \in[1:n]\quad\text{and}\quad C^{Y}_{j,j^{\prime}}:=d_{Y}^{q}(y_{j},y_{j^{\prime }})\quad\forall j,j^{\prime}\in[1:m].\] (11)

Let \(\mathrm{p}:=[q_{1}^{X},\ldots,q_{n}^{X}]^{\top}\) and \(\mathrm{q}:=[q_{1}^{Y},\ldots,q_{m}^{Y}]^{\top}\) denote the weight vectors corresponding to the given discrete measures. We view the sets of transportation plans \(\Gamma(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) and \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) for the GW and PGW problems, respectively, as the subsets of \(n\times m\) matrices

\[\Gamma(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}):=\{\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m} :\,\gamma 1_{m}=\mathrm{p},\gamma^{\top}1_{n}=\mathrm{q}\},\quad\text{if}\,| \mathrm{p}|=\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{X}=1=\sum_{j=1}^{m}q_{j}^{Y}=|\mathrm{q}|;\] (12)

\[\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}):=\{\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}_{+} :\,\gamma 1_{m}\leq\mathrm{p},\gamma^{\top}1_{n}\leq\mathrm{q}\},\] (13)

for any pair of non-negative vectors \(\mathrm{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}_{+}\), \(\mathrm{q}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}_{+}\), where \(1_{n}\) is the vector with all ones in \(\mathbb{R}^{n}\) (resp. \(1_{m}\)), and \(\gamma 1_{m}\leq\mathrm{p}\) means that component-wise the \(\leq\) relation holds.

Given by a non-negative function \(L:\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\times\mathbb{R}^{m\times m}\to\mathbb{R}_{+}\), he transportation cost \(M\) and the 'partial' transportation con \(\tilde{M}\) are represented by the \(n\times m\times n\times m\) tensors:

\[M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}=L(C^{X}_{i,i^{\prime}},C^{Y}_{j,j^{\prime}}) \qquad\text{and}\qquad\tilde{M}:=M-2\lambda:=M-2\lambda 1_{n,m,n,m},\] (14)

where \(1_{n,m,n,m}\) is the tensor with ones in all its entries. For each \(n\times m\times n\times m\) tensor \(M\) and each \(n\times m\) matrix \(\gamma\), we define tensor-matrix multiplication \(M\circ\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) by

\[(M\circ\gamma)_{ij}=\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}(M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime} })\gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}.\]

Then, the Partial GW problem in (10) can be written as

\[PGW^{L}_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}( \mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma)+\lambda(|\mathrm{p}|^{2 }+|\mathrm{q}|^{2}),\quad\text{ where}\] (15)

\[\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma):=\tilde{M}\gamma^{\otimes 2}:=\sum_{i,j,i^{ \prime},j^{\prime}}\tilde{M}_{i,j^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\gamma_{i,j}\gamma_{i^ {\prime},j^{\prime}}=\sum_{ij}(\tilde{M}\circ\gamma)_{ij}\gamma_{ij}=:\langle \tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F},\] (16)

and \(\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{F}\) stands for the Frobenius dot product. The constant term \(\lambda(|\mathrm{p}|^{2}+|\mathrm{q}|^{2})\) will be ignored in the rest of this paper since it does not depend on \(\gamma\).

### Frank-Wolfe for the PGW Problem - Solver 1

In this section, we discuss the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm for the PGW problem (15). A second variant of the FW solver is provided in the Appendix G.

As a summary, in our proposed method, we address the discrete PGW problem (15), highlighting that the _direction-finding subproblem_ in the Frank-Wolfe (FW) algorithm is a POT problem for (15). Specifically, (15) is treated as a discrete POT problem in our Solver 1, where we apply Proposition 2.1 to solve a discrete OT problem.

For each iteration \(k\), the procedure is summarized in three steps detailed below.

The convergence analysis, detailed in Appendix K, applies the results from [32] to our context, showing that the FW algorithm achieves a stationary point at a rate of \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})\) for non-convex objectives with a Lipschitz continuous gradient in a convex and compact domain.

**Step 1. Computation of gradient and optimal direction.**

It is straightforward to verify that the gradient of the objective function (16) in (15) is given by

\[\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma)=2\tilde{M}\circ\gamma.\] (17)

The classical method to compute \(M\circ\gamma\) is the following: First, convert \(M\) into an \((n\times m)\times(n\times m)\) matrix, denoted as \(v(M)\), and convert \(\gamma\) into an \((n\times m)\times 1\) vector \(v(\gamma)\). Then, the computation of \(M\circ\gamma\) is equivalent to the matrix multiplication \(v(M)v(\gamma)\). The computational cost and therequired storage space are \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2}m^{2})\). In certain conditions, the above computation can be reduced to \(\mathcal{O}(n^{2}+m^{2})\). We refer to Appendices F and H for details.

Next, we aim to solve the following problem:

\[\gamma^{(k)^{\prime}}\leftarrow\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{q})}\langle\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma^{(k)}),\gamma\rangle_{F},\]

which is a discrete POT problem since it is equivalent to

\[\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\langle 2M\circ\gamma^{(k)}, \gamma\rangle_{F}+\lambda|\gamma^{(k)}|(|\mathrm{p}|+|\mathrm{q}|-2|\gamma|).\]

The solver can be obtained by firstly converting the POT problem into an OT problem via Proposition 2.1 and then solving the proposed OT problem.

**Step 2: Line search method.**

In this step, at the \(k\)-th iteration, we need to determine the optimal step size:

\[\alpha^{(k)}=\arg\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}\{\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}((1-\alpha) \gamma^{(k)}+\alpha\gamma^{(k)^{\prime}})\}.\]

The optimal \(\alpha^{(k)}\) takes the following values (see Appendix I for details):

\[\text{Let }\alpha^{(k)}=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }a\leq 0,a+b>0,\\ 1&\text{if }a\leq 0,a+b\leq 0,\text{ where }\left\{\begin{array}{ll}&\delta \gamma^{(k)}=\gamma^{(k)^{\prime}}-\gamma^{(k)},\\ &a=\langle\tilde{M}\circ\delta\gamma^{(k)},\delta\gamma^{(k)}\rangle_{F}\\ &b=2\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma^{(k)},\delta\gamma^{(k)}\rangle_{F}.\end{array} \right.,\end{cases}\] (18)

and \(\mathrm{clip}(\frac{-b}{2a},[0,1])=\min\{\max\{-\frac{b}{2a},0\},1\}\).

**Step 3: Update \(\gamma^{(k+1)}\leftarrow(1-\alpha^{(k)})\gamma^{(k)}+\alpha^{(k)}\gamma^{(k) ^{\prime}}\).**

### Numerical Implementation Details

**The initial guess, \(\gamma^{(1)}\).** In the GW problem, the initial guess is simply set to \(\gamma^{(1)}=\mathrm{pq}^{\top}\) if there is no prior knowledge. In PGW, however, as \(\mu,\nu\) may not necessarily be probability measures (i.e., \(\sum_{i}p_{i}^{X},\sum_{j}q_{j}^{Y}\neq 1\) in general), we set \(\gamma^{(1)}=\frac{\mathrm{pq}^{\top}}{\max(|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{q}|)}\). It is straightforward to verify that \(\gamma^{(1)}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) as

\[\gamma^{(1)}1_{m}=\frac{|\mathrm{q}|\mathrm{p}}{\max(|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{q }|)}\leq\mathrm{p},\ \ \gamma^{(1)\top}1_{n}=\frac{|\mathrm{p}|\mathrm{q}}{\max(|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{q }|)}\leq\mathrm{q}.\]

**Column/Row-Reduction.** According to the interpretation of the penalty weight parameter in the Partial OT problem (e.g. see Lemma 3.2 in [40]), during the POT solving step, for each \(i\in[1:n]\) (or \(j\in[1:m]\)), if the \(i^{th}\) row (\(j^{th}\) column) of \(\tilde{M}\circ\gamma^{(k)}\) contains a non-negative entry, all the mass of \(p_{i}^{X}\) (\(q_{j}^{Y}\)) will be destroyed (created). Thus, we can remove the corresponding row (column) to improve the computational efficiency.

Experiments

In addition to the three experiments detailed here, we also perform a wall-clock time comparison of our proposed PGW solvers in Appendix O and a positive-unlabeled (PU) learning experiment in Appendix P.

### Toy Example: Shape Matching with Outliers

We use the moon dataset and synthetic 2D/3D spherical data in this experiment. Let \(\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\{y_{j}\}_{j=1}^{n}\) denote the source and target point clouds. In addition, we add \(\eta n\) (where \(\eta=20\%\)) outliers to the target point cloud. See Figure 1 for visualization.

We visualize the transportation plans given by the GW [8], MPGW [45], UGW [44], and our proposed PGW problems. For MPGW, UGW, and PGW, we set the mass to be 1 for each point in the source and target point clouds. For GW, we normalize the mass of these points so that the source and target have the same total mass. From Figure 1, we observe that PGW and MPGW induce a one-by-one relation in both cases and no outlier points are matched to the source point cloud. Meanwhile, GW matches all of the outliers. For UGW, as it applies the Sinkhorn algorithm, we observe mass-splitting transportation plans in both cases. Moreover, we observe that some mass from the outliers has been matched, which is not desired.

### Shape Retrieval

**Experiment setup.** We now employ the PGW distance to distinguish between 2D shapes, as done in [51], and use GW, MPGW, and UGW as baselines for comparison. Given a series of 2D shapes, we represent the shapes as mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}^{i}=(\mathbb{R}^{2},\|\cdot\|_{2},\mu^{i})\), where \(\mu^{i}=\sum_{k=1}^{n^{i}}\alpha^{i}\delta_{x_{k}^{i}}\). For the GW method, we normalize the mass for the balanced mass constraint setting (i.e. \(\alpha^{i}=\frac{1}{n^{i}}\)), and for the remaining methods we let \(\alpha^{i}=\alpha\) for all the shapes, where \(\alpha>0\) is a fixed constant. In this manner, we compute the pairwise distances between the shapes.

We then use the computed distances for nearest neighbor classification. We do this by choosing a representative at random from each class in the dataset and then classifying each shape according to its nearest representative. This is repeated over 10,000 iterations, and we generate a confusion matrix for each distance used. Finally, using the approach given by [51, 52], we combine each distance with a support vector machine (SVM), applying stratified 10-fold cross validation. In each iteration of cross validation, we train an SVM using \(\exp(-\sigma D)\) as the kernel, where \(D\) is the matrix of pairwise distances (w.r.t. one of the considered distances) restricted to 9 folds, and compute the accuracy of the model on the remaining fold. We report the accuracy averaged over all 10 folds for each model.

**Dataset setup.** We test two datasets in this experiment, which we refer to as Dataset I and Dataset II. We construct Dataset I by adapting the 2D shape dataset given in [51], consisting of 20 shapes in

Figure 1: The set of red points comprises the source point cloud. The union of the dark blue (outliers) and light blue points comprises the target point cloud. For UGW, MPGW, and PGW, we set the mass for each point to be the same. For GW, we normalize the mass for the balanced mass constraint setting.

each of the classes bone, goblet, star, and horseshoe. For each class, we augment the dataset with an additional class by selecting either a subset of points from each shape of that class (rectangle/bone, trapezoid/goblet, disk/star) or adding additional points to each shape of that class (annulus/horseshoe). Hence, the final dataset consists of 160 shapes across 8 total classes. This dataset is visualized in Figure 5(a).

For Dataset II, we generate 20 shapes for each of the classes rectangle, house, arrow, double arrow, semicircle, and circle. These shapes were generated in pairs, such that each shape of class rectangle is a subset of the corresponding shape of class house, and similarly for arrow/double arrow and semicircle/circle. This dataset is visualized in Figure 5(b).

**Performance analysis**. We refer to Appendix N for full numerical details, parameter settings, and the visualization of the resulting confusion matrices. We visualize the two considered datasets and the resulting pairwise distance matrices in Figure 2. For the SVM experiments, GW achieves the highest accuracy on Dataset I, 98.13%, while the second best method is PGW, 96.25%. For Dataset II, PGW achieves the highest accuracy, correctly classifying 100% of the samples. The complete set of accuracies for all considered distances on each dataset is reported in Table 0(a).

In addition, we report the wall-clock time required to compute all pairwise distances for each distance in Table 0(b). We observe that GW, MPGW, and PGW have similar wall-clock times across both experiments (30-50 seconds for Dataset I, 80-140 seconds for Dataset II), with PGW admitting a slightly faster runtime in both cases. Meanwhile, UGW requires almost 1500 seconds on the experiment with Dataset I and over 500 seconds on the experiment with Dataset II.

### Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenter and Shape Interpolation

By [41], Gromov-Wasserstein can be applied to interpolate two shapes via the concept of _Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters_. In this paper, we introduce _Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenters_ by extending the GW Barycenter to the setting of PGW as follows.

(a) Mean accuracy of SVM using each distance in kernel.

(b) Wall-clock time comparison.

Figure 2: In each row, the first figure visualizes an example shape from each class, and the second figure visualizes the resulting pairwise distance matrices. The first row corresponds to Dataset I and the second corresponds to Dataset II.

Consider the discrete mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}^{1},\ldots,\mathbb{X}^{K}\), where \(\mathbb{X}^{k}=(X^{k},\|\cdot\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}},\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}p_{i}^{k} \delta_{x_{i}^{k}})\), with \(X^{k}=\{x_{i}^{k}\}_{i=1}^{n_{k}}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}\). We denote \(C^{k}=[\|x_{i}^{k}-x_{i}^{k}\|^{2}]_{i,i^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathrm{p}^{k}=[p_{1}^{k},\ldots,p_{n_{k}}^{k}]\). Given positive constants \(\lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{K}>0\), the PGW Barycenter is defined by:

\[\min_{C,\gamma_{k}}\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle M(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k},\gamma^{k }\rangle-2\lambda_{k}|\gamma^{k}|^{2}\] (19)

where each \(\gamma^{k}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{k})\). We refer to Appendix M for the solver of (19) and details.

**Experiment setup.** We apply the PGW barycenter to the following problem: Given two shapes \(X=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}}\) and \(Y=\{y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}\), modeled as mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,\|\cdot\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}}},\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}})\) and \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,\|\cdot\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}},\sum_{i=1}^{m}\delta_{y_{i}})\), we wish to find interpolations between them. In addition, we assume \(\mathbb{Y}\) is corrupted by noise, i.e., \(\mathbb{Y}\) is redefined as \(\mathbb{Y}=(\tilde{Y},\|\cdot\|_{\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}},\sum_{i=1}^{m}\delta_{y_ {i}}+\sum_{i=1}^{m\eta}\delta_{\tilde{y}_{i}})\) with \(\tilde{Y}=Y\cup\{\tilde{y}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\), where \(\eta\in[0,1]\) is the noise level and each \(\tilde{y}_{i}\) is randomly selected from a particular region \(\mathcal{R}\subset\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}\).

**Dataset setup.** We adapt the dataset given in [41]. See Appendix M.1 for further details on the dataset. In this experiment, we test \(\eta=5\%,10\%\). We visualize the barycenter interpolation from \(t=0/7\) to \(t=7/7\), where \((1-t),t\) are the weight of the source \(\mathbb{X}\) and the target \(\mathbb{Y}\), respectively, in the barycenter (19). The visualization given in Figure 3 is obtained by applying SMACOF MDS (multidimensional scaling) of the minimizer \(C\).

**Performance analysis**. From Figure 3, we observe that in this two scenarios, the interpolation derived from GW is clearly disturbed by the noise data points. For example, in rows \(1,3\), columns \(t=1/7,2/7,3/7\), we see that the point clouds reconstructed by MDS have significantly different width-height ratios from those of the source and target point clouds. In contrast, PGW is significantly less disturbed, and the interpolation is more natural. The width-height ratio of the point clouds generated by the PGW barycenter is consistent with that of the source/target point clouds.

## 6 Summary

In this paper, we propose the Partial Gromov-Wasserstein (PGW) problem and introduce two Frank-Wolfe solvers for it. As a byproduct, we provide pertinent theoretical results, including the relation between PGW and GW, the metric property of PGW, and the PGW barycenter. Furthermore, we demonstrate the efficacy of the PGW solver in solving shape-matching, shape retrieval, and shape interpolation tasks. For the shape retrieval experiment, we observe that due to the metric property, PGW and GW have similar accuracy and outperform the other methods evaluated. In the shape matching and point cloud interpolation experiments, we demonstrate PGW admits a more robust result when the data are corrupted by outliers/noisy data.

## Appendix B Proof of Proposition 3.2

The idea of the proof is inspired by the proof of Proposition 1 in [50].

The goal is to verify that

\[PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\] \[:=\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X,Y)}\underbrace{\int_{(X\times Y )^{2}}L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}}_{ \text{transport GW cost}}+\underbrace{\lambda\left(|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}|\right)}_{\text{mass penalty}}\] \[=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d_ {X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}+\lambda\left(|\mu^{ \otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}|\right).\] (21)

Consider \(\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y)\) such that \(\gamma_{1}\leq\mu\) does not hold. Then we can write the Lebesgue decomposition of \(\gamma_{1}\) with respect to \(\mu\):

\[\gamma_{1}=f\mu+\mu^{\perp},\]

where \(f\geq 0\) is the Radon-Nikodym derivative of \(\gamma_{1}\) with respect to \(\mu\), and \(\mu^{\perp},\mu\) are mutually singular, that is, there exist measurable sets \(A,B\) such that \(A\cap B=\emptyset\), \(X=A\cup B\) and \(\mu^{\perp}(A)=0,\mu(B)=0\). Without loss of generality, we can assume that the support of \(f\) lies on \(A\), since

\[\gamma_{1}(E)=\int_{E\cap A}f(x)\,d\mu(x)+\mu^{\perp}(E\cap B)\qquad\forall E \subseteq X\text{ measurable}.\]Define \(A_{1}=\{x\in A:\,f(x)>1\},A_{2}=\{x\in A:\,f(x)\leq 1\}\) (both are measurable, since \(f\) is measurable), and define \(\bar{\mu}=\min\{f,1\}\mu\). Then, \[\bar{\mu}\leq\mu\qquad\text{and}\qquad\bar{\mu}\leq f\mu\leq f\mu+\mu^{\perp}= \gamma_{1}.\] There exists a \(\bar{\gamma}\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y)\) such that \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}=\bar{\mu},\bar{\gamma}\leq\gamma\), and \(\bar{\gamma}_{2}\leq\gamma_{2}\). Indeed, we can construct \(\bar{\gamma}\) in the following way: First, let \(\{\gamma^{x}\}_{x\in X}\) be the set of conditional measures (disintegration) such that for every measurable (test) function \(\psi:X\times Y\to\mathbb{R}\) we have \[\int\psi(x,y)\,d\gamma(x,y)=\int_{X}\int_{Y}\psi(x,y)\,d\gamma^{x}(y)\,d\gamma _{1}(x).\] Then, define \(\bar{\gamma}\) as \[\bar{\gamma}(U):=\int_{X}\int_{Y}\mathbbm{1}_{U}(x,y)\,d\gamma^{x}(y)\,d\bar {\mu}(x)\qquad\forall U\subseteq X\times Y\text{ Borel}.\] Then, \(\bar{\gamma}\) verifies that \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}=\bar{\mu}\), and since \(\bar{\mu}\leq\gamma_{1}\), we also have that \(\bar{\gamma}\leq\gamma\), which implies \(\bar{\gamma}_{2}\leq\gamma_{2}\). Since \(|\gamma_{1}|=|\gamma_{2}|\) and \(|\bar{\gamma}_{1}|=|\bar{\gamma}_{2}|\), then we have \(|\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|=|\gamma_{2}^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{\otimes 2}|\). We claim that \[|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|\geq|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{ \otimes 2}|+|\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|.\] (22)
* _Left-hand side of (22)_: Since \(\{A,B\}\) is a partition of \(X\), we first spit the left-hand side of (22) as \[|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|= \underbrace{(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A )}_{(I)}+\underbrace{(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times B)+(\mu^{ \otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times A)}_{(II)}\] \[+\underbrace{(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times B )}_{(III)}.\] Then we have \[(III)=(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times B)=\mu^{\perp} \otimes\mu^{\perp}(B\times B)=|\mu^{\perp}|^{2},\] \[(II)=(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times B)+(\mu^{ \otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times A)=2|\mu^{\perp}|(\mu-\gamma_{1})(A).\] Since \(\gamma_{1}=f\mu\) in \(A\), then \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}=\gamma_{1}\) in \(A_{2}\) and \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}=\mu\) in \(A_{1}\), so we have \[(\mu-\gamma_{1})(A) =(\mu-\gamma_{1})(A_{1})+(\mu-\gamma_{1})(A_{2})=(\gamma_{1}-\bar {\gamma}_{1})(A_{1})+(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A_{2})\] \[=(\gamma_{1}-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A)+(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A).\] Thus, \[(II)=2|\mu^{\perp}|((\gamma_{1}-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A)+(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A )),\] and we also get that \[(I) =(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A)\] \[=(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{1}\times A_{1})+(\mu^{ \otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{2}\times A_{2})+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2})(A_{1}\times A_{2})\] \[\qquad+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{2}\times A_{1})\] \[=(\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{1}\times A _{1})+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{2}\times A_{2})+\] \[\qquad+|\bar{\gamma}_{1}\otimes\mu-\gamma_{1}\otimes\bar{\gamma}_{ 1}|(A_{1}\times A_{2})+|\mu\otimes\bar{\gamma}_{1}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}\otimes \gamma_{1}|(A_{2}\times A_{1})\] \[=(\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{1}\times A _{1})+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A_{2}\times A_{2})+2(\bar{\gamma}_{1}- \gamma_{1})(A_{1})(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A_{2})\] \[=(\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A )+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A)+\underbrace{2(\bar{\gamma}_{1}- \gamma_{1})(A_{1})(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(A_{2})}_{\geq 0}.\]
* _Right-hand side of (22):_ First notice that \[(\gamma_{1}-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(B)=(\gamma_{1}-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(B)\leq\gamma_{1 }(B)=|\mu^{\perp}|,\]and since \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}\leq\mu\) and \(\mu(B)=0\), we have

\[(\mu-\bar{\gamma}_{1})(B)=0.\]

Then,

\[|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|=\] \[=(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A)+( \gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A)+(\mu^{\otimes 2}- \bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times B)\] \[\quad+(\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B \times B)+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times B)+(\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times B)\] \[\quad+(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times A)+( \gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(B\times A)\] \[\leq\underbrace{(\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A \times A)+(\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2})(A\times A)}_{\leq(I)}+ \underbrace{|\mu^{\perp}|^{2}}_{=(III)}+\underbrace{2|\mu^{\perp}|(\gamma_{1}- \bar{\gamma}_{1})(A)}_{=(II)}.\]

Thus, (22) holds.

We finish the proof of the proposition by noting that

\[|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}- \bar{\gamma}_{2}^{\otimes 2}| \leq|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|-|\gamma_{1}^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{ \otimes 2}|\] \[=|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|-|\gamma_{2}^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{ \otimes 2}|\] \[\leq|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{ \otimes 2}-\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{\otimes 2}|\]

where the first inequality follows from (22), and the second inequality holds from the fact the total variation norm \(|\cdot|\) satisfies triangular inequality. Therefore \(\bar{\gamma}\) induces a smaller transport GW cost than \(\gamma\) (since \(\bar{\gamma}\leq\gamma\)), and also \(\bar{\gamma}\) decreases the mass penalty in comparison that corresponding to \(\gamma\). Thus, \(\bar{\gamma}\) is a better GW transportation plan, which satisfies \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}\leq\mu\). Similarly, we can further construct \(\bar{\gamma}^{\prime}\) based on \(\bar{\gamma}\) such that \(\bar{\gamma}_{1}^{\prime}\leq\mu,\bar{\gamma}_{2}^{\prime}\leq\nu\). Therefore, we can restrict the minimization in (9) from \(\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y)\) to \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\). Thus, the equality (21) is satisfied.

Proof of Remark 3.1.: Given \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), since \(\gamma_{1}\leq\mu\), \(\gamma_{2}\leq\nu\), and \(\gamma_{1}(X)=|\gamma_{1}|=|\gamma|=|\gamma_{2}|=\gamma_{2}(Y)\), we have

\[|\mu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{ \otimes 2}| =\mu^{\otimes 2}(X^{2})-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}(X^{2})+\nu^{ \otimes 2}(Y^{2})-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}(Y^{2})\] \[=|\mu|^{2}+|\nu|^{2}-2|\gamma|^{2},\]

and so the transportation cost in partial GW problem (10) becomes

\[C( \gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu)\] \[:=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{ \prime}))\,d\gamma(x,y)d\gamma(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})+\lambda\left(|\mu^{ \otimes 2}-\gamma_{1}^{\otimes 2}|+|\nu^{\otimes 2}-\gamma_{2}^{\otimes 2}|\right)\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{ \prime}))\,d\gamma(x,y)d\gamma(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})+\lambda\left(|\mu|^{2}+| \nu|^{2}-2|\gamma|^{2}\right)\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}\left(L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{\prime})-2\lambda)\ d\gamma(x,y)d\gamma(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})+\underbrace{ \lambda\left(|\mu|^{2}+|\nu|^{2}\right)}_{\text{does not depend on $\gamma$}}.\] (23)

## Appendix C Proof of Proposition 3.3

In this section, we discuss the minimizer of the Partial GW problem (9). Trivially, \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\subseteq\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y)\) and by using Proposition 3.2 it is enough to show that a minimizer for problem (10) exists.

We refer the reader to [8, Chapters 5 and 10] for similar ideas.

### Formal Statement of Proposition 3.3

_Suppose \(X,Y\) are compact sets, then exists compact set \([0,\beta]\subset\mathbb{R}\), such that_

\[d(x,x^{\prime}),\,d(y,y^{\prime})\in[0,\beta],\qquad\forall x,x^{\prime}\in X,y, \,y^{\prime}\in Y\]

_Let \(A=[0,\beta^{q}]\). Let \(L_{A^{2}}\) denote the restriction of \(L\) on \(A^{2}\), i.e. \(L_{A^{2}}:A^{2}\to\mathbb{R}\) with \(L_{A^{2}}(r_{1},r_{2})=L(r_{1},r_{2})\), \(\forall r_{1},r_{2}\in A\). Suppose \(L\) satisfies the following: there exists \(0<K<\infty\) such that for every \(r_{1},r_{1}^{\prime},r_{2},r_{2}^{\prime}\in A\),_

\[|L_{A^{2}}(r_{1},r_{2})-L_{A^{2}}(r_{1}^{\prime},r_{2})|\leq K|r_{1}-r_{1}^{ \prime}|,\,\,\,|L_{A^{2}}(r_{1},r_{2})-L_{A^{2}}(r_{1},r_{2}^{\prime})|\leq K| r_{2}-r_{2}^{\prime}|\] (24)

_(i.e., \(L_{A^{2}}\) is Lipschitz on each variable). Then \(PGW_{L}^{L}(\cdot,\cdot)\) admits a minimizer._

Note, the condition (24) contains the case \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{p}\) as a special case:

**Lemma C.1**.: _If \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{p}\), for \(1\leq p<\infty\), then \(L\) satisfies the condition (24)._

Proof.: Assume that \(L\) is defined on an interval of the form \([0,M]\), for some \(M>0\). Consider \(r_{1},r_{1}^{\prime},r_{2},r_{2}^{\prime}\in[0,M]\). If \(p=1\), by triangle inequality we have

\[|L(r_{1},r_{2})-L(r_{1}^{\prime},r_{2})|=||r_{1}-r_{2}|-|r_{1}^{\prime}-r_{2}| |\leq|r_{1}-r_{1}^{\prime}|\]

and similarly,

\[|L(r_{1},r_{2})-L(r_{1},r_{2}^{\prime})|\leq|r_{2}-r_{2}^{\prime}|.\]

From [8, page 473], since for \(1\leq p<\infty\), the function \(t\mapsto t^{p}\), for \(t\in[0,M]\), is Lipschitz with constant bounded by \(pM^{p-1}\), we have

\[|L(r_{1},r_{2})-L(r_{1}^{\prime},r_{2})|\leq pM^{p-1}|r_{1}-r_{1}^{\prime}|.\]

and similarly,

\[|L(r_{1},r_{2})-L(r_{1},r_{2}^{\prime})|\leq pM^{p-1}|r_{2}-r_{2}^{\prime}|.\]

**Lemma C.2**.: _Given \(q\geq 1\), consider \(\beta>0\). Then \([0,\beta]\ni c\mapsto c^{q}\in[0,\beta^{q}]\) is a Lipschitz function._

Proof.: Given \(c_{1},c_{2}\in[0,\beta]\), we have

\[|c_{1}^{q}-c_{2}^{q}|\leq q\beta^{q-1}|c_{1}-c_{2}|\] (25)

Thus, \(c\mapsto c^{q}\) is a Lipschitz function. 

### Convergence Auxiliary Result

If a sequence \(\{\gamma^{n}\}\) converges weakly to \(\gamma\), we write \(\gamma^{n}\stackrel{{\underline{w}}}{{\rightharpoonup}}\gamma\). In this setting, if \(\gamma^{n}\stackrel{{\underline{w}}}{{\rightharpoonup}}\gamma\), it does not imply that \((\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}\stackrel{{\underline{w}}}{{\rightharpoonup}} \gamma^{\otimes 2}\). Thus, the technique used in classical OT for proving the existence of a minimizer for the optimal transport optimization problem as a consequence of the Stone-Weierstrass theorem does not apply directly in the Gromov-Wasserstein context.

Inspired by [8], we introduce the following lemma.

**Lemma C.3**.: _Given metric space \((Z,d_{Z})\), suppose \(\phi:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}\) is a Lipschitz continuous function with respect to \((Z^{2},d_{Z}^{+})\), where_

\[d_{Z}^{+}((z_{1},z_{2}),(z_{1}^{\prime},z_{2}^{\prime})):=d_{Z}(z_{1},z_{1}^{ \prime})+d_{Z}(z_{2},z_{2}^{\prime}),\qquad\forall(z_{1},z_{2}),(z_{1}^{ \prime},z_{2}^{\prime})\in Z^{2}.\]

_Given \(\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(Z)\), and a sequence \(\{\gamma^{n}\}_{n\geq 1}\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(Z)\) such that converges weakly to \(\gamma\),_

\[\gamma^{n}\stackrel{{\underline{w}}}{{\rightharpoonup}}\gamma \qquad(n\to\infty).\]

_Finally, consider the mapping_

\[Z\ni z\mapsto\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot)):=\int_{Z}\phi(z,z^{\prime})d\gamma(z^{ \prime})\in\mathbb{R}.\]

_Then we have the following results:_1. \(\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))\to\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot))\) _uniformly (when_ \(n\to\infty\)_)._
2. \((\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}(\phi(\cdot,\cdot))\to\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi(\cdot, \cdot))\) _(when_ \(n\to\infty\)_)._
3. _If_ \(\mathcal{M}\subset\mathcal{M}_{+}(Z)\) _is compact for the weak convergence, then_ \(\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi(\cdot,\cdot))\) _admits a minimizer._

Proof.: The main idea of the proof is similar to [8, Lemma 10.3]: we extend it from \(\mathcal{P}_{+}(Z)\) to \(\mathcal{M}_{+}(Z)\).

1. Since \(\gamma^{n}\stackrel{{ w}}{{\rightharpoonup}}\gamma\), and \(Z\) is compact, we have \(|\gamma^{n}|\to|\gamma|\). Then, given \(\epsilon>0\), for \(n\) sufficiently large we have \(|\gamma^{n}|\leq|\gamma|+\epsilon\). Let us denote by \(\|\phi\|_{Lip}\) the Lipschitz constant of \(\phi\). For any \(z_{1},z_{2}\in Z\), we have: \[|\gamma^{n}(\phi(z_{1},\cdot))-\gamma^{n}(\phi(z_{2},\cdot))| \leq\int_{Z}|\phi(z_{1},z)-\phi(z_{2},z)|\gamma^{n}(z)\] \[\leq\max_{z\in Z}|\phi(z_{1},z)-\phi(z_{2},z)|(|\gamma|+\epsilon)\] \[\leq(|\gamma|+\epsilon)\|\phi\|_{Lip}\,d_{Z}(z_{1},z_{2})=Kd_{Z} (z_{1},z_{2}),\] where \(K=(|\gamma|+\epsilon)\|\phi\|_{Lip}\) is a finite positive value. Note that the above inequality also holds if we replace \(\gamma^{n}\) by \(\gamma\). Since \((Z,d_{Z})\) is compact, \(Z=\bigcup_{i=1}^{N}B(z_{i},\epsilon/K)\) for some \(z_{1},\ldots,z_{N}\in Z\), where \(B(z_{i},\epsilon/3K)=\{z\in Z:\,d_{Z}(z,z_{i})\leq\epsilon/3K\}\) is the closed ball centered at \(z_{i}\), with radius \(\epsilon/K\). By definition of weak convergence, when \(n\) is sufficiently large, \[|\gamma^{n}(\phi(z_{i},\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z_{i},\cdot))|<\epsilon/3,\qquad \text{for each }i\in[1:N].\] Given \(z\in Z\), then \(z\in B(z_{i})\) for some \(z_{i}\). For sufficiently large \(n\), we have: \[|\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot))|\] \[\leq|\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))-\gamma^{n}(\phi(z_{i},\cdot))|+| \gamma^{n}(\phi(z_{i},\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z_{i},\cdot))|+|\gamma(\phi(z_{i}, \cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot))|\] \[\leq Kd(z,z_{i})+\epsilon/3+Kd(z,z_{i})=\epsilon/3+\epsilon/3+ \epsilon/3=\epsilon.\] (26) Thus we prove the first statement.
2. We recall that we do not have \((\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}\stackrel{{ w}}{{\rightharpoonup}}\gamma^{\otimes 2}\). Consider an arbitrary \(\epsilon>0\). We have, \[0 \leq\limsup_{n\to\infty}|(\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}(\phi)-(\gamma)^{ \otimes 2}(\phi)|\] (27) \[\leq\limsup_{n\to\infty}\underbrace{|(\gamma^{n}\otimes\gamma^{n })(\phi)-(\gamma\otimes\gamma^{n})(\phi)|}_{A_{n}}+\limsup_{n\to\infty} \underbrace{|(\gamma^{n}\otimes\gamma)(\phi)-(\gamma\otimes\gamma)(\phi)|}_{B_ {n}}.\] For the first term, when \(n\) is sufficiently large, by statement (1), we have: \[A_{n} =\int\left(\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot))\,d \gamma^{n}(z)\right.\] \[\leq\max_{z}|\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot)|| \gamma^{n}|\] \[\leq\epsilon(|\gamma|+\epsilon)\] (28) Thus, \(\limsup_{n}A=\lim_{n}A=0\). Similarly, for the second term, when \(n\) is sufficiently large, we have \[B_{n}:=\int(\gamma^{n}(\phi(z,\cdot))-\gamma(\phi(z,\cdot)))d\gamma(z)\leq \epsilon|\gamma|.\] (29) Thus, \(\limsup_{n}B_{n}=\lim_{n}B_{n}=0\). Therefore, from (27), (28) and (29), we obtain \[\limsup_{n\to\infty}|(\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}(\phi)-(\gamma)^{\otimes 2}(\phi)|= \lim_{n\to\infty}|(\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}(\phi)-(\gamma)^{\otimes 2}(\phi)|=0.\] (30)3. Let \(\gamma^{n}\in\mathcal{M}\) be a sequence such that \((\gamma^{n})^{\otimes 2}(\phi)\) (weakly) converges to \(\inf_{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi)\). Since \(\mathcal{M}\) is compact, there exists a sub-sequence \(\gamma^{n_{k}}\stackrel{{ w}}{{\to}}\gamma\) for some \(\gamma\in\mathcal{M}\). Then, by statement (2), we have: \[\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi)=\lim_{k}(\gamma^{n_{k}})^{\otimes 2}(\phi)=\inf_{ \gamma\in\mathcal{M}}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi),\] and we complete the proof.

### Proof of the Formal Statement for Proposition 3.3

The proof follows the ideas of [8, Corollary 10.1].

Define \((Z,d_{Z})\) as \(Z:=X\times Y\), with \(d_{Z}((x,y),(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})):=d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})+d_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})\).

We claim that the following mapping

\[(X\times Y)^{2}=Z^{2} \to\mathbb{R}\] \[((x,y),(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})) \mapsto\phi((x,y),(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})):=L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{ \prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))-2\lambda\]

is a Lipschitz function with respect to \(d_{Z}^{+}\), where \(L\) satisfies (24). Indeed, given \(((x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{1}^{\prime},y_{1}^{\prime})),((x_{2},y_{2}),(x_{2}^{\prime },y_{2}^{\prime}))\in Z^{2}\), we have:

\[|\phi((x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{1}^{\prime},y_{1}^{\prime}))-\phi((x_{2}, y_{2}),(x_{2}^{\prime},y_{2}^{\prime}))|\] \[=|L(d_{X}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime}))-L(d_ {X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{2},y_{2}^{\prime}))|\] \[\leq|L(d_{X}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime}))-L( d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime}))|\] \[\quad+|L(d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime}) )-L(d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y_{2},y_{2}^{\prime}))|\] \[\leq K|d_{X}^{q}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime})-d_{X}^{q}(x_{2},x_{2}^{ \prime})|+K|d_{Y}^{q}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime})-d_{Y}^{q}(y_{2},y_{2}^{\prime})|\] \[\leq K^{\prime}|d_{X}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime})-d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{ \prime})|+K^{\prime}|d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{1}^{\prime})-d_{Y}(y_{2},y_{2}^{\prime})|\] (31) \[\leq K^{\prime}(d_{X}(x_{1},x_{2}^{\prime})+d_{X}(x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime}))+K^{\prime}(d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{2})+d_{Y}(y_{1}^{\prime},y_{2}^{ \prime}))\] (32) \[=K^{\prime}\left[(d_{X}(x_{1},x_{2})+d_{Y}(y_{1},y_{2}))+((d_{X}( x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime})+d_{Y}(y_{1}^{\prime},y_{2}^{\prime}))]\right.\] \[=K^{\prime}\left[d_{Z}((x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2}))+d_{Z}((x_{1}^ {\prime},y_{1}^{\prime}),(x_{2}^{\prime},y_{2}^{\prime}))\right]\] \[=K^{\prime}d_{Z}^{\prime}((x_{1},y_{1}),(x_{2},y_{2})),((x_{1},y_ {1}),(x_{2},y_{2})))\]

where in (31), \(K^{\prime}=q\beta^{q-1}K\); the inequality holds by lemma C.2; The inequality (32) follows from the triangle inequality:

\[d_{X}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime})-d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime}) \leq d_{X}(x_{1},x_{2})+d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime})+d_{X}(x_{2}^{ \prime},x_{1}^{\prime})-d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime})\] \[=d_{X}(x_{1},x_{2})+d_{X}(x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime}),\]

and similarly,

\[d_{X}(x_{2},x_{2}^{\prime})-d_{X}(x_{1},x_{1}^{\prime})\leq d_{X}(x_{1},x_{2})+ d_{X}(x_{1}^{\prime},x_{2}^{\prime}).\]

Let \(\mathcal{M}=\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\). From [53, Proposition B.1], we have that \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) is a compact set with respect to the weak convergence topology.

By Lemma (C.3) part (3), we have the PGW problem, which can be written as

\[\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(\phi)+\lambda(|\mu|^{2}+| \nu|^{2})\]

admits a solution, i.e., a minimizer \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\). Therefore, we end the proof of Proposition 3.3.

## Appendix D Proof of Proposition 3.4: Metric Property of Partial GW

Let \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=D^{p}(r_{1},r_{2})\) for a metric \(D\) on \(\mathbb{R}\), and since all the metrics in \(\mathbb{R}\) are equivalent, for simplicity, consider \(D(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|.\) (Notice that this satisfies the hypothesis of Proposition H.1 used in the experiments).

Consider the GW problem, for \(q\geq 1\),

\[GW^{L}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y )^{2}}L(d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime}))\,d\gamma^{\otimes 2},\] (33)

or, in particular,

\[GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y )^{2}}|d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})-d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})|^{p}\,d\gamma^{\otimes 2}.\] (34)

For probability mm-spaces we have the equivalence relation \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) if and only if \(GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\). By [8, Chapter 5], \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) is equivalent to the following: there exists a bijective isometry mapping \(\phi:X\to Y\), such that

\[d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})-d_{Y}(\phi(x),\phi(x^{\prime}))=0,\quad\mu^{ \otimes 2}-a.s.\] \[\phi_{\#}\mu=\nu.\]

**Remark D.1**.: _In the literature, the case where \(q=1\) is the most frequently considered problem. In particular, in [8] it is stated the equivalence relation \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) if and only if there exists \(\phi:X\to Y\) such that \(\phi_{\#}\mu=\nu\) and \(d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})=d_{Y}(\phi(x),\phi(x^{\prime}))\ \mu^{\otimes 2}-a.s.\) if and only if \(GW^{p}_{1}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\). Thus, \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) is also equivalent to have \(\phi:X\to Y\) such that \(\phi_{\#}\mu=\nu\) and \(d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})=d_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})\)\(\gamma^{\otimes 2}-a.s.\) where \(\gamma\) is a minimizer for \(GW^{p}_{1}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\). So, in this situation we also have \(d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})=d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})\ \gamma^{\otimes 2}-a.s.\) for any given \(q\geq 1\). Therefore, \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) if and only if \(GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\)._

### Formal Statement of Proposition 3.4

We first introduce the formal statement of Proposition 3.4. To do so, we extend the equivalence relation \(\sim\) to all mm-spaces (not only probability mm-spaces): Given arbitrary mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), where \(X,Y\) are compact and \(\mu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X)\), \(\nu\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(Y)\), we write \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\) if and only if they have the same total mass (i.e., \(|\mu|=\mu(X)=\nu(Y)=|\nu|\)) and \(GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\).

_Formal statement of Proposition 3.4:_ Given \(\lambda>0\), \(1\leq p,q<\infty\), then \((PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\cdot,\cdot))^{1/p}\) defines a metric among mm-spaces under taking quotient with respect to the equivalence relation \(\sim\).

Next, we discuss its proof.

### Non-Negativity and Symmetry Properties

It is straightforward to verify \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\geq 0\), and that \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{Y}, \mathbb{X})\). In what follows, we will concentrate on proving \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\) if and only if \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\):

\[0\leq PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\leq GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X}, \mathbb{Y})=0,\]

where the inequality follows from the fact \(\Gamma(\mu,\nu)\subseteq\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\). Thus, \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\).

For the other direction, suppose that \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\). We claim that \(|\mu|=|\nu|\) and that there exist an optimal plan \(\gamma\) for \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\) such that \(|\mu|=|\gamma|=|\nu|\). Let us prove this by contradiction. Assume \(|\mu|<|\nu|\). For convenience, suppose \(|\mu|^{2}\leq|\nu|^{2}-\epsilon\), for some \(\epsilon>0\). Then, for each \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), we have \(|\gamma^{\otimes 2}|\leq|\mu|^{2}\leq|\nu|^{2}-\epsilon\), and so

\[PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\geq\lambda(|\mu|^{2}+|\nu|^{2}-2| \gamma|^{2})\geq\lambda(|\nu^{2}|-|\gamma|^{2})\geq\lambda\epsilon>0.\]

Thus, \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})>0\), which is a contradiction. So, \(|\mu|=|\nu|\). In addition, if \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) is optimal for \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\), we have \(|\gamma|=|\mu|=|\nu|\), thus \(\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)\). Therefore, since \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\), and for such optimal \(\gamma\) we have \(|\gamma|=|\mu|=|\nu|\), we obtain

\[\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}|d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})-d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})|^{p}d \gamma^{\otimes 2}=0.\]

As a result, \(d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})=d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})\ \gamma^{\otimes 2}-a.s.\), which implies that \(GW^{p}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=0\), and so \(\mathbb{X}\sim\mathbb{Y}\).

### Triangle Inequality - Strategy: Convert the PGW Problem into a GW Problem

Consider three arbitrary mm-spaces \(\mathbb{S}=(S,d_{S},\sigma)\), \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\). We define \(\hat{\mathbb{S}}=(\hat{S},d_{\hat{S}},\hat{\sigma})\), \(\hat{\mathbb{X}}=(\hat{X},d_{\hat{S}},\hat{\mu})\), \(\hat{\mathbb{Y}}=(\hat{Y},d_{\hat{Y}},\hat{\nu})\) in a similar way to that of Proposition G.1 but now aiming to have new spaces with equal total mass:

First, introduce auxiliary points \(\hat{\infty}_{0},\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{2}\) and set

\[\begin{cases}\hat{S}&=S\cup\{\hat{\infty}_{0},\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_ {2}\},\\ \hat{X}&=X\cup\{\hat{\infty}_{0},\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{2}\},\\ \hat{Y}&=Y\cup\{\hat{\infty}_{0},\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{2}\}.\end{cases}\]

Define \(\hat{\sigma},\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu}\) as follows:

\[\begin{cases}\hat{\sigma}&=\sigma+|\mu|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{1}}+|\nu|\delta_ {\hat{\infty}_{2}},\\ \hat{\mu}&=\mu+|\sigma|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{0}}+|\nu|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{2} },\\ \hat{\nu}&=\nu+|\sigma|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{0}}+|\mu|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{1}}.\end{cases}\] (35)

Note that \(\hat{\sigma}\) is not supported on point \(\hat{\infty}_{0}\), similarly, \(\hat{\mu}\) is not supported on \(\hat{\infty}_{1}\), \(\hat{\nu}\) is not supported on \(\hat{\infty}_{2}\). In addition, we have \(|\hat{\mu}|=|\hat{\nu}|=|\hat{\sigma}|=|\mu|+|\nu|+|\sigma|\). (For a similar idea in classical unbalanced optimal transport see, for example, [16].)

Finally, define \(d_{\hat{S}}:\hat{S}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\) as follows:

\[d_{\hat{S}}(s,s^{\prime})=\begin{cases}d_{S}(s,s^{\prime})&\text{if }(s,s^{ \prime})\in S^{2},\\ \infty&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}\] (36)

Note, \(d_{\hat{S}}(\cdot,\cdot)\) is not a rigorous metric in \(\hat{S}\) since we allow \(d_{\hat{S}}=\infty\). Similarly, define \(d_{\hat{X}},d_{\hat{Y}}\). As a result, we have constructed new spaces

\[\hat{\mathbb{S}}=(\hat{S},d_{\hat{S}},\hat{\sigma}),\quad\hat{\mathbb{X}}=( \hat{X},d_{\hat{X}},\hat{\mu}),\quad\hat{\mathbb{Y}}=(\hat{Y},d_{\hat{Y}},\hat {\nu}).\] (37)

We define the following mapping \(D_{\lambda}:(\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\})\times(\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\})\to \mathbb{R}_{+}\):

\[D_{\lambda}^{p}(r_{1},r_{2})=\begin{cases}|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{p}&\text{if }r_{1},r_{2}<\infty,\\ \lambda&\text{if }r_{1}=\infty,r_{2}<\infty\text{ or vice versa},\\ 0&\text{if }r_{1}=r_{2}=\infty.\end{cases}\] (38)

Note that \(D_{\lambda}\) is not a rigorous metric since it may sometimes violate triangle inequality. See the following lemma for a detailed and precise explanation.

**Lemma D.2**.: _Let \(D_{\lambda}(\cdot,\cdot)\) denote the function defined in (38). For any \(r_{0},r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\), we have the following:_

* \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})\geq 0\)_._ \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=0\) _if and only if_ \(r_{1}=r_{2}\)_, where_ \(r_{1}=r_{2}\) _denotes that_ \(r_{1}=r_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\) _or_ \(r_{1}=r_{2}=\infty\)_._
* _Except the case_ \(r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathbb{R},r_{0}=\infty\)_, for all other cases, we have_ \[D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})\leq D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{0})+D_{\lambda}(r_{2},r_{0}).\]

Proof of Lemma D.2.: It is straightforward to verify \(D_{\lambda}(\cdot,\cdot)\geq 0\).

Now, consider \(r_{0},r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\). If \(r_{1}=r_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\) or \(r_{1}=r_{2}=\infty\), we have \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=0\). Otherwise, \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})>0\). So, \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=0\) if and only if \(r_{1}=r_{2}\).

For the second item, we have the following cases:

Case 1: \(r_{1},r_{2},r_{0}\in\mathbb{R}\),

\[D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2}) =|r_{1}-r_{2}|\] \[\leq|r_{1}-r_{2}|+|r_{2}-r_{0}|\] \[=D_{\lambda}(r_{0},r_{1})+D_{\lambda}(r_{0},r_{2})\]

Case 2: \(r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathbb{R},r_{0}=\infty\). We do not need to verify the inequality in this case.

Case 3: \(r_{1}\in\mathbb{R},r_{2},r_{0}=\infty\), or \(r_{1}=\infty,r_{2}\in\mathbb{R},r_{0}=\infty\). In this case, we have

\[D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{0})=\sqrt{\lambda},D_{\lambda}(r_{ 2},r_{0})=0\]

and it is straightforward to verify the inequality.

Case 4: \(r_{1},r_{2}=\infty,r_{3}\in\mathbb{R}\). In this case, we have \(D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=0\leq D_{\lambda}(r_{0},r_{1})+D_{\lambda}(r_{0},r_{2})\).

Case 5: \(r_{1},r_{2},r_{0}=\infty\). In this case, we have

\[D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2})=D_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{0})=D_{\lambda}(r_{2},r_{0})=0\]

and it is straightforward to verify the inequality. 

We construct the following _generalized GW problem_:

\[GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}}):=\inf_{\hat{\gamma}\in \Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})}\underbrace{\int_{(\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})^{2}}D^{p }_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))\,d \hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}}_{\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\lambda,\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})}.\] (39)

Similarly, we define \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{S}})\), and \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\).

The mapping (6) is modified as:

\[\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma,\mu)\ni\gamma^{01}\mapsto\hat{\gamma}^{01} \in\Gamma(\hat{\sigma},\hat{\mu}),\] \[\hat{\gamma}^{01}:=\gamma^{01}+(\sigma-\gamma_{1}^{01})\otimes \delta_{\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{0}}}+\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{1}}\otimes(\mu-\gamma _{2}^{01})+|\gamma|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{0}}+|\nu|\delta_{ \hat{\infty}_{2},\hat{\infty}_{2}};\] \[\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma,\nu)\ni\gamma^{02}\mapsto\hat{\gamma}^{02} \in\Gamma(\hat{\sigma},\hat{\nu}),\] \[\hat{\gamma}^{02}:=\gamma^{02}+(\sigma-\gamma_{1}^{02})\otimes \delta_{\hat{\infty}_{0}}+\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{2}}\otimes(\nu-\gamma_{2}^{02 })+|\gamma|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{2},\hat{\infty}_{0}}+|\mu|\delta_{\hat{ \infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{1}};\] \[\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\ni\gamma^{12}\mapsto\hat{\gamma}^{12} \in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu}),\] \[\hat{\gamma}^{12}:=\gamma^{12}+(\mu-\gamma_{1}^{12})\otimes \delta_{\hat{\infty}_{1}}+\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{2}}\otimes(\nu-\gamma_{2}^{1 2})+|\gamma|\delta_{\hat{\infty}_{2},\hat{\infty}_{1}}+|\mu|\delta_{\hat{ \infty}_{0},\hat{\infty}_{0}}.\] (40)

It is straightforward to verify the above mappings are well-defined. In addition, we can observe that, for each \(\gamma^{01}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma,\mu),\gamma^{02}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma, \nu),\gamma^{12}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\),

\[\hat{\gamma}^{01}(\{\hat{\infty}_{2}\}\times X) =\hat{\gamma}^{01}(S\times\{\hat{\infty}_{2}\})=0,\] (41) \[\hat{\gamma}^{02}(\{\hat{\infty}_{1}\}\times Y) =\hat{\gamma}^{02}(S\times\{\hat{\infty}_{1}\})=0,\] (42) \[\hat{\gamma}^{12}(\{\hat{\infty}_{0}\}\times Y) =\hat{\gamma}^{12}(X\times\{\hat{\infty}_{0}\})=0.\]

**Proposition D.3**.: _If \(\gamma^{12}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) is optimal in PGW problem \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\), then \(\hat{\gamma}^{12}\) defined in (40) is optimal in generalized GW problem \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\). Furthermore, \(\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma}^{12};\lambda,\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})=C(\gamma^{12};\lambda, \mu,\nu),\) and thus,_

\[PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}}, \hat{\mathbb{Y}}).\]

Proof of Proposition D.3.: For each \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), define \(\hat{\gamma}\) by (40).

Note that if we merge the points \(\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{2},\hat{\infty}_{3}\) as \(\hat{\infty}\), i.e.

\[\hat{\infty}=\hat{\infty}_{1}=\hat{\infty}_{2}=\hat{\infty}_{3},\]

the value \(\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\lambda,\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})\) will not change. Thus, we merge these three auxiliary points.

We have:

\[\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\lambda,\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})=\int_{(\hat{X} \times\hat{Y})^{2}}D^{p}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y} }(x,x^{\prime}))d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}|d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})-d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{ \prime})|^{p}d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\int_{(\{\delta\}\times Y)^{2}}\lambda d \hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\int_{(X\times\{\delta\})^{2}}\lambda\hat{\gamma}^{ \otimes 2}\] \[\quad+2\int_{(\{\delta\}\times Y)\times(X\times\{\delta\})}D^{p} _{\lambda}(\infty,\infty)d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+2\int_{(\{\delta\}\times\{ \delta\})\times(X\times Y)}D^{p}_{\lambda}(\infty,\infty)d\hat{\gamma}^{ \otimes 2}\] \[\quad+2\int_{(\{\delta\}\times\{Y\})\times\{\delta\}^{2}}D^{p}_{ \lambda}(\infty,\infty)d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+2\int_{(X\times\{\delta\}) \times\{\delta\}^{2}}D^{p}_{\lambda}(\infty,\infty)d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}|d^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime})-d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{ \prime})|^{p}d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\] \[\quad+2\lambda(|\nu|-|\gamma|)|\gamma|+\lambda(|\nu|-|\gamma|)^{ 2}+2\lambda(|\mu|-|\gamma|)|\gamma|+\lambda(|\mu|-|\gamma|)^{2}\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}|d^{q}_{X}(x,y^{\prime})-d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{ \prime})|^{p}\,d\gamma^{\otimes 2})+\lambda(|\nu^{2}|+|\mu|^{2}-2|\gamma|^{2})=C( \gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu).\]

As we merged the points \(\hat{\infty}_{1},\hat{\infty}_{2},\hat{\infty}_{3}\), by [40, Proposition B.1.], the mapping \(\gamma\mapsto\hat{\gamma}\) defined in (40) is a bijection. Then, if \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) is optimal for the PGW problem \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\) (defined in (10)), \(\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})\) is optimal for generalized GW problem \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\) (defined in (39)). Therefore,

\[GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})=PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}( \mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}).\]

**Proposition D.4** (Triangle inequality for \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\cdot,\cdot)\)).: _Consider the generalized GW problem (39). Then, for any \(p\in[1,\infty)\), we have_

\[GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\leq GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}( \hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{X}})+GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{ \mathbb{Y}}).\]

Proof of Proposition D.4.: We prove the case \(p=2\). For general \(p\geq 1\), it can be proved similarly.

Choose an optimal \(\gamma^{12}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) for \(PGW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\), an optimal \(\gamma^{01}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma,\mu)\) for \(PGW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{X})\), and an optimal \(\gamma^{02}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\sigma,\nu)\) for \(PGW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{Y})\). Construct \(\hat{\gamma}^{12},\hat{\gamma}^{01},\hat{\gamma}^{02}\) by (40).

By Proposition D.3, we have that \(\hat{\gamma}^{12}\), \(\hat{\gamma}^{01}\), \(\hat{\gamma}^{02}\) are optimal for \(GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\), \(GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{X}})\), \(GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\), respectively.

Define canonical projection mapping

\[\pi_{0,1}: (\hat{S}\times\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})\rightarrow(\hat{S}\times\hat{X})\] \[(s,x,y)\mapsto(s,x).\]

Similarly, we define \(\pi_{0,2},\pi_{1,2}\).

By _gluing lemma_ (see Lemma 5.5 [54]), there exists \(\hat{\gamma}\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(\hat{S}\times\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})\), such that \((\pi_{0,1})_{\#}\hat{\gamma}=\hat{\gamma}^{01},(\pi_{0,2})_{\#}\hat{\gamma}=\hat {\gamma}^{02}\). Thus, \((\pi_{1,2})_{\#}\hat{\gamma}\) is a coupling between \(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu}\). We have

\[GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}) =\int_{(\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x, x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))d(\hat{\gamma}^{12})^{\otimes 2}\] \[\leq\int_{(\hat{S}\times\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^ {q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))d\hat{\gamma}^{ \otimes 2}.\] (43)

The inequality holds since \((\pi_{1,2})_{\#}\hat{\gamma},\hat{\gamma}^{12}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})\), and \(\hat{\gamma}^{12}\) is optimal.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:26]

Following (43) and (47), we have

\[GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\leq\left( \int_{(\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}}\times\hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}}D^{2} _{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))d\hat{ \gamma}^{\otimes 2}\right)^{1/2}\] \[\leq\left(\int_{(\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}}\times \hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}(s,s^{\prime} ),d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\right)^{1/2}\] \[\qquad+\left(\int_{(\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}} \times\hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}(s,s^{ \prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\right)^{1/2}\] (48) \[=\left(\int_{(\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}}\times \hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}(s,s^{\prime} ),d^{q}_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime}))d(\gamma^{01})^{\otimes 2}\right)^{1/2}\] \[\qquad+\left(\int_{(\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}} \times\hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}}D^{2}_{\lambda}(d^{q}_{\hat{\mathcal{S}}}(s,s^{ \prime}),d^{q}_{\hat{Y}}(y,y^{\prime}))d(\gamma^{02})^{\otimes 2}\right)^{1/2}\] \[=GW^{2}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{X}})+GW^{2}_{ \lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}}),\]

where in the third inequality (48) we used the Minkowski inequality in \(L^{2}((\hat{\mathcal{S}}\times\hat{\mathcal{X}}\times\hat{\mathcal{Y}})^{2}, \hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2})\). 

Now, we can complete the proof of Proposition 3.4: By the Propositions D.3, we have

\[PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X} },\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\]

and similarly for \(PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}\) and \((\mathbb{S},\mathbb{X}),PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{Y})\). By the Proposition D.4, \(GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\cdot,\cdot)\) satisfies the triangle inequality, thus we complete the proof:

\[PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}) =GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\] \[\leq GW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{X}})+GW^{p }_{\lambda,q}(\hat{\mathbb{S}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\] \[=PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{S},\mathbb{X})+PGW^{p}_{\lambda,q}( \mathbb{S},\mathbb{Y}).\]

## Appendix E Proof of Proposition 3.5: PGW converges to GW as \(\lambda\to\infty\).

In the main text, we set \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\). In this section, we discuss the limit case that when \(\lambda\to\infty\).

**Lemma E.1**.: _Suppose \(|\mu|\leq|\nu|\), for each \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), there exists \(\gamma^{\prime}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) such that \(\gamma\leq\gamma^{\prime}\) and \((\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma^{\prime}=\mu\)._

Proof.: Let \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\).

If \(|\gamma|=|\mu|\), then we have \((\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma=\mu\).

If \(|\gamma|<|\mu|\), let \(\mu^{r}=\mu-(\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma,\nu^{r}=\nu-(\pi_{2})_{\#}\gamma\). We have that \(\mu^{r},\nu^{r}\) are non-negative measures, with \(|\mu^{r}|=|\mu|-|\gamma|>0\). If we define

\[\gamma^{\prime}:=\gamma+\frac{1}{|\nu|-|\gamma|}\mu^{r}\otimes\nu^{r},\]

we obtain \(\gamma\leq\gamma^{\prime}\). In addition, we have:

\[(\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma^{\prime}=(\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma+\mu^{r}\frac{|\nu^{r}|}{| \nu|-|\gamma|}=(\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma+\mu^{r}=\mu,\]

\[(\pi_{2})_{\#}\gamma^{\prime}=(\pi_{2})_{\#}\gamma+\nu^{r}\frac{|\mu^{r}|}{| \nu|-|\gamma|}\leq(\pi_{2})_{\#}\gamma+\nu^{r}\frac{|\nu^{r}|}{|\nu|-|\gamma|}=\nu.\]

Thus, \(\gamma^{\prime}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) and \((\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma^{\prime}=\mu\).

**Lemma E.2**.: _Given general mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), where \(\mu,\nu\) are supported on bounded sets (in general, it is assumed that \(X\) and \(Y\) are compact, and that \(\text{supp}(\mu)=X\), \(\text{supp}(\nu)=Y\)), consider the problem problem \(PGW^{L}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\) with \(L(r_{1},r_{2})\) a continuous functions. If \(\lambda\) is sufficiently large, for all optimal \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) we have \(|\gamma|=\min(|\mu|,|\nu|)\)._

Proof.: We prove it for \(q=1\), for a general \(q\geq 1\), it can be proved similarly.

Without loss of generality, suppose \(|\mu|\leq|\nu|\).

Since \(\mu,\nu\) are supported on bounded sets, there exists \(A=[0,M]\) such that \(d_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y,y^{\prime})\in A\) for all \(x,x^{\prime}\in\text{supp}(\mu),y,y^{\prime}\in\text{supp}(\nu)\).

Thus, the restriction of \(L\) on \(A^{2}\), denoted as \(L_{A^{2}}\), is continuous on \(A^{2}\), and thus it is bounded. So, consider

\[\text{m}:=\max_{r_{1},r_{2}\in A}(L(r_{1},r_{2}))\geq L(d_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d _{Y}(y,y^{\prime})),\quad\forall x,x^{\prime}\in\text{supp}(\mu),y,y^{\prime} \in\text{supp}(\nu).\]

Suppose \(2\lambda\geq\text{m}+1\), and assume that there exists a optimal \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) such that \(|\gamma|<|\mu|\). By Lemma E.1, there exists \(\gamma^{\prime}\) such that \(\gamma\leq\gamma^{\prime},(\pi_{1})_{\#}\gamma^{\prime}=\mu\). Thus, we have

\[C(\gamma^{\prime};\lambda,\mu,\nu)-C(\gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu) =\int_{(X\times Y)}L(d_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}(y,y^{\prime}))-2 \lambda\,d((\gamma^{\prime})^{\otimes 2}-(\gamma)^{\otimes 2})\] \[\leq\int_{(X\times Y)}\text{m}-2\lambda\,d((\gamma^{\prime})^{ \otimes 2}-(\gamma)^{\otimes 2})\] \[=-(|\gamma^{\prime}|^{2}-|\gamma|^{2})=-(|\mu|^{2}-|\gamma|^{2})<0,\]

which is contradiction since \(\gamma\) is optimal, and so we have completed the proof. 

**Lemma E.3**.: _Consider probability mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), that is, with \(|\mu|=|\nu|=1\). Then, for each \(\lambda>0\), we have_

\[PGW^{L}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\leq GW^{L}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{ Y}).\]

Proof.: In this setting, we have \(\Gamma(\mu,\nu)\subset\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), and thus

\[PGW^{L}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\] \[=\inf_{\Gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d ^{q}_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}+\lambda(|\mu|^{2}+| \nu|^{2}-2|\gamma|^{2})\] \[\leq\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d^{q}_ {X}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime}))+\lambda(|\mu|^{2}+|\nu|^{2}-2| \gamma|^{2})d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\] \[=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)}\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d^{q}_{X} (x,x^{\prime}),d^{q}_{Y}(y,y^{\prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\] \[=GW^{L}_{q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}).\]

Based on the above properties, we can now prove Proposition 3.5:

**Proposition E.4** (Generalization of Proposition 3.5).: _Consider general probability mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\), \(\mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\nu)\), that is, with \(|\mu|=|\nu|=1\), where \(X,Y\) are bounded. Assume that \(L\) is continuous. Then_

\[\lim_{\lambda\to\infty}PGW^{L}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})=GW^{L}_{q}( \mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}).\]

Proof.: When \(\lambda\) is sufficiently large, by Lemma E.2, for each optimal \(\gamma_{\lambda}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) of the minimization problem \(PGW^{L}_{\lambda,q}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\), we have \(|\gamma_{\lambda}|=\min(|\mu|,|\nu|)=1\). That is, \(\gamma_{\lambda}\in\Gamma(\mu,\nu)\). Plugging\(\gamma_{\lambda}\) into \(C(\gamma_{\lambda};\lambda,\mu,\nu)\), we obtain:

\[PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}) =\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{ \prime}))d\gamma_{\lambda}^{\otimes 2}+\lambda(1^{2}+1^{2}-2\cdot 1^{2})\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^{ \prime}))d\gamma_{\lambda}^{\otimes 2}\geq GW(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}).\]

By Lemma E.3, we also have \(PGW_{\lambda,q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\leq GW_{q}^{L}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{ Y})\) and we complete the proof. 

## Appendix F Tensor Product Computation

**Lemma F.1**.: _Given a tensor \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m\times n\times n}\) and \(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\), the tensor product operator \(M\circ\gamma\) satisfies the following:_

1. _The mapping_ \(\gamma\mapsto M\circ\gamma\) _is linear with respect to_ \(\gamma\)_._ 2. _If_ \(M\) _is symmetric, in particular,_ \(M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}=M_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime},i,j},\forall i,i^{ \prime}\in[1:n],j,j^{\prime}\in[1:m]\)_, then_ \[\langle M\circ\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\rangle_{F}=\langle M\circ\gamma^{\prime },\gamma\rangle_{F}.\]

Proof.:
1. For the first part, consider \(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) and \(k\in\mathbb{R}\). For each \(i,j\in[1:n]\times[1:m]\), we have we have \[(M\circ(\gamma+\gamma^{\prime}))_{ij} =\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}(\gamma +\gamma^{\prime})_{i^{\prime}j^{\prime}}\] \[=\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\gamma _{i^{\prime}j^{\prime}}+\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}\gamma_{i^{\prime}j^{\prime}}^{\prime}\] \[=(M\circ\gamma)_{ij}+(M\circ\gamma)_{i^{\prime}j^{\prime}},\] \[(M\circ(k\gamma))_{ij} =\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}(k \gamma)_{ij}\] \[=k\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\gamma _{ij}\] \[=k(M\circ\gamma)_{ij}.\] Thus, \(M\circ(\gamma+\gamma^{\prime})=M\circ\gamma+M\circ\gamma^{\prime}\) and \(M\circ(k\gamma)=kM\circ\gamma\). Therefore, \(\gamma\mapsto M\circ\gamma\) is linear.
2. For the second part, we have \[\langle M\circ\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\rangle_{F} =\sum_{iji^{\prime}j^{\prime}}M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}},\gamma _{ij}\gamma_{i^{\prime}j^{\prime}}^{\prime}\] \[=\sum_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}M_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime},i,j} \gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\gamma_{i,j}\] (49) \[=\langle M\gamma^{\prime},\gamma\rangle\] where (49) follows from the fact that \(M\) is symmetric.

## Appendix G Another Algorithm for Computing PGW Distance - Solver 2

Our Algorithm 2 for solving the proposed PGW problem is based on a theoretical result that relates GW and PGW. The details of our computational method, as well as the proof of Proposition G.1 stated below, are provided in Appendix G.1. Based on such proposition, we extend the PGW problem to a discrete _GW-variant_ problem (55), leading to a solution for the original PGW problem by truncating the GW-variant solution.

**Proposition G.1**.: _Let \(\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\mu)\) be a mm-space. Consider an auxiliary point \(\hat{\infty}\) and let \(\hat{\mathbb{X}}=(\hat{X},d_{\hat{X}},\hat{\mu})\), where \(\hat{X}=X\cup\{\hat{\infty}\}\), \(\hat{\mu}\) is constructed by (4), and considering \(\infty\) as an auxiliary point to \(\mathbb{R}\) such that \(x\leq\infty\) for every \(x\in\mathbb{R}\), we extend \(d_{X}\) into \(d_{\hat{X}}:\hat{X}^{2}\to\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\) and define \(L_{\lambda}:\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}\to\mathbb{R}\) as follows:_

\[d_{\hat{X}}(x,x^{\prime})=\begin{cases}d_{X}(x,x^{\prime})&\text{if }x,x^{\prime}\in X \\ \infty&\text{otherwise}\end{cases},L_{\lambda}(r_{1},r_{2}):=\begin{cases}L(r_{1},r_{2})-2\lambda&\text{if }r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathbb{R}\\ 0&\text{elsewhere}\end{cases}.\] (50)

_Consider the following GW-variant2 problem:_

Footnote 2: \(\widehat{GW}^{L_{\lambda}}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})\) is not a rigorous GW problem since \(d_{\hat{X}}=\infty\) is possible, thus it is not a metric. Also, \(\mathbb{X}\), \(\mathbb{Y}\) are not necessarily _probability_ mm-spaces

\[\widehat{GW}^{L_{\lambda}}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})=\inf_{\hat{ \gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})}\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}(L_{\lambda}(d_{ \hat{X}}^{q},d_{\hat{Y}}^{q}))\] (51)

_Then, when considering the bijection \(\gamma\mapsto\hat{\gamma}\) defined in (6) we have that \(\gamma\) is optimal for PGW problem (10) if and only if \(\hat{\gamma}\) is optimal for the GW-variant problem (51)._

Proof.: The mapping \(F\) defined by (6) well-defined bijection, as shown in[40, 12].

Given \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), we have \(\hat{\gamma}=F(\gamma)\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})\). Let \(\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\mu,\nu)\) denote the transportation cost in the GW-variant problem (51), that is,

\[\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\mu,\nu):=\int_{(\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})^{2}}L_{\lambda}(d _{\hat{X}}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{\hat{Y}}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))\,d\hat{\gamma}(x, y)d\hat{\gamma}(x^{\prime},y^{\prime})\]

Then, we have

\[C(\gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu)\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}(L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^ {\prime}))-2\lambda)\,d\gamma^{\otimes 2}+\underbrace{\lambda(|\mu|+|\nu|)}_{ \text{does not depend on }\gamma}\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}(L(d_{X}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{Y}^{q}(y,y^ {\prime}))-2\lambda)\,d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\lambda(|\mu|+|\nu|)\qquad(\text{ since }\hat{\gamma}|_{X\times Y}=\gamma)\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}(L(d_{\hat{X}}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}),d_{\hat{ Y}}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))-2\lambda)\,d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\lambda(|\mu|+|\nu|) \quad(\text{as }d_{\hat{X}}|_{X\times X}=d_{X},\,d_{\hat{Y}}|_{Y\times Y}=d_{Y})\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L_{\lambda}(d_{\hat{X}}^{q}(x,x^{\prime}), d_{\hat{Y}}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))\,d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\lambda(|\mu|+|\nu|) \quad(\text{since }\hat{L}|_{\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}}(\cdot,\cdot)=(L(\cdot, \cdot)-2\lambda))\] \[=\int_{(\hat{X}\times\hat{Y})^{2}}L_{\lambda}(d_{\hat{X}}^{q}(x,x ^{\prime}),d_{\hat{Y}}^{q}(y,y^{\prime}))\,d\hat{\gamma}^{\otimes 2}+\underbrace{ \lambda(|\mu|+|\nu|)}_{\text{does not depend on }\hat{\gamma}}\ \.\quad(\text{since }\hat{L}\text{ assigns }0\text{ to }\hat{\infty})\]

Combining this with the fact that \(F:\gamma\mapsto\hat{\gamma}\) is a bijection, we have that \(\gamma\) is optimal for (10) if and only if \(\hat{\gamma}\) is optimal for (51). Under the assumptions of Proposition 3.3, there exists an optimal \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) for the PGW problem exists, and so we have:

\[\arg\min_{\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mu},\hat{\nu})}\hat{C}(\hat{\gamma};\mu, \nu)=\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)}C(\gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu).\] (52)

**Remark G.2**.: _Both algorithms (Algorithm 1, and 2) are mathematically and computationally equivalent, owing to the equivalence between the POT problem in Solver 1 and the OT problem in Solver 2._

### Frank-Wolfe for the PGW Problem - Solver 2

Similarly to the discrete PGW problem (15), consider the discrete version of (4):

\[\hat{\mathrm{p}}=[\mathrm{p};|\mathrm{q}|]\in\mathbb{R}^{n+1},\quad\hat{ \mathrm{q}}=[\mathrm{q};|\mathrm{p}|]\in\mathbb{R}^{m+1},\] (53)and, in a similar fashion, we define \(\hat{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)\times(n+1)\times(m+1)}\) as

\[\hat{M}_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}=\begin{cases}\tilde{M}_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}&\text{if }i,i^{\prime}\in[1:n],j,j^{\prime}\in[1:m],\\ 0&\text{elsewhere}.\end{cases}\] (54)

Then, the GW-variant problem (51) can be written as

\[\widehat{GW}(\hat{\mathbb{X}},\hat{\mathbb{Y}})=\min_{\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma( \hat{\mathbb{p}},\hat{\mathbb{q}})}\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\hat{\gamma}).\] (55)

Based on Proposition G.1 (which relates \(PGW^{L}_{\lambda}(\cdot,\cdot)\) with \(\widehat{GW}(\cdot,\cdot)\)), we propose two versions of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm [31] that can solve the PGW problem (15). Apart from Algorithm 1 in [45], which solves a different formulation of partial GW, and Algorithm 1 in [44], which applies the Sinkhorn algorithm to solve an entropic regularized version of (8), to the best of our knowledge, a precise computational method for the discrete PGW problem (15) has not been studied.

Here, we discuss another version of the FW Algorithm for solving the PGW problem (15). The main idea relies on solving first the GW-variant problem (51), and, at the end of the iterations, by using Proposition G.1, convert the solution of the GW-variant problem to a solution for the original partial GW problem (15).

First, construct \(\hat{\mathbb{p}},\hat{\mathbb{q}},\hat{\mathbb{M}}\) as described in Proposition G.1. Then, for each iteration \(k\), perform the following three steps.

**Step 1: Computation of gradient and optimal direction**. Solve the OT problem:

\[\hat{\gamma}^{(k)^{\prime}}\leftarrow\arg\min_{\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{ \mathbb{p}},\hat{\mathbb{q}})}\langle\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\hat{\gamma}^{(k)}),\hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F}.\]

The gradient \(\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\gamma^{(k)})\) can be computed in a similar way as described in Lemma H.2. We refer to Section H for details.

**Step 2: Line search method**. Find optimal step size \(\alpha^{(k)}\):

\[\alpha^{(k)}=\arg\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}\{\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}((1-\alpha)\hat{ \gamma}^{(k)}+\alpha\hat{\gamma}^{(k)^{\prime}})\}.\]

Similar to Solver 1, let

\[\begin{cases}&\delta\hat{\gamma}^{(k)}=\hat{\gamma}^{(k)^{\prime}}-\hat{ \gamma}^{(k)},\\ &a=\langle\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma}^{(k)},\delta\hat{\gamma}^{(k)}\rangle_ {F},\\ &b=2\langle\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma}^{(k)},\hat{\gamma}^{(k)}\rangle_{F}. \end{cases}\] (56)

Then the optimal \(\alpha^{(k)}\) is given by formula (18). See Appendix J for a detailed discussion.

**Step 3**. Update \(\hat{\gamma}^{(k+1)}\leftarrow(1-\alpha^{(k)})\hat{\gamma}^{(k)}+\alpha^{(k) }{\hat{\gamma}^{(k)^{\prime}}}\).

Gradient Computation in Algorithms 1 and 2

In this section, we discuss the computation of Gradient \(\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma)\) in Algorithm 1 and \(\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\hat{\gamma})\) in Algorithm 2.

**Proposition H.1** (Proposition 1 [41]).: _If the cost function can be written as_

\[L(r_{1},r_{2})=f_{1}(r_{1})+f_{2}(r_{2})-h_{1}(r_{1})h_{2}(r_{2})\] (57)

_then_

\[M\circ\gamma=u(C^{X},C^{Y},\gamma)-h_{1}(C^{X})\gamma h_{2}(C^{Y})^{\top},\] (58)

_where \(u(C^{X},C^{Y},\gamma):=f_{1}(C^{X})\gamma_{1}1_{m}^{\top}+1_{n}\gamma_{2}^{ \top}f_{2}(C^{Y})\)._

Additionally, the following lemma builds the connection between \(\tilde{M}\circ\gamma\) and \(M\circ\gamma\).

**Lemma H.2**.: _For any \(\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\), we have:_

\[\tilde{M}\circ\gamma=M\circ\gamma-2\lambda|\gamma|1_{n,m}.\] (59)

Proof.: For any \(\gamma\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\), we have

\[\tilde{M}\circ\gamma =(M1_{n,n,m,m}-2\lambda)\circ\gamma\] \[=(M-2\lambda 1_{n,n,m,m})\circ\gamma\] \[=M\circ\gamma-2\lambda 1_{n,m,n,m}\circ\gamma\] \[=M\circ\gamma-2(\langle 1_{n,m},\gamma\rangle_{F})1_{n,m}\] \[=M\circ\gamma-2\lambda|\gamma|1_{n,m}\]

where the second equality follows from Lemma F.1. 

Next, in the setting of Algorithm 2, for any \(\hat{\gamma}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)}\), we have

\[\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\hat{\gamma})=2\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma}\] (60)

and \(\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma}\) can be computed by the following lemma.

**Lemma H.3**.: _For each \(\hat{\gamma}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)}\), we have \(\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)}\) with the following:_

\[(\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma})_{ij}=\begin{cases}(\tilde{M}\circ\hat{\gamma}[1:n, 1:m])_{ij}&\text{if }i\in[1:n],j\in[1:m]\\ 0&\text{elsewhere}\end{cases}.\] (61)

Proof.: Recall the definition of \(\hat{M}\) is given by (54), choose \(i\in[1:n],j\in[1:m]\), we have

\[(\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma})_{ij} =\sum_{i^{\prime}=1}^{n}\sum_{j^{\prime}=1}^{m}\hat{M}_{i,j,i^{ \prime},j^{\prime}}\hat{\gamma}_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}+\sum_{j^{\prime}=1}^{ m}\hat{M}_{i,j,n+1,j}\hat{\gamma}_{n+1,j^{\prime}}+\sum_{i^{\prime}=1}^{n}\hat{M}_{i,j,i ^{\prime},m+1}\hat{\gamma}_{i,m+1}\] \[\qquad+\hat{M}_{i,j,n+1,m+1}\hat{\gamma}_{n+1,m+1}\] \[=\sum_{i^{\prime}=1}^{n}\sum_{j^{\prime}=1}^{m}\hat{M}_{i,j,i^{ \prime},j^{\prime}}\hat{\gamma}_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}+0+0+0=\sum_{i^{\prime }=1}^{n}\sum_{j^{\prime}=1}^{m}\hat{M}_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\hat{\gamma} _{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\] \[=(\tilde{M}\circ(\hat{\gamma}[1:n,1:m]))_{ij}\]

If \(i=n+1\), we have

\[(\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma})_{n+1,j}=\sum_{i^{\prime}=1}^{n+1}\sum_{j^{\prime} =1}^{m+1}\hat{M}_{n+1,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\hat{\gamma}_{i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}=0\]

Similarly, \((\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma})_{i,m+1}=0\). Thus, we complete the proof.

Line Search in Algorithm 1

In this section, we discuss the derivation of the line search algorithm.

We observe that in the partial GW setting, for each \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), the marginals of \(\gamma\) are not fixed. Thus, we can not directly apply the classical algorithm (e.g. [43]).

In iteration \(k\), let \(\gamma^{(k)},\gamma^{(k)^{\prime}}\) be the previous and new transportation plans from step 1 of the algorithm. For convenience, we denote them as \(\gamma\), \(\gamma^{\prime}\), respectively.

The goal is to solve the following problem:

\[\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}\mathcal{L}(\tilde{M},(1-\alpha)\gamma+\alpha\gamma^{ \prime})\] (62)

where \(\mathcal{L}(\tilde{M},\gamma)=\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F}\). By denoting \(\delta\gamma=\gamma^{\prime}-\gamma\), we have

\[\mathcal{L}(\tilde{M},(1-\alpha)\gamma+\alpha\gamma^{\prime})=\mathcal{L}( \tilde{M},\gamma+\alpha\delta\gamma).\]

Then,

\[\langle\tilde{M}\circ(\gamma+\alpha\delta\gamma),(\gamma+\alpha \delta\gamma)\rangle_{F}\] \[=\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F}+\alpha\left( \langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}+\langle\tilde{M}\circ \delta\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F}\right)+\alpha^{2}\langle\tilde{M}\circ\delta \gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}\]

Let

\[a= \langle\tilde{M}\circ\delta\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F},\] \[b= \langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}+\langle\tilde {M}\circ\delta\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F}=2\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\delta \gamma\rangle_{F},\] (63) \[c= \langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\gamma\rangle_{F},\]

where the second identity in (63) follows from Lemma F.1 and the fact that \(\tilde{M}=M1_{n,n,m,m}-2\lambda 1_{n,m,n,m}\) is symmetric.

Therefore, the above problem (62) becomes

\[\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}a\alpha^{2}+b\alpha+c.\]

The solution is the following:

\[\alpha^{*}=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }a\leq 0,a+b\leq 0,\\ 0&\text{if }a\leq 0,a+b>0,\\ \text{clip}(\frac{-b}{2a},[0,1])&\text{if }a>0,\end{cases}\] (64)

where

\[\text{clip}(\frac{-b}{2a},[0,1])=\min\left\{1,\max\{0,\frac{-b}{2a}\}\right\} =\begin{cases}\frac{-b}{2a}&\text{if }\frac{-b}{2a}\in[0,1],\\ 0&\text{if }\frac{-b}{2a}<0,\\ 1&\text{if }\frac{-b}{2a}>1.\end{cases}\]

We can further discuss the difference in computation of \(a\) and \(b\) in PGW setting and the classical GW setting. If the assumption in Proposition H.1 holds, by (58) and (59), we have

\[a =\langle\tilde{M}\circ\delta\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}\] \[=\langle(M\circ\delta\gamma-2\lambda|\delta\gamma|I_{n,m}),\delta \gamma\rangle_{F}\] \[=\langle M\circ\delta\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}-2\lambda| \delta\gamma|^{2}\] (65) \[=\left\langle u(C^{X},C^{Y},\delta\gamma)-h_{1}(C^{X})\delta \gamma h_{2}(C^{Y})^{\top},\delta\gamma\right\rangle_{F}-2\lambda|\delta \gamma|^{2},\] \[b =2\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}\] \[=2\langle\tilde{M}\circ\gamma-2\lambda|\gamma|I_{n,m},\delta \gamma\rangle\] \[=2(\langle M\circ\gamma,\delta\gamma\rangle_{F}-2\lambda|\delta \gamma||\gamma|)\] (66)

Note that in the classical GW setting [43], the term \(u(C^{X},C^{Y},\delta\gamma)=0_{n\times m}\) and \(|\delta\gamma|=0\). Therefore, in such line search algorithm (Algorithm 2 in [43]), the terms \(u(C^{X},C^{Y},\delta\gamma),2\lambda|\delta\gamma|1_{n\times m}\) are not required. In addition, in equation (66), \(M\circ\gamma,2\lambda|\gamma|\) have been computed in the gradient computation step, thus these two terms can be directly applied in this step.

Line Search in Algorithm 2

Similar to the previous section, in iteration \(k\), let \(\hat{\gamma}^{(k)},\hat{\gamma}^{(k)^{\prime}}\) denote the previous transportation plan and the updated transportation plan. For convenience, we denote them as \(\hat{\gamma},\hat{\gamma}^{\prime}\), respectively.

Let \(\delta\hat{\gamma}=\hat{\gamma}-\hat{\gamma}^{\prime}\).

The goal is to find the following optimal \(\alpha\):

\[\alpha=\arg\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}\mathcal{L}(\hat{M},(1-\alpha)\hat{\gamma}, \alpha\hat{\gamma}^{\prime})=\arg\min_{\alpha\in[0,1]}\mathcal{L}(\hat{M}, \alpha\delta\hat{\gamma}+\hat{\gamma}),\] (67)

where \(\hat{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)\times(n+1)\times(m+1)}\), with \(\hat{M}[1:n,1:m,1:n,1:m]=\tilde{M}=M-2\lambda 1_{n\times m\times n\times m}\).

Similar to the previous section, let

\[\begin{split}& a=\langle\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma},\delta \hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F},\\ & b=\langle\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma},\hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F} +\langle\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma},\delta\hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F}=2\langle\hat{M }\circ\delta\hat{\gamma},\hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F},\\ & c=\langle\hat{M}\circ\hat{\gamma},\hat{\gamma}\rangle_{F}, \end{split}\] (68)

where (68) holds since \(\hat{M}\) is symmetric. Then, the optimal \(\alpha\) is given by (64).

It remains to discuss the computation. By Lemma F.1, we set \(\gamma=\hat{\gamma}[1:n,1:m],\delta\gamma=\delta\hat{\gamma}[1:n,1:m]\). Then,

\[\begin{split}& a=\langle(\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma})[1:n,1:m], \delta\gamma\rangle_{F}=\langle(\hat{M}\circ\delta\gamma,\delta\gamma)_{F},\\ & b=\langle(\hat{M}\circ\delta\hat{\gamma})[1:n,1:m],\gamma \rangle_{F}=\langle(\hat{M}\circ\delta\gamma,\gamma)_{F}.\end{split}\]

Thus, we can apply (65), (66) to compute \(a,b\) in this setting by plugging in \(\gamma=\hat{\gamma}[1:n,1:m]\) and \(\delta\gamma=\delta\hat{\gamma}[1:n,1:m]\).

## Appendix K Convergence

As in [45] we will use the results from [32] on the convergence of the Frank-Wolfe algorithm for non-convex objective functions.

Consider the minimization problems

\[\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma\leq(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\gamma) \qquad\text{ and }\qquad\min_{\hat{\gamma}\in\Gamma(\hat{\mathrm{p}},\hat{\mathrm{q}})} \mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\hat{\gamma})\] (69)

that corresponds to the discrete partial GW problem, and the discrete GW-variant problem (used in version 2), respectively. The objective functions \(\gamma\mapsto\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\gamma)=\tilde{M}\gamma^{\otimes 2}\) (where \(\tilde{M}=M-2\lambda 1_{n,m}\) for a fixed matrix \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) and \(\lambda>0\)), and \(\hat{\gamma}\mapsto\mathcal{L}_{\hat{M}}(\hat{\gamma})=\hat{M}\hat{\gamma}^{ \otimes 2}\) (where \(\hat{M}\) is given by (54)) are non-convex in general (for \(\lambda>0\), the matrices \(\tilde{M}\) and \(\hat{M}\) symmetric but not positive semi-definite), but the constraint sets \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) and \(\Gamma(\hat{\mathrm{p}},\hat{\mathrm{q}})\) are convex and compact on \(\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) (see Proposition B.2 [53]) and on \(\mathbb{R}^{(n+1)\times(m+1)}\), respectively.

From now on we will concentrate on the first minimization problem in (69) and the convergence analysis for the second one will be analogous.

Consider the _Frank-Wolfe gap_ of \(\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}\) at the approximation \(\gamma^{(k)}\) of the optimal plan \(\gamma\):

\[g_{k}=\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\langle\nabla \mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma^{(k)}),\gamma^{(k)}-\gamma\rangle_{F}.\] (70)

It provided a good criterion to measure the distance to a stationary point at iteration \(k\). Indeed, a plan \(\gamma^{(k)}\) is a stationary transportation plan for the corresponding constrained optimization problem in (69) if and only if \(g_{k}=0\). Moreover, \(g_{k}\) is always non-negative (\(g_{k}\geq 0\)).

From Theorem 1 in [32], after \(K\) iterations we have the following upper bound for the minimal Frank-Wolf gap:

\[\tilde{g}_{K}:=\min_{1\leq k\leq K}g_{k}\leq\frac{\max\{2L_{1},D_{L}\}}{\sqrt{K }},\] (71)where

\[L_{1}:=\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma^{(1)})-\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p },\mathrm{q})}\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma)\]

is the initial global suboptimal bound for the initialization \(\gamma^{(1)}\) of the algorithm, and \(D_{L}:=\mathrm{Lip}\cdot(\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})))^ {2}\), where \(\mathrm{Lip}\) is the Lipschitz constant of \(\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}\) and \(\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}))\) is the \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) diameter of \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\).

The important thing to notice is that the constant \(\max\{2L_{1},D_{L}\}\) does not depend on the iteration step \(k\). Thus, according to Theorem 1 in [32], the rate on \(\tilde{g}_{K}\) is \(\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})\). That is, the algorithm takes at most \(\mathcal{O}(1/\varepsilon^{2})\) iterations to find an approximate stationary point with a gap smaller than \(\varepsilon\).

Finally, we adapt Lemma 1 in Appendix B.2 in [45] to our case characterizing the convergence guarantee, precisely, determining such a constant \(\max\{2L_{1},D_{L}\}\) in (71). Essentially, we will estimate upper bounds for the Lipschitz constant \(\mathrm{Lip}\) and for the diameter \(\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}))\).

* Let us start by considering the diameter of the couplings of \(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) with respect to the Frobenious norm \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\). By definition, \[\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})):=\sup_{\gamma,\gamma^{ \prime}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\|\gamma-\gamma^{\prime}\|_{F}.\] For any \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\), since \(\gamma_{1}\leq\mathrm{p}\) and \(\gamma_{2}\leq\mathrm{q}\), we obtain that, in particular, \(|\gamma_{1}|\leq|\mathrm{p}|\) and \(|\gamma_{2}|\leq|\mathrm{q}|\). Thus, since \(|\gamma_{1}|=|\gamma|=|\gamma_{2}|\) (recall that \(\gamma_{1}=\pi_{1\#}\gamma\) and \(\gamma_{2}=\pi_{2\#}\gamma\)) we have \[|\gamma|\leq\min\{|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{q}|\}=:\sqrt{s}\qquad\forall\gamma\in \Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}).\] Thus, given \(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\), we obtain \[\|\gamma-\gamma^{\prime}\|_{F}^{2} \leq 2\|\gamma\|_{F}^{2}+2\|\gamma^{\prime}\|_{F}^{2}=2\sum_{i,j}( \gamma_{i,j})^{2}+2\sum_{i,j}(\gamma_{i,j}^{\prime})^{2}\] \[\leq 2\left(\sum_{i,j}|\gamma_{i,j}|\right)^{2}+2\left(\sum_{i,j}| \gamma_{i,j}^{\prime}|\right)^{2}=2|\gamma|^{2}+2|\gamma^{\prime}|^{2}\leq 4s\] (essentially, we used that \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\) is the \(2\)-norm for matrices viewed as vectors, that \(|\cdot|\) is the \(1\)-norm for matrices viewed as vectors, and the fact that \(\|\cdot\|_{2}\leq\|\cdot\|_{1}\)). As a result, \[\mathrm{diam}(\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}))\leq 2\sqrt{s},\] (72) where \(s\) only depends on \(\mathrm{p}\) and \(\mathrm{q}\) that are fixed weight vectors in \(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\) and \(\mathbb{R}_{+}^{m}\), respectively.
* Now, let us analyze the Lipschitz constant of \(\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}\) with respect to \(\|\cdot\|_{F}\). For any \(\gamma,\gamma^{\prime}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})\) we have, \[\|\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}(\gamma)-\nabla\mathcal{L}_{\tilde {M}}(\gamma^{\prime})\|_{F}^{2}\] \[=\|\tilde{M}\circ\gamma-\tilde{M}\circ\gamma^{\prime}\|_{F}^{2}\] \[=\|[M-2\lambda]\circ(\gamma-\gamma^{\prime})\|_{F}^{2}\] \[=\langle[M-2\lambda]\circ(\gamma-\gamma^{\prime}),[M-2\lambda] \circ(\gamma-\gamma^{\prime})\rangle_{F}\] \[=\sum_{i,j}\left([(M-2\lambda)\circ(\gamma-\gamma^{\prime})]_{i,j }\right)^{2}\] \[=\sum_{i,j}\left(\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}(M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j ^{\prime}}-2\lambda)(\gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}-\gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}^{\prime})\right)^{2}\] \[\leq\left(\max_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\{M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j ^{\prime}}-2\lambda\}\right)^{2}\left(\sum_{i,j}^{n,m}\left(\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}^{n,m}(\gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}-\gamma_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}^{ \prime})\right)^{2}\right)\] \[=(\max(M)-2\lambda)^{2}\left(\sum_{i,j}^{n,m}\|\gamma-\gamma^{ \prime}\|_{F}^{2}\right)\] \[\leq nm\left(\max(M)-2\lambda\right)^{2}\|\gamma-\gamma^{\prime}\|_ {F}^{2}.\]Hence, the Lipschitz constant of the gradient of \(\mathcal{L}_{\tilde{M}}\) is by

\[\mathrm{Lip}\leq\sqrt{nm}\left|\max_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\{M_{i,j,i^{ \prime},j^{\prime}}\}-2\lambda\right|.\]

In the particular case where \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{2}\) we have \(M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}=|C^{X}_{i,i^{\prime}}-C^{Y}_{j,j^{\prime}}|^{2}\) (as in (14)) where \(C^{X}\), \(C^{Y}\) are given \(n\times n\) and \(m\times m\) non-negative symmetric matrices defined in (11), that depend on the given discrete mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}\) and \(\mathbb{Y}\). Here, we obtain

\[\max_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\{M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\}=\max_{i,j,i^ {\prime},j^{\prime}}\{|C^{X}_{i,i^{\prime}}-C^{Y}_{j,j^{\prime}}|^{2}\}\leq \left((\max_{i,i^{\prime}}\{C^{X}_{i,i^{\prime}}\})^{2}+(\max_{j,j^{\prime}} \{C^{Y}_{j,j^{\prime}}\})^{2}\right)\]

and so the Lipschitz constant verifies

\[\mathrm{Lip}\leq\sqrt{nm}\left|((\max(C^{X})^{2}+\max(C^{Y})^{2})-2\lambda\right|\]

Combining all together, we obtain that after \(K\) iterations, the minimal Frank-Wolf gap verifies

\[\tilde{g}_{K}=\min_{1\leq k\leq K}g_{k} \leq\frac{\max\{2L_{1},4s\sqrt{nm}\left|\max_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}\{M_{i,j,i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\}-2\lambda\right|\}}{\sqrt{K}}\] \[\leq 2\frac{\max\{L_{1},2s\sqrt{nm}\left|(\max(C^{X})^{2}+\max(C^{Y })^{2})-2\lambda\right|\}}{\sqrt{K}}\qquad(\text{if $M$ is as in \eqref{eq:L1}})\]

where \(L_{1}\) dependents on the initialization of the algorithm.

Finally, we mention that there is a dependence in the constant \(\max\{2L_{1},D_{L}\}\) on the number of points (\(n\) and \(m\)) of our discrete spaces \(X=\{x_{1},\ldots x_{n}\}\) and \(Y=\{y_{1},\ldots,y_{m}\}\) which was not pointed out in [45].

## Appendix L Related Work: Mass-Constrained Partial Gromov-Wasserstein

Partial Gromov-Wasserstein is first introduced in [45]. To distinguish the PGW problem in [45] and the PGW problem in this paper, we call the former one the Mass-Constrained Gromov-Wasserstein problem (MPGW):

\[MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y}):=\inf_{\gamma\in\Gamma^{\rho}_{\leq}(\mu, \nu)}\gamma^{\otimes 2}(L(d^{q}_{X},d^{q}_{Y})),\] (73)

where \(\rho\in[0,\min\{|\mu|,|\nu|\}]\), and

\[\Gamma^{\rho}_{\leq}(\mu,\nu):=\{\gamma\in\mathcal{M}_{+}(X\times Y):\gamma_{ 1}\leq\mu,\,\gamma_{2}\leq\nu,\,\,|\gamma|=\rho\}.\] (74)

Unlike the relation between Partial OT and OT, it is not rigorous to say that the PGW and the MPGW problems are equivalent, since the objective function

\[\gamma\mapsto\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d^{2}_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{2}_{Y}(y,y^{ \prime}))d\gamma^{\otimes 2}\] (75)

is not a convex function even if \((r_{1},r_{2})\mapsto L(r_{1},r_{2})\) is convex [37]: (If the problems were convex, MPGW, as the _'Lagrangian formulation'_ of PGW--adding the constraint of PGW in the functional a la _Lagrange Multipliers-- would be equivalent to PGW. However, since these problems are not convex, we cannot claim that they are equivalent in principle.)

We can still investigate their relation by the following lemma, based on which we design the wall-clock time experiment in Section O.

**Proposition L.1**.: _Suppose \(\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) is optimal for \(PGW_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\). Let \(\rho=|\gamma|\), we have \(\gamma\) is also optimal in \(MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\)._

Proof.: Pick \(\gamma^{\prime}\in\Gamma^{\rho}_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\subset\Gamma_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\), since \(\gamma\) is optimal in \(PGW_{\lambda}(\mu,\nu)\), we have

\[0 \leq C(\gamma;\lambda,\mu,\nu)-C(\gamma^{\prime};\lambda,\mu,\nu)\] \[=\int_{(X\times Y)^{2}}L(d^{2}_{X}(x,x^{\prime}),d^{2}_{Y}(y,y^{ \prime}))d(\gamma^{\otimes 2}-\gamma^{\prime\otimes 2})\]

Thus, \(\gamma\) is optimal in \(\Gamma^{\rho}_{\leq}(\mu,\nu)\) for \(MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X},\mathbb{Y})\) and we complete the proof.

At first glance, the formulations of the MPGW (73) and the PGW (10) problems could be thought to be equivalent since tuning the hyper-parameter \(\lambda\) for controlling the total mass in the PGW problem is quite similar in spirit to the approach in [45] (MPGW) which instead constrains the total mass of \(\gamma\) by the hyper-parameter \(\rho\). However, since classical GW and its variants (e.g. UPGW, PGW, MPGW) are not convex problems, mathematically this equivalence relation is not verified.

We first notice that the "Lagrangian form" of the MPGW problem (73) is our PGW formulation (10) by considering \(2\lambda\) be the "Lagrange variable" of constraint \(-|\gamma|^{2}+\rho^{2}\leq 0\). However, as said before, the equivalence is not direct as the cost functional (75) is not convex. In fact, he MPGW problem does not give rise to a metric, while our PGW formulation gives rise to a metric as shown in Proposition 3.4. We will show this through the following example. In fact, we will see that by using the MPGW formulation we cannot distinguish different mm-spaces, while with our PGW we can discriminate different mm-spaces.

**Example:** Consider the following three mm-spaces

\[\mathbb{X}_{1}=(\mathbb{R}^{3},\|\cdot\|,\sum_{i=1}^{1000}\alpha\delta_{x_{i} }),\quad\mathbb{X}_{2}=(\mathbb{R}^{3},\|\cdot\|,\sum_{i=1}^{800}\alpha\delta_ {x_{i}}),\quad\mathbb{X}_{3}=(\mathbb{R}^{3},\|\cdot\|,\sum_{i=1}^{400}\alpha \delta_{x_{i}}),\]

where \(\alpha>0\) is the mass of each point. For numerical stability reasons, we set \(\alpha=1/1000\). On the one hand, if we compute MPGW, the mass is fixed to be a value \(\rho\in[0,0.4]\), since the total mass in \(\mathbb{X}_{3}\) is \(0.4\). For our experiment, we set \(\rho=0.4\), and we observe:

\[MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X}_{1},\mathbb{X}_{2};\rho=0.4)=MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X}_{2 },\mathbb{X}_{3};\rho=0.4)=MPGW_{\rho}(\mathbb{X}_{1},\mathbb{X}_{3};\rho=0.4)=0\]

On the other hand, if we compute our PGW, considering any \(\lambda>0\), (in particular, we set \(\lambda=10\)), we obtain

\[PGW_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X}_{1},\mathbb{X}_{2};\lambda=10) =3.6\] \[PGW_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X}_{2},\mathbb{X}_{3};\lambda=10) =4.8\] \[PGW_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X}_{1},\mathbb{X}_{3};\lambda=10) =8.4\]

In particular, one can verify the triangular inequality.

As a conclusion, in this example, MPGW can not describe the dissimilarity of any two datasets taken from \(\{\mathbb{X}_{1},\mathbb{X}_{2},\mathbb{X}_{3}\}\). They are three distinct datasets, but MPGW returns zero for each pair. On the contrary, our PGW can measure dissimilarity.

In addition, the discrepancy provided by our PGW formulation is consistent with the following intuitive observation: One expects the dissimilarity between \(\mathbb{X}_{1}\) and \(\mathbb{X}_{3}\) to be larger than the difference \(\mathbb{X}_{1}\) and \(\mathbb{X}_{2}\), and than the difference between \(\mathbb{X}_{1}\) and \(\mathbb{X}_{2}\). This is because we are considering discrete measures, with the same mass at each point concentrated on the sets \(\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{400}\}\subset\{x_{1},\ldots,x_{400},\ldots,x_{800}\}\subset\{ x_{1},\ldots,x_{400},\ldots,x_{800},\ldots,x_{1000}\}\) for the datasets \(\mathbb{X}_{3},\mathbb{X}_{2},\mathbb{X}_{1}\), respectively.

## Appendix M Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Barycenter

We first introduce the classical Gromov-Wasserstein problem [41]: Consider finite discrete probability measures \(\mu^{1},\ldots,\mu^{K}\), where \(\mu^{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{k}}p_{i}^{k}\delta_{x_{i}^{k}}\) and each \(x_{i}^{k}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}\) for some \(d_{k}\in\mathbb{N}\). Let \(C^{k}=[\|x_{i}^{k}-x_{i^{\prime}}^{k}\|^{2}]_{i,i^{\prime}\in[1:n_{k}]}\) and \(\mathrm{p}^{k}=[p_{i}^{k},\ldots,p_{n_{k}}^{k}]^{\top}\). Given \(\mathrm{p}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\) with \(|\mathrm{p}|=1\) for some \(n\in\mathbb{N}\) and \(\xi_{1},\ldots,\xi_{K}\geq 0\) with \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\xi_{k}=1\), the GW barycenter problem is defined by:

\[\min_{C,\gamma^{k}}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\xi_{k}\langle L(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k}, \gamma^{k}\rangle,\] (76)

where the minimization is over all matrices \(C\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n},\gamma^{k}\in\Gamma(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{k}), \forall k\in[1:K]\).

Similarly, we can extend the above definition into PGW setting. In particular, we relax the assumptions \(|\mathrm{p}|=1\) and \(|\mathrm{p}^{k}|=1\) for each \(k\in[1:K]\). Given \(\lambda_{1},\ldots,\lambda_{K}>0\), the PGW barycenter is the follow problem:

\[\min_{C,\gamma_{k}}\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle M(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k},\gamma^{k} \rangle-2\lambda_{k}|\gamma^{k}|^{2}\] (77)where each \(\gamma^{k}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{k})\).

The problem (77) can be solved iterative by two steps:

**Minimization with respect to \(C\)**: For each \(k\), we solve the PGW problem

\[\min_{\gamma^{k}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(p,p^{k})}\langle M(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k}, \gamma^{k}\rangle-2\lambda_{k}|\gamma^{k}|^{2}\]

via solver 1 or 2.

**Minimization with respect to \(\{\gamma^{k}\}_{k}\)**:

\[\min_{C}\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle M(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k},\gamma^{k}\rangle\] (78)

Note, we can ignore the \(-2\lambda_{k}|\gamma^{k}|^{2}\) terms as \(\gamma^{k}\) is fixed in this case.

It has closed form solution due to the following lemma and proposition:

**Lemma M.1**.: _Given matrices \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{n,m},B\in\mathbb{R}^{m,l},C\in\mathbb{R}^{n,l}\), let_

\[\mathcal{L}=\langle AB,C\rangle,\]

_then \(\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dA}=CB^{\top}\)._

Proof.: For any \(i\in[1:n],j\in[1:m]\), we have

\[\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dA_{ij}} :=\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\frac{d}{dA_{ij}}C_{i^{\prime},j^{ \prime}}(AB)_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\] \[=\sum_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}C_{i^{\prime},j^{\prime}}\frac{d( \sum_{k}A_{i^{\prime},k}B_{k,j^{\prime}})}{dA_{ij}}\] \[=\sum_{j^{\prime}}C_{i,j^{\prime}}B_{k,j^{\prime}}=(CB^{\top})_{ ij}.\]

**Proposition M.2**.: _If \(L\) satisfies (57), and \(f_{1}^{\prime}/h_{1}^{\prime}\) is invertible, then (78) can be solved by_

\[C=\left(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\sum_{k} \xi_{k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma_{k})^{\top}}{\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma_{1}^{ k}(\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}}\right),\] (79)

_where_

\[\frac{A}{B}=\left[\frac{A_{ij}}{B_{ij}}\right]_{ij},\text{with convention }\frac{0}{0}=0.\]

_Special case: if \(|\mathrm{p}|\leq|\mathrm{p}^{k}|,\forall k\), when \(\lambda\) is sufficiently large, (79) and [41, Proposition 3] coincide._

Proof.: From Proposition H.1, the objective in (78) becomes

\[\mathcal{L}= \sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle f_{1}(C)\gamma_{1}^{1}1_{n_{k}}^{\top}+1_ {n}(\gamma_{2}^{k})^{\top}f_{2}(C^{k})-h_{1}(C)\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})^{\top}, \gamma^{k}\rangle\] \[=\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle f_{1}(C)\gamma_{1}^{1}1_{n_{k}}^{\top}, \gamma^{k}\rangle+\underbrace{\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle 1_{n}(\gamma_{2}^{k})^{\top}f_{2}(C^{k}), \gamma^{k}\rangle}_{\text{constant}}-\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\langle h_{1}(C)\gamma^{k} h_{2}(C^{k})^{\top},\gamma^{k}\rangle\]We set \(\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dC}=0\). From Lemma M.1, we have:

\[0 =\frac{d\mathcal{L}}{dC}\] \[=\sum_{k}\xi_{k}f_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\gamma^{k}1_{n_{k}}(\gamma_{1 }^{k})^{\top}-\sum_{k}\xi_{k}h_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})( \gamma^{k})^{\top}\] \[=f_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma^{k}1_{n_{k}}(\gamma_{1 }^{k})^{\top}-h_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})( \gamma^{k})^{\top}\] \[=f_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\underbrace{\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma_{1}^{k} (\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}}_{B}-h_{1}^{\prime}(C)\odot\underbrace{\sum_{k}\xi_{ k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma^{k})^{\top}}_{A}.\] (80)

We claim \(\frac{A}{B}\) is well-defined, i.e., if \(B_{ij}=0\), then \(A_{ij}=0\).

For each \(i,j\in[1:n]\), if \(B_{ij}=0\), we have two cases:

Case 1: \(\forall k\in[1:K]\), we have \(\gamma_{1}^{k}[i]=0\).

Thus, \(\gamma^{k}[i,:]=0_{n_{k}}^{\top}\). So \(A[i,:]=(\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma^{k})^{\top})[i,:]=0_{n_{k}}^{\top}\).

Case 2: \(\forall k\in[1:K]\), we have \(\gamma_{1}^{k}[j]=0\).

It implies \((\gamma^{k})^{\perp}[:,j]=0_{n}\), thus \(A[:,j]=(\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k}))(\gamma^{k})^{\top}[:,j]=0_{n_{k}}\). Therefore, \(A_{ij}=0\).

Thus \(\frac{A}{B}\) is well-defined.

In addition, in these two cases, if we change the value \(C_{ij}^{k}\), \(\mathcal{L}\) will not change.

From (80), we have:

\[\left(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}(C)\right)_{ij}=\frac{\left(\sum_{ k}\xi_{k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma^{k})^{\top}\right)_{ij}}{\left(\sum_{ k}\xi_{k}\gamma_{1}^{k}(\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}\right)_{ij}}\]

if \(B_{ij}>0\). In addition, if \(B_{ij}=0\), there is no constraint for \(C_{ij}\).

Combining it with the fact that if \(B_{i,j}=0\), then \(C_{i,j}\) has no effect on \(\mathcal{L}\). Thus, we have the following is a solution:

\[C=\left(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\sum_{k} \xi_{k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma^{k})^{\top}}{\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma_{1}^{k }(\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}}\right).\]

In particular case: \(|\mathrm{p}|\leq|\mathrm{p}^{k}|,\forall k\), suppose \(\lambda>\max\{c^{2}:c\in\bigcup_{k}C^{k}\cup C\}\), by lemma E.1, we have for each \(k\), \(|\gamma^{k}|=\min(|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{p}|^{k})=|\mathrm{p}|\), that is \(\gamma_{1}^{k}=\mathrm{p}\).

Thus,

\[\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma_{1}^{k}(\gamma_{1}^{\prime})^{\top}=\sum_{k}\xi_{k} \gamma_{1}^{k}(\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}=\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}^{ \top}=\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}^{\top}\]

Thus, \(C=\left(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}\right)^{-1}\left(\frac{\sum_{k} \xi_{k}\gamma^{k}h_{2}(C^{k})(\gamma^{k})^{\top}}{\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}^{\top} }\right).\) 

**Remark M.3**.: _In \(l^{2}\) loss case, i.e. \(L(r_{1},r_{2})=|r_{1}-r_{2}|^{2}\), (79) becomes_

\[C=\frac{\sum_{k}\xi_{k}\gamma^{k}C^{k}(\gamma^{k})^{\top}}{\sum_{k}\xi_{k} \gamma_{1}^{k}(\gamma_{1}^{k})^{\top}}.\] (81)

Since in this case, we can set

\[f_{1}(x)=x^{2},f_{2}(y)=y^{2},h_{1}(x)=2x,h_{2}(y)=y.\]

Thus \(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}(x)=\frac{2x}{2}=x\) and \(\left(\frac{f_{1}^{\prime}}{h_{1}^{\prime}}\right)^{-1}(x)=x\). Therefore, (79) becomes (81).

Similarly, we can also extend the above PGW Barycenter into the MPGW setting:

\[\min_{C,\gamma^{k}}\sum_{k=1}^{K}\xi_{k}\langle L(C,C^{k})\circ\gamma^{k},\gamma^ {k}\rangle,\]

where, for each \(k\in[1:K]\), \(\rho_{k}\in[0,\min(|\mathrm{p}|,|\mathrm{p}^{k}|)]\), and the optimization is over \(C\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\) and \(\gamma_{k}\in\Gamma_{\leq}^{\rho_{k}}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{k})\) for \(k\in[1:K]\).

It can be solved by the following algorithm 4.

``` Input:\(\{C^{k},\mathrm{p}^{k},\lambda_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K},\mathrm{p}\) Output:\(C\) Initialize \(C\). for\(i=1,2,\ldots\)do  Compute \(\gamma^{k}\leftarrow\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}^{\rho_{k}}(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{p}^{k})}\langle\mathcal{L}(C,C^{k}),\gamma\rangle,\forall k\in[1:K]\).  Update \(C\) by (79).  if convergence, break endfor ```

Figure 4: We visualize the dataset in point cloud interpolation. The first row is the original images in Link. The second row is the point clouds obtained by the k-mean method, where \(k=1024\).

Figure 5: We test interpolation tasks in 3 scenarios: source data is clean, target data is selected from three cases as described in section **dataset and data processing**. In each scenario, we test \(\eta=5\%,10\%\) respectively. In the first column, we present the source and target point cloud visualization in each task. In columns 2-9, we present GW, PGW barycenter for \(t=0/7,1/7,\dots,7/7\).

### Details of Point Cloud Interpolation Experiment

**Dataset and data processing.** We apply the dataset in [41] with download link. The original data are images, which we convert into a point cloud using the k-mean algorithm, where \(k=1024\) (see the second row of Figure 4).

Suppose \(\mathcal{D}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\) is a region that contains these point clouds. Let \(\mathcal{R}\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\) denote another region. In \(\mathcal{R}\), we randomly select and add \(n\eta\) noise points to these point clouds. In particular, we consider noise corruption in the following three cases:

Case 1: \(\mathcal{R}\) is a rectangle region which is disjoint to \(\mathcal{D}\). See the third row in Figure 4.

Case 2: \(\mathcal{R}=\mathcal{R}_{1}\cup\mathcal{R}_{2}\), where \(\mathcal{R}_{1},\mathcal{R}_{2}\) are rectangles which are disjoint to \(\mathcal{D}\). See the fourth row in Figure 4.

Case 3: \(\mathcal{R}\) contains \(\mathcal{D}\). See the fifth row in Figure 4.

**GW Barycenter and PGW Barycenter methods**. We select \(t_{1},\ldots,t_{K}\) with \(0=t_{1}<t_{2}<\ldots<t_{K}=1\). For each \(t\in\{t_{1},\ldots,t_{K}\}\), we compute the GW Barycenter

\[\arg\min_{C,\gamma^{1},\gamma^{2}}(1-t)\langle L(C,C^{1})\circ\gamma^{1}, \gamma^{1}\rangle+t\langle L(C,C^{2})\circ\gamma^{2},\gamma^{2}\rangle,\] (82)

where \(\gamma_{1}\in\Gamma(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{1}),\gamma_{2}\in\Gamma(\mathrm{p}, \mathrm{p}^{2})\). Apply Smacof-MDS to the minimizer \(C\), the resulting embedding, denoted as \(X_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times 2}\) (where \(n=1024\)) is the GW-based interpolation.

Replacing the GW Barycenter with the PGW Barycenter

\[\arg\min_{C,\gamma^{1},\gamma^{2}}(1-t)(\langle L(C,C^{1})\circ\gamma^{1}, \gamma^{1}\rangle+\lambda_{1}|\gamma^{1}|^{2})+t(\langle L(C,C^{2})\circ \gamma^{2},\gamma^{2}\rangle+\lambda_{2}|\gamma^{2}|),\] (83)

where \(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}>0,\gamma^{1}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{1 }),\gamma^{2}\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{p}^{2})\). Then we obtain PGW-based interpolation.

**Problem setup**. We select one point cloud from the clean dataset denoted as \(X=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) (source point cloud), \(n=1024\).

Next, we select one noise-corrupted point cloud, as described in Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, respectively. In these three scenarios, we test \(\eta=0.5\%\) and \(\eta=10\%\) where \(\eta\) is the noise level. Therefore, we test \(3*2=6\) different interpolation tasks for these two methods. The size of the target point cloud is then \(m=n+n\eta\). See Figure 5 for details.

**Numerical details.** In the GW-barycenter method, because of the balanced mass setting, we set

\[\mathrm{p}^{1}=\frac{1}{n}1_{n},\mathrm{p}^{2}=\frac{1}{m}1_{m},\mathrm{p}= \frac{1}{n}1_{n}.\]

In PGW-barycenter, we set

\[\mathrm{p}^{1}=\frac{1}{n}1_{n},\mathrm{p}^{2}=\frac{1}{n}1_{m},\mathrm{p}= \frac{1}{n}1_{n}.\]

In addition, we set \(\lambda_{1},\lambda_{2}\) such that \(2\lambda_{1},2\lambda_{2}\geq\max(\max(C_{1})^{2},\max(C_{2})^{2})\). We compute GW/PGW barycenter for \(t=0/7,1/7,\ldots,7/7\).

In both GW and PGW barycenter algorithms, we set the largest number of iterations to be 100. The threshold for convergence is set to be 1e-5.

**Performance analysis.** Each interpolation task is essentially unbalanced: the source point cloud contains clean data, while the target point cloud contains clean and noise points. We observe that in the first two scenarios, the interpolation derived from GW is clearly disturbed by the noise data points. For example, in rows \(1,3,5,7\), columns \(t=1/7,2/7,3/7\), we see that the point clouds reconstructed by MDS have significantly different width-height ratios from those of the source and target point clouds.

In contrast, PGW is significantly less disturbed, and the interpolation is more natural. The width-height ratio of the point clouds generated by the PGW barycenter is consistent with that of the source/target point clouds.

In the third scenario, the noise data is uniformly selected from a large region that contains the domain of all clean point clouds. In this case, we observe that the GW and PGW barycenters perform similarly.

However, at \(t=1/7,2/7,4/7\), GW-barycenters present more noise points than PGW-barycenters in the same truncated region.

**Limitations and future work**. The main issue of the above GW/PGW techniques arises from the MDS method:

Given minimizer \(C\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\) of GW/PGW barycenter problem (82) (or (83)), MDS studies the following problem:

\[\min_{X\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}}\sum_{i,i^{\prime}=1}^{n}\left|C ^{1/2}_{i,i^{\prime}}-\|X_{i}-X_{i^{\prime}}\|\right|^{2}\] (84)

Let \(O(n)\) denote the set of all \(n\times n\) orthonormal matrices. Suppose \(X^{*}\) is a minimizer, then \(RX^{*}\) is also a minimizer for the above problem for all \(R\in O(n)\).

In practice, this means manually setting suitable rotation and flipping matrices for each method at each step, especially for the GW method.

However, we understand that this issue stems from the inherent properties of the GW/PGW method. GW can be seen as a tool that describes the similarity between two graphs, which are rotation-invariant and flipping-invariant. Therefore, the GW/PGW barycenter essentially describes the interpolation between two graphs rather than two point clouds.

### Details of Point Cloud Matching

**Dataset setup**. In the Moon dataset (see link), we apply \(n=200\) and set Gaussian variance to be \(0.2\). The outliers are sampled from region \([[-2,-1.5]\times[-3.5,-3]]\).

In the second experiment, the circle data is uniformly sampled from 2D circle

\[\mathbb{S}^{1}=\{s\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:\|s\|^{2}=1\}\]

and spherical data is uniformly sampled from 3D sphere

\[\mathbb{S}^{2}=\{s+[0,0,4]\in\mathbb{R}^{2}:\|s\|^{2}=1\},\]

where the shift \([0,0,4]\) is applied for visualization.

We set sample size \(n=200\) for both 2D and 3D samples.

In both experiment, the number of outliers is \(\eta n=0.2n=40\).

**Numerical details**. In GW, we normalize the two point clouds as

\[\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\delta_{x_{i}}), \mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\sum_{j=1}^{n+n\eta}\frac{1}{n+n\eta}\delta_{y_{j}}).\]

In PGW, MPGW, UGW, we define the point clouds as

\[\mathbb{X}=(X,d_{X},\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{1}{n}\delta_{x_{i}}), \mathbb{Y}=(Y,d_{Y},\sum_{j=1}^{n+n\eta}\frac{1}{n}\delta_{y_{j}}).\]

In PGW, we choose \(\lambda\) such that \(\lambda\geq\max((C^{X})^{2}),\max((C^{Y})^{2}))\), in particular, \(\lambda=10.0\).

In MPGW, we set \(\rho=1.0\).

In UGW, we set \(\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}=10.0\), \(\epsilon=0.05\).

## Appendix N Details of Shape Retrieval Experiment

**Dataset details.** We test two datasets in this experiment, which we refer to as Dataset I and Dataset II. We visualize Dataset I in Figure 5(a) and Dataset II in Figure 5(b). The complete datasets can be accessed from the supplementary materials.

Numerical details.We represent the shapes in each dataset as mm-spaces \(\mathbb{X}^{i}=\left(\mathbb{R}^{2},\|\cdot\|_{2},\mu^{i}=\sum_{k=1}^{n^{i}} \alpha^{i}\delta_{x^{i}_{k}}\right)\). We use \(\alpha^{i}=\frac{1}{n^{i}}\) to compute the GW distances for the balanced mass constraint setting. For the remaining distances, we set \(\alpha=\frac{1}{N}\), where \(N\) is the median number of points across all shapes in the dataset. For the SVM experiments, we use \(\exp(-\sigma D)\) as the kernel for the SVM model, and we set \(\sigma=10\) for all distances. Moreover, we normalize the matrix \(D\) to facilitate a fair comparison of each distance used, since the considered distance may have different scales. We note that the resulting kernel matrix is not necessarily positive semidefinite.

In computing the pairwise distances, for the PGW method, we set \(\lambda\) such that \(\lambda\leq\lambda_{max}=\max_{i}\left(|C^{i}|^{2}\right)\). In particular, we compute \(\lambda_{max}\) for each dataset and use \(\lambda=\frac{1}{5}\lambda_{max}\) for each experiment. For UGW, we use \(\varepsilon=10^{-1}\) and \(\rho_{1}=\rho_{2}=1\) for both experiments. Finally, for MPGW, we set the mass-constrained term to be \(\rho=\min(|\mu^{i}|,|\mu^{j}|)\) when computing the similarity between shape \(\mathbb{X}^{i}\) and \(\mathbb{X}^{j}\).

Performance analysis.The pairwise distance matrices are visualized for each dataset in Figure 7, and the confusion matrices computed with each dataset are given in Figure 8. Finally, the classification accuracy with the SVM experiments is reported in Table 0(a). The results indicate that the PGW distance is able to consistently obtain high performance across both datasets.

In addition, from Figure 7, we observe that PGW qualitatively admits a more reasonable similarity measure compared to other methods. For example, in Dataset I, class "bone" and "rectangle" should have relatively smaller distance than "bone" and "annulus". Ideally, a reasonable distance should satisfy the following:

\[0<d(\text{bone},\text{rectangle})<d(\text{bone},\text{annulus}).\]

However, we do not observe this relation in GW and UGW3, and for the MPGW method, \(MPGW(\text{bone},\text{rectangle})\approx 0\), which is also undesirable. For PGW, however, we do observe this relation. Additionally, we report the wall-clock time comparison in Table 0(b).

Wall-Clock Time Comparison for Partial GW Solvers

In this section, we present the wall-clock time comparison between our method Algorithms 1, 2, the Frank-Wolf algorithm proposed in [45], and its Sinkhorn version [41, 45]. Note that these two baselines solve a mass constraint version of the PGW problem, which we refer to as the "MPGW" problem. The proposed PGW formulation in this paper can be regarded as a "Lagrangian formulation" of MPGW4 formulation to the PGW problem defined in (10). In this paper, we call these two baselines as "MPGW algorithm" and "Sinkhorn PGW algorithm".

Footnote 4: Due to the non-convexity of GW, we do not have a strong duality in some of the GW representations. Thus, the Lagrangian form is not a rigorous description.

**Numerical details.** The data is generated as follows: let \(\mu=\text{Unif}([0,2]^{2})\) and \(\nu=\text{Unif}([0,2]^{3})\), we select i.i.d. samples \(\{x_{i}\sim\mu\}_{i=1}^{n},\{y_{j}\sim\nu\}_{j=1}^{m}\), where \(n\) is selected from \([10,50,100,150,...,10000]\) and \(m=n+100\), \(\text{p}=1_{n}/m,\text{q}=1_{m}/m\). For each \(n\), we set \(\lambda=0.2,1.0,10.0\). The mass constraint parameter for the algorithm in [45], and Sinkhorn is computed by the mass of the transportation plan obtained by Algorithm 1 or 2. The runtime results are shown in Figure 9.

Regarding the acceleration technique, for the POT problem in step 1, our algorithms and the MPGW algorithm apply the linear programming solver provided by Python OT package [55], which is written in C++. The Sinkhorn algorithm from Python OT does not have an acceleration technique. Thus, we only test its wall-clock time for \(n\leq 2000\). The data type is 64-bit float number.

From Figure 9, we can observe the Algorithms 1, 2 and MPGW algorithm have a similar order of time complexity. However, using the column/row-reduction technique for the POT computation discussed in previous sections, and the fact the convergence behaviors of Algorithms 1 and 2 are similar to the MPGW algorithm, we observe that the proposed algorithms 1, 2 admits a slightly faster speed than MPGW solver.

Figure 9: We test the wall-clock time of our Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, the MPGW solver (Algorithm 1 in [45]), and the Sinkhorn algorithm [41]. We denote these methods as v1, v2, m, s respectively. The linear programming solver applied in the first three methods is from POT [55], which is written in C++. The maximum number of iterations for all the methods is set to be \(1000\). The maximum iteration for OT/OPT solvers is set to be \(300n\). The maximum Sinkhorn iteration is set to be \(1000\). The convergence tolerance for the Frank-Wolfe algorithm and the Sinkhorn algorithm are set to be \(1e-5\). To achieve their best performance, the number of dummy points is set to be 1 for MPGW and PGW.

Positive Unlabeled Learning Problem

### Problem setup.

Positive unlabeled (PU) learning [56, 57, 58] is a semi-supervised binary classification problem for which the training set only contains positive samples. In particular, suppose there exists a fixed unknown overall distribution over triples \((x,o,l)\), where \(x\) is data, \(l\in\{0,1\}\) is the label of \(x\), \(o\in\{0,1\}\) where \(o=1\), \(o=0\) denote that \(l\) is observed or not, respectively. In the PU task, the assumption is that only positive samples' labels can be observed, i.e., \(\text{Prob}(o=1|x,l=0)=0\).

Consider training labeled data \(X^{pu}=\{(x_{i}^{pu},l)\}_{i=1}^{n}\subset\{x:o=1\}\) and testing data \(X^{un}=\{x_{j}^{un}\}_{j=1}^{m}\subset\{x:o=0\}\), where \(x_{i}p_{i}^{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{1}},x_{j}^{u}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{2}}\). In the classical PU learning setting, \(d_{2}=d_{1}\). However, in [44] this assumption is relaxed. The goal is to leverage \(X^{p}\) to design a classifier \(\hat{l}:x^{u}\rightarrow\{0,1\}\) to predict \(l(x^{u})\) for all \(x^{u}\in X^{u}\).5

Footnote 5: In the classical setting, the goal is to learn a classifier for all \(x\). In this experiment, we follow the setting in [44].

Following [57, 45, 44], in this experiment, we assume that the "select completely at random" (SCAR) assumption holds: \(\text{Prob}(o=1|x,l=1)=\text{Prob}(o=1|l=1)\). In addition, we use \(\pi=\text{Prob}(l=1)\in[0,1]\) to denote the ratio of positive samples in testing set6. Following the PU learning setting in [58, 59, 45, 44], we assume \(\pi\) is known. In all the PU learning experiments, we fix \(\pi=0.2\).

Footnote 6: In the classical setting, the prior distribution \(\pi\) is the ratio of positive samples of the original dataset. For convenience, we ignore the difference between this ratio in the original dataset and the test dataset.

### Our method.

Similar to [45] our method is designed as follows: We set \(\mathrm{p}\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\mathrm{q}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}\) as \(p_{i}^{X}=\frac{\pi}{n},i\in[1:n]\); \(q_{j}^{Y}=\frac{1}{m},j\in[1:m]\). Let \(\mathbb{X}^{p}=(X^{p},\|\cdot\|_{d_{1}},\sum_{i=1}^{n}p_{i}^{X}\delta_{x_{i}} ),\mathbb{X}^{u}=(X^{u},\|\cdot\|_{d_{2}},\sum_{j=1}^{n}q_{j}^{Y}\delta_{y_{j}})\). We solve the partial GW problem \(PGW_{\lambda}(\mathbb{X}^{p},\mathbb{X}^{u})\) and suppose \(\gamma\) is a solution. Let \(\gamma_{2}=\gamma^{\top}1_{n}\). The classifier \(\hat{l}\) is defined by the indicator function

\[\hat{l}_{\gamma}(x^{u})=\mathbbm{1}_{\{x^{u}:\gamma_{2}(x^{u})\geq\mathrm{ quantile}\}},\] (85)

where \(\mathrm{quantile}\) is the quantile value of \(\gamma_{2}\) according to \(1-\pi\).

Regarding the initial guess \(\gamma^{(1)}\), [45] proposed a POT-based approach when \(X\) and \(Y\) are sampled from the same domain, i.e., \(d_{1}=d_{2}\), which we refer to as "POT initialization."

When \(X,Y\) are sampled from different spaces, that is, \(d_{1}\neq d_{2}\), the above technique (86) is not well-defined. Inspired by [8, 44], we propose the following "first lower bound-partial OT" (FLB-POT) initialization:

\[\gamma^{(1)}=\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\int_{X \times Y}|s_{X,2}(x)-s_{Y,2}(y)|^{2}d\gamma(x,y)+\lambda(|\mathrm{p}-\gamma_{ 1}|+|\mathrm{q}-\gamma_{2}|),\]

where \(s_{X,2}(x)=\int_{X}|x-x^{\prime}|^{2}d\mu(x)\) and \(s_{Y,2}\) is defined similarly. The above formula is analog to Eq. (7) in [44], which is designed for the unbalanced GW setting. To distinguish them, in this paper we call the Eq. (7) in [44] as "FLB-UOT initialization".

### Dataset.

The datasets include MNIST, EMNIST, and the following three domains of Caltech Office: Amazon (A), Webcam (W), and DSLR (D) [60]. For each domain, we select the SURF features [60] and DECAF features [61]. For MNIST and EMNIST, we train an auto-encoder, respectively, and the embedding space dimension is \(4\) and \(6\), respectively. See Figure 10 for the TSNE visualization of these datasets.

### Initial methods.

In this experiment, we employ three distinct initial methods: "POT", "FLB-UOT", "FLB-POT".

Figure 10: TSNE visualization for datasets MNIST,EMNIST,Caltech Office.

**"POT initialization"** is firstly introduced in [45].When \(X_{1},X_{2}\) are in the same dimensional space, i.e. \(d_{1}=d_{2}\). The initial guess, \(\gamma^{(1)}\) is given by the following partial OT variant problem:

\[\gamma^{(1)}=\arg\min_{\gamma\in P_{\nu,\pi}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\langle L(X, Y),\gamma\rangle_{F},\] (86)

where \(L(X,Y)\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m},\;(L(X,Y))_{ij}=\|x_{i}-y_{j}\|^{2}\) and

\[\Gamma_{PU,\pi}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q}):=\{\gamma\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n\times m }:(\gamma^{\top}1_{n})_{j}\in\{q_{j}^{Y},0\},\forall j;\gamma 1_{m}\leq\mathrm{p},|\gamma|=\pi\}.\] (87)

The above problem can be solved by a Lasso (\(L^{1}\) norm) regularized OT solver.

When \(d_{1}\neq d_{2}\), the above technique can not be applied since the problem (86) (in particular \(L(X,Y)\)) is not well-defined.

The second method **"FLB-UOT"** is induced in [44]:

\[\gamma^{(1)}=\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\int_{X \times Y}|s_{X,2}(x)-s_{Y,2}(y)|^{2}d\gamma(x,y)+\lambda(D_{KL}(\gamma_{1}, \mathrm{p})+D_{KL}(\gamma_{2},\mathrm{q})),\] (88)

where \(s_{X,2}(x)=\int_{X}|x-x^{\prime}|^{2}d\mu(x)\) and \(s_{Y,2}\) is defined similarly. The problem (88) is called Hellinger Kantorovich, which is a classical unbalanced optimal transport problem. It can be solved by the Sinkhorn solver [38].

Analog to the above method, we propose the third method, called **"FLB-POT"** (first lower bound-partial optimal transport)

\[\gamma^{(1)}=\arg\min_{\gamma\in\Gamma_{\leq}(\mathrm{p},\mathrm{q})}\int_{X \times Y}|s_{X,2}(x)-s_{Y,2}(y)|^{2}d\gamma(x,y)+\lambda(|\mathrm{p}-\gamma_{ 1}|+|\mathrm{q}-\gamma_{2}|).\] (89)

The above problem is a partial OT problem and can be solved by classical linear programming [12].

### Numerical details and performance.

**Accuracy Comparison.** In Table 2 and 4, we present the accuracy results for the MPGW, UGW, and the proposed PGW methods when using three different initialization methods: POT, FLB-UOT, and FLB-POT.

Following [45], in the MPGW and PGW methods, we incorporate the prior knowledge \(\pi\) into the definition of \(p\) and \(q\). Thus it is sufficient to set \(mass=\pi\) for MPGW and choose a sufficiently large value for \(\lambda\) in the PGW method. This configuration ensures that the mass matched in the target domain \(\mathcal{Y}\) is exactly equal to \(\pi\). However, in the UGW method [44], the setting is \(p=\frac{1}{n}1_{n}\) and \(q=\frac{1}{m}1_{m}\). Therefore, in each experiment, we test different parameters \((\rho,\rho_{2},\epsilon)\) and select the ones that result in transported mass close to \(\pi\).

Overall, all methods show improved performance in MNIST and EMNIST datasets. One possible reason for this could be the better separability of the embeddings in MNIST and EMNIST, as

Limitations

### Compatibility Between Linear Search and Frank-Wolf Solver

In practice, we have found that in some experiments, the linear search algorithm (see Sections I, J) may cause the Frank Wolfe algorithms (1, 2) to stop running earlier than expected. This may hurt the performance observed in the PU learning experiments (see Appendix P). As such, we disable line search in these experiments.

However, in other experiments, for example PGW barycenter (Appendix M.1), we do not find a significant effect of the linear search algorithm on the results.

### MDS in Point Cloud Interpolation Experiment

In the point cloud interpolation experiment (see Appendix M), for the classical GW barycenter method [41] or our PGW barycenter method, the last step is the same: applying MDS on the barycenter minimizer \(C\) to construct interpolation point cloud \(X_{t}\). However, such construction is not unique. As a consequence, for each constructed \(X_{t}\), we need to manually set up the rotation and flipping matrices.

This problem follows from the fact that the GW and PGW formulations cannot distinguish the data from its rotated (and flipped) version. We refer to Section M.1 for details.

## Appendix R Compute Resources

All experiments presented in this paper are conducted on a computational machine with an AMD EPYC 7713 64-Core Processor, 8 \(\times\) 32GB DIMM DDR4, 3200 MHz, and a NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.

## Appendix S Impact Statement

The work presented in this paper aims to advance the field of machine learning, particularly the supplementary theoretical developments and explorations of computational optimal transport. There are many potential societal consequences of our work, none of which we feel must be specifically highlighted here.

#### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the Abstract, we briefly introduce our main contributions, and in the Introduction (Section 1) we explain our main contributions in detail. These contributions are reflected by the theoretical and experimental results provided in the remainder of the main text and appendices. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We explain the limitations in Appendix Q. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: In each theorem, we clearly specify the details of conditions and assumptions along with complete proof. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justifications: In Sections M.1,M.2,N, subsection "numerical details", we explain the detailed parameter settings for each method in order to reproduce our results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the data and code as supplementary material. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We refer to the subsections "experiment setup" in Sections 5, M.1, M.2, N, P. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We calculate accuracy in experiments N, P, which are the only statistics reported in this paper. These values are classification accuracies for each tested dataset. Thus, error bar/variance are not involved in this work. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix R. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The authors have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and all the imported code has been properly cited. Guidelines: The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
* If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
* The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix S. Guidelines: The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not pose such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Sections M.1, M.2, N, P, subsection "dataset", we provide the citations of all datasets from other literature. We also cite all code adapted from other sources. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. ** If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
