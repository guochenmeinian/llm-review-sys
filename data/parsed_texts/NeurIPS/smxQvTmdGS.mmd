job matching systems powered by LLMs could unintentionally disadvantage ethnic minorities or individuals with disabilities (Hutchinson et al., 2020). Similarly, modern machine translation systems often transform gender-neutral terms into predominantly gendered forms, potentially intensifying existing gender biases (Stanovsky et al., 2019). Consequently, there is an urgent call for effective mechanisms to assess these detrimental biases in LLMs, ensuring their fair applications.

The LLMs often show significant volatility in their prediction in response to even slight changes in the input prompts or hyperparameter settings (Li et al., 2023; Li and Shin, 2024; Yang et al., 2024), causing generation inconsistency. For example, LLMs may provide contradictory statements about the same facts, or display varying gender stereotypes associated with the same profession in different contexts, underscoring the unpredictability of their behavior. However, existing evaluation metrics for LLMs' alignment overlook the model's stereotype volatility induced by generation inconsistency. For instance, the metrics proposed in CrowS-Pairs (Nangia et al., 2020) assess the frequency that the LLMs prefer a stereotypical output over an anti-stereotypical one in a given context and thus do not capture the LLMs' perspective variation due to context change. Consequently, the metrics fail to support the estimation of the likelihood of the LLMs' generations being against vulnerable groups.

To address the deficiency of previous metrics focusing solely on the average performance, we propose to study the statistical properties of LLMs' biased behavior across contexts by capturing both the bias and volatility of an LLM, with an intuitive explanation of them in Figure 1. Overlooking either factor can skew alignment evaluations, as demonstrated in Section A.2, where we show that current metrics fail to accurately assess discrimination risk between two models due to ignoring volatility. Moreover, accurately assessing these aspects is vital for estimating the risk of LLM applications inducing or amplifying stereotypes in practical scenarios, potentially resulting in the misallocation of vital resources, such as medical aid, to underrepresented and vulnerable groups.

In this work, we introduce a novel Bias-Volatility Framework (BVF) to formally model both the bias and volatility of the LLMs' stereotyped behavior originating from the model's biases and generation inconsistency. BVF is based on three key new ideas: The first is to use a _stereotype distribution_ of an LLM to mathematically characterize the stereotype variation over contexts, which can be estimated based on a sample of variable contexts for a prediction task. The distribution enables us to go beyond pure task performance evaluation to evaluate an LLM's behavior (e.g., its potential tendency of social discrimination). The second is that metrics can be defined to quantify an LLM's behavior by comparing the estimated stereotype distribution with an expected reference distribution (e.g., fair treatment of each group) and quantifying any deviation (risk). The third is that based on the stereotype distribution and defined metrics, we can mathematically decompose an LLM's aggregated stereotype risk into two components: _bias risk_, originating from the systematic bias of the stereotype distribution, and _volatility risk_, due to variations of the stereotype distribution.

Figure 1: **Snow** metaphorically represents any human or language models. The biases of **Snow** are manifested in the statistical properties of its _perspectives_ (i.e. \(\mathbf{p}_{Snow}(Y|X)\)) over a topic (i.e. \(Y\)) conditioned on an evidence (i.e. \(X\)), including persistent _bias_ and _context-dependent volatility_, respectively correlating with the _mean_ and _variation_ of a bias-measuring random variable derived from perspectives.

Compared with existing stereotype assessment frameworks for analyzing discrimination risk, BVF offers the following distinguishing benefits: _i)_ Versatility: BVF can be adapted for diverse measurement objectives concerning justice-/fairness-related and intersectional topics; _ii)_ Comparative analysis: It enables the comparison of discrimination risk across different LLMs; _iii)_ Causative analysis: It provides a clear delineation of the sources of discrimination, elucidating whether it stems from the model's learned biases or its generation inconsistencies; and _iv)_ General applicability: It allows statistical analysis and comparison of parametric biases, i.e. knowledge and stereotypes, in any modal model, provided the framework's components are appropriately adapted for that use case (refer to Appendix E for more details).

We apply BVF to 12 commonly used language models, providing insights and issuing pre-warnings on the risk of employing potentially biased LLMs. We find that the bias risk primarily contribute the discrimination risk while most LLMs have significant pro-male stereotypes for nearly all careers. We also find that LLMs aligned with reinforcement learning from human feedback exhibit lowers overall discrimination risk but exhibit higher volatility risk.

## 2 Mathematical Modeling

In this section, we will illustrate how metrics introduced in BVF take both bias and volatility into account. This process involves two key steps: _i)_ Define and statistically analyze the distribution of model stereotypical behavior to quantify the risk levels associated with the LLMs' overall behavioral mode; and _ii)_ Decompose the total risk into two components: the risk arising from the persistent bias and the risk stemming from volatility.

Figure 3: Given _unbiased_ predicted probability \(\mathbf{p}^{*}\), how to relate probability \(\mathbf{p}\) (middle) to stereotype (left) and discrimination risk (right). In addition, risk decomposition is illustrated in the right figure.

Figure 2: Our statistical framework for measuring stereotypes in large language models (LLMs). As a case study, we investigate the biases of an LLM regarding \(Y=\{Binary\ Gender\}\), with \(X=\{Occupations\}\) as the context evidence. Starting with the LLM’s predicted word probability matrix for \(Y\) (blue for male and pink for female) conditioned on contexts \(C\) augmented with \(X\), we apply the discrimination criterion \(J\) on each element to transform the word probability matrix into a discrimination risk matrix. We then aggregate the discrimination risk matrix across \(C\)’s distribution and derive a discrimination risk vector, capturing the risk for each fixed \(X=x\). Finally, by aggregating the discrimination risk vector over \(X\)’s distribution, we obtain the LLM’s overall discrimination risk concerning \(Y\).

### LLMs' Stereotype Distribution and Discrimination Assessment

Our framework is depicted in Figure 2 and 3. We mathematically define the polarity and extent of an LLM's stereotype. We notice that the inconsistency of LLM's stereotype is triggered by the variation of contexts. Further, LLMs predict the forthcoming tokens according to the tokens of the existing context. Therefore, our definition is based on LLM's token prediction probability. When the LLM \(M\) is applied to predict the attribute \(Y\) given the demographic group \(X=x_{i}\) and the context \(C=c\) as the evidence, the model \(M\) computes the probabilities of all candidate tokens and selects the token with the highest predicted probability. Therefore, the stochastic nature of LLM next token sampling strategy causes inconsistency in their exhibited stereotype. We denote the LLM's preference that \(M\) predicts \(Y=y\) given \(X=x\) as \(p^{M}_{y|x}(c)\). We define \(M\)'s stereotype against \(X=x\) about \(Y=y\) in the context \(C=c\) as:

\[s^{M}_{y|x}(c)=\frac{p^{M}_{y|x}(c)}{p^{*}_{y|x}(c)}-1.\] (1)

where \(p^{*}_{y|x}(c)\) denotes the attribute prediction probability of the unbiased model. If the context \(c\) is devoid of information about the attribute \(Y\), we set \(p^{*}_{y|x}(c)=\frac{1}{|Y|}\), where \(|Y|\) is the number of possible values of \(Y\). For instance, the unbiased preference on gender topic is \(p^{*}_{male}(c)=p^{*}_{female}(c)=0.5\). When \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)>0\), it indicates that \(Y=y\) is a stereotypical impression of \(X=x\); conversely, it represents an anti-stereotype. The absolute value of \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\) signifies the corresponding intensity. Based on \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\), we further define two indices to characterize LLM's discrimination against group \(X=x\) and compute LLM's overall discrimination levels for all demographic groups and attributes.

**Definition 1**.: _The Discrimination Risk Criterion \(J\), measuring the most significant stereotype of \(M\):_

\[J(s^{M}_{Y|x}(c))=\max_{y\in Y}\{s^{M}_{y|x}(c)^{+}\}\] (2)

_where \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)^{+}=\max\{s^{M}_{y|x}(c),0\}\), which refers to the positive part of \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\). The purpose of utilizing the positive part is to eliminate the interference of anti-stereotypes. The detailed explanation can be found in Appendix B.1._

**Definition 2**.: _The Discrimination Risk \(r_{x}\), measuring \(M\)'s discrimination risk against \(X=x\) for all the sub-categories of attribute \(Y\):_

\[r_{x}=\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(J(s^{M}_{Y|x}(c))).\] (3)

_We further define the LLM's Overall Discrimination Risk to summarize \(M\)'s discrimination for all demographic groups about attribute \(Y\):_

\[R=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}(r_{x}).\] (4)

Our definition of \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\) is grounded in sociological research examining human stereotyping. Scholars in sociology have observed the variability in individuals' perceptions of a particular demographic across different attributes (Brigham, 1971, McCauley et al., 1980). As such, sociological discourse has elucidated the notion of a person's stereotype intensity, delineated by their beliefs regarding the association between a demographic and a specific attribute.

### Disentangle Bias and Volatility for LLM Discrimination Attribution

Modeling the inconsistent stereotypes of LLMs through probabilistic methods reveals two main factors that contribute to discrimination. One factor stems from the bias inherent in LLM predictions regarding the correlation between demographic groups and specific attributes; the other factor is the estimation variation, wherein the former denotes systematic bias in LLM predictions while the latter signifies the efficiency of LLM estimations in statistical terms.

Addressing bias necessitates adjustments to LLM architecture and training procedures, while variation may prove unavoidable. Consequently, decomposing discrimination risk in LLMs based on the contributions of bias and variation offers insight into the potential discrimination mitigative measures. Moreover, bias-induced discrimination can be likened to LLM prejudice, whereas variation-induced discrimination pertains to the LLM's lack of well-learned parametric biases for the prediction.

**Definition 3**.: _The Bias Risk \(r_{x}^{b}\) is the risk caused by the systemic bias of LLM's estimation about the correlation between social group \(X\) and attribute \(Y\):_

\[r_{x}^{b}=J(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(s_{Y|x}^{M}(c))).\] (5)

_The Volatility Risk \(r_{x}^{v}\) assesses inconsistency and randomness about \(M\)'s discrimination risk:_

\[r_{x}^{v}=r_{x}-r_{x}^{b}\] (6)

The Overall Discrimination Risk defined in Equation 4 also can be decomposed according to the bias-induced part versus the volatility-induced part, which is referred as Overall Bias Risk \(R^{b}\) and the Overall Volatility Risk \(R^{v}\) respectively:

\[R^{b}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}(r_{x}^{b}),R^{v}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}(r_{x}^{v}).\] (7)

## 3 Method

To use the BVF for estimating an LLM discrimination risk on a specific social justice topic, three steps are undertaken sequentially: specifying demographic groups and attributes, determining contexts to estimate the stereotype distribution, and calculating discrimination metrics with risk decomposition. This section elaborates on each step.

### Groups and Attributes

To facilitate the estimation of LLM's stereotype distribution, it is imperative to identify the tokens associated with specific demographics and attributes. For instance, to evaluate the potential for gender discrimination within employment opportunities for LLM, it is essential to identify all lexical representations denoting gender categories and various job roles. Examples of the former include terms such as "she/he," "woman/man," "grandmother/grandfather," among others, while the latter encompasses vocations such as "doctor" and "nurse," among others.

The sociological literature examining social discrimination has compiled comprehensive word lists pertaining to vulnerable demographic groups and attributes serving as stereotypical labels. We have opted to utilize these established word lists to instantiate variable \(Y\), as provided in Appendix D.1.

Occupations serve as the primary demographic categorization in our study, denoted by variable \(X\). The exhaustive list of occupations employed is available in Appendix D.1. We use a uniform distribution as the distribution of occupations to exclude occupation value judgments.

### Collect Context by Data Mining

Effectively capturing the varied applied contexts is crucial for accurately assessing and breaking down discrimination within LLMs. We adopt a data mining approach to gather a set of context templates, denoted as \(C\), specifically aimed at assessing discrimination risks related to the feature \(Y\). These

Figure 4: Our approach to data mining _contexts_ involves _i)_ extracting sentences containing terms from \(X\) and \(Y\) with coreference, _ii)_ parsing and recording their structure, and _iii)_ tallying their skeletons to estimate the distribution of \(C\).

context templates are chosen based on whether they fairly connect the demographic variable \(X\) with the attribute \(Y\). The selection process for \(C\), outlined in Figure 4, is designed to avoid the influence of other confounding factors and involves two steps:

Step 1. Gathering sentences.Randomly sample \(N\) articles from a representative dataset. In practice, we scrape from the clean Wikipedia dump from HuggingFace [Foundation] and set \(N=10,000\). In pre-processing the data, we filter out sentences lacking words from \(Y^{3}\). Next, we retain only those sentences where the gender-specific word from \(Y\) either co-refers with or modifies the subject, which would later be replaced with occupation words from \(X\). The structural skeletons of these selected sentences offer additional contextual cues to LLMs, encouraging them to express nuanced attitudes towards \(Y\) during inference.

Step 2: Extracting context templates.We simplify intricate text structures into sentence skeletons, reducing gender-specific cues for LLMs' inference, and then we track these predicates' frequency as distribution. For instance, in the sentence "Detective Smith said he would leave no stone unturned..." where he refers to Detective Smith and is a masculine word related to \(Y\), we parse and extract the predicate situated between these keywords, simply _said_ here, without imposing restrictions on its length. All predicates are standardized to the past tense, and _that_ is appended to reporting verbs, to prevent counting predicates with equivalent meanings, such as _says_, _said_, and _said that_, multiple times. Context templates are crafted using "[X]" for the subject and "[Y]" for the gender attribute word, as in "The [X] said that [Y]." We assume minimal deviation between the distribution of the mining dataset and real-world LLM application contexts. Consequently, the weight of each context template for aggregation is determined by its frequency in the mining dataset, calculated as \(\frac{Count(c_{i})}{\sum_{c\in C}Count(c)}\). Detailed information about our chosen \(C\) and its distribution is available in Appendix D.3 and code.

### Estimation of the Distribution and Indices

The procedure of estimating and decomposing LLM's discrimination risk includes three steps:

**Step 1: Estimating the conditional probability of \(Y\) given demographic group evidence is \(X=x_{i}\).** As per Equation 1, the estimation of LLM's stereotype relies on \(p^{M}_{y_{j}|x_{i}}(c)\). Nevertheless, a multitude of words associated with \(y_{j}\) exist. For instance, in assessing gender discrimination risk, gender-related terms such as "she/he," "woman/man," "grandmother/grandfather," and so forth are pertinent. Each word linked to a particular demographic group prompts the LLM to yield the corresponding token probability, denoted as \(\hat{p}^{M}_{v|x_{i}}(c)\). Consequently, \(p^{M}_{y_{j}|x_{i}}(c)\) constitutes the normalized summation of \(\hat{p}^{M}_{v|x_{i}}(c)\), computed by:

\[p^{M}_{y_{j}|x_{i}}(c)=\frac{\sum_{v\in y_{j}}\hat{p}^{M}_{v|x_{i}}(c)}{\sum_{ v^{\prime}\in\cup\{y_{k}\}}\hat{p}^{M}_{v^{\prime}|x_{i}}(c)},j\in\{1,\ldots,|Y|\}\] (8)

**Step 2: Estimating the distribution of stereotype.** The computed \(p^{M}_{y_{j}|x_{i}}(c)\) from Step 1 is utilized to derive \(s^{M}_{y_{j}|x_{i}}(c)\), as per Equation 1. Subsequently, a non-parametric approach is employed to gauge the distribution of \(M\)'s stereotype, \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\), across all demographic groups \(x\) concerning attribute \(Y\).

**Step 3: Estimating and decomposing LLM's discrimination risk.** As described in Equations 2 through 7, we employ \(s^{M}_{y|x}(c)\) to compute and aggregate discrimination risks within LLMs. This entails calculating \(r_{x}\), \(p^{b}_{x}\), and \(r^{v}_{x}\), along with their corresponding summaries \(R\), \(R^{b}\), and \(R^{v}\).

## 4 Results

### Main Results

We apply our discrimination-measuring framework to 12 common LLMs, specifically OPT-IML (30B) [Iyer et al., 2023], Baichuan (13B) [baichuan inc, 2023, Yang et al., 2023], Llama2 (7B)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

### Pro-male Bias

Our experiment across almost all LLMs, exclusively exempting ALBERT, unveiled a significant predisposition towards males, as shown in Figure 5. We observe that T5 and XLNet have a very strong tendency to perceive the genders of different occupations as male, which aligns with the two models having the highest risk of gender bias risk in Table 1. In contrast, Albert considers the genders of occupations to lean more towards female, with an overall shorter distance from the zero point, which corresponds to a lower bias risk for Albert as indicated in Table 1. Most models displayed a strikingly consistent trend: across all occupations, the vast majority, with notable exceptions like _nurse_, _stylist_, and _dietitian_, were predominantly perceived as _male-dominated_. This paradox highlights the unintended incorporation and perpetuation of societal gender biases within AI systems.

### Empirical Analysis of Bias Risk and Volatility Risk in LLMs

Data Toxicity:Toxic data in the training set is detrimental to the fairness of LLMs. We fine-tuned Llama2 on toxic data (Davidson et al., 2017; Iyer, 2021; Surge-ai, 2021) and tested the changes in gender discrimination risk before and after its training, as shown in Figure 6. For specific fine-tuning settings, please refer to the table in the Appendix D.4. Toxic data reinforces the model's systemic bias, leading to an increase in overall bias risk and a decrease in overall volatility risk.

Model SizeWe investigate the effects of scaling of various GPT family model sizes that are accessible for public querying. This includes GPT-2 models (137M, 335M, 812M, 1.61B), GPT-Neo (1.3B, 2.7B), and GPT-NeoX (20B). The results was shown in Figure 7. The overall trend shows there is a positive correlation between bias and model size, indicating that larger models might be more susceptible to overfitting or capturing biases present in the data. Conversely, volatility tends to decrease as model size increases, suggesting that larger models exhibit more consistent discrimination.

Rlhfe Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) ensures the fairness of LLMs by aligning the model with human preferences (Stiennon et al., 2020; Ouyang et al., 2022). We evaluated the impact of RLHF on model bias under our BVF. We tested three different sizes of LLAMA2 series models (7b, 13b, 70b) as detailed by Touvron et al. (2023). This included the BASE models pre-trained on text, as well as the chat versions that undergo additional stages of supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. The results are illustrated in Figure 8.

Our observations indicate that across various sizes of Llama models, the chat versions refined with RLHF exhibit a lower bias risk compared to the base versions, yet they possess a higher volatility risk. This suggests that while RLHF is capable of correcting inherent prejudices within the model, it does not effectively instill the principles of genuine gender equality, resulting in the model's continued capricious behavior.

### The Correlation with Social Factors

We investigate the association between discrimination risk and social factors. In Figure 9, we explore the relationship between the model's occupational discrimination risk and the _salary_ of that occupation using weighted least squares (WLS), where the weights are the number of people in that occupation (STATISTICS, 2022c). The regression curve in Figure 9 indicates that discrimination risk and occupational income are positively correlated, with LLMs being more likely to exhibit

Figure 8: The impact of RLHF on bias risk and volatility risk.

gender bias towards higher-income groups. This may be due to imbalances and stereotypes related to socio-economic status and gender roles present in the data. For the analysis results of other social factors such as _years of education_, _recruitment ratio_, and _occupation-specific word frequency_, please refer to Appendix C.2.

### Risk Management Implications

We compile the distribution of bias risk \(r_{x}^{b}\) and volatility risk \(r_{x}^{v}\) under gender topic corresponding to different occupations \(x\), as shown in Figure 10. Bias risk is typically characterized by a distribution that closely approximates normal distribution, underpinned by the principles of regression to the mean and the law of large numbers. Conversely, volatility risk is characterized by a fat-tailed distribution, diverging noticeably from adherence to the law of large numbers and presenting inherent challenges in precise forecasting, potentially rendering it infeasible. It is crucial to remain vigilant in addressing such unpredictable risks to prevent any potential loss of control over risk management protocols.

## 5 Related Work

LLMs have been empirically demonstrated to manifest biased tendencies and generation inconsistencies (Crawford, 2017; Bordia and Bowman, 2019; Perez et al., 2022; Gallegos et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2024). Numerous studies have aimed to develop methods for quantifying social biases in LLMs, revealing the models' inclination towards inequitable or prejudiced treatment of distinct population groups. Based on the different manifestations of these inequitable or prejudiced treatments, prior works on bias measurement in LLMs can be categorized into two main types:

**Word Embedding Metrics** This category of methods quantifies the biases present in LLMs by examining the geometric properties of their embeddings, such as the distance between neutral terms

Figure 10: The detailed discrimination decomposition under the topic of _Gender_. We fit the bias risk distribution with normal distribution. To better demonstrate the amorphous distribution of volatility risk, we perform interpolation on the calculated values and plot the interpolated lines.

Figure 9: The regressions between _income_ and discrimination risk. Each point denotes an occupation, with its size indicating the population of that occupation. We present the regression result determined by the weighted least squares principle, where the weights are derived from the labor statistics by occupation.

(e.g., occupations) and identity-related terms (e.g., gender pronouns) in the vector space. Bolukbasi et al. (2016) were the first to measure bias through the angle between word embeddings. Subsequent works, such as Caliskan et al. (2017) and Dev et al. (2020), have used cosine similarity between different word classes to assess model discrimination, inspired by the Implicit Association Test (IAT; Greenwald et al. 1998), and introduced the Word Embedding Association Test (WEAT) dataset. More recent studies have extended WEAT to multilingual contexts (Lauscher et al., 2020) and contextual settings (May et al., 2019; Kurita et al., 2019; Dolci et al., 2023). However, several reports suggest that biases identified in the embedding space exhibit only weak or inconsistent correlations with biases observed in downstream tasks (Cabello et al., 2023; Goldfarb-Tarrant et al., 2020).

**Probability-Based Metrics** One of the most widely used techniques for measuring biases in LLMs today is based on statistical metrics. For instance, Nadeem et al. (2020) assess LLM bias by analyzing how often the model selects stereotype-conforming or stereotype-rejecting choices when provided with cloze-style inputs. Similarly, Nangia et al. (2020) evaluate bias by examining the distribution of the model's scores for stereotype-laden sentences. Statistical metrics are more adaptable to downstream tasks and have been applied across various NLP tasks such as coreference resolution (Webster et al., 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2020), hate speech detection (Sap et al., 2019), question answering (Li et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021), text classification (De-Arteaga et al., 2019), and knowledge assessment (Dong et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). However, current evaluation methods primarily focus on biases in the model's probability predictions under specific templates, without accounting for prediction volatility or the probabilistic nature of the model's responses.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we propose the Bias-Volatility Framework (BVF) that measures the parametric biases and generation inconsistencies in large language models (LLMs) and define the mathematical terms that capture statistical properties of the distribution of LLMs' behavior metrics. BVF enables the mathematical breakdown of the overall measurement into bias and volatility components, facilitating attribution analysis. Using stereotype as a case study, we assess the discrimination risk of LLMs. We automate the context collection process and apply BVF to analyze 12 models to understand their biased behavior. Our results show that BVF offers a more comprehensive and flexible analysis than existing approaches, enabling tracking discrimination risk by identifying sources such as consistently biased preference and preference variation (i.e. \(R^{b}\) and \(R^{v}\)), while also facilitating the decomposition of overall discrimination risk into conditional components (i.e. each \(r_{x}\), \(r_{x}^{b}\) and \(r_{x}^{v}\)) for enhanced interpretability and control. Notably, BVF unveils insights regarding the collective stereotypes perpetuated by LLMs, their correlation with societal factors, the effects of human intervention, and the nuanced characteristics of their decomposed bias and volatility risks. These findings hold significant implications for discrimination risk management strategies and agent reward model designs. Finally, we underscore the generality and adaptability of this framework, which open up many interesting new opportunities for using it to measure all kinds of parametric biases (i.e., knowledge and stereotypes) across various multimodal models when the behavior metrics, context and bias criterion are appropriately tailored.

## 7 Ethics

**Definition of Justice-related Topics** In our investigation, we employ a framework predicated on the utilization of binary gender classification and a 5-category race taxonomy. This selection is made with the intention of maintaining congruity with previous research, thereby facilitating a clearer comprehension of our discrimination assessment method BVF. It is imperative to underscore, however, that our adoption of such classifications in no way diminishes our profound respect for individuals whose identities transcend these conventional delineations. Rather, it serves as a pragmatic methodological choice aimed at fostering comparability and coherence with existing research paradigms.

**Tailored BVF Adjustment for Dedicated Assessment Purposes** While we emphasize the theoretical robustness and broad applicability of the BVF in evaluating the inductive biases inherent within LLMs, we recognize the need to customize our approach to meet the specific evaluation goals. We acknowledge that every measurement framework has flaws and blind spots. Therefore, we approach evaluation with careful methodology, understanding the need for continual improvement to better grasp fairness and justice in our analysis.

\[M_{2}:\{C_{1}:(0.5,0.5),C_{2}:(0.35,0.65),C_{3}:(0.65,0.35)\},system\ bias=\mathbf{0}, deviation=\mathbf{20\%}.\]

_where the system bias quantifies the difference between a model's averaged contextualized preferences and the unbiased preference._

If we employ the average performance, i.e., system bias in this scenario, as a discrimination measure, this approach overlooks the variation of the entity's preferences, which reflects inconsistency and unpredictability in their predictions or decision-making. Such oversight can lead to measurement outcomes that defy intuitive understanding, as seen in the case of \(M_{2}\), which exhibits fluctuated biased preferences across contexts, yet its system bias remains at 0. Furthermore, _deviation_ alone cannot fully capture the biased behavior of the models. For instance, comparing \(M_{1}\) and \(M_{2}\), while both have the same deviation to be 20%, it does not account for the fact that the predictions of \(M_{2}\) exhibit larger variations, and its preferences are more biased in certain contexts. Consequently, a comprehensive quantitative measure of model discrimination should _i)_ consider both _average performance_ and _performance variation_, termed _bias_ and _volatility_ in our study, respectively; and _ii)_ facilitate their decomposition accordingly.

## Appendix B Mathematical Explanations

### Proof for the Diverse Effects of Different Definition of \(J\)

The utilization of \(J\) in the formulation corresponds to the \(l^{\infty}\) norm of \(S_{y}^{+}\), articulated as

\[J(s_{y|x}^{M}(c))=\max_{y\in Y}\{s_{y|x}^{M}(c)^{+}\}=l^{\infty}(s_{y|x_{1}}^{ M}(c)^{+},s_{y|x_{2}}^{M}(c)^{+},\cdots,s_{y|x_{|Y|}}^{M}(c)^{+}),\] (9)

where \(y_{1},y_{2},\cdots,y_{|Y|}\) is the possible values of \(Y\). Indeed, it is feasible to supplant the \(l^{\infty}\) norm with the \(l^{k}\) norm, delineated by

\[J^{k}(s_{y|x}^{M}(c))=l^{k}(s_{y|x_{1}}^{M}(c)^{+},s_{y|x_{2}}^{M}(c)^{+}, \cdots,s_{y|x_{|Y|}}^{M}(c)^{+})=\left(\sum_{y}(s_{y|x}^{M}(c)^{+})^{k}\right) ^{1/k},\] (10)

where \(k\in N^{+}\). The choice of \(l^{k}\) norm indicates the degree of risk aversion. Specifically, as the value of \(k\) increases, it signifies a higher level of individual aversion to uncertainty and risk, that is, a stronger degree of risk aversion. Conversely, a smaller value of \(k\) suggests that the individual is more willing to accept risk. In this paper, we adopt the maximal aversion to stereotypes, which posits that any form of stereotyping by the model towards any group is unacceptable. Consequently, we choose \(l^{\infty}\) norm in Equation 2 and all results in this paper are calculated by \(l^{\infty}\) norm.

### Mathematical Definition and Derivation of Reference Models

In this section, we will present the mathematical definitions and details of four reference models.

Ideally Unbiased ModelAn Ideally Unbiased Model, for any given occupation \(x\) and context \(c\), would yield the most equitable forecast. Considering binary gender as an illustrative case, such a model would assign gender probabilities \(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}=(0.5,0.5)\) across all occupations, irrespective of the template \(c\) utilized. Consequently, \(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})=0\) and

\[R=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}) \right)\right)=0.\] (11)

In parallel, the model's systemic bias risk and volatility risk can be quantified as follows:

\[R^{b}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}) \right)\right)=0,\] (12)

\[\text{Deviation}=\frac{|0.6-0.5|+|0.6-0.5|+|0.6-0.5|}{3\cdot 0.5}\]

Simplifying this, we find:

\[\text{Deviation}=\frac{3\times 0.1}{3\times 0.5}=\frac{0.1}{0.5}=\mathbf{20\%}\]\[R^{v}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}) \right)-J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right)\right)=0.\] (13)

This delineates that an ideally unbiased model is devoid of discrimination risk, encompassing neither systemic bias nor efficiency bias, thus standing as the paradigm with the minimal discrimination risk.

Stereotyped ModelThe Stereotyped Model ingrains fixed stereotypes for each occupation, positing, for instance, that "all doctors are male, all nurses are female." In the context of binary gender, this model stipulates \(\forall c,\ \mathbf{p}_{y|x}=(1,0)\) or \(\forall c,\ \mathbf{p}_{y|x}=(0,1)\) for a designated occupation \(x\). Therefore, \(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})=1\) and

\[R=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}) \right)\right)=1.\] (14)

Accordingly, the model's systemic bias risk and volatility risk are derived as:

\[R^{b}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}( \mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right)\right)=0,\] (15) \[R^{v}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J( \mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right)-J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right) \right)=1.\] (16)

This elucidates that a Stereotyped Model manifests the utmost bias risk.

Randomly Stereotyped ModelThe distinction between a Randomly Stereotyped Model and a Stereotyped Model resides in the non-existence of fixed stereotypes for any given occupation, with its evaluations being contingent upon \(c\). Continuing with binary gender as an illustration, for a specified \(x\), upon the random selection of \(c\sim C\), \(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}\) adheres to a Bernoulli distribution. That is, \(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}\) possesses an equal probability of being \((1,0)\) and \((0,1)\). Hence, \(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})=1\) and

\[R=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J(\mathbf{p}_{y|x}) \right)\right)=1.\] (17)

Correspondingly, the model's systemic bias risk and volatility risk are calculated as:

\[R^{b}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}( \mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right)\right)=0,\] (18) \[R^{v}=\mathbb{E}_{x\sim X}\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}\left(J( \mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right)-J\left(\mathbb{E}_{c\sim C}(\mathbf{p}_{y|x})\right) \right)=1.\] (19)

This delineation indicates that a Randomly Stereotyped Model is imbued with the highest level of volatility risk.

risk. Similarly, we measured religious and disability-related biases in four models--BERT, GPT-2, T5, and Llama 2. The detailed results can be found in Table 3.

### The Correlation with More Social Factor

Upon ascertaining the overall discrimination risk, one might ponder the extent to which these data encapsulate facets of societal constructs. To elucidate, the objective is to ascertain the correlation between various socio-economic determinants and the overall discrimination risk exhibited by LLMs. A strong correlation would suggest that LLMs manifest social biases that align with the stereotypes propagated by these determinants. To this end, data encompassing four distinct variables--_years of education_, _recruitment ratio_, _salary_, and _occupation-specific word frequency_--were collated from diverse sources [22, 23, 24, 25]. A regression analysis was conducted on these variables and the overall level of discrimination, with the results delineated in Figure 9.

### The Distributional Characteristics of Bias and Volatility in Racial Discrimination

In our observations of racial discrimination, we noted the distributional characteristics of bias risk and volatility risk. Similar to gender discrimination, the bias risk approaches a normal distribution, while the volatility risk exhibits a fat-tailed distribution. This suggests that it might be a universal pattern.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Model} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Religion} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Disability} \\ \cline{2-7}  & \(R\) & \(R^{b}\) & \(R^{v}\) & \(R\) & \(R^{b}\) & \(R^{v}\) \\ \hline BERT & 0.1111 & 0.1070 & 0.0041 & 0.1247 & 0.0029 & 0.1217 \\ \hline GPT2 & 0.1551 & 0.1505 & 0.0046 & 0.1082 & 0.0951 & 0.0131 \\ \hline T5 & 0.1895 & 0.1879 & 0.0016 & 0.1507 & 0.1493 & 0.0014 \\ \hline Llama2 & 0.1423 & 0.1380 & 0.0043 & 0.0883 & 0.0776 & 0.0107 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Expansion of Data Sources

We use additional natural language datasets, including webpage, book, conversation, and textbook, as sources for mining context templates. The results of the gender discrimination assessments, segmented by dataset, are presented in Table 4. In the ranking of each model's risk level for gender bias, despite variations in the magnitude of measured risk across datasets. Specifically, models identified as the most biased consistently exhibit the highest levels of bias in all our test scenarios,

Figure 14: The regressions between discrimination risk and salary

Figure 13: The regressions between discrimination risk and gender ratio recruitmentand similarly, the least biased models maintain their ranking. This consistency suggests that the biases inherent in LLMs are uniform across application contexts. Furthermore, the variation in the magnitude of discrimination values across datasets highlights the necessity of pre-selecting contexts akin to those to which LLMs are exposed.

### Expansion of Languages

The BVF framework can be applied to other languages. To manage various languages, it is necessary to redefine the demographic variable \(X\) with the attribute \(Y\) and subsequently obtain new context templates, similar to the process for different data sources. We present the measurement results of our model in Chinese in Table 5.

Figure 16: The detailed discrimination decomposition under the topic of _Gender_ and _Race_. We fit the bias risk distribution with normal distribution. To better demonstrate the amorphous distribution of volatility risk, we perform interpolation on the calculated values and plot the interpolated lines.

### Lists of Employed \(C\) with Distribution Details

Due to the diverse and thus challenging-to-enumerate forms of context templates collected from the corpus, we present only the top ten templates here based on their frequency of occurrence, which will determine their final weight for aggregation. The remaining templates are released alongside the code.

For gender discrimination detection (i.e., when \(Y\) represents gender), we utilize the following context templates:

As for race discrimination detection (i.e., when Y represents race), given that racial references in the text often appear as adjectives, we have adjusted our sentence mining strategy. We identify sentences with professions as subjects (assuming these subjects are being modified by adjectives), parse their predicates, and record the frequency of appearance of each sentence predicate. Considering that contemporary mainstream LLMs predominantly operate within an autoregressive paradigm, we have slightly modified the sentence structure to position the prediction [Y] at the end of the sentence. For instance, we employ the following context template:

### Hyper-parameters for Fine-tuning on Toxicity Data

We utilized the existing Toxicity Data dataset as our training data, which was constructed by aggregating harmful speech found on social media platforms (Davidson et al., 2017; Iyer, 2021; Surge-ai, 2021). We fine-tune the Llama2 model underwent on an 8-GPU setup, employing a batch size of 1 on each GPU and 4 gradient accumulation steps. Training was conducted over 2 epochs, with a learning rate set at 1e-5 and a warm-up ratio of 0.2 applied.

More Discussions

While BVF was motivated by discrimination analysis, it is a general framework for measuring and decomposing the model's behavioral patterns. As such, its adaptability enables a wide range of applications, depending on how its components are adapted to specific use cases. In the following sections, we explore the diverse ways in which the framework can be instantiated and deployed across different scenarios.

### Instantiation of Criterion Function \(J\)

BVF is a statistical framework capable of measuring LLM's _knowledge_ and _stereotypes_, where the transition between these two measurement scenarios mainly depends on how criterion \(J\) is defined. We have mentioned the concept of _parametric biases_ several times in previous sections, indicating the conditional relationships among words that the LLM learns from its pre-training data, often inferred from cues like word co-occurrence rates. This represents the LLM's preliminary comprehension of the world gleaned from its exposure to vast textual data. People subjectively label inductive biases that help the LLM accomplish tasks harmlessly as _knowledge_, seen in its ability to generate statements like "_Pride and Prejudice_ is authored by Jane Austen," or "Fubini's theorem states that the order of integration doesn't matter when the integral's absolute value is finite." In our work, inductive biases considered as potentially harmful are labeled as _stereotype_, such as when the LLM is more inclined to interpret a demographic group as either victims or criminals, hindering fair judgments, or when it biases a certain group of people towards certain professions, perpetuating social class intergenerational transmission.

Our framework was initially designed to measure this broader notion of _parametric biases_, thus allowing for the assessment of LLM's _knowledge_ alongside the _stereotype_. When \(J\) is defined to evaluate the LLM's mastery of knowledge, _stereotype_ in this work corresponds to _knowledge_, while _volatility_ corresponds to _confidence_ in this knowledge. More specifically, when \(J\) is designed as a concave5 function of model prediction \(\mathbf{p}\), according to Jensen's inequality, \(\mathbb{E}(J(\mathbf{p}))<J(\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{p}))\), indicating that the overall metric \(\mathbb{E}(J(\mathbf{p}))\) is less than the performance metric of deterministic knowledge \(J(\mathbb{E}(\mathbf{p}))\) under criterion \(J\). The difference in these two terms here stems from the _confidence_ in knowledge. We leave the refinement of this knowledge measurement framework as future work.

Footnote 5: A logically sound \(J\) should ideally exhibit convex behavior when assessing stereotype, as its value ought to decrease when probabilities are more evenly distributed. Conversely, when evaluating knowledge, \(J\) should display concave behavior, indicating that unbalanced correct predictions result in lower risk measurement values.

### Interpretation of Bias and Volatility

We propose supplementing _behavior variation_ alongside _average performance_ as a holistic measure of the applicability of large foundation models. This entails assessing the overall _behavior_ of the model, rather than solely measuring task performance with individual cases. This variation implies the unpredictability of LLMs' behavior, raising concerns for their direct use in sensitive areas like medical diagnoses, employment decisions, or integration into future agent systems. For instance, an LLM might accurately provide factual information in some cases but fail to do so in others, or it may exhibit bias at a critical moment, despite having appeared neutral for an extended time. In extreme cases, such uncontrollable unpredictability could lead to fatal system failure.

Take discrimination measurement, for instance. Human discriminatory viewpoints vary with contexts, influenced by numerous environmental factors during decision-making. For an individual with deep-seated biases yet susceptible to environmental influences, their seemingly fair and benevolent act in a particular context requires explanation using both the mean and variance of their biased _preferences_. For LLMs, instances where the generation distribution shifts due to varied conditioned contexts are more readily observable. For example, inconsistencies in LLM predictions on case judgments due to subtle changes in wording that do not affect the facts of the case pose a serious threat to judicial fairness [Chen et al., 2023]. Hence, in considering the model's application risks, both _bias_ and _volatility across contexts_ need to be taken into account.

The same rationale applies to measuring LLM knowledge. Inconsistency in model knowledge generation, indicative of insufficient knowledge confidence, also impacts the model's application effectiveness. However, existing evaluation methods for LLMs primarily assess average performance across test samples, which fails to capture these inconsistencies. For example, the knowledge-testing benchmark MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) only evaluates each concept once with a fix question prompt, leading to significant variations in models' test accuracy on any small sub-split (e.g., astronomy) when the initial task-instructional prompts are slightly modified.

Consequently, we suggest that in model auditing, in addition to the traditional measure of _average task performance_, one should also take into account _performance variation_, indicating inconsistencies in behavior across various contexts. Indeed, much akin to evaluating human performance across diverse situations when recruiting labor, we should similarly assess the holistic _behavior_ of models before grounding them in real-world applications.

### Instantiation of Context \(C\)

Expanding the scope of _context_ allows this framework to measure the inductive bias of models across diverse modalities. In this study, context primarily refers to the textual environment upon which the LLM is conditioned, while for visual models, such as those in autonomous vehicles determining steering angles from visual inputs, the context covers all encountered visual scenarios.

Evaluating the inductive biases of models across modalities is equally essential for their safe practical deployment. For instance, assessing the qualification of a visual model for autonomous vehicles requires at least measuring its knowledge of traffic-norm related video-action pairs such as <_video: running emergency vehicle, action: yield>_, where the videos constitute the major contexts. In testing this knowledge, visual contexts should encompass not only commonly encountered emergency vehicles like ambulances and police cars but also ones from the long-tail distribution, such as fire trucks (Shakir, 2023). Likewise, determining the applicability of this visual model for autonomous driving systems also necessitates the evaluation of both the average performance and the performance variance regarding a set of traffic knowledge of a similar nature.
