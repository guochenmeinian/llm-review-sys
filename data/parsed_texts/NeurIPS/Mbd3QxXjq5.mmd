###### Abstract

Recent work has shown the immense potential of synthetically generated datasets for training large language models (LLMs), especially for acquiring targeted skills. Current large-scale math instruction tuning datasets such as MetaMathQA [1] and MAMmoTH [2] are constructed using outputs from closed-source LLMs with commercially restrictive licenses. A key reason limiting the use of open-source LLMs in these data generation pipelines has been the wide gap between the mathematical skills of the best closed-source LLMs, such as GPT-4, and the best open-source LLMs. Building on our proposed prompting novelty, the recent progress in open-source LLMs, and some brute-force scaling, we construct OpenMathInstruct-1, a high-quality math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs. The dataset is constructed by synthesizing _code-interpreter_ solutions for GSM8K and MATH, two popular math reasoning benchmarks, using the recently released and permissively licensed Mixtral model. Our best model, OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, trained on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH, which is competitive with the best _gpt-distilled_ models. To support the open-source efforts, we have released our code, models, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset under a commercially permissive license.1

## 1 Introduction

The huge development and inference costs associated with general-purpose large language models (LLMs) have led to the rise of smaller, task-specific LLMs. Recent work has proposed creating these domain/task-specific LLMs by generating _high-quality synthetic data_ using powerful closed-source models such as GPT-3.5/4 [3] and training smaller models on the generated _distillation_ data [4, 5, 6]. For mathematical reasoning, our task of interest, all the current state-of-the-art open-source models are _gpt-distilled_[7, 2, 8, 9]. However, model development recipes relying on proprietary models like GPT-4 can have serious limitations: (a) legal restraints on how the finetuned models can be used,2 (b) generating data with closed-source models is typically costlier than state-of-the-art open-source models, and (c) these recipes lack reproducibility as closed-source model behaviors can vary significantly over time [10].

Footnote 2: https://openai.com/policies/terms-of-use

_For developing mathematical reasoning models, why are open-source models not used in place of closed-source models?_ To answer this, we compare GPT-4 with the Mixtral 8x7B model [11], one of the best open-source LLMs at mathematical reasoning in early 2024, by generating _code-interpreter_ style solutions for two popular mathematical reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8K [12]and MATH [13]. We use the metric _training set coverage (TSC)_ to compare the models, where TSC measures the number of training problems for which any of the generated solutions leads to the ground truth answer (pass@k). Figure 1 shows the training set coverage (TSC) of the Mixtral model as a function of the number of sampled solutions. For the relatively easier GSM8K benchmark, the Mixtral model's coverage catches up to GPT-4's with almost 8x the number of solution samples. For the challenging MATH benchmark, even with 12x the number of solutions, the Mixtral model still has a lower TSC than GPT-4. This gap in the training set coverage reflects the distillation data quality and, hence, the quality of the final fine-tuned model. This explains the preference for GPT-4 in the current distillation pipelines for mathematical reasoning.

_Bridging the coverage gap between GPT-4 and Open-source LLMs_: We limit our investigation of open-source LLMs for synthesizing solutions to the Mixtral-base model due to (a) its strong performance on mathematical reasoning tasks compared to other open-source LLMs, and (b) its permissive license.3 As a first attempt, we use a brute-force approach of sampling several solutions per problem. However, this approach only scales logarithmically, limiting its effectiveness (Figure 1). Next, we explore the approach of targeted solution generation, where we write few-shot prompts focused on specific sections of the training data. Concretely, we write few-shot prompts for each mathematics subject in the MATH dataset and merge the synthesized solutions. The motivation is that these subject-specific few-shot prompts could better target the latent mathematical capabilities of these general-purpose LLMs. Unfortunately, we only find a marginal gain in TSC with this approach (Section 2.2.2). Finally, we utilize the fact that reference text solutions accompany mathematical benchmarks such as MATH and GSM8K. These reference solutions can aid the synthesis of code-interpreter style solutions. We show that using these reference solutions in our few-shot prompt with a slight modification substantially increases the coverage and, consequently, the performance of the fine-tuned model (Section 2.2.3 and 4.1.2).

Footnote 3: https://mistral.ai/news/mixtral-of-experts/

Our solution synthesis experiments result in OpenMathInstruct-1, a collection of 1.8M problem-solution pairs. OpenMathInstruct-1 has a training set coverage of 93% for MATH and 99.9% for GSM8K. Table 1 shows that compared to previous mathematical reasoning fine-tuning datasets, OpenMathInstruct-1 is at least four times bigger, and, even more importantly, it is permissively licensed, allowing unrestricted usage by future work. To illustrate the quality of OpenMathInstruct-1, we train and release a range of models based on Mistral-7B [14], Llama 2 [15], and CodeLlama [16]. In particular, the CodeLlama-70B model fine-tuned on a subset of OpenMathInstruct-1, referred to as OpenMath-CodeLlama-70B, achieves a score of 84.6% on GSM8K and 50.7% on MATH. These scores are competitive with the current best _GPT-distilled_ models. Finally, to support the open-source efforts in this direction, we have publicly released all our fine-tuned models, code, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset, along with a further 6.6M incorrect sampled solutions under a commercially permissive license.4

## 2 Training Data Synthesis

### Overview

Setup.Let \(\mathcal{X}=\{(q_{1},a_{1}),\cdots,(q_{N},a_{N})\}\) be a typical mathematical reasoning training dataset, where \(q_{i}\) and \(a_{i}\) denote the \(i^{\text{th}}\) question and answer respectively. Optionally, the training dataset may include reference text solution \(t_{i}\), which illustrates a trajectory from \(q_{i}\) to \(a_{i}\) using mathematical principles.5 Besides the data, we assume access to a foundation LLM like Mixtral-base. The goal is to generate diverse, high-quality solutions for the training set problems using the LLM: a popular recipe for reasoning tasks [21; 22]. Recent work has also attempted augmenting training set problems [1; 2], but we limit our exploration to solution synthesis for existing problems in the benchmark.

Footnote 5: Both GSM8K and MATH have these text solutions.

Solution Format.We use the code-interpreter format for the synthesized solutions (see Figure 5 in Appendix for a sample solution). The code-interpreter format interweaves natural language reasoning with Python code blocks. It thus combines the computation precision of coding environments with the expressiveness of natural language reasoning, which is particularly suitable for mathematical reasoning tasks [8; 23]. To demarcate the start and end of a code block, we use the strings \(\langle\texttt{llm-code}\rangle\) and \(\langle\texttt{llm-code}\rangle\). A code block is followed by its execution block, which is demarcated by \(\langle\texttt{llm-code-output}\rangle\) and \(\langle\texttt{/llm-code-output}\rangle\). During inference, the model invokes the Python interpreter to run the preceding code block after generating \(\langle\texttt{/llm-code}\rangle\), appends the execution result in between the \(\langle\texttt{llm-code-output}\rangle\) separators, and resumes the autoregressive model inference.6

Footnote 6: During training, we donâ€™t mask the code execution output surrounded by \(\langle\texttt{llm-code-output}\rangle\) separators.

Approach.We use few-shot prompting to synthesize solutions for the training sets of GSM8K and MATH. Formally, the prompt has the form:

\[\mathcal{I}\left(q_{1},c_{1}\right),\cdots,\left(q_{K},c_{K}\right)\,q^{\prime}\]

where \(\mathcal{I}\) represents a text-based instruction for the task, \(\{q_{1},\cdots,q_{K}\}\) represent \(K\) problems representative of the dataset, \(\{c_{1},\cdots,c_{K}\}\) represent their respective solutions in the code-interpreter format, and \(q^{\prime}\) represents a question from the training set. Given this prompt, the base LLM generates a candidate solution \(c^{\prime}\) for the question \(q^{\prime}\). If \(c^{\prime}\) leads to the correct answer for the question \(q^{\prime}\), we add the pair \((q^{\prime},c^{\prime})\) to our fine-tuning set. For all our experiments, we choose \(K=5\), and the representative problems are chosen from the training set of the corresponding benchmark. In the instruction \(\mathcal{I}\), we instruct the model to output the answer inside the \(\backslash\)boxed{} block. The complete instruction is in Table 13 in Appendix B.4.

Sampling Details.We sample solutions with temperature=1.0 and top_p=0.95. We use the following constraints in our generation pipeline: (a) the total number of input-output tokens is limited to 4096, (b) a maximum of 512 new tokens after each code block, (c) a maximum of 3 code blocks, and (d) the generation halts after any code execution error. We use the TensorRT-LLM toolkit.7

### Prompting

In the previous section, we described our solution generation pipeline. A key ingredient of this pipeline is the few-shot prompt examples. We next describe the different prompting strategies explored in this work.

#### 2.2.1 Default

We choose five representative examples of GSM8K and MATH to create the few-shot prompt for the respective datasets. For GSM8K, we use a mix of problems that require vanilla Python code and problems that are best solved using Python's _sympy_ library. For MATH, we compose a 5-shot prompt with examples from different subjects. To reflect this diversity of reasoning paths required for MATH, we choose a mix of problems that require code-based solutions, text-based solutions, and a combination of both. The prompts used for the two datasets are presented in Appendix B.6.

For GSM8K, we sample 128 solutions per training problem, which gets a training set coverage of 99.1%. For MATH, we sample 224 solutions per training problem, which only achieves a training set coverage of 80.1%. This difference in coverage reflects the difficulty of the MATH benchmark compared to GSM8K, which has been noted in previous work as well [8, 9].

#### 2.2.2 Subject-specific Prompting (Subj)

_Could the diversity of mathematical topics in MATH be a reason for the low training set coverage with a single 5-shot prompt?_ To answer this question, we create subject-specific prompts for the seven subjects in the MATH benchmark, namely algebra, geometry, intermediate algebra, number theory, prealgebra, precalculus, and probability (See Table 11 in the appendix for the subject-wise split of MATH training data). The MATH benchmark also labels problems by their hardness level, with levels ranging from 1 to 5, where level 5 is the hardest. For creating subject-specific 5-shot prompts, we choose one example from each level for a given subject. For each of the seven prompts, we sample 32 solutions per problem and combine the data generated with all the prompts, which is equivalent to 32 x 7 = 224 solutions per problem. However, even with this fine-grained prompting, we only achieve a negligible gain in the training set coverage, though the total number of correct solutions increases by 14K (177K \(\rightarrow\) 191K, see Table 2).

Combining this fine-tuning dataset with the earlier single default prompt dataset yields a training coverage of 85.1% for MATH, a boost of 5% absolute. However, achieving this coverage required sampling almost 450 solutions per problem (224 + 224 = 448). _Can we make the solution generation pipeline more efficient?_

#### 2.2.3 Masked Text Solution Prompting (Mask-Text)

GSM8K and MATH benchmarks come with reference text solutions. Using these text solutions can, in theory, reduce the problem of code-interpreter solution generation to a translation problem from text to code. We initially experimented by prompting the LLM with:

\[\mathcal{I}\left(q_{1},t_{1},c_{1}\right),\cdots,\left(q_{K},t_{K},c_{K} \right)\,q^{\prime},t^{\prime}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Prompt & \multicolumn{3}{c}{MATH} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{GSM8K} \\  & \# Samples & \# Unique Solns. & Coverage (in \%) & \# Samples & \# Unique Solns. & Coverage (in \%) \\ \hline Default & 224 & 177K & 80.1 & 128 & 434K & 99.1 \\  + Subj & 224 & 191K & 80.1 & - & - & - \\ \hline Mask-Text & 224 & 192K & 85.9 & 128 & 602K & 99.9 \\  + Subj & 224 & 227K & 87.5 & - & - & - \\ \hline Total & 896 & 787K & 93.0 & 256 & 1036K & 99.9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Statistics of _unique_ solutions generated by prompts described in Section 2.2. Default prompt refers to the single prompt used for the two benchmarks, Mask-Text refers to prompting the model with masked text solution, and Subj refers to prompting with subject-specific prompts (applicable only to MATH). Coverage % refers to the percentage of problems in the training set for which thereâ€™s at least one solution among the generated solutions.

where \(t_{i}\)'s represent the text solution of representative problem \(q_{i}\)'s and \(t^{\prime}\) represents the text solution of the problem \(q^{\prime}\). Using the text solution in the prompt leads to a considerable increase in training set coverage. However, our manual analysis revealed that many solutions were _shortcuts_. E.g., trivial solutions such as print(ANSWER) or The answer is ANSWER where the ANSWER is copied from the text solution \(t^{\prime}\) in the prompt. Our attempts to filter out these trivial solutions proved challenging as there are many creative ways in which the generated solutions were cheating (see Figure 11 in Appendix).

To deter the possibility of such _shortcut_ solutions where the results of intermediate computations or the final answer from the text solution are copied, we propose prompting with a _masked text solution_. Such solutions have all numbers in intermediate computations replaced with symbols. A sample masked text solution is shown in Figure 2. These masked text solutions are generated using few-shot prompting as follows:

\[\mathcal{I}_{\text{mask}}\;(q_{1},t_{1},t_{1}^{\text{mask}}),\cdots,(q_{K},t _{K},t_{K}^{\text{mask}})\;q^{\prime},t^{\prime}\]

where \(\mathcal{I}_{\text{mask}}\) represents the instruction for the solution masking task, and \(\{t_{1}^{\text{mask}},\cdots,t_{K}^{\text{mask}}\}\) represent masked text solutions corresponding to \(\{t_{1},\cdots,t_{K}\}\). For a detailed overview of the masked text solution generation pipeline, we refer the reader to Appendix B.5. Using these masked text solutions in the prompts significantly boosts the training set coverage for MATH, increasing from 80.1% \(\rightarrow\) 85.9% for the single _default_ prompt, and 80.1% \(\rightarrow\) 87.5% for the subject-specific prompts. For GSM8K, it leads to the coverage increasing from 99.1% to 99.9%.

Table 2 summarizes the statistics of the solutions dataset generated via different prompts. The OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset is obtained by merging and deduplicating the problem-solution pairs resulting from the above-described prompt strategies. OpenMathInstruct-1 consists of 787K unique solutions for 6978 problems (out of 7500) in MATH and 1.04M unique solutions for 7469 problems (out of 7473) in GSM8K. To get to this final dataset, we also perform a few post-processing steps, which are described next.

### Post-processing

The generated solutions can sometimes be _syntactically noisy_ even if they lead to the right answer. We fix or remove the following solutions:

* Remove solutions with multiple \(\backslash\)boxed\(\{\}\) blocks.
* Remove solutions with the \(\langle\)llm-code\(\rangle\) string but not the \(\langle\)/llm-code\(\rangle\) string.
* Remove text beyond the solution line with the answer, i.e., the \(\backslash\)boxed\(\{\}\) block. See Figure 12 in the Appendix for an example solution where we perform trimming.

While these post-processing steps can fix some of the syntactic errors, filtering _semantically noisy_, i.e., solutions that get to the right answer with flawed reasoning [12], is a much harder problem and beyond the scope of this work. Anecdotally, we find such solutions to be rare in our corpus. See Figure 13 in the Appendix for a sample _semantically noisy_ solution.

Figure 2: A sample masked solution from GSM8K training set. The masked text solution only masks the intermediate computations, such as 9 \(\rightarrow\) M and 63 \(\rightarrow\) N, and doesnâ€™t mask the amounts introduced in the question, such as 7, 2, and Â§4.

### Data Selection

OpenMathInstruct-1 on average has hundreds of solutions per problem. These solutions can have different formats (code vs. text), and problems can have very different numbers of solutions in the dataset. Careful data selection allows for reduced training times and can also benefit performance. We detail the data selection strategies explored in this work.

#### 2.4.1 Fair vs. Naive Downsampling

For a dataset like MATH, where problems have divergent difficulty levels, our solution generation strategy leads to a corpus where _easier_ problems have a lot of solutions and _harder_ problems have very few solutions (see Appendix A.2 for a detailed discussion on solution count). A _naive_ strategy for downsampling treats every instance, i.e., problem-solution pair, as an equal. This problem-agnostic sampling perpetuates the imbalance of the original corpus, as seen in Figure 3(a). We propose a _fair_ sampling alternate in which we iterate over all the problems round-robin and sample without replacement from the remaining solutions for each problem. This problem-dependent sampling ensures a more balanced representation of each problem in the downsampled dataset (see Figure 3(b)). Experimental results show that _fair_ downsampling outperforms _naive_ downsampling (Section 4.1.1).

#### 2.4.2 Code-Preferred Solutions

The code-interpreter format allows for mixing code and text, and also text-based solutions without any code blocks. For GSM8K, the proportion of text-based solutions is 2%, but for MATH, their representation is 35.1%.8 While natural language reasoning is more expressive, it lacks the precision of code-based solutions [24]. Suppose for a problem \(q\) there are a total of \(N_{\text{total}}\) correct solutions in the corpus, out of which \(N_{\text{code}}\) represents the number of code-based solutions, and \(N_{\text{text}}\) represents the text-based solutions. We propose the following two _code-preferential_ data selection strategies:

Footnote 8: We detect the presence of code by searching for \(\langle\texttt{llm-code}\rangle\) in the solution string.

* _Majority-Code_: If \(N_{\text{code}}>N_{\text{text}}\), remove all the text-based solutions.
* _Any-Code_: If \(N_{\text{code}}>0\), remove all the text-based solutions.

Ablation experiments over the MATH subset of OpenMathInstruct-1 show the benefit of _code-preferential_ data selection (Section 4.1.4).

## 3 Experimental Setup

### Training Details

For all our experiments, including ablations, models of size 34B or smaller are trained for four epochs. A global batch size of 128 is used along with the AdamW optimizer with a weight decay of 1e

Figure 3: Histogram of the number of solutions for problems in a 64K downsampled subset of MATH instances in OpenMathInstruct-1.

2 [25] and dropout [26] of 0.1. We save one checkpoint per epoch for ablation experiments and two checkpoints per epoch for final model runs. The final checkpoint is created by averaging all the saved checkpoints. All experiments are performed using the NeMo toolkit9[27]. For the full set of training hyperparameters, see Appendix B.1.

Footnote 9: https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo

### Evaluation Setup

We evaluate our models on popular math reasoning benchmarks, namely GSM8K, MATH, GSM-Hard [24], SVAMP [28], TabMWP [29], ASDiv [30], and MAMPS [31]. For ablation experiments and hyperparameter selection, we create a validation set of 1K examples from the training set of GSM8K and MATH since both datasets lack an actual validation set. All the fine-tuned models are evaluated in the zero-shot setting. We use greedy decoding and self-consistency/majority voting [32] for evaluation. For majority voting, we found that using a lower temperature of 0.7 is beneficial compared to the data generation setup. We also deviate from the data generation setup by allowing the model to continue answer generation after code execution errors.

We finetune all the models on a mixture of (a) 512K fair downsampled GSM8K instances, and (b) 512K MATH instances with _any-code_ filtering (Section 2.4).10 Thus, the total finetuning corpus size is roughly 1.02M. We justify the data selection choices later in the ablation experiments.

Footnote 10: The actual number of MATH instances is 511,677.

Table 3 compares the performance of _OpenMath-finetuned_ models against their _GPT-distilled_ counterparts. Among the 7B models, our OpenMath-Mistral-7B is competitive with all the _GPT-distilled_ models. It is second-best to WizardMath on GSM8K, and tested by ToRA by 0.1% on MATH.11 Our models easily outperform both MetaMath [1] and MAMmoTH [2], even when controlling for the base fine-tuned model. Since WizardMath and ToRA finetuning datasets are not publicly available yet, OpenMathInstruct-1 presents a superior alternative to the publicly available MetaMathQA and MathInstruct datasets, which are used to fine-tune MetaMath and MAMmoTH, respectively.

Footnote 11: Our grading script scores the publicly released ToRA outputs about 2-3% lower than the reported numbers. We believe that ToRA uses some heuristics to extract answers when the model doesnâ€™t generate answers in the correct format.

With the increase in model parameters, our models continue to outperform MetaMath and MAMmoTH substantially. Compared to ToRA, with greedy decoding, we see a meaningful drop in performance on MATH, though our models are equal or better on GSM8K. With self-consistency (SC) decoding, however, our models outperform ToRA on both MATH and GSM8K. The substantial gains with SC can be attributed to the diversity of our fine-tuning data.

### Ablations

We perform ablation experiments with the Mistral-7B as the base model. We report results on the 1K-sized validation subsets for MATH and GSM8K created by us.

#### 4.1.1 Fair vs Naive Downsampling

We finetune the base model on a dataset of 128K instances created by combining 64K naive or fair downsampled instances from the GSM8K and MATH portion of the data. Table 4 shows that the model fine-tuned on the data downsampled with fair sampling outperforms the one created by naive downsampling. The performance gap is particularly substantial for MATH, which suffers from a graver data imbalance than GSM8K in our corpus.

#### 4.1.2 Default vs Masked Prompting

We finetune the base model on a dataset of 128K instances created by combining 64K fair-sampled instances from the GSM8K and MATH portion of the data generated using default and masked prompting. Table 5 shows that the model fine-tuned on the data generated using masked prompting outperforms the one created by default prompting on both GSM8K and MATH. Thus, the gains in the training set coverage with masked prompting (Section 2.2.3) also translate to finetuning performance.

#### 4.1.3 Impact of Fine-Tuning Dataset Size

To determine the impact of the size of the fine-tuning dataset, we create datasets of size 128K/256K/512K by combining 64K/128K/256K fair downsampled equally-sized subsets of GSM8K and MATH. Table 6 shows that the performance increases for both GSM8K and MATH with the increase in the fine-tuning dataset size. We didn't find any benefit from training the models for more steps, so the performance gain is attributable to the increased data size.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline Sampling & GSM8K & MATH \\ \hline Naive & 74.3 & 35.0 \\ Fair & **75.3** & **37.0** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Comparison of performance of Fair vs Naive downsampling on our validation subset of GSM8K and MATH.

#### 4.1.4 MATH-only Ablations

This section presents the ablation results for only the MATH portion of OpenMathInstruct-1. We finetune the base model on a 128K _fair_ downsampled subset to control for data size.

Default vs Subject-Specific Prompting.In section 2.2.2, we motivated using subject-specific prompts, which ultimately didn't result in much training set coverage difference. _But how are the solutions generated by the combination of subject-wise prompts different from a single default prompt?_ To answer this, we create a subset of 128K instances generated with the default prompt/subject-specific prompts. Table 7 compares the finetuning performance on these two splits on our MATH validation subset. While the model trained on the _subject-specific_ subset underperforms the model trained on the _default_ subset with greedy decoding, the trend is decisively reversed for self-consistency decoding with four samples. This suggests that the subset collected with subject-specific prompts has a higher diversity of solutions than the ones collected using a single prompt.

Code-Preferential Subsets.In this ablation, we determine the impact of code-preferential solution selection strategies proposed in Section 2.4.2. Table 8 shows that code-preferential solution strategies aid the greedy decoding performance. However, the reduction in solution diversity arguably results in a performance drop with self-consistency decoding (text-based solutions are about one-third of the original corpus). Based on these results and because _Any-Code_ results in a smaller finetuning dataset (512K compared to 664K with _Majority-Code_), we chose to use the _Any-Code_ subset.

## 5 Analysis

We analyze the performance of the ablation model trained on 512K instances from Section 4.1.3. We limit the discussion to the MATH benchmark, where the model scores 41.6% on our validation subset.

Performance-split by Subjects and Levels.Figure 4 presents the performance split by subjects and levels on the MATH validation subset. Among subjects, we see that the model's worst performance is on geometry, which can be attributed to the lack of multi-modality in our base models [23]. We see a monotonic decrease in performance with the increase in hardness level which is to be expected [23]. The model scores 72.4% on Level 1 problems and only 16.3% on the hardest problems, i.e., Level 5.

Error Analysis.Table 9 shows that the model performs an absolute 13.3% better when using code for answering questions in comparison to when not using it. We find that some of the errors made by text-based solution could have been avoided by preferring code-based solution; see Figure 16 for a sample solution where the model makes an arithmetic calculation error. This analysis provides another support for our proposal and use of code-preferred solutions from Section 2.4.2.

Table 10 presents the count of different error categories. For code-based solutions, we find that almost 74% of the errors in such solutions are due to reasoning errors, and the remaining 26% are attributable to execution-related issues. We present sample solutions from these error categories in Appendix B.3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline Dataset Size & GSM8K & MATH \\ \hline
128K & 75.3 & 37.0 \\
256K & 79.0 & 38.6 \\
512K & 81.0 & 41.6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 6 Related Work

Mathematical Reasoning and LLMs.Recently, a plethora of work has been done on enhancing the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LLMs. Inference techniques such as Chain-of-Thought [33], its programmatic counterpart, Program of Thought [24; 34], Self-Consistency [32], and Self-Verification [23] have been shown to significantly improve the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.

Pretraining language models on math-heavy content has resulted in foundation LLMs such as Minerva [35], Galactic [36], Llemma [37], and DeepSeeKMath [38] with stronger mathematical skills out-of-the-box. A more direct approach of dataset-specific training does _instruction fine-tuning_ on problem-solution pairs derived from math reasoning datasets. Our work falls in this latter category and bears similarity with recent work such as RFT [39], ToRA [8], MAMmoTH [2], MetaMath [1] and MathCoder [7]. We differ from the previous work along one factor or a combination of the following factors: (a) reliance on GPT-3.5/4, (b) solution format, and (c) use of ground truth text solution in synthesizing code-based solutions.

Knowledge Distillation via Synthetic Data.Recent work exploring the use of targeted _synthetic_ data generated by large foundation models for pre-training/instruction tuning smaller LLMs has led to tremendous progress in skills of these smaller LLMs [5; 6; 4; 40; 41; 42].

## 7 Conclusion

We introduce OpenMathInstruct-1, a math instruction tuning dataset with 1.8M problem-solution pairs which is released with a commercially permissive license. Compared to previous work, the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset is at least four times bigger. With our proposed prompting novelty of using _masked text solutions_ and some brute-force scaling, we achieve training set coverage of 99.9% for the GSM8K benchmark and 93% for the challenging MATH benchmark. The quality of these synthesized solutions is illustrated by finetuning experiments, which show models achieving performance comparable to or better than their _gpt-distilled_ counterparts. To support the open-source efforts in this direction, we publicly release all our fine-tuned models, code, and the OpenMathInstruct-1 along with a further 6.6M incorrect sampled solutions.

## Limitations and Potential Risks

Our work aims to improve the mathematical reasoning of open-source models using open-source models. In pursuit of this goal, we create a synthetic dataset, OpenMathInstruct-1, that our experiments show aids the performance on existing math benchmarks. Below, we list the key limitations of our work:

* Our manual analysis reveals solutions that get the right answer but via flawed reasoning (Figure 13 in Appendix). Removing these _semantically noisy_ solutions is beyond the scope of the current work. This means a lack of guarantee about the quality of our synthetically generated solutions.
* Improving performance on in-domain math benchmarks may not translate to performance gain on other related tasks. The drop in performance on GSM-Hard compared to GSM indicates that our models may not be robust to input perturbations, though, they are at par with previous work.

While we don't foresee any material risk due to our work, using our imperfect dataset and models to perform tasks, such as evaluating student assignments or building a math tutor, carries risk.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our claims match our experimental results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: Empirical paperGuidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide all the details to the best of our capacity. Some of the details have been shared in the supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [No] Justification: We are not sharing the data and code as of now. But we will be releasing everything with open access after the review cycle. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the details have been shared in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: All our fine-tuning runs are quite costly, which limits our capability to do multiple runs to capture this variability. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Details in the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We briefly mention it in the Limitations section on Page 10. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [No] Justification: Our dataset is related to mathematical reasoning. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We mention the use of Mistral models and that these models are released under permissive license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets**Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have tried to share details of the dataset generation process and the dataset ultimately created to the best of our capabilities. We have also clearly communicated that all the resources will be released under a commercially permissive license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. * **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not a paper which deals with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector. * **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Not required for our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.

### Code-Block Count Frequencies

We're using the code-interpreter solution format, which allows for flexible reasoning in text along with precision in code-based reasoning (see Figure 10). The code-interpreter allows solving a problem by breaking it into multiple code blocks. Most of the solutions in OpenMathInstruct-1 have 0 or 1 code blocks, 16.4% and 81.7% of the solutions, respectively (see Figure 6). The remaining 2% of the solutions have two or more code blocks. Figure 7 shows an example of a solution using two code blocks.

### Frequency of solutions per problem in OpenMathInstruct-1

Figure 8 shows the histogram of the frequency of the number of solutions in OpenMathInstruct-1 for problems in GSM8K and MATH. For GSM8K, 57.4% problems (4292 out of 7473) have more than half the sampled solutions, i.e., \(>\) 128 solutions out of 256 sampled solutions, that are _valid_. For MATH, the solution frequency histogram mimics a power-law curve, with most problems having very few solutions and very few problems with many solutions. Concretely, 19% problems (1324 out of

Figure 5: Code-Interpreter style solution for a training set problem from GSM8K.

Figure 6: Distribution of solutions with different code-block counts in OpenMathInstruct-1.

6978) with any solutions in OpenMathInstruct-I have \(\leq 10\) valid solutions out of the 896 sampled solutions per problem. To further highlight the hardness of the MATH benchmark in comparison to GSM8K, just 3.1% problems (233 out of 7500) have more than half the sampled solutions ( \(>448\) out of 896 sampled solutions), that are _valid_.

## Appendix B Miscellaneous

### Training Hyperparameters

Table 12 details the hyperparameters used for finetuning the different base models. Due to compute limitations, for 70B models, we limit the training to 2 epochs for Llama2 and 3 epochs for CodeLlama. For CodeLlama models, we use the learning rate of 2e-5 used by ToRA models [8]. For the Mistral-7B model, we use a lower learning rate of 1e-6 based on our hyperparameter search.

### Sample Solutions

In this section, we illustrate sample solutions representative of different phenomena encountered during the creation of OpenMathInstruct-1.

* Figure 9 presents a sample problem from the MATH training set with its representative solutions from the OpenMathInstruct-1 dataset.
* Figure 10 shows a sample solution that utilizes the strength of the code-interpreter solution format with reasoning in both code and natural language.
* Figure 11 demonstrates a sample solution generated when the reference solution is used in the few-shot prompt. The model copies the children's ages from the reference solution and initializes the child_age variable. Such solutions are the reason why we propose the use of masked text solutions in the prompt.
* Figure 12 illustrates a sample solution where the solution goes beyond answering the question, with the model generating coherent but unrelated text for the input problem.
* Figure 13 shows a sample solution where the generated solution gets the right answer but through flawed reasoning. These _semantically noisy_ solutions are much harder to detect with simple syntactic filters. One solution might be to use models like GPT-4 to grade the generated solutions as done in recent work [5]. We leave the work of developing such semantic filters for future work.

### Error Analysis of Solutions Generated by Fine-tuned Model

In this section, we illustrate instances of the different kinds of errors made by the ablation model analyzed in Section 5.

* Figure 14 demonstrates a sample where the model performs correct reasoning while generating the code. However, the model falters at copying the code output and generates a new answer.
* Figure 15 presents an example where the model generates correct but inefficient code that doesn't finish in our stipulated execution time and results in the _timeout_ error.
* Figure 16 illustrates a sample where the model performs correct reasoning but falters in arithmetic calculation (multiplication). Failure at arithmetic computation has been a known issue with LLMs and justifies our preference for code-based solutions.
* Figure 17 shows an example where the model generates a wrong code block to solve the problem and repeatedly generates the same code block till it runs into our maximum execution constraint. This example shows a limitation of our current dataset where we lack examples in which the model recovers from its error, unlike GPT-4 [23].
* Figure 18 shows a sample solution where the code generated in the solution runs into an execution error. Nevertheless, the model still generates an _incorrect_ answer to the question.

Figure 10: Sample solution where the model performs the initial reasoning in code and performs the last reasoning steps to answer the question in natural language. This shows the strength of the code-interpreter solution format for mathematical reasoning.

### Instructions for Few-shot Data Generation

Table 13 details the instructions used for the different generation tasks.

Figure 11: Sample _shortcut_ solution generated from prompting the LLM with the reference solution in context. The code initializes the variable child_age with the childrenâ€™s ages copied from the reference solution. The generated code then performs ad-hoc computations before answering the question in the text.

\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline
**Task** & **Instruction** \\ \hline Few-shot prompt (\(\mathcal{I}\)) & Here are some examples of questions and solutions followed by a new question that you need to solve. Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \textbackslash{boxed}\{\}. \\ \hline Few-shot prompt text masking (\(\mathcal{I}_{\text{mask}}\)) & Here are some examples of questions, solutions, and their masked solutions followed by a new question and solution that you need to mask. The goal is to ensure that the masked solution doesnâ€™t have any of the numerical values not mentioned in the question. So intermediate values calculated in the solution are to be masked by single letter capital variables, such as M, N. \\ \hline Zero-shot prompt for fine-tuned models & System: Youâ€™re an expert Python programmer and mathematician. Help the user to solve this problem using code when necessary. Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \textbackslash{boxed}\{\}. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13: Instructions for prompting the model.

### Masked Text Solution Generation

We generate masked text solutions using a pipeline very similar to the solution generation pipeline. We use the following procedure:

* Generate eight candidate masked solutions.
* Filter out solutions that have very different lengths.
* Filter out solutions that have the final answer. This ensures that our masked solutions are at least masking the final answer.
* Rank solutions where higher-ranked solutions have fewer numbers. This is essentially a heuristic to ensure we pick solutions where the intermediate computation is masked out the most.

Question: A department store displays a 20% discount on all fixtures. What will be the new price of a 25 cm high bedside lamp that was worth $120?

My solution: Let's solve this problem using Python code. <llm-code> discount_percent = 20 price_before_discount = 120 discount_portion = discount_percent / 100 discount_amount = price_before_discount * discount_portion price_after_discount = price_before_discount - discount_amount price_after_discount </llm-code> <llm-code-output> 96.0 </llm-code-output> So the new price of the lamp is \boxed{96} dollars.

Question: James opens up a flower shop. He needs to pay rent of $1200 a week with an additional 20% of rent to pay for utilities and he has 2 employees per shift with the store open 16 hours a day for 5 days a week. If he pays each employee $12.50 an hour, what are his weekly expenses to run the store?

My solution: The cost consists of rent, utilities, and employee salaries. Let's compute each of them separately and then add them up. <llm-code> # rent cost rent_per_week = 1200 # utility cost utility_per_week = rent_per_week * 20 / 100 # employee cost employee_work_hours = 16 work_days_per_week = 5 employee_work_hours_per_week = work_days_per_week * employee_work_hours_number_of_employees = 2 employee_cost_per_hour * employee_cost_per_hour # add the three to get total cost cost_per_week = rent_per_week + utility_per_week + employees_cost_per_week cost_per_week </llm-code> <llm-code-output> 3440.0 </llm-code-output> Thus James's weekly expenses add up to \boxed{3440} dollars.

Question: A rectangular box $P$ is inscribed in a sphere of radius $r$. The surface area of $P$ is 384, and the sum of the lengths of its 12 edges is 112. What is $r$?

My solution: Let the dimensions of $P$ be $x$, $y$, and $z$. The sum of the box's edges is $4(x + y + z)$ and the surface area is $2xy + 2yz + 2xz$. The diameter of the sphere is $2r$ and it's equal to the diagonal of the box. Let's now write down the equations based on the above information and solve them using sympy. <llm-code> from sympy import symbols, Eq, solve

# define the variables x, y, z, r = symbols('x y z r')

equations based on the given information eq1 = Eq(2 * (x*y + x*z + y*z), 384) eq2 = Eq(4 * (x + y + z), 112)

the diagonal of the box is the diameter of the sphere diagonal_eq = Eq(x**2 + y**2 + 2**2, (2*r)**2)

# solve the equations solutions = solve((eq1, eq2, diagonal_eq), (x, y, z, r))
[solution[-1] for solution in solutions] </1lm-code> <1lm-code-output> [-10, -10, 10, 10] </1lm-code-output> Since the radius of the sphere is positive, we get $r = \boxed{10}$.

Question: A bee starts flying from point $P_0$. She flies $1$ inch due east to point $P_1$. For $j \ge 1$, once the bee reaches point $P_j$, she turns $30^^{(circ }$ counterclockwise and then flies $j+1$ inches straight to point $P_{j+1}$. When the bee reaches $P_{2015},$ how far from $P_0$ is she, in inches? My solution: We can represent the rotation action via $\omega = e^{(pi i/6)$. Let's assume the bee starts at the origin, so $P_{2015}$ is at the point \[z = 1 + 2 \omega + 3 \omega^2 + 4 \omega^3 + \dots + 2015 \omega^2(2014).\] This is an arithmetic-geometric series which we can solve by simplifying the expression. Alternatively, we can solve for |z| using sympy using the following code. <llm-code> from sympy import I, pi, exp, sqrt

rotation action of 30 degrees omega = exp(I * pi/6) position = 0 for i in range(2015):  delta = (i + 1) * omega**(i)  position += delta real, img = (position.as_real_imag()) # Distance from origin i.e. starting point  dist = sqrt(real**2 + img**2)  print(dist) </1lm-code> <llm-code-output> sqrt(2)*(1008 + 1008*sqrt(3)) </llm-code-output> So the bee is $\boxed{1008}sqrt{2} + 1008}sqrt{6}$ far from the starting point. Question: If $f (x) = x^2 - 1$, what is the value of $f (-1)$? My solution:
