###### Abstract

On User-Generated Content (UGC) platforms, recommendation algorithms significantly impact creators' motivation to produce content as they compete for algorithmically allocated user traffic. This phenomenon subtly shapes the volume and diversity of the content pool, which is crucial for the platform's sustainability. In this work, we demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that a purely relevance-driven policy with low exploration strength boosts short-term user satisfaction but undermines the long-term richness of the content pool. In contrast, a more aggressive exploration policy may slightly compromise user satisfaction but promote higher content creation volume. Our findings reveal a fundamental trade-off between immediate user satisfaction and overall content production on UGC platforms. Building on this finding, we propose an efficient optimization method to identify the optimal exploration strength, balancing user and creator engagement. Our model can serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for recommendation algorithms on UGC platforms, helping to align their immediate objectives with sustainable, long-term goals.

## 1 Introduction

User-generated content (UGC) platforms have become an indispensable component of our daily lives [5, 45]. Those platforms, including various social media (e.g., Facebook, Instagram), streaming services (e.g., YouTube, TikTok) and many more, count on algorithmic recommendation algorithms [36, 5] to help content consumers (i.e., users) navigate the vast ocean of content generated by creators. Unlike other content recommendation platforms such as Netflix and Spotify, user experience on UGC platforms critically relies on the active participation of creators [58], as the goal of enhancing user engagement is inherently linked to the abundancy and diversity of the content pool.

Recent studies have begun to explore how a platform's algorithmic decisions, such as their employed recommendation algorithms and revenue sharing agreements, might influence the behavior of content creators and subsequently affect user welfare [52, 54, 55, 34, 30, 33, 32, 43]. A common technique used in these works is to model the competition among creators who strive to establish their brand and comparative advantages by selecting topics that maximize the traffic or rewards from the platform. While these competition models offer valuable insights into how platforms' interventions could lead to suboptimal outcomes in terms of content diversity and issues related to popularity bias, they ignore the dimension of content creation volume -- an equally critical aspect of such competitiondynamics. In fact, there are evidence suggesting that traffic received directly influences creator productivity [31; 56]. A recent study on a leading video recommendation platform found that creators whose content received boosted exposure significantly increased their video production without compromising quality [31]. And a recent field experiment on a large-scale video sharing social network showed that while popularity-based recommendation strategies boost content consumption, they can reduce content production [56]. The similar effect has also been documented on Instagram. For instance, when the recommender system allocates more traffic to targeted groups of creators, their production frequency increases, as indicated by metrics such as the number of daily active creators and the daily average creation volume per group. However, disproportionately boosting traffic to certain creator groups can negatively impact others; for instance, directing more traffic to popular, or "head", creators often diminishes engagement from less prominent, or "tail", creators. And overall, a statistically significant positive correlation exists between content viewership and the corresponding creator's productivity2.

Footnote 2: Further details regarding the Instagram findings are protected under a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) and may be disclosed in future versions of this work.

Motivated by real-world evidence and the research gap in modeling production frequency within content creation competition, we introduce a new game-theoretical model, named Cournot Content Creation Competition (\(C^{4}\)), aiming to study the impact of a platform's recommendation strategy on creators' production willingness. Our \(C^{4}\) framework builds upon the Content Creator Competition (\(C^{3}\)) framework introduced in [52; 54; 55], assuming that creators compete for platform-allocated user traffic [27; 29]. However, unlike \(C^{3}\) and similar previous models, our approach models the competition where creators are aware of their expertise and consistently produce within their niche, but strategically adjust their production frequency to balance gain and cost, which is often observed on mature platforms such as YouTube and Instagram. Our proposed competition model resonates with the well-established Cournot competition [14] in economics, where firms compete for revenue by strategically setting their production quantities. Hence, it inherits its name.

Our \(C^{4}\) framework offers a powerful tool for analyzing the competition dynamics among creators, as it always yields a unique Pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) that enables a precise prediction of the total content creation volume under any specific recommendation strategy. Furthermore, our in-depth analysis of \(C^{4}\)'s equilibrium reveals a critical and interesting insight: while increased recommendation accuracy boosts immediate user satisfaction, it simultaneously reduces creators' motivation to produce content, potentially compromising long-term user engagement. This finding, supported by both theoretical analyses and simulations, suggests the necessity to balance user and creator engagement through a careful control over the recommendation algorithm's exploration strength at a per-user basis. We formulated this mechanism design challenge as a bi-level optimization problem and tackled it using a projected gradient descent approach with an efficient gradient approximation scheme, providing an effective method to achieve the optimal trade-off between user satisfaction and creator productivity.

In summary, our contributions are threefold: (a) **modeling-wise**, we introduce a new game-theoretical framework, \(C^{4}\), to investigate how recommendation algorithms affect content creation frequency among creators; (b) **conceptally**, we reveal a new insight that managing the exploration strength of the recommendation algorithm can balance between short-term user satisfaction and long-term creator engagement at equilibrium; and (c) **technique-wise**, we reformulate the mechanism design problem of identifying the optimal engagement trade-off at the equilibrium into a solvable offline optimization problem, tackled using approximated gradient descent. Our \(C^{4}\) framework and its derived solution serve as a pre-deployment audit tool for platforms, assessing the effects of algorithmic choices on creator and user engagement.

## 2 Related Work

The study of online content creation economy has captured the attention of machine learning community recently, leading to a diverse collection of models addressing the dynamics of content creator competition [25; 24; 3; 54; 52; 57; 32; 34; 30; 16]. In these models, creators strategically select the type [49], topic [30; 34; 52], or quality [25; 32] of their content, competing for resources such as traffic [30; 2; 24], user engagement [52], or platform-provided incentives [57; 54]. Some models aim to explore the properties of creator-side equilibrium, investigating how creators specialize at equilibrium [34], the impact of creators' strategic behaviors on social welfare [52], and the design of optimization methods for long-term welfare considering these behaviors [2; 3; 54; 57; 32; 33; 39]. Unlike these works, which generally assume equally paced creation frequency among creators, our proposed \(C^{4}\) games consider scenarios where creators strategically control their creation quantities, allowing us to analyze how recommendation algorithms influence overall content creation volume at the equilibrium.

Our model of the platform's recommendation algorithm draws inspiration from the proportional allocation concept in game theory, applicable to resource distribution [9; 41] and contest design [48]. We assume that each user contributes a unit of traffic, which is allocated to creators based on both of their merit and effort (content creation frequency). This modeling is closely related to the Tullock contest [48], also known as the lottery contest, where the probability of winning a fixed prize is proportionate to the effort expended relative to the total effort by all contestants. While the Nash equilibrium of the one-dimensional Tullock contest with homogeneous costs is well-understood [20; 21], our work extends this framework to include heterogeneous convex costs. A recent study [53] also explored competition between human and Generative AI creators within a similar setup, examining its impact on total content creation volume. However, they did not address the influence of different recommendation algorithms, which we investigate in our work.

In a broader sense, our work contributes to a line of research evaluating the impact of recommender systems on individuals, specifically exploring how deployed algorithms shape user and content creator behavior [16; 12; 11; 38; 17; 35; 19] and how we can design new algorithms to address these effects [10; 50; 6; 51; 4; 43; 1]. Our study introduces a key insight: recommender algorithms optimized solely for user satisfaction can unintentionally reduce content creators' willingness to engage, thereby impacting long-term user engagement. We address this challenge by proposing a solution that balances creator engagement and user satisfaction through imposing exploration strengths tailored to individual users.

## 3 The Cournot Content Creation Competition

In this section, we introduce the formulation of Cournot Content Creation Competition (\(C^{4}\)), which models the competition among creators for traffic on UGC platforms. This model considers the potential impact of the platform's traffic reallocation mechanisms, such as their deployed recommendation algorithms, where creators strategically choose their production frequencies to optimize their allocated traffic. Each \(C^{4}\) game instance \(\mathcal{G}\) is characterized by a tuple \((n,m,M,\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\{\beta_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m})\). We detail each component of this tuple as follows:

1. **Basic setups.** There is a set of content creators denoted by \([n]=\{1,\cdots,n\}\), and a set of users denoted by \(\{u_{j}\}_{j=1}^{m}\). We assume each user \(j\) has a stable preference over creators and such relationship is captured by an \(n\)-by-\(m\) matrix \(M\) with its \((i,j)\)-th entry \(w_{ij}\in[0,1]\) denoting the strength of user \(j\)'s preference over creator \(i\)'s content. Each creator determines a production frequency \(x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}\) in a unit amount of time (e.g., one week/one month). For the purpose of our analysis, \(x_{i}\) can be interpreted interchangeably as either the production frequency or volume, provided there is no ambiguity3. Follow the terminology of game theory literature, \(x_{i}\) is referred to as the action or pure strategy of creator \(i\). Each creator \(i\) is associated with a cost function \(c_{i}\), which characterizes the cost for creating content at frequency \(x_{i}\). We have two assumptions about \(c_{i}\): 1. \(c_{i}\) is increasing in \(x_{i}\) and \(c_{i}(x_{i})\rightarrow+\infty\) as \(x_{i}\rightarrow+\infty\), which reflects that content creation is always not free. 2. \(c_{i}\) is convex in \(x_{i}\), indicating a non-decreasing marginal cost of improving production frequency. Footnote 3: For the elegance of our theoretical analysis, we treat \(x_{i}\) as a continuous variable, although the key messages and insights of this paper are preserved if \(x_{i}\) is discrete.
2. **Platform intervention.** We assume that each user \(u_{j}\) contributes a unit amount of traffic, and the platform redistributes the total user traffic based on a relevance-based recommendation algorithm that adheres to certain probabilistic principle. Specifically, the recommendation algorithm matches \(u_{j}\) to each piece of content produced by creator \(i\) with a probability proportional to \(\exp(\beta_{j}\sigma_{ij})\), where \(\sigma_{ij}=w_{ij}+\epsilon_{ij}\) represents the algorithm's estimated relevance score. This score combines the true preference score \(w_{ij}\) with independent Gaussian noise \(\epsilon_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})\). The parameter \(\beta_{j}\geq 0\) governs the exploration of the matching for user \(u_{j}\): a higher \(\beta_{j}\) results in a more precise matching, while a lower \(\beta_{j}\) introduces more exploration into the matching results 4. In this work, we analyze intervention mechanisms that operate under this Personalized Probabilistic Matching (PPM) principle, parameterized by \(\bm{\beta}=\{\beta_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\), and refer to it as PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)) for ease of notations. Footnote 4: The randomness in matching results may stem from either the imperfect estimation of the preference score \(w_{ij}\) or intentionally injected exploration strength based on the intervention mechanism. In this paper, we focus on the latter source of randomness and analyze how such exploration strength might affect the outcomes.
3. **Creator utility.** Creators are reward-seeking individuals who try to maximize the expected traffic for their created content while carefully balancing the costs. Under PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)) and when each creator \(i\) produces \(x_{i}\) copies of content, the platform will allocate to \(i\) the amount of traffic from \(u_{j}\) proportional to \(\mathbb{E}_{e_{ij}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma^{2})}\left[x_{i}e^{\beta_{j}(w_{ij} +\epsilon_{ij})}\right]=x_{i}e^{\beta_{j}w_{ij}}\cdot e^{\frac{\sigma^{2}\beta_ {j}^{2}}{2}}\). Here we should note that \(x_{i}\) does not suggest the creator would create \(x_{i}\) pieces of identical content, but amount of content following his/her expertise. Therefore, we formulate creator \(i\)'s utility function as the following: \[u_{i}(x_{i},\bm{x}_{-i};\bm{\beta}) =\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left(\frac{\mathbb{E}[x_{i}e^{\beta_{j}\sigma_{ij }}]}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}[x_{k}e^{\beta_{j}\sigma_{kj}}]}\right)-c_{i}(x _{i})\] \[=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left(\frac{x_{i}e^{\beta_{j}w_{ij}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{ n}x_{k}e^{\beta_{j}w_{kj}}}\right)-c_{i}(x_{i}),\] (1) where \(\bm{x}_{-i}\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n-1}\) denotes the strategy profile of all creators except \(i\).

The \(C^{4}\) game models the scenario where creators are aware of their expertise (i.e., what topic to create), and compete purely on _creation quantity_. This concept is akin to the extensively studied Cournot competition [14] model in economics, where firms independently determine the output of homogeneous products at different costs. However, our model diverges from the classic Cournot competition in several key aspects. First of all, they have different revenue functions: in Cournot competition, the revenue for each firm is calculated as the product of price and production quantity, and the price only depends on all firms' joint strategy. In contrast, in the \(C^{4}\) game, the gain of a creator not only relies on other creators' decision but also hinges on the platform's traffic allocation algorithm. In addition, while Cournot competition typically incorporates only linear cost functions, the \(C^{4}\) game accommodates general convex cost functions, offering a more nuanced reflection of the real cost faced by creators. These distinctions highlight the unique aspects of our model, while maintaining a conceptual link to traditional economic theories of competition.

Research questions:Under the \(C^{4}\) framework, an important and natural research question is how we can predict creators' strategic choices in the competition. This is a fundamental question in game theory and we employ the concept of Pure Nash Equilibrium (PNE) [40] to characterize the outcome of \(C^{4}\) games. The definition of PNE is given by the following:

**Definition 1**.: _A joint strategy profile of all creators \(\bm{x}^{*}=(x_{1}^{*},\cdots,x_{n}^{*})\) forms a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE), if for every creator \(i\), \(x_{i}^{*}\) is a best response strategy that maximizes \(u_{i}\) given other creators' strategy \(\bm{x}_{-i}\); formally,_

\[u_{i}(x_{i}^{*},\bm{x}_{-i}^{*})\geq u_{i}(x_{i},\bm{x}_{-i}^{*})\ \ \text{for every}\ x_{i}\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0},\forall i\in[n].\] (2)

In other word, a PNE represents a stable state when everyone is satisfied with their strategies and does not want to deviate. As we will demonstrate in the subsequent section, a PNE always exists in \(C^{4}\) under any PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)) and can be computed efficiently. This finding forms the basis for our further theoretical analysis and empirical simulations.

In addition to the predictability and stability of creators' production strategies, it is equally crucial for platform designers to develop metrics that encourage the prosperity of the content ecosystem. They must also devise algorithmic solutions to optimize these metrics, balancing the trade-off between engagement of users and creators, using the available "knob" PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)). We will explore these issues in the upcoming technical discussions.

## 4 The PNEs of \(C^{4}\) Games and Their Properties

As widely known, the PNE does not always exist [18; 23; 26]. However, our first main result establishes that, under mild assumptions, \(C^{4}\) always admits a unique PNE.

**Theorem 1**.: _For any \(C^{4}\) instance \(\mathcal{G}(n,m,M,\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\bm{\beta})\). If each \(c_{i}\) is convex in \(x_{i}\), \(\mathcal{G}\) admits a unique PNE._

Note that the primary challenge in proving Theorem 1 is to show \(\mathcal{G}\) is a strictly monotone game, whereas the existence and uniqueness of PNE in such games is a classic result from [44]. Theorem 1 is interesting from multiple perspectives. First, it strictly generalizes previous equilibrium existence results in classic Tullock contest [42; 13], which corresponds to the special case when \(m=1\) and \(w_{11}=\cdots=w_{n1}\). Second, the fact that \(C^{4}\) games are monotone is significant because it is well-known that the PNE of strictly monotone games can be found efficiently. For example, many natural multi-agent online learning dynamics such as mirror descent [7], accelerated optimistic gradient [8], and payoff-based learning [47] guarantee the last-iterate convergence to the unique PNE in strictly monotone games, even when players have mere zeroth order feedback about their utility functions. These results suggest that the PNE of \(\mathcal{G}\) is achievable if all creators use a reasonable update rule in their strategies. This observation not only makes this equilibrium a plausible prediction of real-world competition but also paves the way to our simulation-based studies in our experiments, where we use multi-agent mirror descent with perfect gradient to numerically solve the PNE of \(C^{4}\).

In addition to the existence and uniqueness properties, the following corollary characterizes the first-order characterization of \(\mathcal{G}\)'s PNE.

**Corollary 1**.: _The unique PNE \(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta})\) of any \(\mathcal{G}(n,m,M,\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\bm{\beta})\) satisfies the following first-order condition:_

\[\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}\bigg{|}_{\bm{x}=\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta})} =0,\quad 1\leq i\leq n.\] (3)

Since we have already shown the existence and uniqueness of \(\mathcal{G}\)'s PNE, Corollary 1 follows immediately according to Definition 1. Corollary 1 is useful for establishing further properties of \(C^{4}\) games in Section 5.

## 5 The Trade-Off Between User and Creator Engagement

We have established that a unique PNE exists in any \(C^{4}\) game under any PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)) and can be naturally achieved by competing content creators. This raises a crucial question for platform designers: how should the quality of the PNE be evaluated? For any mature UGC platform, it is essential to balance user satisfaction, which is key to short-term prosperity, with creator engagement, which is crucial for long-term sustainability. Within our \(C^{4}\) framework, this requires the platform designer to generate matching results that not only guarantee high user satisfaction (by improving the average matching quality at PNE) but also stimulate substantial content creation volume (by encouraging creators to increase their production frequency \(x^{*}\) at PNE). We define these two objectives as follows:

**Definition 2**.: _For any \(C^{4}\) instance \(\mathcal{G}(n,m,M,\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\bm{\beta})\), let \(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta})=(x_{1}^{*},\cdots,x_{n}^{*})\) be the unique PNE under PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)). Then the (short-term) total user satisfaction is defined as_

\[U(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta});\bm{\beta})=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{ w_{ij}x_{i}^{*}e^{\beta_{j}w_{ij}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{*}e^{\beta_{j}w_{kj}}} \right),\] (4)

_and the (long-term) total content creation volume is defined as_

\[V(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta}))=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{*}.\] (5)

_The social welfare of the whole system is measured by a linear combination of \(U\) and \(V\), defined as_

\[W_{\lambda}(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta});\bm{\beta})=U(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta});\bm{ \beta})+\lambda V(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta});\bm{\beta}).\] (6)

If we denote \(\pi_{j}^{*}(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta}),\bm{\beta})=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{w_{ ij}x_{i}^{*}e^{\beta_{j}w_{ij}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{*}e^{\beta_{j}w_{kj}}}\right)\) as the indicator of an individual user's satisfaction or utility, which is the expected matching scores of user \(j\) at the PNE under PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)). And the total user satisfaction measure \(U=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\pi_{j}^{*}\) is the accumulated user utility. We argue that \(U\) primarily serves as a metric for short-term welfare evaluation, since it focuses solely on user satisfaction at a specific instance of matching outcomes but does not capture the dynamics of userengagement over time. This overlooks the crucial fact that sustained user engagement on a platform requires a continuous supply of relevant content, as users can hardly be satisfied by their previously consumed material. This limitation is also evident in \(U\)'s mathematical formulation: its value remains unchanged with a rescaling of \(\{x_{i}^{*}\}\), indicating that it fails to reflect changes in content volume or frequency that might affect long-term user engagement. On the other hand, the long-term prosperity of a UGC platform is fundamentally linked to the engagement of content creators. Therefore, we introduce the total content creation volume \(V\) as an indicator of the long-term welfare of the platform.

For the platform designers, it is essential to develop metrics that balance both short-term and long-term considerations. Thus, we propose a hybrid social welfare metric, \(W\), which combines \(U\) and \(V\) to reflect both user satisfaction and content supply sustainability. However, understanding the mechanisms to optimize \(U\) and \(V\) independently is critical. In the following sections, we will explore the optimal matching mechanisms tailored to the exclusive objectives of \(U\) (short-term) and \(V\) (long-term), and then present an efficient algorithm designed to optimize \(W\).

Interestingly, our findings suggest that both \(U\) and \(V\) exhibit monotonicity with respect to the parameter \(\bm{\beta}\), even in scenarios involving a homogeneous user population. This uniform behavior of \(U\) and \(V\) offers valuable insights into how the adjustment of exploration strength could potentially impact platform performance. Our forthcoming theorem formally characterizes these observations.

**Theorem 2**.: _Consider any \(C^{4}\) game with \(m=1\). If the elements of \(M=[w_{1},\cdots,w_{n}]^{\top}\) are not identical, it holds that:_

1. \(U(\beta)\) _defined in Eq. (_4_) is strictly increasing in_ \(\beta\)_._
2. \(V(\beta)\) _defined in Eq. (_5_) is strictly decreasing in_ \(\beta\in[\beta_{0},+\infty)\) _for some_ \(\beta_{0}>0\)_._

Theorem 2 conveys two significant insights. The first one, though perhaps unsurprising, reveals that improving matching accuracy corresponds to an increase in expected user satisfaction. Despite its intuitiveness, this is a strong observation because it holds without relying on any specific structural assumptions about creator cost functions. This means that regardless of the potential complexity in equilibrium structures due to creator costs, and even when the order of \(x_{i}^{*}\) does not align with a creator's capability \(w_{i}\), the metric \(U\) is still monotonically increasing with respect to \(\beta\). The second insight may surprise some readers: it suggests that while keep increasing the matching accuracy motivates some creators to produce more content, it demotivates others, resulting in a net decrease in the overall volume of content creation. This finding illustrates an intrinsic trade-off between short-term matching accuracy and long-term content supply: strategies that enhance short-term user satisfaction can inadvertently reduce content creation frequency across creators. To the best of our knowledge, this result is novel and has not been discussed in similar studies.

Here is an intuitive explanation for why a large \(\beta\) diminishes creators' willingness to produce content. As the traffic allocation becomes more deterministic, the marginal gain from increasing production frequency diminishes because the amount of traffic accrued is largely determined by the relevance score, rather than volume. In the extreme case where \(\beta\to+\infty\), only the most relevant creator captures all the user traffic, regardless of her production volume. Consequently, due to the presence of production costs, this creator, and others, will only sustain the minimum viable productivity. Conversely, in the other extreme scenario where \(\beta=0\), i.e., user traffic is distributed uniformly among creators irrespective of relevance, the gain for each creator depends solely on their production frequency, prompting a productivity arms race. Clearly, both extremes are suboptimal, but they effectively illustrate the rationale behind our theoretical findings.

Although in Theorem 2 we consider the game instance \(\mathcal{G}\) with \(m=1\) as a representative snapshot of how creators compete for a single unit of user traffic (i.e., homogeneous user population), extending the time frame to encompass a sequence of heterogeneous users suggests that the observed trade-off between \(U\) and \(V\) remains consistent. In our experiments, we will demonstrate this trade-off in broader settings through simulations, e.g. when \(m>1\) and with various complex user distributions.

The proof of Theorem 2, while delivering a clear message, is far from trivial. Since the dependencies of \(U\) and \(V\) on \(\beta\) are indirectly linked through \(x^{*}\), which lacks a closed form, the derivation of their derivatives with respect to \(\beta\) necessitates the use of the implicit function theorem [37] to articulate the derivative of \(x^{*}\) with respect to \(\beta\). This involves a complex matrix inverse, which we simplify using the Sherman-Morrison formula [46] due to its structure being a diagonal matrix with a rank-one update. This proof technique not only supports our theorem but also inspires a novel first-orderoptimization approach to address the hybrid social welfare optimization discussed in Section 7. Detailed proofs are provided in Appendix A.2.

## 6 Finding the Optimal Trade-off through Optimization

Our theory thus far indicates that optimizing both user satisfaction \(U\) and creator engagement \(V\) is non-trivial, even when the user population is homogeneous, as achieving the optimal of \(U\) and \(V\) simultaneously is impossible. Consequently, an essential and intriguing question arises within any specific competitive environment \(C^{4}\): how can we identify the optimal trade-off between these two factors by optimizing any given welfare metric \(W_{\lambda}\)?

Generally, the welfare metric \(W\) is influenced by three factors: the platform's algorithmic recommendation policy PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)), the resulting content creation profile \(\bm{x}^{*}\) at the PNE induced by \(\bm{\beta}\), and the relevance matrix \(M\). Thus, we can formulate the resulting optimization problem (OP) as follows:

Find \[\arg\max_{\bm{\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{m}_{\geq 0}}W_{\lambda}(\bm{x}^{*} (\bm{\beta}),\bm{\beta})\] (7) \[s.t. \bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta})\text{ is the PNE of }\mathcal{G}.\]

In general, OP (7) presents a formidable challenge, as solving for a PNE of a game is known to be difficult [15]. Fortunately, the nice structure of \(C^{4}\) allows us to utilize the implicit characterization of the PNE detailed in Corollary 1 to tackle OP (7) effectively. In the subsequent section, we demonstrate that the gradient of \(W_{\lambda}\) w.r.t. \(\bm{\beta}\) can be explicitly computed.

### The Derivation of Exact Gradient

According to the chain rule, the first-order gradient of \(W_{\lambda}\) w.r.t. \(\bm{\beta}\) can be expressed as

\[\frac{dW_{\lambda}}{d\bm{\beta}}=\frac{dU(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta}),\bm{\beta}) }{d\bm{\beta}}+\lambda\frac{dV(\bm{x}^{*}(\bm{\beta}))}{d\bm{\beta}}=\left( \frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}}+\lambda\frac{\partial V}{\partial\bm{x} ^{*}}\right)\cdot\frac{d\bm{x}^{*}}{d\bm{\beta}}+\frac{\partial U}{\partial \bm{\beta}}.\] (8)

The evaluation of the gradient of \(W_{\lambda}\) relies on the calculation of three vectors, \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}},\frac{\partial V}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}} \in\mathbb{R}^{1\times n}\), and \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{\beta}}\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times m}\), as well as a Jacobian matrix \(\frac{d\bm{x}^{*}}{d\bm{\beta}}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\). The computations of \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}},\frac{\partial V}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}}\) and \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{\beta}}\) are straightforward and computationally light, which position the main challenge as the computation of \(\frac{d\bm{x}^{*}}{d\bm{\beta}}\). Fortunately, the first-order characterization of \(\bm{x}^{*}\) by Corollary 1 enables us to express the gradient of \(\bm{x}^{*}\) w.r.t. \(\bm{\beta}\) using implicit function derivation [37] as \(\frac{d\bm{x}^{*}}{d\bm{\beta}}=-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}} \right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{\beta}}\), where \(F(\bm{x},\bm{\beta})=\left(\frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_{i}}\right)_{i=1}^ {n}\) is an \(n\)-valued function, and both \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}^{*}}\) and \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{\beta}}\) are matrices of dimensions \(n\times n\) and \(n\times m\), respectively. The following proposition provides the exact formula for the gradient. The calculation is straightforward and we omit the detailed derivation.

**Proposition 1**.: _Let \(\bm{x}^{*}=(x_{1}^{*},\cdots,x_{n}^{*})\) be the PNE of \(\mathcal{G}(n,m,M,\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n},\bm{\beta})\). Then, the Jacobian matrix of \(\bm{x}^{*}\) as a function of \(\bm{\beta}\) is_

\[\frac{d\bm{x}^{*}}{d\bm{\beta}}=\left(D+YZ^{\top}\right)^{-1}B\in\mathbb{R}^{ n\times m},\] (9)

_where \(D\) is an \(n\times n\) diagonal matrix given by_

\[D=\text{diag}\left(c_{1}^{\prime\prime}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{P_{1j}^{2}}{x_{1} ^{*2}},\cdots,c_{n}^{\prime\prime}+\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{P_{nj}^{2}}{x_{n}^{* 2}}\right),\] (10)

_and \(B,Y,Z\) are \(\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) matrices calculated as follows (\(1\leq i\leq n,1\leq j\leq m\)):_

\[Y=\left[\frac{P_{ij}(1-2P_{ij})}{x_{i}^{*}}\right]_{ij},\quad Z=\left[\frac{P _{ij}}{x_{i}^{*}}\right]_{ij},\quad B=\left[\frac{P_{ij}(1-2P_{ij})}{x_{i}^{* }}\cdot\left(w_{ij}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{kj}P_{kj}\right)\right]_{ij},\] (11)

_where \(c_{i}^{\prime\prime}\) is the second-order derivative of creator \(i\)'s cost function, and \(P_{ij}=\frac{x_{i}^{*}\exp(\beta_{i}w_{ij})}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}^{*}\exp(\beta_ {j}w_{kj})}\) is the probability that creator \(i\) is matched with user \(j\) at the PNE under PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\))._

### Optimization with Approximated Gradients

Proposition 1 together with Eq. (8) offers us a possibility to directly apply gradient-based approaches for solving OP (7). However, the gradient computation requires the inversion of an \(n\times n\) matrix, whose time complexity is \(O(n^{3})\) and thus too cumbersome. To reduce the computational burden, we propose to approximately compute the gradient using the Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula [46] to approximate the matrix inverse, inspired by the specific structure of the RHS of Eq. (9). According to Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury formula, it holds that

\[(D+YZ^{\top})^{-1}=D^{-1}-D^{-1}Y\left(I+Z^{\top}D^{-1}Y\right)^{-1}Z^{\top}D^{ -1},\] (12)

and the computation of the RHS of Eq. (12) now requires a time complexity of \(O(n^{2}m+nm^{2}+m^{3})\). However, the size of the user population \(m\) in practical scenarios is often even larger than \(n\). To efficiently compute the RHS of Eq. (12), we propose a method to "sketch" the matrices \(Y\) and \(Z\) by sampling a subset of users. Initially, each column of \(Y\) and \(Z\) corresponds to a user index \(j\). We begin by sampling a sub-population of \(\mathcal{X}\), indexed by \(\mathcal{I}\), with \(|\mathcal{I}|=\tilde{m}=[\delta m]\), where \(\delta\in(0,1]\) denotes the sampling rate. With this sampled index set \(\mathcal{I}\), we construct matrices \(\tilde{Y},\tilde{Z}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\), where the \((i,j)\)-th entries are defined as follows:

\[\tilde{Y}_{ij}=\frac{P_{iji^{\prime}}(1-2P_{iji^{\prime}})}{x_{i}^{*}},\quad \tilde{Z}_{ij}=\frac{P_{iji^{\prime}}}{x_{i}^{*}},\] (13)

with \(j^{\prime}\) being uniformly sampled from \(\mathcal{I}\). Given that \(\tilde{Y},\tilde{Z}\) now possess reduced ranks of \([\delta m]\), the computational complexity of evaluating \((D+\tilde{Y}\tilde{Z}^{\top})^{-1}\) is significantly lowered to \(O(n^{2}\tilde{m}+n\tilde{m}^{2}+\tilde{m}^{3})\). Algorithm 1 describes the steps for addressing OP (7).

4 Compute the approximated gradient \(\frac{dW_{\lambda}}{d\bm{\beta}}\) using (8),(9),(12) with sketched matrices \(\tilde{Y},\tilde{Z}\),
5 Update \(\bm{\beta}=\bm{\beta}+\eta\frac{dW_{\lambda}}{d\bm{\beta}}\). ```

**Algorithm 1**Approximated Gradient Descent for Solving OP (7).

Algorithm 1 requires solving for the PNE of \(\mathcal{G}\) each time when \(\bm{\beta}\) is updated. To accomplish this, we employ the multi-agent mirror descent method, as proposed in [7] and detailed in Algorithm 2 in Appendix, to serve as a subroutine5. To accelerate the convergence of Algorithm 1, the PNE strategy \(\bm{x}^{*}\) obtained under the previous \(\bm{\beta}\) is used as the initial strategy for computing the new PNE after updating \(\bm{\beta}\). Further implementation details are provided in the experiment section.

Footnote 5: In [7], the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to PNE under zeroth order feedback. Here we use the perfect gradient as input and thus the convergence is also guaranteed.

## 7 Experiments

To validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate the performance of Algorithm 1, we conduct simulations on instances of \(\mathcal{G}\) constructed from both synthetic data and the MovieLens-1m dataset [28]. In our experiments, Algorithm 2 is employed to solve the PNE for each instance of \(\mathcal{G}\). Below, we first outline the specifications of these two simulation environments and then present our results.

**Synthetic environment** For the synthetic environment, we construct the user population \(\mathcal{X}\) by setting an embedding dimension \(d=32\) and independently sampling \(50\) cluster centers, denoted as \(\{\mathbf{c}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{c}_{50}\}\), from the unit sphere \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}\). For each center \(\mathbf{c}_{i}\), users belonging to cluster-\(i\) are generated by sampling independently from a Gaussian distribution \(\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{c}_{i},0.5^{2}\mathbf{I}_{d})\). The sizes of the \(50\) user clusters are determined uniformly at random, ensuring the total size of \(\mathcal{X}\) is \(m=1000\). Similarly, \(n=200\) creators are generated, and the relevance matrix \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) is defined by the dot product between each user-creator pair, which are then normalized to the range \([0,1]\). This syntheticdataset encapsulates a class of clustered user and creator preference distributions. On the creators' side, their cost functions are set to \(c_{i}(x)=c_{i}x^{\rho}\), with the default \(\rho=1.5\). The marginal costs \(\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) are randomly sampled from a uniform distribution \(\mathcal{U}[0.1,0.5]\).

**Environment constructed from MovieLens-1m dataset** We use deep matrix factorization [22] to train user and movie embeddings (with dimension set to \(32\)) by fitting the observed ratings in the range of 1 to 5. To ensure the quality of the trained embeddings, we performed a 5-fold cross-validation and obtained an averaged RMSE\(=\)0.739 on the test sets. With the same hyper-parameter, we train the user/item embeddings with the complete dataset. We randomly select \(m=1000\) user embeddings to construct the population \(\mathcal{X}\) and \(n=200\) movie embeddings as the creator profiles. Similarly, The relevance matrix \(M\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times m}\) is given by the dot product between each user-creator pair normalized to \([0,1]\) and creators' cost functions are the same as we specified in the synthetic environment.

### The Empirical Trade-Offs Between \(U\) and \(V\)

Figure 1 illustrates the content creation frequency \(x_{i}^{*}\), user utility \(\pi_{j}^{*}\), and their corresponding aggregated values \(U=\sum_{j}\pi_{j}^{*}\), \(V=\sum_{i}x_{i}^{*}\) under the PNE induced by different homogeneous \(\beta\) (i.e., all users share the same \(\beta\)). The result in the right panel shows that a larger \(\beta\) enhances overall user satisfaction \(U\) but undermines total content creation \(V\). As \(\beta\) increases, the drop in \(V\) becomes more significant. This empirical finding supports Theorem 2 and suggests it holds under broader settings without the assumptions on creator cost function and user population structure. The left and middle plots illustrate each creator \(i\)'s creation frequency \(x_{i}^{*}\) and each user \(j\)'s utility \(\pi_{j}^{*}\) at the PNE, such that both \(x_{i}^{*}\) and \(\pi_{j}^{*}\) are rearranged in descending order. They show that when \(\beta\) is shared across all users, its change affects \(x_{i}^{*}\) and \(\pi_{j}^{*}\) in the same direction.

### The Optimal PPM\((\beta)\) Found by Algorithm 1

Next, we use Algorithm 1 to find the optimal PPM\((\beta)\) and investigate the properties of the optimal \(\beta\). We set \(\lambda=0.5\) and aim to maximize the objective \(W_{\lambda}=U+0.5V\), more results under different choices of \(\lambda\) can be found in Appendix B. The initial \(\beta\) is set to \((100,\cdots,100)\), representing a nearly deterministic matching for every user. Algorithm 1 is then run to update \(\beta\). The sample rate and learning rate are set to \(\delta=0.1,\eta=200\). In addition to searching for personalized \(\beta_{j}\) for each user \(j\), we also attempt to find a homogeneous \(\beta\) (i.e., a fixed \(\beta_{j}\) for each \(j\)) using Algorithm 16.

Footnote 6: The gradient of \(W_{\lambda}\) with respect to a homogeneous \(\beta\) can be readily obtained by summing all the partial derivatives of \(W_{\lambda}\) with respect to \(\beta_{j}\).

The first and third panels in Figure 2 show the evolution of \(W_{\lambda}\) during the optimization process in both synthetic and MovieLens environments. As illustrated, Algorithm 1 successfully finds a better PPM\((\beta)\) compared to the baseline of exact matching for all users, with a significant gain of over 20% in the welfare metric. Furthermore, in both environments, personalized \(\beta\) leads to a slightly better outcome compared to homogeneous \(\beta\).

The second and fourth panels depict the optimal \(\beta_{j}\) for each user \(j\), arranged in descending order. These panels provide insights into how such a mechanism achieves better trade-offs. For each user

Figure 1: The left and the middle panel: the empirical distributions of content creation frequency \(x_{i}^{*}\) and each user’s individual utility \(\pi_{j}^{*}\). Different colors represent results for PNEs induced by different \(\beta\). Right: the total content creation \(V\) and total user satisfaction \(U\) obtained under different \(\beta\). Error bars obtained from 10 independently generated environments.

index \(j\) on the \(x\)-axis, we also plot the average and the standard deviation of the relevance scores \(\{w_{ij}\}_{i=1}^{n}\) associated with each user \(j\) over all creators, shown as orange and green lines. Based on the definition, users with smaller average scores and higher standard deviations are considered more "picky" or selective, indicating high relevance scores with a small group of creators and low scores with many others. Conversely, users with higher average scores and smaller standard deviations are less selective and more open to exploration. The results show that the optimal \(\bm{\beta}\) tends to increase the exploration strengths (by deploying smaller \(\beta_{j}\)) for less selective users. This approach is intuitive, as it safely increases exploration while minimizing losses in user engagement.

## 8 Conclusion

In this work, we introduced a new game-theoretical model \(C^{4}\) (Cournot Content Creation Competition) to explore how creators strategically determine their creation frequency under a UGC platform's recommendation algorithm. Our investigations reveal a critical balance between user satisfaction and creator engagement, mediated by the exploration strength of the recommendation. The existence and uniqueness of the PNE of \(C^{4}\) games provide a predictive framework for assessing the effects of algorithmic choices on content diversity and volume. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical simulations, we demonstrated how varying the exploration strength can either enhance user engagement at the cost of reduced content diversity or encourage richer content creation at the expense of immediate user satisfaction. These findings disclose the delicate trade-offs platform designers face and highlight the utility of our model as a pre-deployment audit tool for optimizing recommendation algorithms to balance platforms' long-term and short-term objectives.

While our \(C^{4}\) model offers insights into strategic differentiation among creators regarding production quantity, it relies on a simplified assumption that creators maintain a fixed niche, consistently producing content on the same topic with similar quality. This assumption, though useful for modeling purposes, may be restrictive in real-world scenarios where creators dynamically adjust topics, vary content quality, and scale production quantity. Exploring the dynamics where creators compete across heterogeneous dimensions--such as topic variety, content quality, and production quantity--would be a valuable direction for future research. We leave this intriguing problem for future work.

Appendix to _Unveiling User Satisfaction and Creator Productivity Trade-Offs in Recommendation Platforms_

### Omitted Proofs

#### Proof of Theorem 1

Proof.: First of all, we argue that given any \(\mathcal{G}(n,m,M,\{c_{i}\},\boldsymbol{\beta})\), for any creator \(i\), there exists an \(\delta_{i}>0\) such that any \(x_{i}\in[0,\delta_{i}]\) cannot be an equilibrium strategy. This is because given any \(\boldsymbol{x}_{-i}\in\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n-1}\), \(u_{i}\) as a function of \(x_{i}\) has a continuous and strictly positive gradient at \(x_{i}=0\), meaning that there exists a \(\delta_{i}>0\) such that \(\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}\bigg{|}_{x_{i}=t}>0,\forall t\in[0, \delta_{i}]\) regardless of what other creators' strategies are. In other word, for any \(x_{i}\leq\delta_{i}\), creator \(i\) can always increase her strategy to strictly improve her utility. As a result, any potential PNE \(\boldsymbol{x}^{*}\) must satisfy that \(x_{i}^{*}\geq\delta_{i}\).

On the other hand, since \(c_{i}(x_{i})\to+\infty\) when \(x_{i}\to+\infty\) but the traffic gain for each creator is at most \(m\), we have \(u_{i}(x_{i},\boldsymbol{x}_{-i})\to-\infty,\forall\boldsymbol{x}_{-i}\in \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}^{n-1}\) when \(x_{i}\to+\infty\). As a result, any equilibrium strategy must also be upper bounded by a uniform constant \(\Delta>0\).

To argue the existence and uniqueness of PNE of \(\mathcal{G}\), in the following we may with out loss of generality restrict each creator \(i\)'s strategy set to a convex set \([\delta_{i},\Delta]\).

For any fixed \(\boldsymbol{\beta}=(\beta_{1},\cdots,\beta_{m})\), let \(a_{ij}=\exp(\beta_{j}w_{j})\) and Eq. (1) can be simplified to

\[u_{i}(x_{i},\boldsymbol{x}_{-i};\boldsymbol{\beta})=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\left( \frac{x_{i}a_{ij}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{kj}}\right)-c_{i}(x_{i}),\] (14)

For simplicity we denote \(g_{j}(\boldsymbol{x})=\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{kj}\) and \(u_{i}\) can be expressed as \(u_{i}(x_{i},\boldsymbol{x}_{-i})=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\frac{x_{i}a_{ij}}{g_{j}( \boldsymbol{x})}-c_{i}(x_{i})\). Our proof starts from a sufficient condition from [44] for a game to be monotone. A game is said to satisfy the _diagonal strict concavity_ (DSC) condition if (1) each player has a concave utility function in his own strategy in a convex strategy space; and (2) there exists _some_ non-zero parameter \(\lambda=(\lambda_{1},\cdots,\lambda_{n})\) such that the Hessian matrix given by

\[H_{kl}(\boldsymbol{x};\lambda)\triangleq\frac{\lambda_{k}}{2}\frac{\partial^ {2}u_{k}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{k}\partial x_{l}}+\frac{\lambda_{l}}{2} \frac{\partial^{2}u_{l}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{l}\partial x_{k}}\] (15)

is _strictly_ negative-definite. In [44], it is shown that any game satisfying \(\lambda\)-DSC condition has a unique pure Nash equilibrium (PNE); such a game is often referred to as monotone games.

First of all, we already argued that each creator \(i\)'s strategy set is \([\delta_{i},\Delta]\), which is a convex set. Core to our proof is to show that game \(\mathcal{G}\) is 1-DSC under the theorem conditions. Direct calculation shows that for any \(1\leq k\leq l\leq n\),

\[\frac{\partial^{2}u_{k}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{k}\partial x _{l}} =\frac{a_{kj}a_{lj}}{g_{j}^{3}}\cdot(-g_{j}+2a_{kj}x_{k}),\] \[\frac{\partial^{2}u_{l}(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{l}\partial x _{k}} =\frac{a_{kj}a_{lj}}{g_{j}^{3}}\cdot(-g_{j}+2a_{lj}x_{l}),\]

and therefore the Hessian matrix of \(\mathcal{G}\) specified by the RHS of Eq. (15) is equal to

\[-[H(\boldsymbol{x})] =\sum_{j=1}^{m}g_{j}^{-3}\begin{bmatrix}a_{1j}\\ a_{2j}\\ \vdots\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}2\sum_{i\neq 1}x_{i}a_{ij}&\sum_{i\notin\{1,2 \}}x_{i}a_{ij}&\ldots\\ \sum_{i\notin\{1,2\}}x_{i}a_{ij}&2\sum_{i\neq 2}x_{i}a_{ij}&\ldots\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots\end{bmatrix}[a_{1j},a_{2j},\ldots]+\begin{bmatrix}\frac{ \partial^{2}c_{1}}{\partial x_{1}^{2}}&0&\ldots\\ 0&\frac{\partial^{2}c_{2}}{\partial x_{2}^{2}}&\ldots\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots\end{bmatrix}\] \[\triangleq\sum_{j=1}^{m}g_{j}^{-3}\boldsymbol{a}_{j}H_{j} \boldsymbol{a}_{j}^{\top}+H_{0},\] (16)where \(g_{j}\) in the above expressions denotes \(g_{j}(\bm{x})\), vector \(\bm{a}_{j}=(a_{1j},\cdots,a_{nj})^{\top}\). We can see that if all the cost functions are strictly convex, the second diagonal matrix \(H_{0}\) in the RHS of Eq. (16) is strictly positive-definite (PD). Therefore, it suffices to show that (1) for all \(j\in[m]\), \(H_{j}\) is PD. To see this, let \(z_{i}=x_{i}a_{ij}\) and we show that for any \(\bm{y}=(y_{1},\cdots,y_{n})\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), \(\bm{y}^{\top}H_{j}\bm{y}\geq 0\), and the equality holds if and only if \(\bm{y}=\bm{0}\). In fact, note that

\[\bm{y}^{\top}H_{j}\bm{y} =2\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}z_{j}\right)+2\sum_ {i<j}y_{i}y_{j}\left(\sum_{k\notin\{i,j\}}z_{k}\right)\] \[=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}z_{j}\right)+\left[ \sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}z_{j}\right)+2\sum_{i<j}y_{i}y_{j} \left(\sum_{k\notin\{i,j\}}z_{k}\right)\right]\] \[=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}z_{j}\right)+\sum_{k= 1}^{n}z_{k}\left[\sum_{j\neq k}y_{j}^{2}+2\sum_{i<j,i\neq k,j\neq k}y_{i}y_{j}\right]\] \[=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}^{2}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}z_{j}\right)+\sum_{i= 1}^{n}z_{i}\left(\sum_{j\neq i}y_{j}\right)^{2}\geq 0.\] (17)

Because \(x_{i}\) and \(a_{i}\) are all strictly positive, each \(z_{i}\) must also be strictly positive. Hence, Eq. (17) can take value zero if and only if \(y_{i}=0,\forall i\in[n]\). Therefore, \(H_{j}\) is PD for any \(j\in[m]\), which completes the proof.

### Proof of Theorem 2

First let's recall the definition of \(U,V\) when \(m=1\):

\[U(\bm{x}^{*}(\beta);\beta) =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{w_{i}x_{i}^{*}e^{\beta w_{i}}}{\sum_{k =1}^{n}x_{k}^{*}e^{\beta w_{k}}}\right),\] (18) \[V(\bm{x}^{*}) =\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{*}.\] (19)

In the following, we prove the monotonicity of \(U(\beta)\) and \(V(\beta)\) by showing \(\frac{d\ln U}{d\beta}>0\) and \(\frac{dV}{d\beta}<0\), respectively. Before presenting the detailed proof, we first derive some relevant definitions and their properties that will be used in the proof.

For simplicity we omit the superscript \({}^{*}\) in \(\bm{x}^{*}\) and simply use \(\bm{x}\) to refer to the PNE of \(\mathcal{G}\). When \(m=1\), the creator utility function writes

\[u_{i}(x_{i},x_{-i})=\frac{x_{i}e^{\beta w_{i}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}e^{\beta w _{k}}}-c_{i}(x_{i}),i\in[n].\] (20)

Let \(P_{i}=\frac{x_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}\), where \(a_{i}=e^{\beta w_{i}}\). First of all, we claim that it is without loss of generality to consider the regime where \(P_{i}\leq\frac{1}{3}\). To see this, consider the following two \(C^{4}\) instances:

\[\mathcal{G}_{1}(n,m=1,\bm{w}=(w_{1},\cdots,w_{n}),\mathbf{c}=(c_{ 1},\cdots,c_{n}),\bm{\beta}),\] \[\mathcal{G}_{2}(3n,m=1,[\bm{w},\bm{w},\bm{w}],[\mathbf{c}/3, \mathbf{c}/3,\mathbf{c}/3],[\bm{\beta},\bm{\beta},\bm{\beta}]).\]

Clearly, both games \(\mathcal{G}_{1},\mathcal{G}_{2}\) have unique PNE. Let the PNE of \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) be denoted by \(\bm{x}_{1}^{*}\). In \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\), since its \(3n\) players are divided into three identical groups, its PNE can be represented as \((\bm{x}_{2}^{*},\bm{x}_{2}^{*},\bm{x}_{2}^{*})\), where each group of \(n\) players follow the same strategy. Moreover, for any \(1\leq i\leq n\), it is straightforward to observe that the \(i\)-th player's utility functions in \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) and \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\) differ only by a multiplicative constant of \(3\). Consequently, we have \(\bm{x}_{1}^{*}=\bm{x}_{2}^{*}\). Therefore, for any \(C^{4}\) instance \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) with \(m=1\), we can always construct an equivalent instance \(\mathcal{G}_{2}\) that shares the same PNE structure, while ensuring \(P_{i}\leq\frac{1}{3}\). This justifies the assumptions that, without loss of generality, we can take \(P_{i}\leq\frac{1}{3}\).

Another property we need is that the PNE strategy \(x_{i}\) of any player \(i\) in \(\mathcal{G}_{1}\) is bounded in a compact region \([0,L]\) for some constant \(L\), regardless of the values of \(\bm{\beta}\). To see this, note that \(c_{i}(x_{i})\) is increasing in \(x_{i}\) and goes to infinity as \(x_{i}\to+\infty\) while \(P_{i}\) is upper bounded by \(1\). As a result, for any \(x_{i}\) such that \(u_{i}(x_{i},\bm{x}_{-i})\leq 1-c_{i}(x_{i})<-c_{i}(0)=u_{i}(0,\bm{x}_{-i})\), \(x_{i}\) cannot be a PNE strategy as switching to \(0\) increases player \(i\)'s utility. Therefore, if we take

\[L=\max_{i\in[n]}\{\inf_{x}\{x\geq 0:1-c_{i}(x_{i})<-c_{i}(0)\}\},\]

it holds that \(x_{i}\leq L,\forall i\in[n]\).

Let \(F(x,\beta)=\left(\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}\right)_{i=1}^{n}\) be an \(n\)-value function. From Corollary 1 we know \(\bm{x},\beta\) satisfy \(F(\bm{x},\beta)=0\). And Theorem 1 guarantees that for any \(\beta\geq 0\), the \(\bm{x}\) implicitly determined by \(F(\bm{x},\beta)=0\) exists and is unique. Therefore, by the implicit function theorem [37], the derivative of \(\bm{x}\) w.r.t. \(\beta\) can be written as

\[\frac{d\bm{x}}{d\beta}=-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1} \cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta},\]

where \(\left[\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}\right]_{n\times n}\) is the Jacobian matrix (which is also the Hessian of \(\mathcal{G}\) when \(\lambda=\bm{1}\), see Eq. (15)) and \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times 1}\) is the partial derivative of \(F\) w.r.t. \(\beta\).

The first-order derivative of \(u_{i}\) can be calculated as

\[\frac{\partial u_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}=\frac{e^{\beta w_{i}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_ {k}e^{\beta w_{k}}}-x_{i}\left(\frac{e^{\beta w_{i}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}e^{ \beta w_{k}}}\right)^{2}-c_{i}^{\prime}(x_{i}),\] (21)

and we can use it to further obtain the following explicit expressions in terms of the derivatives of \(F\):

\[\left(\frac{\partial F_{i}}{\partial x_{i}}\right) =-\frac{1}{x_{i}^{2}}P_{i}^{2}\left(1-2P_{i}\right)-\frac{1}{x_{i} ^{2}}P_{i}^{2}-c_{i}^{\prime\prime}(x_{i}),\] \[\left(\frac{\partial F_{i}}{\partial x_{j}}\right) =-\frac{1}{x_{i}x_{j}}P_{i}P_{j}\left(1-2P_{i}\right),j\neq i,\] \[\left(\frac{\partial F_{i}}{\partial\beta}\right) =\frac{P_{i}}{x_{i}}\cdot\left(1-2P_{i}\right)\cdot\left(w_{i}- \sum_{k=1}^{n}P_{k}w_{k}\right).\] (22)

Let's define a positive definite diagonal matrix

\[D=\text{diag}\left(\frac{P_{1}^{2}}{x_{1}^{2}}+c_{1}^{\prime\prime},\cdots, \frac{P_{n}^{2}}{x_{n}^{2}}+c_{n}^{\prime\prime}\right).\]

Since \(c_{i}^{\prime\prime}>0\), we can introduce variables

\[\delta_{i}\in(0,1)\text{ such that }\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{x_{i}^{2}}+c_{i}^{\prime \prime}=\frac{P_{i}^{2}}{\delta_{i}x_{i}^{2}}.\] (23)

In addition, let's also define

\[\bm{y}=\left(\frac{P_{1}(1-2P_{1})}{x_{1}},\cdots,\frac{P_{n}(1-2P_{n})}{x_{n} }\right)^{\top},\bm{z}=\left(\frac{P_{1}}{x_{1}},\cdots,\frac{P_{n}}{x_{n}} \right)^{\top},\] (24)

then we have \(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}=D+\bm{y}\bm{z}^{\top}\) and from Sherman-Morrison formula[46], it holds that

\[-\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1} =(D+\bm{y}\bm{z}^{\top})^{-1}\] \[=D^{-1}-\frac{D^{-1}\bm{y}\bm{z}^{\top}D^{-1}}{1+\bm{z}^{\top}D^{- 1}\bm{y}},\] (25)where

\[D^{-1}=\text{diag}\left(\frac{\delta_{1}x_{1}^{2}}{P_{1}^{2}},\cdots, \frac{\delta_{n}x_{n}^{2}}{P_{n}^{2}}\right),\] \[D^{-1}\bm{y}=\left(\frac{\delta_{1}x_{1}(1-2P_{1})}{P_{1}},\cdots, \frac{\delta_{n}x_{n}(1-2P_{n})}{P_{n}}\right)^{\top},\] \[\bm{z}^{\top}D^{-1}=\left(\frac{\delta_{1}x_{1}}{P_{1}},\cdots, \frac{\delta_{n}x_{n}}{P_{n}}\right).\]

Since \(P_{i}\leq\frac{1}{3}\), we have \(1-2P_{i}\geq\frac{1}{3}>0\). With all the notations introduced so far we are now ready to give the formal proof of Theorem 2.

Proof.: We prove the monotonicity of \(U(\beta)\) and \(V(\beta)\) by showing \(\frac{d\ln U}{d\beta}>0\) and \(\frac{dV}{d\beta}<0\).

**The monotonicity of \(U(\beta)\):** The first-order derivative of \(\ln U\) w.r.t. \(\beta\) is given by

\[\frac{d\ln U}{d\beta} =\frac{1}{U}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot \frac{d\bm{x}}{d\beta}+\frac{\partial U}{\partial\beta}\right)\] \[=-\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial \beta}+\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\beta}.\] (26)

where \(\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}}\in\mathbb{R}^{1\times n}\) is the partial derivative of \(U\) w.r.t. \(\bm{x}\). Let \(a_{i}=e^{\beta w_{i}}\), we will first show \(\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\beta}\geq 0\). In fact, calculation shows

\[\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\beta} =\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}} \cdot\left(\frac{(\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}^{2}x_{k}a_{k})(\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k} )-(\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k})^{2}}{(\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k})^{2}}\right)\] \[=\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}^{2}x_{k}a_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k} a_{k}}-\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}.\] (27)

From Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, it holds that

\[\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}^{2}x_{k}a_{k}\cdot\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}\geq\left(\sum_ {k=1}^{n}\sqrt{w_{k}^{2}x_{k}a_{k}\cdot x_{k}a_{k}}\right)^{2}=\left(\sum_{k =1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}\right)^{2}.\]

Therefore, the RHS of Eq. (27) is greater than or equal to \(0\). Hence, it suffices to show

\[-\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial F }{\partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta}>0.\] (28)

Also note that

\[\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial x_{i}} =\frac{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}} \cdot\left(\frac{w_{i}a_{i}(\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k})-a_{i}\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k} x_{k}a_{k}}{(\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k})^{2}}\right)\] \[=\frac{w_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}}-\frac{a_{i}}{ \sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}\] \[=\frac{w_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}}-\frac{P_{i}}{x_ {i}},\] (29)

and substitute Eq. (22), (25), and (29) into the LHS of Eq. (28), we obtain

\[-\frac{1}{U}\cdot\frac{\partial U}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot\left( \frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta}\] \[= \left[\frac{w_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}w_{k}x_{k}a_{k}}-\frac{P_{ i}}{x_{i}}\right]_{i\in[n]}^{\top}\cdot\left[D^{-1}-\frac{D^{-1}\bm{y}\bm{z}^{ \top}D^{-1}}{1+\bm{z}^{\top}D^{-1}\bm{y}}\right]\cdot\left[\frac{P_{i}}{x_{i}} \cdot(1-2P_{i})\cdot\left(w_{i}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}P_{k}w_{k}\right)\right]_{i\in[n]}\] \[= \frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}-\frac{ \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)\right)^{2}}{T(1+\sum_{i=1}^{ n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i}))},\] (30)where \(T=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}x_{i}a_{i}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}a_{k}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{ i}w_{i}\). Therefore, it suffices to prove

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}-\frac{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)\right)^{2}}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i}) }>0.\] (31)

Since \(1-2P_{i}>0\), from Cauchy-Schwarz inequality it holds that

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}\cdot\left(1+\sum_ {i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})\right)\] \[= \sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n }\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}\] \[\geq \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)\right)^{2}+\sum _{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)^{2}\] \[> \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)\right)^{2},\]

where the last inequality holds because \(\{\bm{w}_{i}\}\) are not identical so there exists at least one \(j\in[n]\) such that \(\delta_{j}(1-2P_{j})(w_{j}-T)^{2}>0\). Therefore, Eq. (31) holds and we have \(\frac{d\ln U}{d\beta}>0\).

**The monotonicity of \(V(\beta)\):** Next we show \(\frac{dV}{d\beta}<0\). Since \(\frac{\partial V}{\partial\beta}=0\), this is equivalent to show

\[\frac{\partial V}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial F}{\partial\bm{x}} \right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta}>0.\] (32)

Note that \(\frac{dV}{dx_{i}}=1\), we have

\[\frac{\partial V}{\partial\bm{x}}\cdot\left(\frac{\partial F}{ \partial\bm{x}}\right)^{-1}\cdot\frac{\partial F}{\partial\beta}\] \[= -[1,1,\cdots,1]\cdot\left[D^{-1}-\frac{D^{-1}\bm{y}\bm{z}^{\top}D ^{-1}}{1+\bm{z}^{\top}D^{-1}\bm{y}}\right]\cdot\left[\frac{P_{i}}{x_{i}} \cdot(1-2P_{i})\cdot\left(w_{i}-\sum_{k=1}^{n}P_{k}w_{k}\right)\right]_{i\in[ n]}\] \[= -\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)}{P_{i}}+ \frac{1}{1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_ {i}(1-2P_{i})}{P_{i}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T).\] (33)

To show the RHS of Eq. (33) is positive, it suffices to show

\[\left(1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})\right)\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i }x_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T)}{P_{i}}<\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i} )}{P_{i}}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})(w_{i}-T).\] (34)

Plugin \(T=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}w_{i}\) into Eq. (34), it is equivalent to show that

\[\left(1+\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})\right)\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i }x_{i}(1-2P_{i})w_{i}}{P_{i}}-\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}w_{i}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta _{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i})}{P_{i}}<\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i})}{P_{i }}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})w_{i},\]

and note that \(1=\sum_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}\), it is equivalent to show

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}[\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})+P_{i}]\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1 -2P_{i})w_{i}}{P_{i}}<\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i})}{P_{i}} \sum_{i=1}^{n}[\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})+P_{i}]w_{i}.\] (35)Let \(a_{i}=\frac{\delta_{i}x_{i}(1-2P_{i})}{P_{i}},b_{i}=\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})+P_{i}\), then Eq. (35) is equivalent to

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}\cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}w_{i}<\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i} \cdot\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}w_{i}\Longleftrightarrow\sum_{i>j}(w_{i}-w_{j})\left( \frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}-\frac{b_{j}}{a_{j}}\right)>0.\]

Next, without loss of generality we show that for any \(1\leq i<j\leq n\), if \(w_{i}>w_{j}\) then it also holds that \(\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}>\frac{b_{j}}{a_{j}}\) for sufficiently large \(\beta\). In fact, from \(P_{i}=\frac{x_{i}e^{\beta w_{i}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{k}e^{\beta w_{k}}}\) and Eq. (23) we obtain

\[\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}\cdot\frac{a_{j}}{b_{j}}= \frac{\delta_{j}(\delta_{i}(1-2P_{i})+P_{i})(1-2P_{j})}{\delta_{i }(\delta_{j}(1-2P_{j})+P_{j})(1-2P_{i})}\cdot e^{\beta(w_{i}-w_{j})}\] \[= \frac{1+P_{i}\delta_{i}/(1-2P_{i})}{1+P_{j}\delta_{j}/(1-2P_{j}) }\cdot e^{\beta(w_{i}-w_{j})}\] \[= \frac{1+\frac{P_{i}^{3}}{(1-2P_{i})(P_{i}^{2}+x_{i}^{2}c_{i}^{ \prime\prime}(x_{i}))}}{1+\frac{P_{j}^{3}}{(1-2P_{j})(P_{j}^{2}+x_{j}^{2}c_{j}^ {\prime\prime}(x_{j}))}}\cdot e^{\beta(w_{i}-w_{j})}.\] (36)

On the one hand, because \(1-2P_{i},1-2P_{j}\in[\frac{1}{3},1]\), \(x_{i},x_{j}\in[0,L]\), and \(c_{i}^{\prime\prime}(x_{i}),c_{j}^{\prime\prime}(x_{j})>0\), the first terms of the LHS of Eq. (36) is a positive number lower bounded away from zero. On the other hand, \(w_{i}>w_{j}\) ensures that the second term \(e^{\beta(w_{i}-w_{j})}\) can be arbitrarily large as long as \(\beta\) is sufficiently large. Therefore, there must exist a \(\beta_{0}>0\) such that for any \(\beta>\beta_{0}\), \(\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}\cdot\frac{a_{j}}{b_{j}}>1\) holds for any \(i>j\).

As a result, \((w_{i}-w_{j})\left(\frac{b_{i}}{a_{i}}-\frac{b_{j}}{a_{j}}\right)>0\) holds, which completes the proof.

## Appendix B Additional Experiments

We use the following Multi-agent Mirror Descent (MMD) algorithm as the PNE solver of \(C^{4}\), whose convergence is guaranteed by [7]. Since each creator's strategy set \(\mathcal{X}_{i}=[0,+\infty)\), we can simply choose a projection mapping \(\text{Proj}_{\mathcal{X}_{i}}(\bm{x})=(\max(x_{i},0))_{i=1}^{n}\). The gradients of utility functions can be implemented directly since they have closed forms. Through our experiment, the default \(T=10000,\eta=0.1,\epsilon=1e-2,x_{i}^{(0)}=1.0\). Algorithm 2 is a simplified version of Algorithm 1 in [7] where we replace the gradient estimation to the exact gradient. According to Theorem 5.1 in [7], Algorithm 2 converges to the unique PNE of any \(C^{4}\) game with probability 1.

``` Input: Maximum iteration number \(T\), step size \(\eta\), each player \(i\)'s utility function \(u_{i}\), error tolerance \(\epsilon\), initial strategy \(\bm{x}_{i}=\bm{x}_{i}^{(0)}\).

**Algorithm 2**Multi-agent Mirror Descent (MMD) with perfect gradient

Figure 3 illustrates the trade-off between \(U\) and \(V\) in the MovieLens environment, and Figure 4 plots the same information as shown in Figure 2 but with a different value of \(\lambda=0.1\). As we can see, the optimal PPM(\(\bm{\beta}\)) found by Algorithm 1 conveys a consistent message: it prioritizes the recommendation accuracy for users with more determined preferences while increasing the exploration strength for less selective users.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We list the paper's contribution and scope clearly at the last paragraph of Section 1 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed our limitations in the Conclusion section as well as in Theorem 2. We are not able to prove the most general claim with \(m>1\) and have to demonstrate our idea in a simplified setting \((m=1)\). However, our empirical study shows our theory is applicable to a much broader scenario. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs**Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have listed all the details of proof assumptions in the theory statement, and complete proofs in Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the code and data in the supplementary material with a well commented python notebook for reproducing all the results and figures. Experiment details are listed in Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the code and data in the supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Experiment details are listed in Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide error bars in all figure in our experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our experiments are not computational intense and do not require GPU as they are not related to deep learning. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The codes are anonymous as well. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: It has been discussed at Abstract and Section 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.

* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.

* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
