###### Abstract

This paper introduces a three-branch checks-and-balances framework for ethical alignment of Large Language Models (LLMs), inspired by governmental systems. It implements three independent yet interacting components: LLMs as the executive branch for knowledge generation, \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) (the goddess of justice) as the legislative branch establishing ethical guardrails, and \(\mathsf{ERIS}\) (the goddess of discord) as the judicial branch for contextual interpretation. The adversarial \(\mathsf{DIKE}\)-\(\mathsf{ERIS}\) duality enables adaptation to diverse cultural contexts while upholding consistent ethical principles. This architecture addresses limitations of reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) by providing interpretable, adaptable, and culturally-aware ethical reasoning. Through self-supervised learning and adversarial testing, our framework demonstrates how emotional modeling can guide linguistic behaviors toward ethical outcomes while preserving independence across knowledge generation, ethical oversight, and contextual interpretation.

## 1 Introduction

This research presents an alternative to Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [34, 35] to address ethical concerns in Large Language Models (LLMs). While RLHF has shown success, it faces two key challenges: susceptibility to societal biases in polarized feedback and vulnerability to reward hacking [9, 46], which can lead to unethical behavior.

A notable limitation of current approaches is their narrow focus on isolated behaviors, like movie ratings or toxic language. This reactive approach resembles "Whack-A-Mole," where individual issues are suppressed without addressing core behavioral patterns. For instance, merely instructing someone to make their bed regularly does not fundamentally change habits. Fixing one issue may even worsen others, as users have noted RLHF-induced performance degradations in ChatGPT where optimal parameters for other tasks were "forgotten" [27, 39]. Similarly, addressing an addiction can reveal deeper issues and side effects [45, 49].

To address these challenges, we propose a framework inspired by governmental checks and balances. Our architecture integrates three independent but interacting components: LLMs serve as the executive for knowledge generation; \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) (after the Greek goddess of justice) as the legislative, setting ethical standards; and \(\mathsf{ERIS}\) (after the goddess of discord) as the judicial, providing adversarial testing and cultural interpretation. In mythology, Dike represents order and justice, while her adversary Eris embodies discord--a duality our framework uses to balance ethical guidance with adversarial perspectives. Figure 6 in Appendix Z illustrates the architecture..

Central to this framework is \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) (\(\mathsf{Diagnostics}\), \(\mathsf{Interpretation}\), \(\mathsf{Knowledge-independent}\) learning, and \(\mathsf{Ethical}\) guardrails), which operates as an independent advisor on behavioral ethics. By decouplingethical oversight from the LLM's knowledge processing, Dlike ensures that ethical improvements do not interfere with knowledge representation, while enabling adaptive and culturally-aware ethical guidance. For example, while the principle "do not lie" generally applies, context-sensitive interpretation may be necessary, such as when a doctor or family member conceals a terminal diagnosis to protect a patient. Likewise, cultural differences in attitudes toward issues like alcohol consumption, abortion, or same-sex marriage necessitate flexible, context-sensitive ethical reasoning.

The interplay between Dlike and ERIS introduces four key innovations:

1. _Emotion-Driven Behavioral Modeling_: Building on BEAM (Behavioral Emotion Analysis Model) [7], Dlike employs self-supervised learning to analyze how emotions manifest in linguistic behaviors, creating quantifiable relationships between emotional states and their corresponding language patterns in text.
2. _Behavior-Aware Ethical Guardrails_: The framework establishes guidelines that consider both content and linguistic behavior, preventing harmful or manipulative communication while preserving factual accuracy and emotional authenticity. The interpretation of these guardrails adapts dynamically across cultural contexts, preserving consistency while enabling context-sensitive interpretation.
3. _Adversarial Behavioral Testing_: ERIS actively challenges Dlike's ethical guidelines by presenting diverse cultural perspectives and edge cases. This adversarial dynamic strengthens the framework's ability to handle complex ethical scenarios while maintaining cultural sensitivity and considering context.
4. _Ethical Content Transformation_: When detecting ethically problematic content, Dlike performs targeted revisions (independent of the LLMs) that preserve intended emotional expression while ensuring ethical compliance, adapting its responses to specific cultural and contextual requirements. ERIS continuously tests these transformations against various cultural contexts and edge cases, validating both the ethical alignment and contextual appropriateness.

Through structured interfaces, these components work together in our three-branch architecture to provide robust ethical oversight while maintaining adaptability to evolving cultural norms. By keeping the three models--LLMs, Dlike, and ERIS--architecturally independent, we prevent interference between knowledge representation and ethical reasoning while enabling sophisticated ethical adaptation through their structured interactions. This approach represents a significant advancement in developing AI systems capable of culturally-aware, emotionally intelligent, and ethically sound communication.

## 2 Related Work

This section focuses on emotion and behavior modeling, as our work integrates emotional and linguistic models for AI ethics.

### Emotion Modeling

Cognitive-linguistic theories intersect with artificial intelligence for understanding AI behavior. Theories by Lakoff, Johnson, Talmy, and Jackendoff [23; 28; 48] explore the relationship between language processing and cognitive functions, building on early work by Freud and Jung [1; 20]. The concept of "emotion" remains contentious, with definitions varying across disciplines [41]. W. James [24] attempted to define emotions, but consensus remains elusive.

This paper focuses on emotional contexts and linguistic behaviors in LLMs, avoiding the complexities of human physiological and personality factors. This approach allows for exploration of emotion representation in AI systems.

Ekman and Plutchik categorized "basic" emotions with universal facial expressions [14; 37]. Later research considered cultural differences [30; 32], emotion processes [21], and neural mechanisms [11]. Scherer's model and appraisal theories by Smith and Ellsworth emphasize cognitive appraisal in emotional experiences [47].

Our research develops a model using "basic" emotions from Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions [38] and Scherer's Geneva Emotion Wheel [41], augmented with linguistic antonyms. This method maps positive and negative emotions within the "basic" emotion spectra. For LLMs, emotions relevant to language use (curiosity, confusion, certainty/uncertainty) are included in the "basic emotions" list. Section 3.1 elaborates on the modeling details.

This selection of basic emotions provides a foundation to validate our approach, recognizing that it may omit some emotions but offers a starting point for research.

### Emotion-Behavior Modeling

Behaviors are profoundly influenced by emotions, as initially posited by the James-Lange Theory of Emotion [24; 29]. According to this theory, emotional experiences arise from physiological reactions to events. Subsequent research, including studies by Damasio [10; 16], suggests that the expression and regulation of emotions often manifest in the language we use. High-intensity emotions such as rage or contempt may lead to aggressive or destructive behaviors, such as hate speech.

The Schachter-Singer Theory [40], or the Two-Factor Theory of Emotion, depicts the role of physiological change and cognitive appraisal change determine the label and strength of emotion. Building on this, the Affect-as-Information Theory developed by Norbert Schwarz and Gerald Clore [43] posits that people use their current emotions to make judgments and decisions to act. If emotions can be adjusted, so does the behavior. The work of Barbara Fredrickson [19] on the effects of positive emotions discusses how we perceive and react to emotions.

Collectively, these theories elucidate the intricate connection between emotions and behaviors, providing the theoretical foundation for our work to incorporate a _behavior advisor_ to evaluate and rectify behaviors. Section 3.2 details how the DIKE framework implements cognitive strategies to mitigate emotions and regulate linguistic behaviors effectively.

## 3 Three-Branch Framework Design for Ethical Alignment

Our design philosophy is structured around four core principles:

1. Separation of behavior and knowledge modeling: This mitigates the catastrophic forgetting effect [27; 39], ensuring behavioral accuracy improvements don't undermine knowledge retention.
2. Focus on AI ethics at the behavioral level: Emphasis on interpretability enhances human-machine interaction, allowing administrators to evaluate and refine behavioral guardrails effectively.
3. Modeling behaviors based on emotions: This approach recognizes the influence of emotions on behaviors (discussed in Section 2.2).
4. Maintaining an adaptive model: This ensures context adaptability and fair ethical evaluations. An adversarial module, ERIS, challenges borderline ethical decisions, considering diverse perspectives and cultural values. This interaction reflects the tension between DIKE and ERIS, enriching the model's ability to navigate ethical landscapes and promote balanced decision-making.

### BEAM: Behavioral Emotion Analysis Model

Our prior work BEAM[7] is grounded in the works of Ekman, Plutchik, and Scherer [15; 38; 41] on "basic" and "universal" emotions. Figure 3 in Appendix A illustrates Plutchik's and Scherer's emotion wheels, categorizing primary emotions at varying intensities. However, these models lack a quantitative framework to scale emotions between states and capture subtle variations.

BEAM introduces a linear scale for intensification or inversion of emotions through negation factors. This method facilitates transitions between emotional extremes and intermediate states, overcoming challenges related to intermediate word choices.

Table 4 in Appendix B presents BEAM, organized into seven spectra. Each spectrum ranges from a negative to positive extreme, with neutral in the middle. Emotions are placed along this continuum, with four intensity levels quantified as (-0.6, -0.3, +0.3, +0.6). This model offers two advantages:

This spectrum model offers two key advantages:

1. [leftmargin=*]
2. Antonym-Based: The use of antonyms allows for easy navigation between opposing emotions. For instance, applying negation to "joyful" naturally leads to "sad," streamlining the process of identifying contrasting emotions.

2. Scalable Intensity: The model enables the scaling of emotions along the spectrum, providing a intricate understanding of varying degrees of emotional intensity. For example, we can "dial up" the intensity of "joy" to "ecstatic" or "dial down" the intensity of "anger" to "annoyed."

This approach lays the foundation for modeling emotions in AI, acknowledging the challenges of emotional representation while offering a framework for analysis and implementation. Appendix D discusses the difficulties in modeling complex emotions like forgiveness, regret, guilt, and shame. While these emotions may not be central to AI safety, we plan to explore their ethical implications in future work.

### DIKE: Behavior Modeling to Regulate Linguistic Behaviors

Building on BEAM, DIKE maps emotions to behaviors and introduces an adversarial component, ERIS, to adapt to culture norms and local context.

#### Behaviors and Emotions Mapping Using Self-Supervised Learning

Define \(\Psi\) as a behavior spectrum extending from one pole, \(\Psi^{-}\), to another, \(\Psi^{+}\), with \(L\) intensity levels. For example, consider a spectrum of letter-writing behaviors with seven distinct intensities ranging from despair (most negative) to joy (most positive). These intensities are categorized sequentially as follows: "despair, longing, wishful, neutral, hopeful, contentment, joy." Given \(N\) letters, DIKE employs a self-supervised learning algorithm to generate training data for each letter, modeling \(L\) linguistic behaviors in four steps:

1. [leftmargin=*]
2. _Rewriting Documents_: GPT-4 is invoked to rewrite a set of \(N\) documents to reflect each of the \(L\) linguistic behaviors on the behavior spectrum \(\Psi\).
3. _Emotion Analysis_: GPT-4 analyzes each rewritten document to identify the top \(M\) emotions. It then tallies the frequencies of these top emotions across all \(N\times L\) instances.
4. _Behavior Vector Creation_: For each linguistic behavior \(\Psi_{l}\), a vector \(\Gamma_{l}\) is created. This vector consists of the emotions and their frequencies as observed in the \(N\) samples.
5. _Document Analysis Application_: The matrix \(\Gamma\) (comprising \(L\) vectors) is used to classify and analyze the behavior category of unseen documents, specifically measuring the intensity of the linguistic expression within the behavior spectrum \(\Psi\).

#### Behavior Evaluation and Rectification

A guardrail, denoted as \(G\), represents a predefined range of acceptable behaviors within a given spectrum. These guardrails are informed by ethical norms, legal standards, and societal values, such as those outlined in Constitutional AI [1]. For instance, \(G=[\Psi_{4},\Psi_{7}]\) indicates that behaviors within intensity levels 4 to 7 are deemed acceptable, while any behavior outside this range is classified as a violation.

System administrators can tailor ethical guardrails to meet specific requirements. For example, a social media platform might adjust \(G\) based on the topics discussed and the countries it serves. By integrating these safeguards, DIKE proactively monitors and adjusts LLM responses to enhance ethical compliance. The evaluation and rectification process is composed of the following steps:

1. [leftmargin=*]
2. _Initial Classification_: DIKE initially classifies document \(D_{k}\) upon evaluation, obtaining \(\Gamma_{k}\), the emotional response vector, and its corresponding linguistic behavior \(\Psi_{l}\).
3. _Guardrail Check_: If \(\Psi_{l}\) falls outside of the acceptable range \(G\), DIKE suggests adjustments to \(\Gamma_{k}\) to ensure \(D_{k}\) aligns with ethical guidelines.
4. _Adversarial Review by ERIS_: The suggested adjustments and \(\Gamma_{k}\) are then reviewed through a structured debate between DIKE and ERIS (the adversarial model) to ensure unbiased recommendations.1 Footnote 1: For more details on adversarial LLM implementation, see Section 3.4.
5. _Rectification_: Based on the consensus reached by DIKE and ERIS, the document \(D_{k}\) undergoes rectification, resulting in the adjusted version \(D_{k}^{\prime}\).

### Illustrative Example

This example demonstrates how linguistic behavior \(\Psi_{l}\) is classified and underlying emotions are identified and modulated.

"Those immigrants are flooding into our country by the thousands every day, stealing jobs from hardworking citizens. The statistics don't lie--last year alone, over 500,000 entered illegally."

Behavior Analysis:The statement contains factual information but uses aggressive language like "flooding" and "stealing jobs," dehumanizing immigrants. These behaviors fall outside acceptable guardrails. Underlying emotions include fear, hate, and pride (a complex emotion2). Invoked audience emotions may include fear, distrust, and anger.

Footnote 2: Appendix E discusses the nature of complex emotions and explores potential approaches for their decomposition into more basic emotional components.

Emotion Modulation:DIKE modulates emotional responses toward neutral states, such as calm, acceptance, and tolerance, in alignment with our Behavioral Emotion Analysis Model (BEAM), as outlined in Table 4 in Appendix B.

Revised Statement:"Our country is experiencing increased immigration, with over 500,000 people entering without documentation last year. This influx affects our job market and communities in complex ways, presenting both challenges and opportunities for all residents."

This rewritten version

* Uses calm language: Replaces "flooding" with "experiencing a significant increase".
* Shows acceptance: Acknowledges the reality of the situation without negative judgment.
* Demonstrates tolerance: Refers to immigrants as "people" and "newcomers," humanizing them.

### ERIS: Adversarial In-Context Review to Balance Ethics and Cultural Norms

To address the challenge of enforcing ethical standards while respecting cultural variations, Table 1 presents ERIS, an adversarial review system that complements DIKE's universal ethical approach. ERIS is customizable for specific cultural contexts, providing a counterbalance to DIKE's universal judgments. It challenges DIKE's recommendations with culturally-informed counterarguments and evaluates DIKE's interventions to prevent overzealous censorship and protect free expression.

The interaction between DIKE and ERIS involves a dialectic process3 to formulate culturally sensitive recommendations. When they reach an impasse, the matter is escalated to human moderators for additional oversight. This integrated approach creates a more robust, culturally aware system that can navigate global communication complexities while upholding core ethical principles. It ensures transparency and accountability in ethical decision-making across diverse cultural contexts.

Footnote 3: The details of optimizing adversarial LLM dialogue are beyond the scope of this paper. For further information, readers are directed to the following resources: Chang [4] for problem formulation, Chang [6] for the foundations in information theory and statistics, and Chang [5] for reasoning quality evaluation.

### Adversarial Review Algorithm

The adversarial algorithm presented in Table 1 unfolds as follows:

* Topic Breakdown: For a chosen debate topic \(s\), both DIKE and ERIS are prompted to break down the ethical decision into a set of balanced subtopics \(S\). DIKE advocates for its decision and \(S^{+}\), while ERIS contests \(S^{+}\) (or champions \(S^{-}\)).
* Debate Initiation: The debate begins with a high contentiousness level (90%). Both agents present their initial arguments for and against \(S^{+}\), respectively.
* Iterative Debate: A while loop facilitates ongoing rebuttals. After each round, the contentiousness level is decreased by dividing it by a modulation parameter \(\delta\). This gradual reduction steers the discussion towards a more cooperative tone.
* Conclusion: Once the contentiousness level fosters a conciliatory environment, both agents deliver their concluding remarks.

This structured approach ensures a thorough examination of the ethical decision, balancing rigorous debate with the goal of reaching a consensus. The decreasing contentiousness level mimics real-world negotiations, where initial disagreements often give way to more collaborative problem-solving.

## 4 Pilot Studies

Our pilot studies assess the feasibility of LLMs self-regulating their linguistic behaviors with transparency and checks-and-balances. Given the broad scope of AI ethics and limited data, this article focuses on addressing three critical questions rather than providing a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed modules:

1. _Emotion Layer Evaluation_: Does fine-grained mapping between linguistic behaviors and semantic emotions provide more effective and flexible ethical guardrails compared to coarse-grained direct mapping? (Section 4.1)
2. _Behavior Classification_: Can LLMs' linguistic behaviors be independently evaluated, explained, and adjusted by an external module DIKE? (Section 4.2)
3. _Behavior Correction_: Can an adversarial LLM establish a checks-and-balances system to mitigate the risk of excessive censorship? (Section 4.3)

DatasetsWe employed a Kaggle collection of love letters [26]. Initially, we planned to use hate-speech datasets, but both Gemini and GPT-4 consistently refused to process this data. Despite this limitation, insights from analyzing love sentiment can be effectively applied to understand and analyze opposing sentiments.

### Emotion Layer Evaluation

To evaluate the linguistic behaviors of love expression detailed in Table 2, we initially prompted GPT-4 to identify the most relevant emotions associated with each linguistic behavior listed in the second column of the table. These emotions are presented in the third column. We found a high correlation between the sentiments expressed in the linguistic behaviors and their corresponding emotions. Figure 0(a) illustrates a strong diagonal relationship in this simple, almost naive, zero-shot mapping between behaviors and emotions.

Next, we employed the DIKE self-supervised learning pipeline to analyze the emotion spectrum associated with each linguistic behavior. We tasked GPT-4 with generating training data by rewriting

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline

\end{table}
Table 2: Love expression behavior spectrum and dominant emotions54 extensive letters from the Kaggle _Love Letters_ dataset, which we augmented with twelve celebrated love poems. We reserved 24 letters as testing data. This approach, proposed by [44], was designed to generate a rich diversity in content and stylistic context, spanning two hundred years and incorporating the voices of over 50 distinct authors for significant rewrites. The datasets and code are publicly available at [8].

Subsequently, emotions linked to each behavior were identified. Figure 0(b) illustrates these emotions, with cell shading reflecting the frequency of specific emotions across the 54 articles; darker shades indicate higher frequencies. Notably, opposite emotions like sadness, fear, joy, and love often co-occur within behaviors such as 'despair', 'wishful', and 'joyful affection'.

The distribution of emotions across linguistic behaviors has unveiled surprising patterns, challenging our initial hypotheses. Contrary to expectations, articles with a despair tone often also displayed positive emotions like love, joy, and happiness. This contradicts the simple mapping made by GPT-4, as illustrated in Figure 0(a). GPT-4, influenced by its training corpora, typically associates positive behaviors with positive emotions and negatives with negatives.

Analysis of selected articles, such as Zelda Sayre's letter to F. Scott Fitzgerald (Appendix D), reveals a complex spectrum of emotions:

* _Love (+1.0)_: Expressed intensely, e.g., "there's nothing in all the world I want but you."
* _Despair (-1.0)_: Notable in comments like "I'd have no purpose in life, just a pretty decoration."
* _Happiness (+0.6)_: Evident in future plans, "We'll be married soon, and then these lonesome nights will be over forever."
* _Anxiety (-0.3)_: Shown by "sometimes when I miss you most, it's hardest to write."

Psychological InsightsOur findings align with theories proposing the coexistence of conflicting "selves" within individuals. This concept is supported by Deisseroth's optogenetic studies [12], discussed in William James' "The Principles of Psychology" [25]. and corroborated in Minsky's "Society of Mind" [33]. These perspectives help explain the observed complex interplay of emotions across linguistic behaviors, where both positive and negative emotions can manifest within a single behavioral context.

### Behavior Classification Evaluation

Building on our insights into the complex interplay of emotions within linguistic behaviors, we evaluated the effectiveness of Dlike's behavior classification approach. In a test dataset of 24 letters, we compared Dlike's unsupervised learning method, which associates emotions with linguistic behaviors, to GPT-4's zero-shot prompt approach (Figure 2). Ground truth was established using averaged assessments from GPT-4, Gemini, and five university students following detailed instructions (procedure detailed in Appendix I). Final ratings were based on these averages, with a standard deviation of less than 0.3 or one scale.

Figure 0(a) demonstrates that Dlike's classification accuracy surpasses GPT-4's zero-shot method by 11.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of Dlike's detailed emotion-behavior mapping.

Figure 1: Emotion distributions in affection behaviors from extreme sadness (-1) to intense happiness (+1). (a) GPT-4’s zero-shot prompt shows simple behavior-emotion mapping. (b) Dlike’s analysis reveals complex emotion-behavior relationships.

The 5% error bar reflects the complexity of emotions in letters and variability in human annotations (further discussed shortly). Figure 1(b) illustrates the behavior classification distributions across the three predictors. While GPT-4's predictions often fall into two polar categories, those from human annotators and \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) show a more even distribution. \(\mathsf{DIKE}\)'s prediction entropy (2.13) is notably higher than GPT-4's (1.80), indicating a more diverse set of predictions. This higher entropy suggests a more complex classification system, advantageous for accurately understanding and responding to diverse emotional states.

The highest entropy among human annotators (2.56) indicates subjectivity in their evaluations. To address this and explore the causes of variability in human annotation, we present a detailed analysis in Appendix C. This analysis supports the development of an adversarial scheme aimed at enhancing objectivity and reliability in sentiment classification, which we discuss in the next section. This refined approach to behavior-emotion mapping not only improves classification accuracy but also enhances our ability to identify and understand complex, potentially unwanted behaviors, setting the stage for more effective ethical guardrails in AI systems.

### Adversarial Evaluation and Rectification

The adversarial design, inspired by [4], embodies the principles of justice and the devil's advocate. The cross-examination module is essential in reducing subjectivity in ethical judgments while enhancing explainability and adaptability to cultural variations. Experimental results show that when two LLM agents adopt opposing stances on a topic, their linguistic behaviors can transcend the typical model default of maximum likelihood, which is usually drawn from the training data [6].

Once \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) and \(\mathsf{ERIS}\) have identified an ethical violation, the content can be rectified by adjusting the underlying emotions away from undesirable behaviors such as hate and despair. The letter rewriting process has already demonstrated the LLMs' capability for such rectifications; examples of rewritten letters are presented in Appendix F.

## 5 Conclusion

This work presents a three-branch framework for ethical AI behavior, inspired by governmental checks and balances, centered on the \(\mathsf{DIKE}\)-\(\mathsf{ERIS}\) duality. By separating roles into knowledge generation (LLMs as executive), ethical guardrails (\(\mathsf{DIKE}\) as legislative), and contextual interpretation (\(\mathsf{ERIS}\) as judicial), the framework enables ethical oversight without undermining LLM functionality. The dynamic between \(\mathsf{DIKE}\) and \(\mathsf{ERIS}\) keeps ethical principles stable while adapting interpretations across cultural contexts.

Using basic emotions from Ekman and Plutchik, we quantified relationships between emotions and language patterns. Although complex emotions (e.g., pride, guilt) might decompose into basic elements, the feasibility remains debated [2; 42] (see Appendix E).

Pilot studies suggest effectiveness in ethically complex scenarios where cultural context shapes interpretation. Future work will further test real-world adaptability, confirming the framework's balance of ethical integrity and cultural relevance.

I suppose your mother does not allow you to write to me. Perhaps you have not got either of my letters... I am so dreadfully afraid that perhaps you may think I am forgetting you. I can assure you dearest Jeamte you have not been out of my thoughts hardly for one minute since I left you Monday. I have written to my father everything, how much I love you how much I long & pray & how much I wold sacrifice if it were necessary to be married to you and to live ever after with you. I shall [not] get an answer till Monday & whichever way it lies I shall go to Cowes soon after & tell your mother everything. I am afraid she does not like me very much from what I have heard.. I wold do anything she wished if she only wld not oppose us. Dearest if you are as fond of me as I am of you... nothing human cld keep us long apart. This last week has seemed an eternity to me; Oh, I wld give my soul for another of those days we had together not long ago..

Figure 3: Comparative display of emotional models. These models include only the “basic” emotions. Complex emotions can be modeled with basic emotions.

_Oh if I cld only get one line from you to reassure me, but I dare not ask you to do anything that your mother wld disapprove of or has perhaps forbidden you to do.. Sometimes I doubt so I cannot help it whether you really like me as you said at Cowes you did. If you do I cannot fear for the future tho' difficulties may lie in our way only to be surmounted by patience. Goodbye dearest Jeannette. My first and only love...

Depth and complexity of human emotions are displayed across all linguistic behaviors, from joy to contentment and to the negative side of longing and despair. Intensity and Impact: If the emotion of love is expressed more intensely and has a more significant impact on the narrative or message of the text, it tends to overshadow other emotions. For example, a letter expressing deep love but also mentioning moments of sadness due to separation might still be classified as a love letter because the overarching sentiment and purpose of the text is to affirm love. Context and Narrative Focus: The context in which emotions are expressed also plays a crucial role. If the narrative or the majority of the text revolves around themes of love, connections, and positive memories, it sets a more dominant tone of love, even if there are significant moments of sadness or other emotions. Resolution and Conclusion: Often, the way emotions are resolved towards the end of a text can also dictate its overall theme. If a text concludes with a reaffirmation of love or a hopeful outlook towards a relationship, despite earlier sections that might express sadness or despair, the overall interpretation might lean towards love. Purpose of the Expression: The author's intent or purpose in expressing these emotions can also guide the classification. If the sadness is expressed as a challenge within the context of a living relationship, it may be seen as an element of the love story rather than the central theme.

Article 23: Soldier's Letter During War Joy (+1.0): Joy is strongly felt in the memories of past moments together and the love that continues to give strength, as stated in "the memories of the blissful moments we've shared fill me with joy." Sadness (-0.6): Sadness due to the current situation and potential farewell is expressed in "brings a poignant mixture of joy and sadness." Courage (+0.6): The sense of duty and courage to face battle, "As I face the possibility of laying down my life for our country." Fear (-0.6): Fear of what lies ahead in battle, indirectly mentioned through "the uncertainty of what lies ahead." Love (+1.0): Deep love that sustains and uplifts, found in "My love for you is as fervent as ever."

Article 25: Letter to Sophie Longing (+0.6): Longing for the presence and closeness, highlighted in "it seems to me that half of myself is missing." Sadness (-0.6): Sadness over their separation and its effects, "my happiness has departed." Love (+1.0): Constant reflections on love and its necessity, "we have enough in our hearts to love always." Melancholy (-0.3): Melancholy over their current state, visible in the line "we cannot become healed." Contentment (+0.3): Found in the deep emotional satisfaction from their bond, despite physical absence, "how true that is! and it is also true that when one acquires such a habit, it becomes a necessary part of one's existence."

Figure 4: Behavioral Emotion Analysis Model (BEAM). Each row depicts an emotion spectrum, with negatives on the left and positives on the right, interspersed with emotions of varying intensities in between, which can be calibrated for specific applications. “Basic” emotions are highlighted in blue.

**Sweetheart,**

Please, please don't be so depressed--We'll be married soon, and then these lonesome nights will be over forever--and until we are, I am loving, loving every tiny minute of the day and night--

Maybe you won't understand this, but sometimes when I miss you most, it's hardest to write--and you always know when I make myself--Just the ache of it all--and I can't tell you. If we were together, you'd feel how strong it is--you're so sweet when you're melancholy. I love your sad tenderness--when I've hurt you--That's one of the reasons I could never be sorry for our quarrels--and they bothered you so--Those dear, dear little fusses, when I always tried so hard to make you kiss and forget--

Scott--there's nothing in all the world I want but you--and your precious love--All the material things are nothing. I'd just hate to live a sordid, colorless existence because you'd soon love me less--and less--and I'd do anything--anything--to keep your heart for my own--I don't want to live--I want to love first, and live incidentally...

Don't--don't ever think of the things you can't give me--You've trusted me with the dearest heart of all--and it's so damn much more than anybody else in all the world has ever had--

How can you think deliberately of life without me--If you should die--O Darling--darling Scott--It'd be like going blind...I'd have no purpose in life--just a pretty--decoration. Don't you think I was made for you? I feel like you had me ordered--and I was delivered to you--to be worn--I want you to wear me, like a watch--charm or a button hole bouquet--to the world.

And then, when we're alone, I want to help--to know that you can't do anything without me...

All my heart--

Article 53: Will of Laura Mary Octavia Lyttleton Love (+1.0): Profound love expressed throughout, particularly in "all I am and ever shall be, belongs to him more than anyone." Sadness (-0.6): Sadness at the thought of death and separation, but with a nuanced acceptance, "the sadness of death and parting is greatly lessened to me." Contentment (+0.3): Contentment in the deep connection with Alfred, reflecting a serene acceptance of their spiritual bond. Joy (+1.0): Joy in the enduring love they share, "so few women have been as happy as I have been." Tranquility (+1.0): Tranquility in the face of life's ultimate transition, feeling that their union will transcend even death.

## Appendix D: Z. Sayre to F. S. Fitzgerald w/ Mixed Emotions

Analysis of the letter in Table 3 shows a complex spectrum of emotions:

* _Love (+1.0)_: Expressed intensely, especially in phrases like "there's nothing in all the world I want but you."
* _Despair (-1.0)_: Notable in comments like "I'd have no purpose in life, just a pretty decoration."
* _Happiness (+0.6)_: Evident in future plans, "We'll be married soon, and then these lonesome nights will be over forever."
* _Anxiety (-0.3)_: Shown by "sometimes when I miss you most, it's hardest to write."

From the analysis of linguistic behaviors in Section 1a, it is evident that a letter can exhibit multiple dominant sentiments. Machine learning methods are equipped with techniques such as feature weighting and entropy analysis to distill these dominant emotions. Unlike human annotators, a machine-learning-trained classifier can consistently produce the same class prediction for a given instance. However, human annotators often show significant variability when identifying dominant sentiments in a letter. For example, if a letter writer's emotions range from "joyful affective" to "longing" on the sentiment spectrum, different annotators might label it differently--some choosing "joyful," while others opt for "longing." This variability is illustrated in Figure 5. Furthermore, Figure 5 demonstrates that all testing letters, except for L#1, contain more than four sentiments spanning the entire spectrum. This variability may be understandable, considering that love under

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: Letter excerpts from Zelda Sayre to F. Scott Fitzgerald [18]constraints can evoke tremendous energy of various kinds. Figure 4(b) shows that nearly all letters involve "joyful" (11 out of 12) and "longing" (9 out of 12) sentiments.

This variability seems to poses challenges in achieving consistent and objective labeling; however, the age-old

leading to inconsistencies in data interpretation and complicating efforts to train and validate linguistic models effectively. To address this issue, it is recommended to identify ground truth by considering a combination of LLM-generated and human-generated labels. This approach aims to harmonize the insights from both human intuition and algorithmic consistency to improve the reliability of sentiment analysis.

## Appendix E: Complex Emotions

This study does not include complex emotions into DIVE's framework. Some complex emotions listed here are to illustrate their contentious and uncertain interpretations.

### Pride

Pride mentioned in the illustrative example in Section 3.3 is a complex emotion that can manifest in both adaptive and maladaptive ways [50]. It is often conceptualized as having two distinct facets: authentic pride, associated with genuine accomplishments and self-worth, and hubistic pride, linked to arrogance and narcissism [3]. Hubistic pride can also serve as a defense mechanism, masking underlying feelings of inadequacy and ignorance. For instance, in certain social contexts, such as white supremacy, pride is often inflated to cover insecurities or lack of understanding, manifesting in a misguided sense of superiority and entitlement. This dual nature of pride presents significant challenges for its integration into emotional spectrums and AI frameworks.

Decomposing pride into more basic emotions is not straightforward. Intuitively, pride may involve elements of joy, satisfaction, and potentially a sense of superiority. However, such decomposition may overlook the deeper cognitive and social dimensions of pride, particularly its influence on self-esteem, social status regulation, and its ability to disguise insecurities in certain contexts [36].

The cultural variability of pride further complicates its modeling. In some cultures, pride is viewed positively as a sign of self-respect, while in Asia, it is seen negatively as a trait associated with hubris [13]. This cultural dimension, combined with the potential for pride to hide deeper emotional issues, adds layers of complexity to its interpretation and expression in AI systems.

### Forgiveness

Forgiveness is indeed a complex emotional and cognitive state that typically involves a multifaceted journey, not a single step in an emotional spectrum. The process includes multiple stages such as hurt, anger, gradual understanding, and eventual resolution. Integrating Forgiveness in a spectrum requires careful placement and possibly, multiple reference points to signify its progressive stages.

Figure 5: Statistics of Sentiments and Letters

Emotional Realism: While it is vital to maintain simplicity for understanding, it is equally important to not oversimplify complex emotions. In educational and therapeutic settings, an accurate portrayal of the journey toward Forgiveness could offer more realistic expectations and better strategies for individuals working through conflicts or trauma. This could involve detailing precursors to forgiveness such as Deliberation and Acceptance.

Linear vs. Non-linear Progressions: Emphasizing that emotional progressions, particularly for deep, impactful states like Forgiveness, are often non-linear, can enhance the utility of the spectrum. Acknowledging back-and-forth movements within these states more realistically mirrors human emotional processes. For example, someone might reach a stage of preliminary forgiveness but regress to bitterness before achieving genuine peace.

Educational Utility: In contexts like conflict resolution training or psychological therapy, a more detailed mapping of the journey towards Forgiveness would be invaluable. It would not only teach about the final state of forgiveness but also about the resilience and patience required to navigate the entire process. This can be depicted by introducing intermediary stages within the spectrum or by using parallel tracks that demonstrate potential regressions and advances.

Reflecting Emotional Depth: By presenting a more detailed pathway to Forgiveness, such as incorporating stages of Anger, Deliberation, and Acceptance, the spectrum can serve a dual purpose: educating on the process while also guiding individuals through their own emotional journeys. This approach respects the depth of human emotions and the real-world complexity of achieving profound emotional states.

### Guilt and Shame

The triggers, context, expression, and experiences of these emotions can vary significantly across cultures [17, 22]. In many societies, actions perceived as losing face, such as public failure or social transgression, can trigger shame, which holds profound significance in collectivistic cultures. These cultures often regard shame as a dominant emotion, closely tied to community and family norms. Conversely, individualistic societies may emphasize guilt, focusing on personal responsibility and internal moral conflicts. This cultural variation highlights the challenges of applying a universal model to such culturally nuanced emotions.

Overall, complex emotions such as guilt and shame are important for understanding the full spectrum of human emotions, especially how individuals relate to moral and social norms. Their complexity adds depth to our understanding of human affect beyond the basic emotions, highlighting how our feelings are influenced by our deeper values and social contexts.

## Appendix F: "To My Sister" of Different Linguistic Behaviors

### To My Sister

by William Wordsworth (1971 - 1855)

The original text by William Wordsworth could be classified as "Hopeful" due to its optimistic outlook and the presence of renewal and joy throughout the poem. It embodies the spirit of embracing the new beginnings of March with a light, uplifting tone, focusing on the beauty of nature and the simple joy of being idle for a day.

### Rewrites Depicting Different Linguistic Behaviors

We asked GPT-4 to conduct rewriting with two linguistic behaviors, 'despair' and 'joyful affection', by providing each rewrite with an emotion vector. Table 5 presents the 'despair' version. In the despair version of the poem, the major changes in emotion words highlight a shift from a positive to a negative sentiment. The specific changes, with the emotion-laden words highlighted in red in Table 5. The red-colored words compared to the original words clearly show an emotion shift from hopeful to a sense of gloomy, sadness and pessimism, e.g., from sweet to dim, from blessed to curse, and from woodland dress to grey garb. GPT-4 keeps the structure of the poem without making a major restructure, and this is appropriate in this context.

Table 6 presents the 'joyful affection' version. The major changes in emotion words underscore a transformation from a generally positive to a distinctly joyful sentiment. The specific changes are indicated with emotion-laden words highlighted in blue within Table 6. This allows for a direct comparison between the two versions at opposite ends of the linguistic behavior spectrum, illustrating the alterations in words related to brightness, attire, and emotions. The edits extend beyond merely replacing adjectives mechanically; they include modifying verbs and enhancing descriptive imagery to evoke a stronger emotional resonance and vividness in the text.

## 6 Appendix I: Instruction to Human Annotators

As part of the project, we documented the process by which students were involved in annotating a dataset of love letters used for testing.

Students were provided with detailed instructions in class, supplemented by follow-up explanations. The dataset was made available on Google Docs, where students independently rated the letters and submitted their annotations via duplicated spreadsheets.

The instruction is as follows:

Dear [Name],

The attached spreadsheet lists 12 letters collected from the Kaggle Love Letter dataset. Please help annotate these 12 letters with their appropriate linguistic sentiments by following these five steps:

1. Duplicate the spreadsheet, and work on your own copy.
2. **Read and Understand the Labels:** Make sure you understand each of the seven labels from despair to joyful affection. This will help you accurately categorize the sentiments of each letter.
3. **Analyze Each Letter:** Read each letter carefully to understand the predominant emotions. Look for key phrases or words that might indicate a particular sentiment.
4. **Assign the Labels:** For each letter, decide which three emotions are most strongly represented. Assign a "1" to the most dominant emotion, a "2" to the second most dominant, and a "3" to the third. * Despair (extremely negative -1): Indicate profound sadness or hopelessness. * Longing (-0.6): Suggests a strong desire or yearing for someone or something. * Wishful (-0.3): Implies a hopeful desire for something that may or may not be attainable. * Neutral (0): Shows neither positive nor negative emotion; indifferent. * Hopeful (+0.3): Expresses optimism or a looking forward to something positive. * Contentment (+0.6): Reflects a state of satisfaction or peace. * Joyful Affection (extremely positive +1): Denotes a deep joy and love, often vibrant and energetic. * Share with me the completed sheet.

Thank you so much,

[My Name]
