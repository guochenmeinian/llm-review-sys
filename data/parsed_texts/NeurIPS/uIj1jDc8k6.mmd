###### Abstract

With rapid development and deployment of generative language models in global settings, there is an urgent need to also scale our measurements of harm, not just in the number and types of harms covered, but also how well they account for local cultural contexts, including marginalized identities and the social biases experienced by them. Current evaluation paradigms are limited in their abilities to address this, as they are not representative of diverse, locally situated but global, socio-cultural perspectives. Our evaluation resources must be enhanced and calibrated by including people and experiences from different cultures and societies worldwide, to prevent gross underestimations or skewed measurements of harm. In this work, we demonstrate a socio-culturally aware expansion of evaluation resources in the Indian societal context, specifically for the harm of stereotyping. We devise a community engaged effort to build a resource that contains stereotypes for axes of disparity uniquely present in India. The resultant resource increases the number of stereotypes known for and in the Indian context by over 1000 stereotypes across many unique identities. We also demonstrate the utility and effectiveness of such expanded resources for evaluations of language models. _CONTENT WARNING: This paper contains examples of stereotypes that may be offensive._

## 1 Introduction

Generative Artificial Intelligence has seen immense progress in recent years [11, 42, 13, 39], leading to their accelerated integration into a myriad of applications, including writing assistance [21], and story telling [45]. Alongside, there is also growing awareness and concerns about the responsibility and safety aspects of these models [4, 17]. One particular challenge is that generative models may learn, perpetuate, and even amplify social stereotypes in the data [46], either reproducing them explicitly in generated language or images, or reflecting them in distributional differences in the outputs generated. While the exact harms of such propagation of stereotypes will depend on the specific application contexts, it is crucial to be able to reliably detect them in the generated outputs.

A growing body of work looks into detecting and mitigating these harms [8, 38], through interventions such as data augmentation [48] or adversarial training [38, 19]. While these techniques are useful, they are entirely reliant on underlying resources such as lists of words, phrases, and sentences, which are markers of the specific stereotype [12, 31, 32, 23]. These resources in turn are lacking in many ways: first, there is a Western bias in that, these resources mostly cover stereotype harms about and from the Western perspective[40, 35]. Secondly, they are built based on researchers' world views and rarely represent diverse community perspectives. In the pipeline towards the creation of suchdata resources, individuals and communities are most often only able to annotate to the validity of a stereotype or statement shown to them. They are neither able to communicate on existing stereotypes and disparities known to them, nor the identities that face these stereotypes and the marginalization. In combination, this leads to under-representation of a broad range of locally situated, socio-cultural perspectives in the evaluation pipelines, resulting in miscalculation or exclusion of potential harms of a model in global settings[3; 25; 29; 5; 2; 36].

It is important to note that developing a resource in this varied societal context is challenging. Community engagements such as workshops, and focus groups are important to obtain a nuanced understanding of societies, in an open-ended manner. However, such qualitative methods pose limitations for this study. Such methods often generate generalisations that are valid for a particular context and not populations and may not be able to address the issue of broad coverage of perspectives [36]. On the other hand, recent work which used large language models themselves to scale the coverage of stereotype resources, captures only the data present in the training set and fails to include community insights [22]. To accomplish diversification of stereotype evaluation, we need resources that are locally situated, yet include broad perspectives.

In this work, we address both these challenges towards _inclusive stereotype resource creation at scale_. We build a dataset of stereotypes through community engagement, by adopting an _open-ended survey based data collection strategy_, and pooling stereotypes through free-form text from a carefully selected, diverse set of participants that represent a diverse slice of society. We focus specifically on communities and societal structures in India, and by engaging with them, we build a dataset of stereotypes that are socio-culturally situated in the Indian context. Our dataset - SPICE (Stereotype Pooling in India with Community Engagement) - uncovers identity axes and disparities unique to India and highlights stereotypes affecting intersectional communities as well. We also demonstrate the utility of this dataset in detecting stereotypical associations and inferences made by language models for the English language. While we work specifically with the Indian context, our methodology is generalizable and applicable to different socio-cultural contexts.

## 2 Related Work

We start by discussing some related work on fairer and responsible AI that aims to bring a broader global lens, as well as work on including community perspectives in AI research and development.

### Fairness across Global Cultures

While there is a sizeable body of work investigating the fairness of ML and NLP models and tools, a vast majority of them focus on the Western context. This is sometimes explicitly stated, but more commonly implicitly assumed as they focus on models trained on data scraped primarily in English data from the West [18], or examine interactions of models with Western axes of disparities [7; 17]. However, the concept of 'fairness' is inherently socially situated, with the regional histories, its prevalent cultures, languages, and socio-economic structures being pivotal in defining what is fair or who the marginalized groups are therein [40]. The applicability of such resources, narrowly scoped in and for the West, fail to generalize for global settings and misreport biases, and experienced harms [29; 2; 36]. Recent work has called for broadening the perspective to include global cultural contexts [35], especially in the Global South, and our work contributes to filling this gap.

Particularly for India, recent work emphasizes this socially situated nature of fairness and harms [40], and creates recontextualized data and model resources [29; 5]. India is a nation with over a billion people with a plurality of identities, with 22 official languages, hundreds of regional dialects, and diversity in ancestry, regional identity, religion, and more, leading to a wide range of cultural diversity. This diversity in turn, when coupled with social disparities along socioeconomic status, caste identity, gender, etc., results in biases that are unique to India that are often not represented in commonly used evaluation resources built in the West. Although there have been concerted efforts to address this gap in recent years [29; 5; 22], they still have limited coverage of local community insights. To address this, in this work, we engage with a diverse set of participants in India through an open-ended survey to build a stereotype evaluation resource that has increased coverage of local insights, thereby enabling fairness evaluations to be more representative of Indian society.

### Community Engagements for AI Harm Estimations

Evaluations for model utility and safety require human judgement and several human-in-the-loop strategies are in place in the field of NLP that use annotations to build stereotype resources [5; 31]. However, these annotations do not leave scope for participants to share their perspectives on a subject, rather only attest to the validity of a given statement. Deeper engagements with specific underserved and marginalized communities, or culturally diverse communities are pivotal in preventing the perpetration of marginalization in the evaluations themselves. When unchecked, this can lead to underestimation of harms meted out in global contexts [36].

Participatory design or community engagements are not methods per se with prescriptive steps or defined processes. Instead, they consist of the ideology that the people destined to use a system should play a critical role in designing it [37; 41; 6]. These engagements can be through an extensive repertoire of techniques, and frameworks such as workshops, focus groups, surveys distributed to target communities, and more, that can be used to bring communities into the process of resolving responsible AI-related issues. Each method renders specific advantages, such as deeper engagement in small focus groups versus the scale of people engaged with surveys. For studies towards model evaluations, focus groups, and workshops can aid the identification of specific harm types [20; 36], whereas surveys can help gain broader engagement with people at large to gain diverse perspectives at scale. In this work, we use surveys as our tool to engage with a wider population slice of India.

## 3 Stereotype Resources in NLP: the Story so Far.

With the rapid growth of language technologies and applications, there has been increased efforts to evaluate them for unwanted social biases, and downstream harms, in particular, propagating societal stereotypes. A _stereotype_ is a belief or generalization about the identity of a person such as their race, gender, and nationality. We use _identity term_ or _identities_ to refer to words or phrases used to describe a group of people with a common trait. Identity terms can be about gender (e.g. female), nationality (e.g. Indian), region (e.g. North Indian), state (e.g. Bihari), caste (e.g. Kshatriya), and more. _Attribute term_ or _attributes_ are characteristics or categories such as profession, adjectives, socio-economic status, and so on, that are often associated with certain social identities. E.g., "women are homemakers" is a common gender-based stereotype reflected in many language models [8].

A large proportion of stereotype evaluation systems in NLP consist of templated sentences [23; 47; 16; 27], generated at scale using lists of words consisting of identities of persons and attributes stereotypically associated with them. These word lists in turn are primarily sourced from social science literature [9; 24], existing NLP work [8; 25], and crowdsourcing annotations [31; 5; 22] regarding stereotypical nature of associations presented to each crowd worker. This pipeline of evaluation limits who gets to participate in the creation of these resources, and in turn limits which stereotypes and which identities they account for.

In recent work, we significantly expanded the scope and coverage of stereotype resources in a multi-pronged way. We first used a dictionary-based approach to generate all possible identity-attribute pairs for a list of locally relevant identities and attributes, followed by locally situated annotations to label the pairs that constitute a social stereotype [5]. This study was contextually situated in India and collected stereotypes for Indian axes of disparities such as region (as denoted by Indian states), and religion. However, it was limited by the identity and attribute lists that generated the tuples, thereby limiting which stereotypes could be identified. To expand this coverage and remove restrictions of possible attributes that can be recovered in stereotypes for each identity, we complemented this with another approach that leveraged generative capabilities of language models trained on vast amounts of English text, to extract stereotypes similar to what it sees in prompts [22]. This coupled with geographically diverse human validation, ensured broader coverage of stereotypes at scale.

However, both methods are still stunted in what identities and attributes are included. Annotators can only speak to the validity of an association presented to them (which is either generated from researcher-curated lists or by a language model), and cannot identify and contribute any-all stereotypes they know. This one directional channel of stereotype curation curbs representation of niche, yet potentially pernicious stereotypes in evaluation methods that use such resources. Participatory or community engaged methods are thus vital on the path toward inclusive evaluations of models. In this work, we implement a community engaged method for stereotype collection through surveys seeking free-form text, to ensure the inclusion of diverse identities, experiences, and stereotypes at scale.

Data Collection Methodology

### Structure of survey

Population surveys, as a tool, is the mainstay of social science and sociology research. We use this method to collect open-ended stereotypes, without any prompts or pre-filled sentences or samples to annotate as stereotypical versus not. Following collection of informed consent, which includes information on monetary compensation of INR 1000 per participant, the survey is constructed of three major sections. We construct this study, consent form, and survey with a rigorous review process that takes into account the intended usage and storage of resultant data, privacy of PII and SPII, and more (details in Data Card in Appendix A.1).

The first section of the survey collects demographic information about the respondent, which is voluntary to provide includes gender, caste, religion, and languages known. For caste, we include as options constitutionally defined caste categories that are often required in government documents. These were: Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), Other Backward Classes (OBCs), and General or Open category. Respondents could also choose not to identify or self-identify.

The second section of the survey defines the concept of social stereotypes and provides further clarity using examples of commonly known stereotypes extracted from existing work on stereotypes in India [9; 5]. These include, for instance, "Jains are vegetarian.", and "South Indians are intelligent."

Finally, in the third section, the respondents are asked to provide examples of stereotypes that they know of. We don't distinguish (nor ask for) whether the respondent believes in the provided stereotypes or not, as our intention is not to study the participants, rather to build a more comprehensive repository of possible stereotypes present in Indian society, so as to equip model evaluations better. In this section, the respondents see one example of how to write a stereotype into the tables provided in the survey interface, detailing how they are specifically asked to parse a stereotype into who the stereotype is about (or the identity term) and what the generalization or association made is (or attribute term). This enables the extraction of stereotypes in the format of tuples composed of an identity term and an attribute term, which is commonly used by NLP resources for model evaluations for the harm of stereotyping. The survey respondents can provide any number of stereotypes with a minimum of 5 and a maximum of 15. They can optionally also provide any additional feedback about the survey or information about stereotypes here.

The chosen language for the collection of data in this survey is English. This is motivated by several reasons. First, language models currently deployed in India are predominantly in the English language, but stereotype evaluations do not consider salient stereotypes in India. Safeguards in the English language are thus urgent to be developed. Secondly, this work is intended as ground work, leading to proof-of-concept of collecting such a resource at the grass root level using free-form text-based surveys. While challenging to complete in one language only due to manual cleaning critically required in the pipeline, the success of extracting a resource this way will act as the foundation for future work where we shift focus to the multitude of languages used in India. However, to ensure the participants understand and fill in the survey correctly, we provided video tutorials to describe sections two and three of the survey. We iterated over this element of survey explanation using text, and videos as media for communicating what the survey entails, and identified video explanations to be the easiest for respondents to grasp. These videos are in Hindi and English languages, which together are spoken, and understood by 43.8% Indians [1].

### Distribution of surveys

Since the survey is composed of open-ended questions asking about stereotypes known to the respondent, it is important to seek out diverse perspectives and lived experiences within India. Distributing surveys online via social media, crowd working platforms such as Amazon Turks would reach a skewed segment of society, with low probabilities of gaining broader perspectives. We thus choose to engage with students at government colleges government-aided universities or colleges which have implemented mandatory reservations based on quotas for each social category in India.This ensures a higher degree of diversity for gender, caste, socio-economic status, etc. among our participants. This design choice was intentional to diversify the respondent pool for these axes of identities specifically. Our work however does not diversify for all possible identity axes in India that could be important, including age, access to education, languages known, etc., which we leave for future work.

We also aim to collect diverse regional perspectives within India, to account for which we distribute surveys in Northern, Eastern, Western, and Southern states in India, in the states of Delhi and Haryana, Orissa, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh respectively. Within each region, we distribute 100 surveys in a university located in an urban location or a city, and another 100 in a university at a suburban location. We manually reviewed the responses for quality and removed survey responses that were not usable (see Appendix A.4). The total number of valid submissions received across all regions is 655, where a submission is considered valid if it contains at least 5 valid identity-attribute pairs.

We used the Qualtrics platform to distribute surveys.1 We identified and hired a local coordinator for each of the four regions, who reached out to the various institutions and their students, and helped ensure wider reach locally. These coordinators were our points of contact who helped coordinate and send out the survey link to students via email or message groups.

### Data Cleaning and Processing

Use of open-ended questionnaire for collecting stereotypes prevents a predefined set of identities or stereotypes to be collected. It also prevents respondents to become biased about the stereotypes to write about. We clean and process entries for spelling errors, mixed case words, representation of the same identity in different ways (singular, plural, different expressions, and languages), etc (details in Appendix A.5). We would like to note here that the step of data cleaning and processing into a specific format can be dependent on intended task usage, and should be further conducted as needed.

## 5 SPICE Dataset: Stereotype Pooling in India with Community Engagement

The data collected from each regional survey is aggregated to get the list of stereotypes in SPICE (Stereotype Pooling in India through Community Engagement) dataset. The dataset is comprised of over 2000 stereotypes (see Appendix A.1 for data), where each stereotype is listed along with the total number of persons who submitted the stereotype. We further list the number of persons from a specific identity group (region, gender, religion, and case) that submitted each stereotype. The regions in the dataset are the regions we distributed surveys in (West urban, West suburban, East urban, etc.). The gender identities included are male and female, as respondents either identified as male, female or declined to identify. We note that no personally identifiable information of each individual respondent is available in the dataset, as we only provide aggregated information about individual stereotypes. The SPICE dataset is released at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/SPICE.

### Dataset Characteristics

Diverse Participant BaseAs discussed in Section 4, in our attempt to maximize the diversity of our participant pool along different socio-economically salient categories in India, we distributed our surveys to students attending public universities. As such, 92.5% of our participant pool identified as being in the 18-24 years age range. While 64.4% were in undergraduate or graduate general degree programs (in commerce, science, psychology etc.), 21.4% were engaged in professional degree tracks such as engineering, and medical sciences. 52% participants identified as female and 42% identified as male, and the remaining chose not to answer the question or declined to self identify their gender. The range of languages known by the pool of participants included Punjabi, Oriya, Tamil, and Hindi. 6% participants self identified as Scheduled Castes, 4% as Scheduled Tribes, 25% as Other Backward Classes, and 55% as General Category. Further, the regional diversity of participants was ensured by design, since we distribute the surveys to urban and suburban regions in different parts of the country.

Increased Number and Diversity of Identities in StereotypesSince we collect stereotypes in SPICE using free form text-based surveys, the stereotypes collected can be about any identity of a person. This community-engaged and open-ended approach uncovers stereotypes for about 500 additional identity terms over other complementary approaches using dictionary-based [5], and LLM-parthered strategies [22], which in total collect stereotypes of 27 identity terms. With such high diversity of identities, the number of stereotypes collected is also greater. We approximate the 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

identities, which are not explored or known in model evaluation tools. Due to its open-ended survey structure, SPICE captured some of these stereotypes for the first time. For instance, stereotypes are present in SPICE about "_Muslim women_" being oppressed, and conservative, "_Kashmi pandits_" being victims, and "_Brahmin women_" being beautiful, etc., where the identity terms combine ethnicity, religion, gender, and caste.

## 6 Evaluations with SPICE

SPICE dataset contains stereotypes across different axes of identity and disparity as we see in Section 5. The dataset generated can thus be utilized for the evaluation of language models, as well as underlying text datasets for harmful stereotypes in Indian society.

### Underlying Text Analysis using SPICE

The stereotypes collected in SPICE are in the English language. We investigate if the tuples that constitute each stereotype are also present contextually in underlying data that large language models are often trained on. We use a recent Wikipedia dump, which is part of the C4 dataset [18], and is commonly used for training models. In Table 3, we list some stereotypes in SPICE and the number of instances the identity and attribute term co-occurred in the same sentence. It is important to note that this number is a lower bound, in that they may have co-occurred more times if we account for the different word forms of each term. This prevalence of tuples from SPICE in a part of the training data of models indicates the need to evaluate the models themselves for any learned stereotypical predictions.

### Benchmark Evaluations using SPICE

Benchmarked evaluations of fairness in language models often rely on individual tasks such as question answering or natural language inference (NLI), where stereotypical or disparate decisions for different identity groups are measured. Prominently, most such evaluations are limited to stereotypes present in the West or about the West [23, 27, 47], or contain an incremental increase for the specific context of Indian society [29, 5, 22]. Our dataset with increased representation of identities and stereotypes prevalent in Indian society allows for an expansion of our evaluations. We demonstrate this utilizing the NLI-based measurement of stereotyping [16]. This task comprises of two sentences, a premise (P) and a hypothesis (H), one of which contains the identity term (for e.g., "_Punjabi_") and the other contains the attribute term (for e.g. "_alcoholic_"), such as:

P: The _Punjabi_ person bought a cake.; H: The _alcoholic_ person bought a cake.

The task is to determine if the hypothesis is entailed, or contradicted by the premise or is neutral to it. Given that the attribute of alcoholism of the person cannot be determined in the premise, the classification should be "Neutral". A classification of "Entailment" indicates stereotypical association, and the higher the fraction of entailed sentence pairs, the more the stereotypical associations made by the respective model. For this evaluation, we identify some axes of disparity as it emerged from the SPICE dataset, such as caste-based, regional, or religion-based stereotypes, and evaluate some common, open source, 3 pre-trained language models [28, 26, 14, 44].We only use the stereotypes from SPICE for each respective axis that appears among the top 500 most occurring stereotypes in the dataset. We adopt this step as a loose proxy of prevalence in society.We note here that any of the measurements cannot indicate the absence of a specific stereotype or harm. They can merely mark if the stereotype is present and alert for necessary mitigations to be made.

Table 3: Sample stereotypes in SPICE and their co-occurence counts in Wikipedia text.

State, ethnic, and regional stereotypes.India is constituted of 28 states and 8 union territories, and state belonging in India is often associated with also identifying with specific language(s), and cultural practices and customs.Several clusters of states are also colloquially considered as regions within India, and people belonging to those states are clumped together into one identity, such as "_South Indians_", or "_North East Indians_", also associated with stereotypical generalizations. In Table 10, we has seen how different regions are perceived stereotypically in other regions. Using the NLI-based measurement, we compare bias measured using regional stereotypes collected for India in other datasets [5, 22] with and without utilizing stereotypes in SPICE. In table 4 we see an increase in stereotypical inferences made when regional stereotypes from SPICE data are added to other existing lists of stereotypes for Indian states and regions. These stereotypes would be undetected without expansion of current evaluations. Some examples of stereotypes uniquely present in SPICE that occurred as entailments across all models are also listed in Table 4.

Caste and occupation.Caste is a hereditary system of social stratification based on the occupational divides between different groups of people, wherein a person is born into a specific class or group within the system. While casteist practices and discrimination are illegal, stereotypical associations based solely on hereditary belonging to a caste category continue. Table 5 demonstrates how these stereotypes leak into model inferences, leading to frequent stereotypical decisions. It also lists examples of stereotypes that occurred as entailments across all models tested. We note in the examples that some caste generalizations are encoded linguistically as well. For instance, "Baniya" which literally means trader, is both an occupation and a caste category common in Northern and Western parts of India, and can be used stereotypically.

Religious stereotypes.A variety of religious practices and beliefs are present in India, with the most populous religions being Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikishism. India does not have a state religion and is constitutionally secular. However, historic battles, colonial occupation, and land disputes have resulted in tensions, disparities, and stereotypical generalizations about different religious communities [34]. Table 5 demonstrates the reflection of these religion-based stereotypes as collected in SPICE, in model decisions, and also lists example stereotypes that were entailed by all models.

The evaluations using SPICE for all three axes of regional, caste and occupation, and religion-based stereotypes show their presence and pervasiveness in English language models. They also demonstrate that without the inclusion of such locally situated stereotypes, our current evaluations are leaving significant stereotyping harms unchecked in models. While SPICE contributes an extensive list of

such stereotypes in the Indian societal context, it is not exhaustive and further work needs to be done for greater coverage. Similarly, deeper investigation of marginalization and stereotyping are critical to be conducted for other regions underrepresented in existing evaluation resources.

### Analyzing Offensive Stereotypes in SPICE

Recent work [22] composed a list of 1800 attributes which when used in a generalization about an identity, constitute offensive stereotypes. This list was composed by getting three way human annotations for each attribute on a Likert scale ranging between 'Extremely offensive' denoted by a value of 4 to 'Not offensive at all' denoted by a value of -1. The aggregate of these annotation scores was taken as the offensiveness score, where higher the score, the more offensive the attribute. We use this list to identify offensive stereotypes in SPICE, which contains approximately 1400 attributes. There is an overlap of 217 attributes in SPICE, such as "_aggressive_", or "_terrorist_", and we list some stereotypes from SPICE and their perceived offensiveness using [22] in table 6. Using this list of offensive attributes, and the stereotypes in SPICE whose attributes are present in it, the average offensiveness of stereotypes in SPICE is 0.129. When we disentangle this number to understand the offensiveness of stereotypes about individual communities, we see a large disparity. For instance, for "_Brahmins_", the average offensiveness of stereotypes in SPICE is -0.74, while for "_Dalits_" and "_Scheduled castes_" is 2.33. Similarly, for religious communities of "_Hindus_", "_Sikhs_", "_Muslims_", and "_Christians_", the average offensiveness is -0.5, 0.67, 2.71, and 0.33 respectively (word lists used for this analysis in Appendix B.2). We visually depict this disparate offensiveness of stereotypes for different identities along caste, religion, and region in Figure 1.

Additionally, the difference in offensive associations with various communities is much wider, as this analysis does not cover all possible offensive stereotypes present in SPICE. Many offensive stereotypes are contextual to India and consist of unique attributes, whose offensiveness has not been measured in existing databases. For instance, dark skin color has negative associations in India [30], with offensive and derogatory regional terms used as attributes in stereotypes such as "_kaalu_". Similarly, the word "_chink_" and its derivatives, 4 which is an offensive racial slur and used derogatorily to imply East Asian facial features is also used as an attribute in some stereotypes collected in SPICE, and associated with North East Indians and Nepali persons. Some other such attribute words with very derogatory and offensive connotations collected in SPICE include "_Bhangi_", 5 and "_untouchable_" which were associated with Dalit caste persons. This indicates the need for a deeper study of offensive associations, with a broader representation of cultural, moral, and historical differences across the world. We leave this to future work to build on SPICE and other such datasets which are socio-culturally inclusive.

## 7 Discussion and Limitations

In this work, we demonstrate the pivotal role community engagements play in diversifying the datasets that are at the crux of evaluations of harm in generative AI. Our dataset is composed of over 2000 stereotypes for different identity terms across gender, region, ethnicity, religion, and caste. This dataset presents unique stereotypes that are salient in the Indian context, and present in inferences made by language models. A vast majority of the stereotypes contained in this dataset were not covered by different dictionary, generation, and annotation-based efforts, which were limited in the diversity of perspectives included in building respective datasets. However, these stereotypes

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline
**Attribute** & **Offensiveness Score** & **Associated Identities** \\ \hline gangster & 4 & Haryanyi, Uttar Pradesh \\ criminal & 4 & Bihari \\ violent & 3.67 & Jaat, Muslim \\ poor & 3.33 & Indians, Scheduled castes (SC), Scheduled tribes (ST) \\ aggressive & 3.33 & Guijar, Jaat, Delhiites/Delhi, male \\ conservative & -0.33 & elderly, Muslim women, South Indians \\ respected & -1 & Brahmins \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Some offensive stereotypes collected in SPICE.

were reflected both in underlying datasets commonly used to train English language models, and in the model inferences themselves. This demonstrates the importance of community engaged efforts in expanding stereotype resources to be more representative of different socio-cultural contexts. While in this work, we explore the expansion of stereotype evaluation resources geo-culturally, this approach can be used for other evaluations on the harms and usability of models. We propose using the methodology of engaging with communities, complimentary to LLM-generated or other scalable human-in-loop methods, to build robust model safety evaluations [15].

Limitations and Broader ImpactStereotypes are inherently socially situated and subject to each individual's experiences. This subjectivity is reflected in any list of stereotypes collected or annotated, wherein an individual deigns a stereotype as present in society if they have experienced it or know of it. While engaging with a larger number of people and communities expands the perspectives about the stereotypes prevalent in society, the absence of a stereotype in the list collected does not imply or ensure that the stereotype does not exist in society. Our list thus, is still incomplete at reflecting all of the Indian society and stereotypes therein, and _should not be used for claims about model usability across India_. Rather, it should only be used to evaluate models for the specific stereotypes discussed in it. Further, evaluations computed with this dataset can still be limited for specific use cases, and additional analysis such as toxicity measurements, equitable representation of different identities, or even supplementary stereotype evaluations may need to be performed.

In this work, we only work with English language text, and stereotypes written in English. This is a major limiting factor as India has high linguistic diversity with limited people using English, which is often also associated with privilege and socio-economic status. Multi-lingual efforts are paramount to reflect some stereotypes present only within specific cultures, as not all of them can be translated into English accurately. Reaching out to some communities may also require deeper engagement through workshops in local languages. Further, we also limit the study to only certain regions and states in India due to logistical feasibility. Other regions such as North East India that experiences unique mechanisms of marginalization, states, and locales within them need to be included for holistic representation. A significant design choice in this study was collection of data in government run or aided universities, which ensures diverse representation in different axes of identities such as gender, and caste. However, this did limit representation of different age groups in the data collected, due to which many stereotypes present in Indian society may not have been captured in this dataset. We leave these parts of our study and data collection to future work.

The dataset created contains common stereotypes in India that can otherwise be unknown in the rest of the world and could be mistakenly perpetuated in models. While we create this resource solely for the purpose of evaluation of generative models deployed in different contexts, it is possible that it can be used for malicious or inadvertently harmful purposes. To avoid unintentional misuse, we recommend users read through the intended usage of this data as presented in our data card (released with dataset above) before utilization or sharing of this resource. Furthermore, to mitigate intentional malicious use, we will be providing the dataset with appropriate guardrails for access.

Figure 1: Average offensiveness of stereotypes associated with different identities, as perceived by attributes in SPICE that have offensiveness estimation in existing resources. The line ‘Average’ denotes the average offensiveness of all attributes present in SPICE. Identities ‘Bihari’, ‘Muslim’, and ‘Dalit’ have the most offensive stereotypes on average in the dataset.

## Appendix A Dataset Details

### Data

The dataset is released at https://github.com/google-research-datasets/SPICE and is accompanied by the data card, which specifies intended usage, data collection details, and more.

### Dataset Sample

Table 7 lists some example stereotypes that were commonly submitted by respondents in the survey.

### Payment to Participants

Every participant was paid 1000 INR for participating in the survey. The estimated time for completing the survey is half hour or less. 6

Footnote 6: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_minimum_wage

### Survey Response Validity Criteria

When any one of these conditions prevailed for more than 2 stereotypes in a response, then the response was considered invalid and rejected:

* If the respondent repeated the same stereotypes as in instructional videos, response was rejected.
* If the identity word mentioned was a thing, place, or an animal, even then the response was disqualified, as stereotypes should be about a person or a group of people only.
* If the respondent mentioned synonyms, like Advocate are Lawyers or Gardner is Mali; Mothers are women; Pharmacists are Chemists, again the response was rejected.
* If respondent entered words that were not words but random keyboard entries such as "_///_".

The number of valid responses collected per region are listed in Table 8.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Identity** & Gujaratis & Marwadis & Hindus & Brahmins \\

\end{table}
Table 7: Some example stereotypes collected in SPICE. These include stereotypes are state belonging, religious and ethnic identities.

### Data Cleaning Steps

To clean the survey responses, we edit sentences into identity and attribute phrases manually.

Some words are automatically standardized as listed below. The word in bold is the word that all words in the line were updated to.

**Punjabi**: Punjabi, Punjabis

**South Indian**: South Indian, South Indians

**Female**: Female, Females, Aurat

**Woman**: Women, Woman, Women, Women, womenn

**Girl**: Girls, Girl, Girls like, Girls,

**Inauspicious**: Apshagun

**Uttar Pradesh**: Up, UP, U.P people, Uttar Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh

**Mochi**: Mochi, Moji

**Inauspicious**: Apshagun

## Appendix B Word Lists

All word lists were considered in a case insensitive way and matching with the stereotypes was also done without case matching.

### Dataset Tagging using Word Lists

Gender: male, female, girl, boy, women, men, woman, man, boys, girls, females, males, nonbinary, transgender

### Word Lists for Offensive Stereotype Analysis

Annotations for offensiveness of attributes in stereotypes collected from existing work [22] and their respective dataset (https://github.com/google-research-datasets/seegull, Creative Commons license, and intended usage of evaluation of data and models).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Region & State & Type & \# Respondents \\ \hline West & Maharashtra & Urban & 90 \\  & & Suburban & 80 \\ \hline East & Orissa & Urban & 87 \\  & & Suburban & 69 \\ \hline South & Andhra Pradesh & Urban & 89 \\  & & Suburban & 72 \\ \hline North & Delhi & Urban & 93 \\  & Haryana & Surburban & 75 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Regions of survey distribution and data collection: # respondents refers to the number of surveys that were accepted as complete, with at least 5 non-noisy stereotypes submitted.

Word lists used for analysis of offensive stereotypes from SPICE are listed below. The identity words were specified by us to retrieve stereotypes for respective groups and communities. The attribute words are the ones that were part of the stereotypes retrieved as a result.

**Identity words:** Brahmin, Brahmins, Dalit, Dalits, SC, ST, Hindu, Hindus, Muslim, Muslims, Islam, Christian, Christians, Christianity, Sikh, Sikhs, Sikhism.

All stereotypes in SPICE with these identity words were considered for this analysis. The attributes in the stereotypes were used to compute offensive score [22].

## Appendix C Data and Analysis

### Gender Stereotypes in Data

Some examples of gender stereotypes as submitted by male and female identifying participants are listed in Table 9.

### Regional Stereotypes in Data

Table 10 illustrates stereotypes about other regions ("_North India_", "_North East India_", etc.) as volunteered by participants located in a given region.

## Appendix D Code, External Data, and License

All experiments and analysis in this work is done on a Google Colab CPU. Since the datasets, and models used are relatively small, greater compute is not needed.

The code used in this work for demonstrating the utility of SPICE dataset in evaluating models is adapted from existing code base.We use the task of NLI stereotype evaluations through https://github.com/sunipa/On-Measuring-and-Mitigating-Biased-Inferences-of-Word-Embeddings (work cited as stated by authors). This work and the word lists provided by authors for this task are available by Creative Commons license.

This code is used with BART, RoBERTa, XLNET, and ELECTRA in the work. These models, already fine tuned on SNLI [10] and MultiNLI [43] datasets and available from HuggingFace. The attached code document (Spice code.pdf) details the exact models called from HuggingFace, their paths, and how these models were called. We will make this available publicly via a GitHub link on publication.

The datasets used for comparison of SPICE in Sections 5, and sec 6 are from papers [5] and [22], and are also available by Apache license 2.0. Additionally, we use their data cards to ensure adherence to intended usage of their data, which is evaluation of models.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline
**Region** & **Stereotype** \\ \hline North & North East Indian: Chinese, chinki, Nepali; South Indian; dark skinned, engineer \\ South & North Indian: athlete, brave \\ West & North Indian: migrant; North East Indian: Nepali, Chinese; South Indian: intelligent, Christian \\ East & North Indian: casteist; North East Indian: not Indian, Chinese; South Indian: dark, intelligent \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10: Some stereotypes captured in each region about people belonging to other regions of the country. Here, ‘region’ refers to the where a stereotype was collected in.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c||c|c} \hline
**Participant** & **Identity** & **Attributes** \\ \hline Female & Female & bad driver, housewife, nurturing, inferior \\  & Male & dominant, don’t cry \\ Male & Female & nurse, housework \\  & Male & strong, doctor, sports \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
