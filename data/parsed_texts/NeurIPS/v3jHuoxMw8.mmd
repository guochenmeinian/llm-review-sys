###### Abstract

Vision-language navigation (VLN) requires an agent to execute actions following human instructions. Existing VLN models are optimized through expert demonstrations by supervised behavioural cloning or incorporating manual reward engineering. While straightforward, these efforts overlook the accumulation of errors in the Markov decision process, and struggle to match the distribution of the expert policy. Going beyond this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (Enp) to model the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model. At each step, low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most likely to perform, and vice versa. Theoretically, the optimization objective is equivalent to minimizing the forward divergence between the occupancy measure of the expert and ours. Consequently, Enp learns to globally align with the expert policy by maximizing the likelihood of the actions and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states in a collaborative manner. With a variety of VLN architectures, Enp achieves promising performances on R2R, REVERIE, RxR, and R2R-CE, unleashing the power of existing VLN models.

## 1 Introduction

Vision-language navigation (VLN) [1] entails an embodied agent that executes a sequence of actions to traverse complex environments based on natural language instructions. VLN is typically considered as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) [2], where future states are determined only by the current state and current action without explicit rewards. Therefore, the central challenge for VLN is to learn an effective navigation policy. In this context, existing neural agents [1, 3, 4, 5, 6] are naturally constructed as data-driven policy networks by imitation learning (IL) [7] and bootstrapping from expert demonstrations, _i.e._, ground-truth trajectories [1].

Most VLN models [1, 3, 8, 4, 5, 6] utilize behavioural cloning (BC), a classic approach for IL, through supervised training. While conceptually simple, BC suffers seriously from quadratic accumulation errors [9, 10] along the trajectory due to covariate shift, especially in partially observable settings. Several efforts introduce'student-forcing' [1, 11] and 'pseudo interactive demonstrator' [6], which are essentially online versions of DAgger[12], to alleviate this distribution mismatch. DAgger assumes interactive access to expert policies (_i.e._, the shortest path from current state to the goal2) and reduces to linear expected errors [12, 10]. Some other studies [13, 3, 8, 4, 5] combine reinforcement learning (RL) [14] and IL algorithms to mitigate the limitations of BC. Though effective, it presents challenges in designing an optimal reward function [15] and demands careful manual reward engineering. Such reward functions may not be robust to changes in the environment dynamics andstruggle to generalize well across diverse scenes [16]. In addition, recent research [6] has revealed that training transformer [17]-based VLN models using RL would introduce instability.

From a probabilistic view, most VLN agents [1; 3; 4; 6] essentially train a discriminative action classifier [8; 3; 4], and model the action distribution conditioned on current navigation state \(P(a|s)\) at each time step (Fig. 1). This classifier is supervised by the cross-entropy loss to minimize 1-step deviation error of single-step decision along trajectories [18]. However, the prediction of current action affects future states during the global execution of the learned policy, potentially leading to catastrophic failures [9; 12]. In other words, solely optimizing the conditional action probabilities (_i.e._, policy) remains unclear for the underlying reasons of the expert behaviour, yet fails to exploit complete information in the state-action distribution \(P(s,a)\) induced by the expert [14].

In light of this, we propose an Energy-based Navigation Policy (Enp) framework that addresses the limitations of current policy learning in VLN from an energy perspective (Fig. 1). Energy-based models (EBMs) [19] are flexible and capable of modeling expressive distributions, as they impose minimal restrictions on the tractability of the normalizing constant (partition function) [20]. We reinterpret the VLN model as an energy-based model to learn the expert policy from the expert demonstrations. Specifically, Enp models the joint distribution of state-action pairs, _i.e._, \(P(s,a)\), by energy function, and assigns low energy values to the state-action pairs that the expert mostly performs. For optimization, this energy function is regarded as the unnormalized log-density of joint distribution, which can be decomposed into the standard cross-entropy of action prediction and marginal distribution of the states \(P(s)\). During training, Enp introduces persistent contrastive divergence [21; 22] to estimate the expectation of \(P(s)\), and samples by Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics [23]. In this way, Enp simulates the expert by maximizing the likelihood of the action and incorporates prior knowledge of VLN by optimizing state marginal distribution in a collaborative manner, thereby leveraging the benefits of both energy-based and discriminative approaches.

Theoretically, the training objective of Enp is to maximize the expected \(\log\)-likelihood function over the joint distribution \(P(s,a)\). This is equivalent to estimating the unnormalized probability density (_i.e._, energy) of the expert's occupancy measure [15; 24; 25]. Therefore, Enp performs prioritized optimization for entire trajectories rather than the single-time step decisions in BC, and achieves a global alignment with the expert policy. Furthermore, we realize that Enp is closely related to Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) [7; 26; 15]. For the optimized objective, Enp shares similarities with IRL but minimizes the forward KL divergence [27; 28] between the occupancy measures.

For thorough examination (SS4), we explore Enp across several representative VLN architectures [3; 4; 6; 29]. Experimental results demonstrate that Enp outperforms the counterparts, _e.g._, \(\mathbf{2}\%\) SR and \(\mathbf{1}\%\) SPL gains over R2R [1], \(\mathbf{1.22}\%\) RGS on REVERIE [30], \(\mathbf{2}\%\) SR on R2R-CE [31], and \(\mathbf{1.07}\%\) NDTW on RxR-CE [32], respectively. Enp not only helps release the power of existing VLN models, but also evidences the merits of energy-based approaches in the challenging VLN decision-making.

## 2 Related Work

**Vision-Language Navigation (VLN).** Early VLN agents [1; 13; 3; 33] are built upon a recurrent neural policy network within a sequence-to-sequence framework [34; 35] to predict action distribution.

Figure 1: Comparison of behavioural cloning (BC) and Enp for VLN. Previous methods use BC to optimize the conditional action distribution directly. Enp models the joint state-action distribution through an energy-based model. The low energy values correspond to the state-action pairs that the expert is most likely to perform.

As compressing all history into a hidden vector might be sub-optimal for state tracking across extended trajectories, later attempts [36; 37; 6; 38] incorporate a memory buffer (_e.g._, topological graph) for long-term planning. Recent efforts [39; 5; 4] are devoted to encode complete episode history of navigation states and actions by transformer [17] and optimize the whole model in end-to-end training. Later, various strategies have been proposed to improve the generalization of policies in both seen and unseen environments [3; 8; 40; 41], such as progress estimation [42], instruction generation [33; 43; 44; 45; 46], backtracking [47], cross-modal matching [48; 49], self-supervised pre-training [50; 51; 52], environmental augmentation [3; 53; 54; 55], visual landmarks [56; 57], exploration [58; 59], map building [60; 61; 62; 63], waypoint prediction [64], and foundation models [65; 66].

**Policy Learning in VLN.** VLN can be viewed as a _POMDP_[2], providing several expert demonstrations sourced from ground-truth shortest-path trajectories [1; 30] or human demonstrations [32]. Behavioural cloning (BC) [67; 68], a typical approach of imitation learning (IL) [7; 15], is widely used in current VLN agents [1; 33; 4; 6] with supervised policy learning. Nevertheless, it suffers from distribution shifts between training and testing [12; 69]. [1] introduces'student-forcing' [11] training regime from sequence prediction to mitigate this limitation. Later agents [3; 8; 4; 5] combine both IL and model-free RL [14; 70] for policy learning, where the reward function is manually designed on the distance metric. Instead of directly mapping visual observations into actions or state-action values, [13; 71] investigate model-based RL [72; 73] for look-ahead planning, exploring the potential future states. As reward engineering requires careful manual tuning, [16] proposes to learn reward functions from the expert distribution directly. Although RL is an effective approach in principle, DUET [6] finds it difficult to train large-scale transformers with inaccurate and sparse RL rewards [74] in VLN. Existing studies [61; 62; 63] use an interactive demonstrator (similar to DAgger[12]) to generate additional pseudo demonstrations and achieve promising performance.

In this paper, Enp learns to align with the expert policy by matching the joint state-action distribution for entire trajectories from the occupancy measure view. Furthermore, Enp reinterprets the optimization of policy into an energy-based model, representing an expressive probability distribution.

**Energy-based Model.** Energy-based models (EBMs) [19] are non-normalized probabilistic models that represent data using a Boltzmann distribution. In EBMs, each sample is associated with an energy value, where high-density regions correspond to lower energy [75]. A range of MCMC-based [76; 21] and MCMC-free [77; 78] approaches can be adopted to estimate the gradient of the \(\log\)-likelihood. EBMs have been widely utilized in generation [22], perception [79], and policy learning [80; 81]. The most related work [25; 24; 22] will be discussed below. [25] employs EBM for distribution matching, strictly prohibiting interaction with the environment. Moreover, this approach is applied in an offline setting, specifically for healthcare. [24] considers the expert energy as the reward function and leverages this reward for reinforcement learning. [22] adopts parameterized energy functions to model the conditional action distribution, optimizing for actions that minimize the energy landscape.

In contrast, Enp devotes to learning the joint distribution of state-action pairs from the expert demonstrations online. An external marginal state memory is introduced to store the historical information for initializing the samples for next iterations. Enp demonstrates the potential of EBMs in VLN decision-making, and improves the existing VLN agents across various frameworks.

## 3 Method

In this section, we first formalize the VLN task and discuss the limitations of existing work from a probabilistic view (SS3.1). Then we introduce Energy-based Navigation Policy learning framework - Enp (SS3.2). Furthermore, Enp is compared with other imitation learning methods based on divergence minimization (SS3.3). Finally, we provide the implementation details (SS3.4).

### Problem Formulation

VLN is typically formulated as a POMDP [2; 51] with a finite horizon \(T\), defined as the tuple \(<\)\(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathcal{T},\mathcal{R}\), \(\rho_{0}\)\(>\). \(\mathcal{S}\) is the navigation state space. \(\mathcal{A}\) is the action space. Note that we use panoramic action space [33], which encodes high-level behaviour. The transition distribution \(\mathcal{T}(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a_{t})\) (Markov property) of the environment, the reward function \(\mathcal{R}(s_{t},a_{t})\), and the initial state distribution \(\rho_{0}\) are unknown in VLN and \(\mathcal{T}\) can only be queried through interaction with the environment.

In the standard VLN setting [1], a training dataset \(\mathcal{D}=\{(x,\tau)\}\) consists of pairs of the language instructions \(x\) and corresponding expert trajectories \(\tau\). At step \(t\), the agent acquires an egocentric observation \(O_{t}\), and then takes an action \(a_{t}\in\mathcal{A}\) from \(K_{t}\) candidates based on the instruction \(x\). The agent needs to learn a navigation policy \(\pi^{*}(a|s)\) and predict the action distribution \(P(a_{t}|\bm{s}_{t})\).

Recent VLN agents employ Seq2Seq [8; 3] or transformer-based networks [4; 6] as a combination of a cross-modal state encoder \(\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{s}}\) and a conditional action classifier \(\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{a}}\) for action prediction. Hence they are usually built as a composition of \(\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{s}}\circ\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{a}}\). There are different state representations in previous work [51; 4], here we define a more general one. The cross-modal state encoder extracts a joint state representation \(\bm{s}_{t}=\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{s}}(\bm{x},\bm{O}_{t},\bm{H}_{t})\in \mathbb{R}^{K_{t}\times D}\) by the visual embedding \(\bm{O}_{t}\), the instruction embedding \(\bm{x}\), and history embedding \(\bm{H}_{t}\) along the trajectory \(\tau\). Concretely, \(\bm{H}_{t}\) comes from recurrent hidden units of Seq2Seq framework or an external memory module (_e.g._, topological graph [6]). Then, the action classifier maps the state representation \(\bm{s}_{t}\) into an action-related vector \(\bm{a}_{t}=\{\bm{a}_{t}[k]\}_{k=1}^{K_{t}}\in\mathbb{R}^{K_{t}}\), _i.e._, \(\bm{a}_{t}=\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{s}}(\bm{s}_{t})\), and \(\bm{a}_{t}[k]\) is termed as the logit for \(k\)-th action candidate. Then the probability of \(a_{t,k}\) is computed by softmax, _i.e._, \(P(a_{t,k}|\bm{s}_{t})=\frac{\exp(\bm{a}_{t}[k])}{\sum_{k=1}^{K}\exp(\bm{a}_{t} [k])}\).

The cross-modal state encoder \(\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{a}}\) and action classifier \(\mathcal{F}_{\bm{\theta}_{a}}\) usually employ a joint end-to-end training. Imitation learning (IL) aims to learn the policy from expert demonstrations \(\mathcal{D}\) without any reward signals. Behaviour cloning (BC) [68] is a straightforward approach of IL by maximizing likelihood estimation of \(\pi^{*}(a|s)\), _i.e._, minimizing the cross-entropy loss in a supervised way:

\[\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{\theta}}-\mathbb{E}[\log\pi^{*}(a|s)]\to \mathcal{L}_{\pi}=\sum\nolimits_{(x,\tau)\sim\mathcal{D}}\sum\nolimits_{t}- \log P_{\bm{\theta}}(a_{t}|\bm{s}_{t}),\] (1)

where \(\bm{\theta}=\bm{\theta}_{s}\cup\bm{\theta}_{a}\). BC suffers from the covariate shift problem for the crucial _i.i.d._ assumption, as the execution of \(a_{t}\) will affect the distribution of future state \(\bm{s}_{t+1}\)[9]. Inspired by DAgger[12], some agents [1; 6] query the shortest paths (by expert policy \(\pi^{\text{e}}\)) during navigation, explore more trajectories \(\{\tau^{+}\}\) by interacting with the environments, and aggregate these trajectories as \(\mathcal{D}^{+}=\{(x,\tau)\}\cup\{(x,\tau^{+})\}\). Then, the policy is updated by mixing iterative learning [12]. However, these traditional approaches ignore the changes in distribution and train a policy that performs well under the distribution of states encountered by the expert. When the agent navigates in the unseen environment and receives different observations than expert demonstrations, it will lead to a compounding of errors, as they provide no way to understand the underlying reasons for the expert behaviour [27].

### Energy-based Expert Policy Learning

Instead of solely training the discriminative action classifier at each step, we want to learn a policy \(\pi^{*}\) by exploiting the complete information in the state-action distribution from the expert policy \(\pi^{\text{e}}\). To facilitate later analysis, the occupancy measure \(\rho^{\pi}(s,a)\) of the policy \(\pi\) is introduced [14]. \(\rho^{\pi}(s,a)\) denotes the stationary distribution of state-action pairs \((s,a)\) when an agent navigates with policy \(\pi\) in the environment, defined as:

\[\rho^{\pi}(s,a)\triangleq\pi(a|s)\sum\nolimits_{t}P(s_{t}=s|\pi)=\sum \nolimits_{t}P(s_{t}=s,a_{t}=a),\] (2)

and \(\rho^{\pi}(s,a)\) has a one-to-one relationship with policy \(\pi\): \(\rho^{\pi}=\rho^{\pi^{*}}\Leftrightarrow\pi=\pi^{*}\)[15]. Therefore, we induce a policy \(\pi^{*}\) with \(\rho^{*}(s,a)\) that matches the expert \(\rho^{\text{e}}(s,a)\) based on the joint distribution of state-action pairs \(P(s,a)\). \(t\) is omitted for brevity. The matching loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\rho}\) is designed as:

\[\operatorname*{arg\,min}-\mathbb{E}_{(s,a)\sim\rho^{\pi}(s,a)}[\log\rho^{*}(s, a)]\propto\mathcal{L}_{\rho}=-\sum\nolimits_{(x,\tau)\sim\mathcal{D}}\log P_{ \bm{\theta}}(s,a).\] (3)

Then we reformulate it from an energy view, as energy-based models (EBMs) [19; 79] parameterize an unnormalized data density and can represent a more expressive probability distribution. Specifically,

Figure 2: Overview of Enp. At each step \(t\), the agent acquires a series of observations, and predicts the next step based on the instruction and navigation history. Enp optimizes the marginal state matching loss \(\mathcal{L}_{S}\) through SGLD sampling from Marginal State Memory (Eq. 9), and minimizes the cross-entropy loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\pi}\) jointly (Eq. 1).

Experiment

We examine the efficacy of Enp for VLN in discrete environments (SS4.1), and more challenging continuous environments (SS4.2). Then we provide diagnostic analysis on core model design (SS4.3).

### VLN in Discrete Environments

**Datasets.** R2R [1] contains \(7,189\) shortest-path trajectories captured from \(90\) real-world building-scale scenes [87]. It consists of \(22\)K step-by-step navigation instructions. REVERIE [30] contains \(21,702\) high-level instructions, which requires an agent to reach the correct location and localize a remote target object. All these datasets are devided into _train_, _val seen_, _val unseen_, and _test unseen_ splits, which mainly focus on the generalization capability in unseen environments. Both R2R [1] and REVERIE [30] are built upon Matterport3D Simulator [1].

**Evaluation Metrics.** As in previous work [1, 30], Success Rate (SR), Trajectory Length (TL), Oracle Success Rate (OSR), Success rate weighted by Path Length (SPL), and Navigation Error (NE) are used for R2R. In addition, Remote Grounding Success rate (RGS) and Remote Grounding Success weighted by Path Length (RGSPL) are adopted for object grounding in REVERIE.

**Performance on R2R.** Table 1 demonstrates the numerical results of Enp with different frameworks on R2R. With Seq2Seq-style neural architectures, Enp provides \(\mathbf{1}\%\) SR and \(\mathbf{1}\%\) SPL gains over En-vDrop [3] on _val unseen_. Adopting Enp in transformer-based models leads to promising performance gains on _test unseen_, \(\mathbf{2}\%\) on SR with VLN\(\backslash\)BERT [4], and \(\mathbf{2}\%\) on SR with DUET [6]. The performance is still lower than BEVBert [61] and BSG [62] due to the additional semantic maps. Moreover, we provide the average success rate across different path lengths in Appendix (Fig. 4).

**Performance on REVERIE.** Table 2 presents the results of Enp with different transformer-based frameworks on REVERIE. Enp surpasses all the counterparts on both _val unseen_ and _test unseen_ by large margins, _e.g._, \(\mathbf{1}.34\%\) on SR and \(\mathbf{0}.6\%\) on RGS over VLN\(\backslash\)BERT [4], \(\mathbf{0}.68\%\) on SR and \(\mathbf{1}.22\%\) on RGS over DUET [6], verifying the efficacy of Enp. Inspired by recent efforts [61], potential improvement on object grounding can be achieved by introducing CLIP features [93].

**Qualitative Results.** In Fig. 3 (a), we illustrate the qualitative comparisons of Enp against DUET [6] on R2R _val unseen_. Based on Enp, our agent yields more accurate predictions than DUET. It verifies that Enp leads to better decision-making when facing challenging scenes. In Fig. 3 (b), our agent may fail due to the serious occlusion, and introducing map prediction [95] may alleviate this problem.

### Diagnostic Experiment

**Joint Distribution Matching.** We first investigate the joint distribution matching loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\pi}\) (Eq. 3) in Enp, which is factored as the discriminative action loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\pi}\) (Eq. 1) and the marginal state distribution matching loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\) (Eq. 7). Both of \(\mathcal{L}_{\pi}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\) are online optimized iteratively. A clear performance drop is observed in Table 5, _e.g._, SR from \(\bm{74\%}\) to \(72\%\) for DUET [6] on R2R, as only optimizing the conditional action distribution with \(\mathcal{L}_{\pi}\) will degenerate into BC (or DAGger) with cross-entropy loss. This reveals the appealing effectiveness of the joint distribution matching strategy in Enp.

**Step Size and Guassian Noise in SGLD.** In Enp, SGLD [23] is used to draw samples from Boltzmann distribution (Eq. 9) and further optimize \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathcal{S}}\). Following recent EBM training, we relax the restriction on the relation between the step size \(\epsilon\) and Gaussian noise \(\xi\), _i.e._, \(\text{Var}(\xi)=\epsilon\). Table 6 shows the results with different step sizes (when \(I=15\)), and changing \(\epsilon\) in a small range has little effects on the performance. In addition, different Enp is insensitive to parameter changes. We find that \(\epsilon\!=\!1.5\) and \(\xi\sim\mathcal{N}(0,0.01)\) for the transition kernel of SGLD works well across a variety of datasets and frameworks in VLN.

**Number of SGLD Loop per Training Step.** For the SGLD sampler, we study the influence of the number of inner loop iterations per training step. In Table 7, we can find that \(I=15\) iterations is enough to sample the recurrent states for EnvDrop [3] and VLN\(\circ\)BERT [4]. Slightly more iterations are required for the models [6; 29] with additional topological graph memory due to the global action space. This can be mitigated by pre-storing the samples in the Marginal State Memory \(\mathcal{M}\) during pre-training. As these frameworks [6; 29] employ pre-training and finetuning paradigm for VLN, we design a different number of iterations, _i.e._, \(I_{\text{pre}}=20\) and \(I_{\text{th}}=5\). It is worth noting that the state memory \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{pre}}\) can acquire the samples while performing single-step action prediction in the VLN pre-training. Thus, the SGLD iterations in finetuning based on \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{ft}}\)-\(\mathcal{M}_{\text{pre}}\) can be further reduced.

**Enp _vs._****AIRL.** In Table 8, we compare Enp against AIRL [27], which is a representative work of adversarial imitation learning. The objective function for Enp is equivalent to the forward KL divergence minimization, where \(\text{ENP}\) is the gradient of the backward KL divergence. By modifying the original policy learning in VLN\(\circ\)BERT [4] (a mixture of RL and IL) as an adversarial reward learning formulation, AIRL achieves the comparable performance. Enp yields better scores on R2R-CE with \(\bm{45\%}\) SR and \(\bm{40\%}\) SPL. Meanwhile, Enp avoids the potential influence from the adversarial training.

**Runtime Analysis.** The additional computational complexity of Enp is from the iterations of SGLD inner loop. Towards this, we make some specific designs, such as Marginal State Memory \(\mathcal{M}\) and pre-storing in pre-training. During inference, there is no additional computational consumption in executing the strategy compared to existing VLN agents.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Enp, an Energy-based Navigation Policy learning framework. By explicitly modeling the joint state-action distribution using an energy-based model, Enp shows promise to solve the intrinsic limitations of supervised behavioural cloning. Through maximizing the likelihood of the action prediction and modeling the dynamics of the navigation states jointly, Enp learns to minimize the divergence distance from the expert policy in a collaborative manner. Experimental results on gold-standard VLN datasets in both discrete (R2R and REVERIE) and continuous environments (R2R-CE and RxR-CE) demonstrate the superiority against existing methods. In the future, we will explore more tasks and frameworks with the energy-based policy.

### Model Details

**EnvDrop**[3] adopts an encoder-decoder model. The encoder is a bidirectional LSTM-RNN with an embedding layer. The decoder is an attentive LSTM-RNN. EnvDrop uses the \(2048\)-dimensional image features from ResNet-152 pretrained on ImageNet. The model is first trained with supervised learning via the mixture of imitation and reinforcement learning. Then, it is finetuned by back translation with environmental dropout. The word embedding size is \(256\) and the dimension of the action embedding is \(64\). The size of the LSTM units is set to \(512\) while \(256\) is set for the bidirectional LSTM. RMSprop [102] is employed to optimize the loss with a learning rate \(1\!\times\!10^{-4}\) and the batch size is set as \(64\).

**VLN\(\circ\)BERT**[4] is built upon LXMERT-like transformer [103]. It is trained directly on the mixture of the original training data and the augmented data from PREVALENT [51] for R2R [1]. AdamW optimizer [104] is used and the batch size is set to \(16\). For REVERIE [30], the image features are extracted by ResNet-152 pre-trained on Places365 [48], and the object features are encoded by Faster-RCNN pre-trained on Visual Genome [105].The batch size is set as \(8\).

**VLN\(\circ\)BERT for CE**[64] proposes a waypoint predictor to generate a set of candidate waypoints during navigation. The training objective is the cross-entropy loss between the ground-truth and action predictions. It is minimized by AdamW optimizer [104] with the learning rate \(1\!\times\!10^{-5}\) during training. The decay ratio is set as \(0.50\) for R2R-CE [31] and \(0.75\) for RxR-CE [32].

**DUET**[6] uses a dual-scale graph transformer initialized from LXMERT [103]. The hidden layer size is \(768\). The image features are extracted by ViT-B/16 [106] pretrained on ImageNet [107]. On REVERIE [30], DUET is first pre-trained with the batch size of \(32\). Some auxiliary tasks are employed, such as single-step action prediction, object grounding, masked language modeling, and masked region classification [5]. Then it is finetuned with the batch size of \(8\).

**ETPNav**[29] contains a topological mapping module and a waypoint prediction module [64]. It is pre-trained using proxy tasks following existing transformer-based VLN models [4, 6] with a batch size of \(64\) and a learning rate of \(5\!\times\!10^{-5}\). During finetuning, the AdamW optimizer [104] is utilized. The batch size is set as \(16\) with a learning rate of \(1\!\times\!10^{-5}\). The decay ratio is \(0.75\).

### Comparison Results across Different Path Lengths

In Fig. 4, Env demonstrates notable performance improvements over BC [6] across both _seen_ and _unseen_ splits of R2R [1]. When the length of ground-truth paths exceeds \(16\) meters, our Env outperforms BC by a significant margin in both the _val seen_ and _val unseen_ splits. In addition, the performance gains are relatively more significant in the _unseen_ split compared to the _seen_ split. For example, Env achieves approximately \(\textbf{5}\%\) improvement of SR on the _val seen_ and \(\textbf{6}\%\) improvement on the _val unseen_ for navigation paths longer than \(16\) meters.

### Discussion

**Terms of use, Privacy, and License.** R2R [1], REVERIE [30], R2R-CE [31], and RxR-CE [32] datasets utilized in our work contain a large number of indoor photos from Matterport3D [87],

which are freely available for non-commercial research purposes. No identifiable individuals are present in any of the photographs. All experiments are conducted on the Matterport3D and Habitat Simulators [1, 96], which are released under the MIT license.

**Limitations.** Existing studies in VLN mainly focus on improving the success rate of navigation, with limited attention given to collision avoidance and navigation safety. In addition, current agents are typically designed for static environments within simulators. To mitigate the risk of collisions, it is essential for robots to operate under specific security constraints. Therefore, further advancements are necessary to ensure safe deployment in real-world dynamic environments.

**Future Direction.** i) We explore Enp on several representative VLN architectures [3, 4, 6, 29], and the generalization of Enp to other architectures [63, 61] and more tasks [108] is not clear. We will verify it in future work. ii) Efficiently sampling from un-normalized distributions for high-dimensional data is a fundamental challenge in machine learning. Utilizing MCMC-free approaches [75, 109] and neural implicit samplers [110] may offer valuable insights to enhance our approach. One limitation of Enp is that the optimization through the SGLD inner loop at each training iteration (Algorithm 1), which would reduce the training efficiency (about 9% delay for 5 SGLD iterations). In practice, ENP balances performance and training time with a limited number of iterations. iii) In the future, agents should be able to actively acquire the skills by watching videos similar to humans [52], thereby reducing high training data (expert demonstrations) requirements.

**Broader Impacts.** We introduce an energy-based policy learning for VLN. Equipped with Enp, existing agents are able to perform comprehensive decision-making, showcasing promising improvements across various VLN benchmarks. In real-world deployment, the agent holds potential to significantly benefit society by providing assistance to individuals with specific needs, _e.g._, blind and disabled, enabling them to accomplish daily tasks more independently. In addition, we encourage more efforts devoted to policy learning for future research in the community.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See SS1. We include the paper's contributions and scope in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix A.3, we discuss the limitations of the work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: In SS3.2, we provide the details of our method.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Algorithm 1 and SS3.4, we provide the implementation details of our method. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [No] Justification: As we promised, the code will be released upon the publication of our paper. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In SS4 and Appendix A.1, we provide the training and test details for the experiment. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Table 1, 2, 3, and 4, we report error bars on VLN benchmarks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In SS3.4, we provide the details of the computer resources. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We acknowledge the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and obey them in our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix A.3, we discuss the broader impacts of our work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper is based on publicly available datasets and models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix A.3, we provide the details of the license and terms of use. We also use existing models as components and cite appropriately. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
