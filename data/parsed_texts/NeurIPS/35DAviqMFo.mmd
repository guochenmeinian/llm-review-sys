###### Abstract

Recent studies have put into question the belief that emergent abilities [58] in language models are exclusive to large models. This skepticism arises from two observations: 1) smaller models can also exhibit high performance on emergent abilities and 2) there is doubt on the discontinuous metrics used to measure these abilities. In this paper, we propose to study emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss, instead of model size or training compute. We demonstrate that the Transformer models with the same pre-training loss, but different model and data sizes, generate the same performance on various downstream tasks, with a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model architecture. We also discover that a model exhibits emergent abilities on certain tasks--regardless of the continuity of metrics--when its pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold. Before reaching this threshold, its performance remains at the level of random guessing. This inspires us to redefine emergent abilities as those that manifest in models with lower pre-training losses, highlighting that these abilities cannot be predicted by merely extrapolating the performance trends of models with higher pre-training losses.

## 1 Introduction

Scaling of language modes (LMs) on both model and data sizes has been shown to be effective for improving the performance on a wide range of tasks [42, 6, 23, 8, 65, 55, 36], leading to the widespread adoption of LM applications, e.g., ChatGPT. The success of such scaling is guided by scaling laws [22, 28, 10, 23], which study the predictability of pre-training loss given the model and data sizes.

While scaling laws focus on the pre-training loss, the scaling effect on the performance of downstream tasks has thus far less studied. Emergent abilities [58] are defined as abilities that present in larger LMs but not present in smaller one. The existence of such abilities is recently challenged for two reasons. First, small LMs trained on a sufficient amount of high-quality data can outperform large models on tasks with claimed emergent abilities [55, 56, 26]. For example, LLaMA-13B with less compute [55] can outperform GPT-3 (175B) on MMLU [21], due to more training tokens and improved data-filtering methods. Second, Schaeffer et al. [46] claim that emergent abilities appear due to the nonlinear or discontinuous metrics selected to evaluate certain datasets, rather than from a fundamental change in larger models.

The Chinchilla scaling laws [23] show that different combinations of model sizes and data sizes can lead to different pre-training losses even with the same training compute. Consequently, the pre-training loss can naturally better represent the learning status of LMs than the model or data sizes. However, the relationship between the loss of an LM and its performance on downstream tasks is not yet well understood. Existing literature has either focused on the transfer learning paradigm [33, 54] or constrained its study to single models, tasks, or prompting methods [49, 61].

In this work, we propose to study emergent abilities from the perspective of pre-training loss instead of model size or training compute. To examine the relationship between the pre-training loss of LMs and their performance, we pre-train more than 30 LMs of varied model and data sizes from scratch, using a fixed data corpus, tokenization, and model architecture. Their downstream performance is evaluated on 12 diverse datasets covering different tasks, languages, prompting types, and answer forms. We demonstrate that the pre-training loss of an LM is predictive of its performance on downstream tasks, regardless of its model size or data size. The generality of this conclusion is further verified by extracting and observing the performance and loss relationship of the open LLaMA [55] and Pythia [3] models.

Over the course, we find that performance on certain downstream tasks only improves beyond the level of random guessing when the pre-training loss falls below a specific threshold, i.e., emergent abilities. Interestingly, the loss thresholds for these tasks are the same. When the loss is above this threshold, performance remains at the level of random guessing, even though performance on other tasks continues to improve from the outset. To exclude the impact of discontinuous metrics [46; 61], we evaluate the emergent performance increase using continuous metrics and show that the emergent abilities persist across both discontinuous and continuous metrics.

Based on these observations, we define the emergent abilities of LMs from the perspective of pre-training loss: an ability is emergent if it is not present in language models with higher pre-training loss, but is present in language models with lower pre-training loss. According to the loss scaling laws [22; 28], the pre-training loss is a function of model size, data size, and training compute. Therefore, the new emergent abilities can also account for the previously-observed emergent abilities in terms of model size or training compute.

The advantage of the new definition lies in its ability to better capture the tipping points in training trajectories when LMs acquire emergent abilities. Once again [58], the existence of emergent abilities suggests that we cannot predict all the abilities of LMs by simply extrapolating the performance of LMs with higher pre-training loss. Further scaling the model and data size to lower the pre-training loss may enable new abilities that were not present in previous LMs.

## 2 Does Pre-training Loss Predict Task Performance?

We study the relationship between the performance of the language models (LMs) on 12 downstream tasks and the pre-training loss. We pre-train LMs of different model sizes (300M, 540M, 1B, 1.5B, 3B, 6B, and 32B) on varied numbers of tokens with fixed data corpus, tokenization, and architecture. In addition, we leverage the open LLaMA [55] models (7B, 13B, 33B, and 65B) to validate our observations.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Dataset** & **Task** & **Prompting Type** & **Answer Form** & **Metric** \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{c}{_English datasets_} \\ \hline TriviaQA [27] & Closed-book QA & Few-shot & Open-formed & EM \\ HellaSwag [64] & Commonsense NLI & Zero-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ RACE [31] & Reading Comprehension & Few-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ WinoGrande [44] & Coreference Resolution & Zero-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ MMLU [21] & Examination & Few-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ GSM8K [12] & Math Word Problem & Few-shot CoT & Open-formed & EM \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{c}{_Chinese datasets_} \\ \hline NLPCC-KBQA[15] & Closed-book QA & Few-shot & Open-formed & EM \\ ClozeT [63] & Commonsense NLI & Zero-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ CLUEWSC [62] & Coreference Resolution & Zero-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ C3 [52] & Reading Comprehension & Few-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ C-Eval [25] & Examination & Few-shot & Multi-choice & Accuracy \\ GSM8K-Chinese & Math Word Problem & Few-shot CoT & Open-formed & EM \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: English and Chinese datasets evaluated in the experiment, and their task types, prompting types, answer forms and metrics. For prompting type, we refer to the chain-of-thought prompting [59] as few-shot CoT and the original in-context learning prompting [6] as few-shot.

It is not straightforward that the loss of LMs decides the performance on downstream tasks. Generally the performance is decided by the probability to predict the ground truth \(y\) given the prompt \(x\), i.e. \(p(y|x)\). The probability can be written as a function of the cross entropy loss:

\[p(y|x)=\exp(-\ell(y|x))\] (1)

where \(\ell(y|x)\) is the cross entropy loss of the LM given the context \(x\) and the target \(y\). While \(\ell(y|x)\) has the same form as the pre-training loss \(L\), they are not equal. First, the pre-training loss is an average of all the tokens in all the documents pre-trained on. According to our empirical observation, the losses of different documents are not uniform. Second, if \(x\) and similar documents do not exist in the pre-training corpus, \(\ell(y|x)\) is the generalization loss, which is often related to other factors beyond the training loss, such as the model size. For example, in computer vision, a highly over-parameterized models often improve over an under-parameterized models in test performance when both models converge on the training data [14; 7].

### Pre-training Setting

All the models are pre-trained on a mixture of English and Chinese corpus. The ratio of English to Chinese is 4:1 in the pre-training corpus. The model architecture is similar to LLaMA [55] with two differences: we use grouped-query attention [1] to replace the multi-query attention and we apply rotary position embedding on half the dimensions of the query and key vectors. More details can be found in Appendix A.

### Evaluation Tasks

To present a comprehensive demonstration, we evaluate the pre-trained models on 12 datasets across different tasks and prompting types in both English and Chinese. The six task types include:

**Closed-book QA:** Answering questions about the real world based solely on the pretrained knowledge. We use TriviaQA [31] for English. For Chinese, we build a closed-book QA dataset based on NLPCC-KBQA [15] dataset following the TriviaQA format.

**Commonsense Natural Language Inference (NLI):** Selecting the most likely followup given an event description. We use the HellaSwag dataset [64] for English and the ClozeT dataset in Yao et al. [63] for Chinese.

**Reading comprehension:** Reading a given article or paragraph and answering questions about it. We use RACE [31] for English and C3 [52] for Chinese. Both are based on multi-choice questions.

**Coreference Resolution:** Given a sentence with pronouns, determine which pronoun refers to which entity. We use the WinoGrande dataset [44] for English and the CLUEWSC dataset [62] for Chinese.

**Examination:** Multiple-choice questions in examinations. For English, we use MMLU [21], which includes mathematics, US history, computer science, law, and more. For Chinese, we use C-Eval [25] which ranges from humanities to science and engineering.

**Math Word Problem**: Solving real-life, situational and relevant problems using mathematical concepts. For English we use the GSM8K [12] dataset. For Chinese, we translate the questions and answers in GSM8K to Chinese, namely GSM8K-Chinese.

The prompting types cover few-shot [6], zero-shot, and few-shot chain-of-thought (CoT) [59]. The datasets are summarized in Table 1.

### Pre-training Loss vs. Performance

In the first experiment, we train three models with 1.5B, 6B, and 32B parameters and observe their behaviors until trained on 3T, 3T, and 2.5T tokens, respectively. The training hyperparameters are shown in Table 4 (Appendix).

We evaluate the performance of intermediate training checkpoints. The checkpoints are saved around every 43B tokens during pre-training. We plot the points of task performance (\(y\)-axis) and training loss (\(x\)-axis) in Figure 1, and provide the statistical measures of the two variables in Table 2. From the curves and statistics, we can see that the training loss is a good predictor of the performance on 12 downstream tasks.

* Generally, the task performance improves as the training loss goes down, regardless of the model sizes. On MMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, and GSM8K-Chinese, all models of three sizes perform at the random level until the pre-training loss decreases to about 2.2, after which the performance gradually climbs as the loss decreases. Detailed analysis on this is shown in Section 3.
* Importantly, the performance-vs-loss data points of different model sizes fall on the same trending curve. That is, by ignoring the color differences (model sizes), the data points of different models are indistinguishable. For example, when the training loss falls around 2.00, the green and orange points on TriviaQA are indistinguishable. This indicates that the model performance on downstream tasks largely correlates with the pre-training loss, _regardless of the model size._
* Both spearman and pearson correlation coefficients show that performance is strongly related to pre-training loss on TriviaQA, HellaSwag, RACE, WinoGrande, etc. The pearson correlation coefficients on these tasks specifically show that points from different models lie on the same trending curve. The relationship is weaker on MMLU, CEval, GSM8K, and GSM8K-Chinese, verifying the emergence of performance which we discuss in Section 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Dataset & TriQA & HS & RACE & WG & NQA & ClozeT & C3 & CW & MMLU & CE & GSM & GSMC \\ \hline Spearman & -0.996 & -0.996 & -0.977 & -0.978 & -0.984 & -0.986 & -0.988 & -0.947 & -0.804 & -0.831 & -0.975 & -0.948 \\ Pearson & -0.994 & -0.994 & -0.963 & -0.988 & -0.982 & -0.985 & -0.993 & -0.972 & -0.903 & -0.884 & -0.874 & -0.829 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Statistical measures of the correlation between task performance and pre-training loss in Figure 1. The spearman correlation coefficient [50] measures the monotonicity of the relationship between the two variables, and the pearson correlation coefficient measures the linearity of the relationship. Both vary between -1 and +1 with 0 implying no correlation. Correlations of -1 or +1 imply an exact monotonic/linear relationship.

Figure 1: **The performance-vs-loss curves of 1.5B, 6B, and 32B models. Each data point is the loss (\(x\)-axis) and performance (\(y\)-axis) of the intermediate checkpoint of one of the three models. We mark the results of random guess in black dashed lines.**

* Interestingly, we find that the overall training loss is a good predictor of performance on both English and Chinese tasks, although it is computed on a mixture of English and Chinese tokens. This implies that the learning dynamics of English and Chinese tokens are likely very similar during multilingual pre-training.

### Training Token Count vs. Performance

Following the empirical experiments in scaling laws [22; 28; 23], we further pre-train 28 relatively smaller models with different numbers of training tokens. The model sizes range from 300M, to 540M, 1B, 1.5B, 3B, and to 6B, while the numbers of pre-training tokens range from 33B to 500B. Varying the number of pre-training tokens is necessary since to achieve optimal performance we need to set the cosine learning rate schedule to reach the minimum at the corresponding token count [28; 23]. The number of tokens used and hyperparameters for all models are shown in Table 5 (Appendix).

On each line, each data point represents the performance and pre-training loss of the corresponding model pre-trained completely from scratch with the certain token count (and learning rate schedule). We can see that similar to the observations from Figure 1, the data points of different models sizes and training tokens largely fall on the same trending curves. In other words, _the LMs with the same pre-training loss regardless of token count and model size exhibit the same performance on the 12 downstream tasks._

Another similar observation is that the performance curves on MMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, and GSM8K-Chinese do not yield an uptrend, meaning that the performance of these models on these four tasks are close to random (with fewer than 500B tokens). For simplicity, we only plot the performance of the latest checkpoint in each training in Figure 2. The complete performance curves with intermediate checkpoints of each model, in which we can observe the same trend but larger variance, are shown in Figure 5 (Appendix).

Figure 2: **The performance-vs-loss curves of smaller models pre-trained with different numbers of training tokens**. Each data point is the loss (\(x\)-axis) and performance (\(y\)-axis) of the final checkpoint of one model, i.e., each point corresponds to one model trained from scratch. We mark the results of random guess in black dashed lines.

### LLaMA's Loss vs. Performance

To validate the generality of our observations, we analyze two different model series with required information made publicly available, i.e., LLaMA [55] and Pythia [3]. Compared to our models, LLaMA uses a pre-training corpus that excludes Chinese documents, leverages a different pre-training framework [37], and adopts a slightly different model architecture. Since the intermediate checkpoints of LLaMA are not available, we extract the pre-training loss and corresponding performance on six question answering and commonsense reasoning tasks from the figures in its original paper, and plot the points in Figure 3.

Excitingly, most data points from the LLaMA models with different sizes (7B, 13B, 33B, 65B) fall on the same upwards trend. This observation further confirm our conclusion that the model's pre-training loss can predict its performance on downstream tasks, regardless of model size and token count. Note that there is only one exception at the early stage of LLaMA-65B. We can see that when the training loss is higher than 1.8, LLaMA-65B performs worse than smaller models with the same training loss. Without access to its intermediate checkpoints, we unfortunately cannot further analyze the result. One possible explanation is that they use exponential smoothing on either the loss or downstream performance plots. Exponential smoothing would perturb the earlier points more than other points, potentially leading to this effect. Note that the outliers only constitute the initial 10% training tokens. The results for Pythia are shown in Appendix F, which also support our conclusion.

Observed from previous experiments and analysis, we can conclude that the pre-training loss is a good indicator of LMs' performance on downstream tasks, independent of model sizes, training tokens, languages, and pre-training frameworks.

## 3 Analysis of Different Tasks and Metrics

### Performance Trends of Different Tasks

In Figures 1 and 2, we can separate the datasets into two groups: First, on TriviaQA, HellaSwag, RACE, WinoGrande, NLPCC-KBQA, ClozeT, CLUEWSC, and C3, the performance improves smoothly with decreased pre-training loss from the very beginning. Second, on MMLU, C-Eval, GSM8K, and GSM8K-Chinese, the performance remains flat when the loss is higher than a certain threshold. Once the pre-training loss is lower than this threshold, the performance starts to improve.

Figure 3: **The performance-vs-loss curves of LLaMA.** The values of performance and training loss are extracted from the figures in the original LLaMA paper [55]. Note that the LLaMA2 paper [56] does not cover such figures with related information.

The correlation coefficients in Table 2 also reveal the difference: coefficients in the first group are close to -1, indicating strong correlations, while correlations in the second group are weaker.

Take MMLU as an example of the second group, when the pre-training loss is higher than 2.2, the accuracy remains around 25%. Since each question in MMLU has four options, this means the model prediction is no better than random guessing. However, when the pre-training loss drops below 2.2, the accuracy increases as the loss decreases, similar to the trend observed in the first group of tasks. The performance trends of C-Eval, GSM8K, and GSM8K-Chinese follow a similar pattern. Despite differences in languages, tasks, prompting types, and answer forms among the four datasets are different, the thresholds for performance improvement are surprisingly all around 2.2.

RACE in the first group has a prompting format similar to MMLU: both consist of multi-choice examination questions with in-context demonstrations, but their performance curves are quite different. We hypothesis that it is the task difficulty that makes the difference. Tasks of the first group of datasets are easier than those of the second group. For example, RACE requires the model to select correct answers for questions about a given article, and HellaSwag lets the model to select the possible followup of a situation based on commonsense. In contrast, MMLU and C-Eval consist of questions designed for high school, college, or professional examinations, requiring a broader range of knowledge. GSM8K and GSM8K-Chinese are math word problems that were previously considered as impossible to be solved by pre-trained language models before Chain-of-Thought prompting.

The phenomenon can be related to grokking, which describes the improvement of performance from the random chance level to perfect generalization [40]. Power et al. [40] find that this improvement can occur well past the point of overfitting. In pre-training, the models are usually underfitting instead of overfitting overall. Since the pre-training corpus is a mixture of different documents, it is possible that the model already fits some patterns--such as numerical addition--in the data, while still underfitting the overall corpus.

Certainly, the observations on the second groups of datasets can also be related to emergent abilities [58], that is, abilities that only present in large models. According to the scaling law [28], with the number of training tokens fixed, the pre-training loss follows a power law with respect to model sizes. In other words, there is a monotonic relationship between model size and pre-training loss. For the second group of tasks, there is a threshold of model sizes that corresponds to the tipping point in the pre-training loss. When the model size exceeds this threshold, the model can exhibit performance above the random chance level.

Figure 4: **The performance-vs-loss curves of different metrics on MMLU and C-Eval.** Accuracy: discontinuous; CorrectChoiceProb and BrierScore: continuous. We mark the result of random guess in black dashed lines.

### Influence of Different Metrics

Schaeffer et al. [46] propose an alternative explanation of emergent abilities of LMs, that is, emergent abilities appear due to the researchers' choice of nonlinear or discontinuous metrics. The accuracy on multi-choice questions (e.g., MMLU) is discontinuous, since the score on a question is either 1 or 0. To validate this claim, we examine the intermediate checkpoints on MMLU and C-Eval with continuous metrics rather than discontinuous accuracy used in the original benchmarks. The first metric is the predicted probability of the correct answer, denoted as CorrectChoiceProb. The second one is the Brier Score [5] used in Schaeffer et al. [46]:

\[\mathrm{BrierScore}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{j=1}^{C}(y_{ij}-\hat{y}_{ij })^{2}\] (2)

where \(\hat{y}_{ij}\) is the predicted probability of sample \(i\) for class \(j\) and \(y_{ij}\) is the ground truth probability. The metric measures the prediction error and a lower value indicates better performance.

We plot the results measured by different metrics on MMLU and C-Eval in Figure 4. All three metrics--accuracy, correct choice probability, and Brier Score--show emergent performance improvements (value increase for the first two and decrease for the third) when the pre-training loss drops below a certain threshold. The Brier Score also decreases when the pre-training loss is above the threshold. However, the decrease of Brier Score does not always represent improvements on the task, since the Brier Score is related to not only the predicted probability of the correct answer but also the predicted probabilities of the incorrect answers. We find that the distribution of the correct answers is uniform in the four options in MMLU and C-Eval. The best Brier Score for a context-free predictor is achieved by always giving uniform probability to all the options. In this case, the Brier Score is equal to 0.75. Therefore, the performance in terms of Brier Score is no better than random guess before the loss reaches the threshold. This observation further confirms our previous conclusion. We discuss the contrary observations of Schaeffer et al. [46] and Xia et al. [61] in Appendix C.

We conclude that emergent abilities of language models occur when the pre-training loss reaches a certain tipping point, and continuous metrics cannot eliminate the observed tipping point.

## 4 Defining Emergent Abilities from the Loss Perspective

In previous sections, we show that 1) the pre-training loss is predictive of the performance of language modes on downstream tasks, and 2) some tasks exhibit emergent performance improvements from the random guess level when the pre-training loss drops below a certain threshold regardless of model size, token count, and continuity of metrics. Based on these observations, we give a new definition of emergent abilities from the pre-training loss perspective:

**Definition**.: _An ability is emergent if it is not present in models with higher pre-training loss but is present in models with lower pre-training loss._

The normalized performance on an emergent ability as a function of the pre-training loss \(L\) is:

\[\begin{cases}f(L)&\text{if }L<\eta\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\] (3)

where \(f(L)\) is a monotonically decreasing function of \(L\), \(\eta\) is the threshold, and the normalized performance of random guess is 0.

Next we will show how the new definition can be related to previously observed emergent abilities [58]. In Henighan et al. [22], they give the scaling relation for the loss with model size \(N\) when the number of training tokens \(D\) is fixed:

\[L(N)=L_{\infty}+\left(\frac{N_{0}}{N}\right)^{\alpha_{N}}\] (4)

where \(L_{\infty}\) is the irreducible loss, and \(\alpha_{N}\) is the coefficient. The equation shows that the loss of language models follows a power-law plus a constant. Combining Equation (3) and Equation (4), we can get the normalized performance as a function of the model size \(N\)

\[\begin{cases}f\left(L_{\infty}+\left(\frac{N_{0}}{N}\right)^{\alpha_{N}} \right)&\text{if }N\geq N_{0}\cdot(\eta-L_{\infty})^{-\frac{1}{\alpha_{N}}}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\] (5)From this equation, we can explain the emergent abilities observed in Wei et al. [58]: when model sizes are smaller than \(N_{0}\cdot(\eta-L_{\infty})^{-1/\alpha_{N}}\), the normalized performance is zero. When model sizes exceed \(N_{0}\cdot(\eta-L_{\infty})^{-1/\alpha_{N}}\), the increase in model size leads to a decrease of pre-training loss and an improvement in normalized performance.

## 5 Related Work

**Relationship of Pre-training Loss and Task Performance.** In the transfer learning setting, i.e. the language model is pre-trained on the general corpus and fine-tuned on supervised data of specific tasks, Tay et al. [54] find that models with the same pre-training loss can have different downstream performance after finetuning, due to inductive bias in model architectures such as Transformers and Switch Transformers. Tay et al. [53] further study the effect of model shapes on downstream fine-tuning. Liu et al. [33] also study the effect of inductive bias of model sizes and model algorithms on the relationship of pre-training loss and downstream performance after fine-tuning, but their theory only applies in the saturation regime, where the models are close to minimal possible pre-training loss. Instead, large language models today are generally under-trained [23; 55], far from the saturation regime. Overall, these studies focus on the pretrain-finetune paradigm, in which inductive bias helps improve transferability, while we study prompted performance of large language models without finetuning [29; 6]. For the prompted performance of large language models, Xia et al. [61] claim that perplexity is a strong predictor of in-context learning performance, but the evidence is limited to the OPT model [66] and a subset of BIG-Bench [51]. Instead, Shin et al. [49] find that low perplexity does not always imply high in-context learning performance when the pre-training corpus changes. Gadre et al. [18] fits the relation of perplexity and the top-1 error averaged over many natural language tasks with a power law. Instead, we focus on the different relations of tasks and a small part of tasks that show emergency trends.

**Emergent abilities.** Wei et al. [58] propose the idea of emergent abilities, abilities that only present in large language models. This is similar to the claim of Ganguli et al. [19] that it is more difficult to predict the capacities of language models than to predict the pre-training loss. The existence of emergent abilities has been challenged. Hoffmann et al. [23] show that smaller language models trained with sufficient data can outperform undertrained larger language models, supported by follow-up models [55; 26; 56]. On the other hand, Schaeffer et al. [46] claim that emergent abilities are due to the discontinuous metrics used for evaluation, also found in Xia et al. [61]. Similarly, Hu et al. [24] propose to predict the performance of emergent abilities with the infinite resolution evaluation metric. In this paper we prove the existence of emergent abilities from the perspective of pre-training loss, even with continuous metrics.

## 6 Conclusion

Our paper proposes a new definition of emergent abilities of language models from the perspective of pre-training loss. Empirical results show that the pre-training loss is a better metric to represent the scaling effect of language models than model size or training compute. The performance of emergent abilities exhibits emergent increase when the pre-training loss falls below a certain threshold, even when evaluated with continuous metrics.

The new definition offers a precise characterization of the critical junctures within training trajectories where emergent abilities manifest. It encourages future studies to investigate the shifts in language models at these junctures, which facilitate the development of new capabilities.

## 7 Limitation

We study the relationship of pre-training loss and task performance across model sizes, training tokens, tasks, languages, prompting types, and answer forms. Factors we have not considered are model architectures and training algorithms. We analyze the performance-loss curves of LLaMA and Pythia with slightly different architectures, and find that the relationship holds for all the models. But there are fundamentally different model architectures, such as routed Transformers [16], and non-Transformer architectures [17, 39] beyond our consideration. Both our models and LLaMA use AdamW optimizer [35], while there are other optimizers for language model pre-training [48, 32].

The disadvantage of studying emergent abilities in the lens of pre-training loss is that the pre-training loss is affected by the tokenizer and the distribution of pre-training corpus. The values of pre-training loss of language models trained on different corpus are not directly comparable. One possible solution is to evaluate different language models on a public validation set with the normalized perplexity [43] to account for the different vocabulary sizes.

The paper should not be considered as a push to expand model sizes and data sizes of language models beyond current scales. It is not guaranteed that new tipping points emerge in larger scales. Also, instruction tuning [57, 45, 9, 34] can improve the zero-shot performance of language models on unseen tasks, including MMLU and GSM8K.

## Appendix A Pre-training Settings

### Pre-training Corpus

Our pre-training corpus is a mixture of English and Chinese documents. The ratio of English tokens to Chinese tokens in the pre-training corpus is 4:1. Both the English and Chinese corpora consist of webpages, wikipedia, books, and papers. The distribution of different sources in the English corpus is shown in Table 3. The distribution and processing pipeline are similar to Redpajama [13]. During pre-training, documents from Wikipedia and Books are trained for multiple epochs, but most documents (93.4% in the pre-training corpus) are never repeated.

We tokenize the data with the byte pair encoding (BPE) algorithm [47] in the SentencePiece package [30]. The vocabulary size is 65k.

### Hyperparameters

The hyperparameters for training of 1.5B, 6B, and 32B models are shown in Table 4. The hyperparameters for training of smaller models are shown in Table 5. The sequence length is 2048 and the optimizer is AdamW [35] with \(\beta_{1}=0.9\) and \(\beta_{2}=0.95\).

## Appendix B Evaluation Settings

The evaluated splits and numbers of examples are summarized in Table 6. For English datasets, we follow Gopher [41] and Chinchilla [23]'s selection of evaluation splits. For Chinese datasets, we use the validation split when the ground labels are always available. For CLUEWSC, the size of the validation set is too small (100), so we combine the train and validation splits. GSM8K-Chinese is translated from GSM8K with machine translation and human proofreading.

## Appendix C Are Emergent Abilities of Language Models a Mirage?

[46] claim that emergent abilities proposed in [58] are mainly a mirage caused by nonlinear and discontinuos metrics. [61] also support the idea.

[61] use the perplexity of correct options as the metric for BIG-Bench and find that the metric improves smoothly on almost all the tasks of BIG-Bench. We argue that the perplexity of correct options is not the correct metric to evaluate the performance of multi-choice questions. The correct metric of multi-choice questions should reflect the ability of distinguishing correct options from incorrect options. The perplexity of correct options and incorrect options may decrease simultaneously. In fact, [61] already observe perplexity of incorrect options decreasing during pre-training and only at

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{r r r r r r r r} \hline \hline Parameters & Tokens & d\_model & d\_hidden & n\_heads & n\_layers & Batch Size & Max LR \\ \hline
1.5B & 3T & 2048 & 6912 & 16 & 24 & 1344 & 5e-4 \\
6B & 3T & 4096 & 13696 & 32 & 28 & 4224 & 4e-4 \\
32B & 2.5T & 6656 & 22272 & 52 & 58 & 8832 & 3e-4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3: The ratio of different sources in the English corpus.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

Consider two models that give the same probability independent of questions. One model predicts \((1,0,0,0)\) for the four options and the other model predicts \((0.25,0.25,0.25,0.25)\). The Brier Score for the former is 1.5 while the Brier Score for the latter is 0.75. However, both models do not learn the relationship between questions and correct options at all. One can argue that the latter model better fits the distribution of correct options in the dataset, but the improvement is not as large as the different of 1.5 and 0.75. We should consider the Brier Score of 0.75 as the performance of the random guess baseline, and any decrease in Brier Score above 0.75 should not be considered as the real improvement on the task.

In Figure 6 of [46], they evaluate 4 tasks in BIG-Bench with the Brier Score metric and find that the emergent abilities disappear. We hypothesis that they normalize the Brier Score with the number of options in each question, otherwise the Brier Score of 0.25 on the swahili_english_proverbs task is too low for the smallest model. Four tasks have 2, 2, 4, 5 options in each question. The values of Brier Score for random guess baselines on the four tasks are 0.25, 0.25, 0.1875, and 0.16. Only the largest model surpasses the random guess baseline. This also supports the existence of emergent abilities.

## Appendix D Complete Performance-vs-Loss Curves of Smaller Models

The performance-vs-loss curves for all the intermediate checkpoints are shown in Figure 5. The trend is the same as Figure 2, but with larger variance.

## Appendix E Loss vs Compute as an Indicator of Performance

We show the performance-compute curves in Figure 6. Compared with Figure 1, we observe that points from different models do not fall on the same curves on most tasks. This proves that pre-training loss is a better indicator of task performance than compute.

Figure 5: The complete performance-vs-loss curves of smaller models.

## Appendix F Pythia's Loss vs. Performance

To further support our conclusion, we plot the performance-loss curves of Pythia [3] in Figure 7. Pythia is a suite of open language models with intermediate checkpoints released. For downstream tasks, we select SciQ [60], LAMBADA [38], WinoGrande [44], ARC-Easy [11], ARC-Challenge [11], and PIQA [4] with reported performance in the official repository. We compute the cross-entropy loss of intermediate checkpoints on the corpus Pile [20]. From the plot, we can observe that the points from different models fall on the same curve on all the tasks. This supports our conclusion that pre-training loss is predictive of task performance.

However, neither Pythia nor LLaMA can be used to analyze the emergent abilities. The largest Pythia model fails to achieve performance above random chance on MMLU and GSM8K [2]. Instead, LLaMA has no intermediate checkpoints released and performance curves on MMLU and GSM8K are not available.

## Appendix G Loss vs. Performance on BIG-bench

BIG-bench [51] is a series of diverse tasks designed to evaluate the capacities and limitations of pre-trained language models. Wei et al. [58] find that large language models exhibit emergent abilities on four tasks from BIG-Bench. Among the four tasks, the test set size of the figure-of-speech detection task is too small and the variance is too high. We evaluate the other three tasks in the same setting as Section 2.3 and the results are shown in Figure 8. With pretraining loss decreases along the x-axis, we can clearly observe the tipping point in the performance curves.

Figure 6: The performance-vs-compute curves of 1.5B, 6B, and 32B models.

## Appendix H Compute Resources

All the models are trained on DGX-A100 GPU (8x80G) servers. The 1.5B, 6B, and 32B models in Section 2.3 take 8 days on 256 A100 GPUs, 8 days on 1024 A100 GPUs, and 20 days on 2048 A100 GPUs respectively. The small models in Section 2.4 take about 20 days on 256 A100 GPUs.

## Appendix I Broader Impact

This paper finds that pre-training loss is predictive of downstream task performance and on some tasks the performance only begins to improve when the pre-training loss falls below a certain threshold. Combined with previous works on scaling laws [28, 22, 23], we can predict the amount of compute required to achieve a certain performance. This can be used to estimate the cost of training a large model.

The paper might encourage companies to expand model sizes and data sizes of language models beyond current scales to pursue new emergent abilities, leading to a waste of compute resources. We want to emphasize that the analysis of previous performance trends do not necessarily apply to the larger models.

Figure 8: **The performance-vs-loss curves of 1.5B, 6B, and 32B models on 3 tasks in BIG-bench. Each data point is the loss (\(x\)-axis) and performance (\(y\)-axis) of the intermediate checkpoint of one of the three models. We mark the results of random guess in black dashed lines.**

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction include the main claims made in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations in Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The model are pre-trained with the open-source framework, Megatron-LM 1, and we provide the training hyperparameters. The datasets can be replaced with open-source counterparts, such as RedPajama. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. Footnote 1: https://github.com/WVIDIA/Megatron-LM
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: The training code is Megatron-LM 2. The pre-training dataset cannot be released since it contains proprietary content. Guidelines:  Footnote 2: https://github.com/WVIDIA/Megatron-LM

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The details of pre-training are described in Appendix A and those of evaluation are described in Appendix B. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: It is too computationally expensive to train multiple pre-trained language models from scratch. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix H. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper does not include human subjects or participants. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In Appendix I. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks since it does not include release of data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the creators of code, datasets, and models used in the paper are properly cited. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.

13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.

14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
