###### Abstract

Going beyond mimicking limited human experiences, recent studies show initial evidence that, like humans, large language models (LLMs) are capable of improving their abilities purely by self-correction, _i.e._, correcting previous responses through self-examination, as seen in models like OpenAI o1. Nevertheless, little is known about how such capabilities arise. In this work, based on a simplified setup akin to an alignment task, we theoretically analyze self-correction from an in-context learning perspective, showing that when LLMs give relatively accurate self-examinations as rewards, they are capable of refining responses in an in-context way. Notably, going beyond previous theories on over-simplified linear transformers, our theoretical construction underpins the roles of several key designs of realistic transformers for self-correction: softmax attention, multi-head attention, and the MLP block. We validate these findings extensively on synthetic datasets. Inspired by these findings, we propose a simple self-correction strategy, Checking as Context (CaC), which finds novel applications in alleviating social bias and defending against LLM jailbreaks. We believe that these findings will inspire further research on understanding, exploiting, and enhancing self-correction for building better foundation models.

## 1 Introduction

"_Who among people is without fault? Making mistakes and being able to correct them is the greatest goodness._" - Zuo Zhuan (\(\sim\)400 BC), Translated by ChatGPT

The capacity for self-correction, traditionally viewed as a distinctive human trait, is increasingly being explored within the realm of artificial intelligence, particularly in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent studies have sparked optimism about LLMs' self-correction capabilities for enhancing reasoning [48, 65], planning [81], and alignment [21]. Although some find that self-correction may lead to worse performance without external feedbacks [28, 70], more recent evidence shows that with careful designs of instructions on the self-criticizing process, self-correction can yield considerable benefits on various tasks [38, 86, 42, 32, 34, 69]. Remarkably, self-correction is recognized to be pivotal for building strong reasoning models like OpenAI o1 [52].

Driven by these intruiging empirical findings, we want to establish a principled understanding of how the self-correction ability emerges in LLMs. A particular difficulty is to formulate the multifacetedself-correction designs to be amenable to theoretical analysis. We notice that existing self-correction methods admit a general abstraction: generation, critics, regeneration, and further critics, continuing until the final refined output. This self-correction path can be understood as a particular form of context that provides feedback for refining the prediction on the fly. Different from standard (query, response) context examples akin to supervised learning, self-correction examples can be formulated in a triplet form (query, response, reward) that is akin to LLM alignment with both good and bad samples indicated by their rewards [53; 7; 61; 66]. This observation motivates us to formulate self-correction as a form of _in-context alignment (ICA)_, where LLMs are provided with a context of self-correction steps and the goal is to refine the final outputs to have higher rewards.

Through this perspective, we prove that in a simplified setup, a _standard_ multi-layer transformer can utilize self-correction samples to generate responses of higher rewards. Specifically, we prove the existence of model weights such that a transformer can optimize common ranking-based alignment objectives by performing gradient descent in-context, which includes the Bradley-Terry model [9] and the Plackett-Luce model [58] that are _de facto_ choices for LLM alignment (used in RLHF [53] and DPO [61]). As far as we know, this is the first theoretical analysis showing that LLMs can improve alignment in-context, providing a solid foundation for understanding self-correction. Our theory accommodates different kinds of self-correction methods, because the critics of responses can come from humans [53], external verifiers [13], or LLMs themselves [86; 38]. The analysis further reveals that LLMs' self-correction performance relies crucially on the quality of critics, which agrees well with recent empirical findings [42; 14; 69]. Intriguingly, within this analysis, we nail down the roles of realistic transformer designs - multi-head softmax attention, feed-forward network, and stacked blocks - for alignment, providing concrete theoretical insights for designing robust LLMs. This contrasts with previous in-context learning theories that focus on linear attention in the context of linear regression, deviating from practice [74; 84; 2].

At last, we validate our theoretical explanations through both synthetic and real-world experiments. Extensive synthetic datasets show that transformers can indeed learn from noisy outputs with the help of relatively accurate critics. We validate that real-world transformer modules do matter for in-context alignment, and the results align surprisingly well with our theory. Driven by these theoretical insights, we explore two real-world scenarios where we hypothesize that aligned LLMs can provide relatively accurate self-critics: alleviating social bias and defending against jailbreak attacks. We show that with a simple generation-critic-regeneration process (we call Checking-as-Context) and no external feedback, _intrinsic_ self-correction can alleviate social bias on Vicuna-7b and Llama2-7b-chat, and exhibits a strong correlation between self-checking accuracy and final performance again. With the same strategy, we find that self-correction can reduce the attack success rate by a large margin (_e.g.,_\(95\%\to 2\%\)) against multiple types of jailbreak attacks. These evidences show that LLMs are indeed capable of improving alignment by self-correction alone, which not only validates our theory, but also provide insights for future designs and applications of self-correction.

## 2 Formulation

In this section, we introduce self-correction and formulate it as a general in-context alignment process, and then introduce the setup for theoretical analysis.

### Self-correction as In-context Alignment

**ICL.** In-context learning (ICL) is known as an emergent ability of LLMs to learn from a few demonstrations without finetuning [45]. Specifically, an LLM can directly predict the desirable response to the test query \(x_{test}\) with \(N\) pairwise training examples \(\{(x_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{n}\) as the context:

\[\hat{y}_{test}=\mathrm{LLM}([x_{1},y_{1},\dots,x_{n},y_{n},x_{test}]).\] (1)

Despite its effectiveness, ICL requires the knowledge of desirable responses \(y_{i}\) to construct the training examples. For instance, Wei et al. [78] use human-selected safe query-response pairs for in-context defense of jailbreaks. For queries that are vague or require domain expertise (_e.g.,_ math, science, and open-end discussions), desirable responses can be hard to collect or formulate.

**Self-correction.** As a further step to eliminate human efforts, self-correction relies on LLMs to correct the mistakes in the initial generation. In self-correction, we first generate an initial response \(y_{1}\) to the query \(x\), and then obtain a critic on the response, denoted as a reward \(r_{1}\). The critic can be either generated by LLMs themselves through carefully designed prompting [34; 38], or by external verifiers such as code intepreters [62]. Afterwards, the LLM is then instructed to generate a refined response \(y_{2}\) taking the initial response \(y_{1}\) and its critic \(r_{1}\) as the input context. This process can be repeated multiple times for iterative refinements of the response. After \(N\) steps, we take the final response \(y_{N}\) as the final output. For simplicity, we assume that these steps share the same query \(x\), and the extension to multiple queries is discussed in Appendix F.1.

**In-context Alignment (ICA).** The self-correction process described above can be formalized as an in-context learning task with triplet examples \(\{(x,y_{i},r_{i})\}\), where \(x\) is the (shared) query, \(y_{i}\) is the response, and \(r_{i}\) is the critic at the \(i\)-th step. Note that the same data format is also adopted in LLM alignment tasks, where LLMs are trained to follow human intention with human/AI-generated preference data [53; 7; 61; 66].3 In this way, we formulate self-correction as an in-context way to solve an alignment task, which we call in-context alignment (ICA). Here, the concept of alignment is inclusive and not limited to standard alignment tasks. Any objective that works with the triplet preference data can fit into our framework. Also, we do not assume that the rewards \(r_{i}\) are always accurate, and the quality of the rewards will be shown to have a critical influence on self-correction.

Footnote 3: A major difference is that in alignment, the preference data are used for finetuning pretrained LLMs, while self-correction refines outputs in an in-context way without changing model weights.

### Theoretical Setup

Since real-world LLMs on language tasks are too complex for a rigorous analysis, recent studies on ICL theory rely on synthetic simple tasks to examine LLM capabilities [24; 74; 84; 2]. Existing results are mostly established in the supervised setting, particularly for linear regression, due to its simplicity and alignment with linear attention. However, it is yet unknown whether transformers are capable of learning alignment tasks using preference data in-context. In this section, we introduce a simplified setup for in-context alignment. For the ease of analysis, we still study a linear regression task, where a smaller MSE loss gets higher reward. However, what makes things harder is that the models are not provided with groundtruth targets as the context, but only (potentially false) responses \(y_{i}\) and their rewards \(r_{i}\). To solve this task, the model has to learn the ability to compare the rewards of different samples and prioritize those with higher rewards - a critical ability that is key to self-correction and alignment, but has not been studied in previous theories.

#### 2.2.1 Alignment Task

We begin by formalizing a general alignment task with triplet examples. Consider a training dataset \(D=\{(x,y_{i},r_{i})\}_{i=1}^{n-1}\) composed of a common query \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{x}}\) (assume \(\|x\|^{2}=1\) for simplicity)4, multiple responses \(y_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}\) and rewards \(r_{i}\in\mathbb{R}\). Following the setup of Von Oswald et al. [74], we also consider a linear regression task where the groundtruth function is \(f(x)=W^{*}x\) for some \(W^{*}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}\times n_{x}}\). Here, the responses \(y_{i}\) can be quite noisy (_e.g.,_ random), and the quality of this response is indicated by its reward value. Therefore, the transformers have to rank the responses based on their rewards and adjust their outputs accordingly. In general, the critic \(r_{i}\) here can come from either humans, external feedback (e.g., code execution) or LLMs themselves (called _inxtrinsic_ self-correction)--all these variants are studied in the literature. Thus, the rewards may also contain noise, which reflects the critic quality. The goal is to output a response \(y_{N}\) that has a smaller square error, _i.e.,_ higher rewards. There are two approaches to solve this problem, one is through the in-context alignment with a transformer-based LLM, and one is through learning a parameterized alignment model. We describe these methods formally below, and establish their inherent connections in the next section.

Footnote 4: Following discussions can be extended to multiple \(x\)’s as well.

#### 2.2.2 Transformer Model

The transformer model [72] is the _de facto_ choice for building LLMs. It is a composition of multiple transformer blocks. Each block consists of two modules: MHSA and FFN. Normalization layers are omitted for simplicity.

**MHSA.** A multi-head self-attention (MHSA) layer updates a set of tokens \(\{e_{1},\ldots,e_{N}\}\) by

\[e_{j}\gets e_{j}+\mathrm{SA}_{\theta}\left(j,\{e_{1},\ldots,e_{N}\} \right)=e_{j}+\sum_{h}P_{h}V_{h}\,\mathrm{softmax}\left(K_{h}^{\top}q_{h,j} \right),\] (2)with \(P_{h},V_{h},K_{h}\) the projection, value and key matrices, respectively, and \(q_{h,j}\) the query, all for the \(h\)-th head (bias terms omitted). The columns of the value \(V_{h}=[v_{h,1},\ldots,v_{h,N}]\) and key \(K_{h}=[k_{h,1},\ldots,k_{h,N}]\) matrices consist of vectors \(v_{h,i}=W_{h,V}e_{i}\) and \(k_{h,i}=W_{h,K}e_{i}\); likewise, the query is produced by linearly projecting the tokens, \(q_{h,j}=W_{h,Q}e_{j}\). The parameters \(\theta=\left\{P_{h},W_{h,V},W_{h,K},W_{h,Q}\right\}_{h}\) of a SA layer consist of all the projection matrices of all heads. We omit causal masking in the main paper for simplicity; see Appendix F.2 for an extension.

**FFN.** Following self-attention, a feed-forward network (FFN) transforms each token individually with two shared linear transformations and a ReLU activation in between:

\[e_{j}\leftarrow e_{j}+\operatorname{FFN}_{\phi}(e_{j}),\quad\text{where} \operatorname{FFN}_{\phi}(e_{j})=W_{2}\max(0,W_{1}x+b_{1})+b_{2}.\] (3)

Here, \(W_{1},W_{2}\) are weight matrices and \(b_{1},b_{2}\) are bias vectors. Collectively, \(\phi=(W_{1},b_{1},W_{2},b_{2})\) denotes all FNN parameters. Both SA and FFN have residual connections.

**Context Tokens.** For simplicity, we assume that LLMs take a concatenated input \(e_{i}=[x_{i},y_{i},r_{i}]\) for each example.5 For the last test example, to align with the same input format, we model it as \(e_{N}=[x,y_{N},r_{N}]\), where we use a "dummy" response \(y_{N}=W_{0}x_{N}\) (_i.e.,_ the _initial guess_ of LLMs with weights \(W_{0}\) (Section 2.2.3)) as an initialization for the final output, and its "dummy" reward \(r_{N}\) is assumed to have the lowest reward among the input examples. In total, we have \(N\) tokens \(\{e_{i}=[x,y_{i},r_{i}]\}_{i=1}^{N}\) as the contextual input to the transformer.

Footnote 5: As in Von Oswald et al. [74], it is easy to show that we can construct such concatenated tokens from standard sequential tokens with the help of positional encodings.

#### 2.2.3 Alignment Model

A common way to solve alignment tasks is to learn a parameterized alignment model that models preferences through a ranking objective over multiple candidates [9; 58; 46; 61]. We use \(y_{i}\succ y_{j}\) to denote the event that the response \(y_{i}\) is preferable over \(y_{j}\). Let \(\tau\colon[N]\mapsto[N]\) be the permutation function that denotes the ranking of all responses according to the reward scores, _i.e.,_\(r_{\tau(1)}>\cdots>r_{\tau(N)}\).6 The ranking \(\tau\) implies that for any \(N\geq i>j\geq 1\), we have \(y_{\tau(i)}\succ y_{\tau(j)}\). A common objective for \(N\)-ary comparison is the Plackett-Luce (PL) model [58; 46; 61] that stipulates

Footnote 6: For simplicity, we omit the case of having equal rewards. On the one hand, such scenarios are rare since LLMs are well capable of telling different answers apart. On the other hand, our analysis can be easily extended to such cases by grouping the samples with equal rewards.

\[P_{\mathrm{PL}}\left(\tau\mid x,\{y_{i}\}\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\exp \left(r(x,y_{\tau(i)})\right)}{\sum_{j=i}^{N}\exp\left(r(x,y_{\tau(j)})\right)},\] (4)

where \(r\) denotes the reward function. Since we consider a linear regression task (Section 2.2.1), we use the negative square error as the reward function (higher is better): \(r(x,y)=-\|Wx-y\|^{2}\). The corresponding PL model is

\[P_{\mathrm{PL}}\left(\tau\right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\exp\left(-\|Wx-y_{\tau( i)}\|^{2}\right)}{\sum_{j=i}^{N}\exp\left(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(j)}\|^{2}\right)}.\] (5)

**Relationship to Bradley-Terry model.** The Plackett-Luce model is an \(N\)-ary generalization of the Bradley-Terry model [9] used for pariwise preferences. In particular, with \(N=2\), the PL model (Eq. (5)) reduces to the Bradley-Terry model with least-squares reward:

\[P_{\mathrm{BT}}\left(y_{1}\succ y_{2}\right)=\frac{\exp\left(-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2 }\right)}{\sum_{j=1}^{2}\exp\left(-\|Wx-y_{i}\|^{2}\right)}.\] (6)

Previous work [66] shows that the \(N\)-ary PL model outperforms the binary BT model for alignment.

**Relationship to InfoNCE.** We also notice that the InfoNCE loss that is widely used for contrastive learning [51; 12; 60; 76] can be seen as a special case of the PL model when only considering its first term (\(i=1\)). In this case, only \(y_{1}\) is the positive sample and \(y_{2},\ldots,y_{N}\) are negative samples, which corresponds to a special ranking \(r_{\tau(1)}>r_{\tau(2)}=\cdots=r_{\tau(N)}\). Therefore, the analysis in our framework can be used to explain in-context contrastive learning [16].

Main Results

In this section, we present the main result of this work, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to show that _a realistic transformer (with stacked multi-head softmax attention and feed-forward networks)_ can implement the gradient descent of common alignment objectives with in-context triplets. Notably, our analysis reveals the individual roles of these core designs of realistic transformers for in-context alignment (and self-correction), which may help future designs of LLM backbones as well.

### A Simple Case: Bradley-Terry Model with \(N=2\)

To highlight the key ideas without technical nuances, we start with \(N=2\), the Bradley-Terry (BT) model (Eq. (6)). Assume w.l.o.g. that \(y_{1}\succ y_{2}\) with scores \(r_{1}>r_{2}\), the BT model is \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W;x,y_{1},y_{2})=-\log P_{\mathrm{BT}}\left(y_{1} \succ y_{2}\mid x\right)=\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}+\log\sum_{j=1}^{2}\exp\left(-\|Wx- y_{j}\|^{2}\right).\)

**Proposition 3.1**.: _One can realize the gradient descent for BT,_

\[W^{\prime}=W+\Delta W=W-\eta\nabla_{W}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W;x,y_{1},y_{2 }),\]

_by updating each \(y_{i}\) with_

\[y_{i}^{\prime}=y_{i}-\Delta Wx=\underbrace{y_{i}}_{(i)}-\underbrace{2\eta y_{ 1}}_{(2)}+\underbrace{2\eta\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}y_{j}}_{(j)},\] (7)

_where \(\beta_{j}=\mathrm{softmax}(-\|Wx-y_{j}\|^{2})\). Specifically, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W^{\prime};x,y_{1},y_{2})=\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}} (W;x,y_{1}^{\prime},y_{2}^{\prime})\)._

Proposition 3.1 shows that the gradient descent of the BT model is equivalent to transforming the targets \(y_{i}\) according to Eq. (7). This connection allows us to **optimize output alignment (measured by BT loss) with the forward propagation of an MHSA layer** (Eq. (2)). To see this, Term (1) corresponds to the shortcut feature \(y_{i}\). Term (2) is a bit complex, since it only picks \(y_{1}\) with the higher score (\(r_{1}>r_{2}\)). We find that this can be realized by constructing a _softmax attention head_ that only attends to tokens with the largest reward \(r\). Term (3) can be implemented with another softmax attention head that incorporates \(\beta_{i}\)'s as the attention weights and \(y_{i}\)'s as values. Therefore, the one-step gradient descent of the BT model can be implemented with two-head softmax attention.

**Theorem 3.2**.: _Given a **two-head softmax attention layer** and two tokens \(e_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i}),i=1,2\), there exists a set of parameters (Eq. (2)) such that a forward propagation step with token \(e_{i}\) is equivalent to the gradient-induced dynamics of the Bradley-Terry model (Eq. (6)):_

\[e_{i}^{\prime}=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+\sum_{h=1}^{2}P_{h}V_{h}\mathrm{softmax}( K_{h}^{\top}q_{h,j})=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+(0,-\Delta W_{\mathrm{BT}}x_{i},0),i=1,2.\] (8)

All proofs of the paper are deferred to Appendix E. As outlined above, our construction of in-context alignment requires two heads to implement the two gradient terms corresponding to positive and negative feedback, where softmax attention is exploited for sample selection in both cases. Instead, ICL analyses for linear regression [74] only require one linear attention head for interpolating with linear products. Thus, our alignment analysis better reveals the need for softmax and multi-head attention, so it has a close correspondence to real-world architectures.

### Extension to Cases with \(N>2\)

We further explore how to extend this result to a general \(N\)-ary Plackett-Luce (PL) model (Eq. (5)). Although the key ideas are similar, it is technically much harder to implement \(N>2\) with a single SA layer. To see this, notice that the response update of the PL loss corresponds to

\[y_{i}^{\prime}= y_{i}-2\eta\sum_{i=1}^{N-1}\bigg{(}y_{\tau(i)}-\sum_{j=i}^{N} \beta_{j}y_{\tau(j)}\bigg{)}.\] (9)

At first glance, the \(i\)-th item of the update resembles Eq. (7) and seems implementable with a two-head self-attention. However, it is actually hard to realize the first term \(y_{\tau(i)}\), since softmax attention can only select the top or the bottom value7 from a set of rewards, making it challenging to compare \(N\) examples within a single SA layer.

Footnote 7: Technically, we can also manually choose thresholds for each \(r_{i}\) for them to be selected in a specific attention head (\(N\) heads for \(N\) tokens). However, it is not adaptive to the change of reward values and input length and thus deviates far from the practice.

**A roadmap to implementing \(N>2\) with stacked full Transformer blocks.** We discover that it is still possible to construct the PL gradient descent if we further incorporate the FFN module and allow stacking multiple transformer blocks. Specifically, at the \(i\)-th block, we can 1) identify the token with the largest reward (_i.e., \(y_{\tau(i)}\)_) and implement the \(i\)-th term of the gradient descent with a three-head SA layer; and 2) mask out the \(y_{\tau(i)}\) of this token to eliminate its contribution in subsequent terms with the help of an FFN. In other words, each transformer block can implement one of the \(N-1\) terms of the gradient (Eq. (9)) and prepare the input data for implementing the next term with one additional head. In total, it requires stacking \(N-1\) transformer blocks (each is composed of three-head MHSA and FFN) to implement the whole gradient descent of the PL model. 8

Footnote 8: As a natural extension, stacking \(K(N-1)\) blocks can implement \(K\) gradient descent steps.

**Theorem 3.3**.: _Given a **transformer**\(\mathrm{TF}\)**with \(N-1\)**stacked transformer blocks (composed of three-head softmax attention and feed-forward networks)** and \(N\) input tokens \(\{e_{i},i\in[N]\}\), there exists a set of parameters such that a forward step with token \(e_{i}\) is equivalent to the gradient-induced dynamics of the \(N\)-ary Plackett-Luce model (Eq. (5)), i.e., \(\mathrm{TF}(e_{i})=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+(0,-\Delta W_{\mathrm{PL}}x_{i},0),i \in[N]\)._

Theorem 3.3 shows that a multi-layer transformer can improve its output alignment by optimizing a general Plackett-Luce model through in-context learning. It could serve as a general explanation for ICL-based alignment algorithms [26; 41; 25]. As far as we know, it is the first theoretical result for explaining in-context alignment from an optimization perspective. Through our construction, we also underpin the individual roles of rewards and transformer modules during the self-correction process:

1. **Reward quality determines self-correction quality.** By connecting in-context alignment to an optimization process, we reveal that the critics used in self-correction essentially serve as the supervision for the in-context alignment task. Thus inaccurate rewards would amount to noisy supervision that is known to degrade learning performance [50; 77; 47], which explains the benefits of external feedback [13] and stronger discriminator [14] in self-correction.
2. **Softmax attention is important for ranking.** One of the key steps to implement the gradient descent is to select the top response based on the input rewards, and our construction relies crucially on the ability of softmax attention to compare and reweight different rewards. Instead, it is hard for linear attention to implement such ranking operations.
3. **Multi-head attention is important for token discrimination.** We use two attention heads in Eq. (7) with different roles: one for pushing top ones apart, and one for pulling others closer. This indicates that only with multi-head attention can we achieve better discrimination of different input tokens. In contrast, only one attention head is needed for regression [74].
4. **FFN is important for transforming selected tokens**. In our construction, although softmax attention can select the top tokens, we cannot edit the selected tokens with attention alone. Instead, FFN is capable of 1) identifying top tokens in the input sequence with the knowledge of initial and selected tokens, as well as 2) performing conditional operations (_e.g.,_ masking out \(y_{\tau(i)}\)) by leveraging the ReLU nonlinearity.
5. **Ranking multiple examples requires more depth**. Comparing Theorems 3.2 and 3.3, we notice that ranking \(N\) examples with a transformer requires \(N-1\) layers with our construction. This fact suggests a hint of why depth is still a major factor when constructing LLMs. For example, scaling from 7B to 70B, Llama2 goes from 32 layers to 80 layers and shows significant improvements.

In Section 4, we also empirically validate the necessity of these modules for in-context alignment. This analysis also suggests that linear regression--which only requires single-head linear attention to solve in-context--may not be enough to fully characterize the behavior of standard transformers [2], while our in-context alignment tasks (Section 2.2.1) could be a better theory model. These theoretical disclosures of Transformer modules may inspire future designs of LLM backbones as well.

**Relation to Previous Theoretical analyses.** An existing line of prior research explains in-context learning via its connection to optimization algorithms [24, 74, 6, 39, 18, 79, 2, 30]. We provide a detailed summary of these works in Appendix A, and here summarize key aspects in which we differ:

* **Objective: linear regression _vs._ non-convex alignment**. Compared to previous methods that focus on solving linear regression in-context, we are the first to show that transformers can also solve ranking-based alignment problems in-context. A major difference is that alignment involves a more complex non-convex objective that does not admit a closed-form solution like linear regression.
* **Backbone: linear attention _vs._ full transformer**. As discussed above, our construction identifies that softmax attention and other components of transformers play a major role in ranking while focusing on linear regression problems only requires linear attention. It reveals that our PL model with linear reward could be a better theory model for explaining in-context learning as it aligns better with practice.
* **Task: supervised learning _vs._ preference-based alignment.** Previous ICL theories mostly focus on explaining its ability to perform supervised regression. Instead, we show that LLMs can learn in-context alignment, which allows feedbacks from various sources with noises, and learns from both good and bad behaviors. In particular, our theory also applies to intrinsic self-correction methods with self-generation critics, which is self-supervised.

## 4 Verification on Synthetic Data

Here, we follow our theoretical setup in Section 2.2.3 and conduct a series of synthetic experiments to examine our theoretical results established in Section 3.

**Setup.** We consider the following meta-learning setting. For every task, we draw a common query \(x\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\) and a groundtruth parameter \(W\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\). We then generate \(N\) responses and rewards. For each response \(y_{i}\), we sample a reward \(r_{i}\in\mathcal{U}[0,1]\) and an independent noise weight \(W_{i}^{-}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\), and then generate \(y_{i}=r_{i}Wx+(1-r_{i})W_{i}^{-}x\). Thus, responses with higher rewards are closer to the ground truth in expectation. By default, we set \(d=5,N=20\) and use a \(20\)-layer GPT-2 model with \(3\) heads, \(96\) hidden dimension, and a PL loss (Eq. (5)). Then we evaluate the normalized MSE between the predicted output \(\hat{y}\) and ground-truth \(y=Wx\) using varying numbers of in-context examples, averaged over \(256\) runs with randomly generated tasks. We also implement the gradient descent (GD) of the linear PL model (Eq. (5)) and measure its optimal

Figure 1: Synthetic experiments of in-context alignment with comparison between TF and GD (a), different reward noise \(p\) (b), model depth (c), and attention types (d), (e), (f).

solution in the same way. We also change the reward noise \(p\), model depth, and attention types to investigate their effects on in-context alignment. For more details, please refer to Appendix C.

As shown in Figure 1, there is a clear trend that with more in-context examples, transformer-based in-context alignment and gradient descent (GD) can quickly adapt to the task and find better predictions for test samples. In comparison, Figure 0(a) shows that GD performs better at the beginning, while Transformers also adapt quickly and attain slightly better performance with more in-context examples, _e.g.,_\(N=14\). It indicates that in-context alignment might be even preferable to GD-based alignment in certain cases, which validates our theoretical results that transformers can optimize alignment in-context by gradient descent. Below, we study different factors of in-context alignment.

**Reward quality matters.** To investigate the influence of reward quality, we randomly replace rewards with random values \(r_{i}^{p}\in(0,1)\) with a probability \(p\). As shown by solid lines in Figure 0(b), a large \(p\) significantly decreases the in-context alignment performance with much larger test errors. This can be naturally understood through our theory, where the gradient descent is performed on noisy data that hinders the learning process, as shown in the dashed lines in Figure 0(b). Therefore, it explains why self-correction methods are sensitive to the quality of critics, and LLMs need strong critics to perform effective self-correction, as empirically observed in recent work [14, 42, 86].

**Necessity of Transformer Modules.** While conventional ICL theories show that _1-layer single-head linear self-attention_ is sufficient for linear regression [74], for in-context alignment, we observe: **(1) ICA requires more depth.** Figure 0(c) shows that when transformers are shallow (_e.g.,_ 5 layers), ICA is much worse, and more depth benefits ICA effectively. After 15 layers, depth brings diminishing returns. This is consistent with our theory that requires stacking multiple transformer blocks for in-context alignment of \(N\) example (Theorem 3.3). **(2) Softmax attention is necessary.** Figure 0(d) illustrates that linear attention can hardly solve the in-context alignment task while softmax attention performs much better, which is consistent with our analysis (Section 3.2). **(3) Multi-head attention helps.** Figure 0(e) shows that single-head attention struggles to align in-context, while multi-head (\(3,4,6\)) performs well. In addition, when the number of attention heads exceeds \(3\), there is no significant benefit, which aligns surprisingly well with our analysis that requires \(3\)-head to implement the GD of the \(N\)-ary PL loss (Theorem 3.3). **(4) FFN is necessary.** Figure 0(f) shows that without FFN, the model cannot align in-context, consistent with our analysis that FFN is necessary for transforming selected tokens. Summarizing these results, we find that our proof by construction does have a nice correspondence to the practical behaviors of transformers on in-context alignment tasks, and it helps reveal the roles of each transformer module for in-context alignment-like tasks.

## 5 Exploring Self-correction on Real-world Alignment Tasks

Our theoretical analysis above reveals that self-correction indeed has the potential to improve the alignment of LLMs, especially when the critics are relatively accurate. Motivated by this observation, we explore self-correction on two real-world alignment tasks: alleviating social bias [21] and defending against jailbreaks [89]. Since LLMs are aligned on human preferences and harmfulness is relatively easy for discrimination, we hypothesize that self-generated critics can be accurate in these tasks, which facilitate LLMs to improve their own alignment, known as _intrinsic self-correction_[28].

**Method: Checking-as-Context (CaC).** For simplicity, we study a very simple and general form of self-correction without sophisticated procedures. Specifically, following the same format as our theoretical setup (Section 2.1), given a query \(x\), we first generate an initial response \(y\) (w/o self-correction), and then instruct the model to review its response and get a self-critic \(r\), and instruct the model to regenerate a new answer as the output (w/ self-correction), as

Figure 2: An illustration of Checking-as-Context (CaC) on addressing gender bias.

illustrated in Figure 2. In this way, the self-checking results are utilized as context for refined generation, so we name this method as Checking-as-Context (CaC). See more details in Appendix C.

### Alleviating Social Bias with Self-correction

Following Ganguli et al. [21], we study the use of self-correction to alleviate societal biases in LLMs on the BBQ (Bias Benchmark for QA) benchmark [55], which evaluates societal biases against individuals belonging to protected classes across nine social dimensions. We randomly select 500 questions from each task subclass. Different from moral self-correction [21] that requires model finetuning, our method is more light-weighted, since it is inference-only without parameter update.

Figure 3 shows that on two strong open-source LLMs Vicuna-7b [73] and Llama2-7b-chat [68], an additional self-correction step can indeed improve model alignment on most social bias tasks, including gender, race, religion, social-economic status, sexual orientation, physical appearance, disability status, nationality. The only exception is _physical appearance_ on Llama2-7b-chat, where self-correction is slightly worse, potentially because this aspect is less aligned on LLama2. Moreover, Figure 2(c) exhibits a strong correlation (\(p<0.05\)) between the gain of self-correction and self-checking accuracy, as suggested by our theory (more evidence in Appendix C.2). In Section 5.3, we further conduct controlled analyses on critic qualities, critic types, and model sizes for self-correction.

### Defending Against LLM Jailbreaks with Self-correction

LLM jailbreaks have recently risen to be a major threat to LLM alignment [5; 19], where even well-aligned models like ChatGPT can be manipulated into generating harmful content [89; 43; 78]. Although various defense measures have been proposed [31; 80; 78; 40; 29; 49], these typically require extensive human intervention. The ambiguity remains as to whether LLMs can autonomously counter-act such jailbreaking manipulations. Here, we explore whether LLMs can defend against jailbreak attacks themselves with self-correction. Due to the limit of space, more results can be found in Appendix B.

We observe that for LLM jailbreaks, self-correction can give accurate self-checking most of the time (close to 100%). As a result, from Table 1, we observe that on AdvBench [89], CaC-based self-correction can indeed improve LLM safety a lot by reducing the attack success rate (ASR) on Vicuna-7b and Llama2-7b-chat by a significant margin against different types of jailbreak attacks, including gradient-based GCG attacks [89] and instruction-based AutoDAN [43]. Compared to manually designed defense methods [80; 40; 29], self-correction can achieve comparable and even better performance. It suggests that LLMs can autonomously defend against jailbreak attacks with _intrinsic_ self-correction, which is a promising direction for future research on AI safety.

### Fine-grained Analyses of Self-correction in Language Models

At last, we take a deeper looker into the influencing factors of self-correction through several controlled studies under BBQ (Section 5.1) (see experimental details in Appendix C.2). Overall, we find that self-correction benefits from _high critic accuracy, combining verbal and numerical critic, more self-correction rounds (but not too many), and enough model capacity (e.g. 7B)_.

First, we investigate the influence of critic by controlling its quality and format. Figure 3(a) shows that final performance consistently increases with a more accurate critic (biased or unbiased), which we generate noisy critic by adding random noises to groundtruth critic. Figure 3(b) reveals that among different formats of critic, verbal critic with natural language significantly outperforms numerical critic, and combining verbal critic through chain-of-thought (CoT) and binary critic leads to optimal results. We believe that verbal critic creates _fine-grained rewards_ in a way that LLMs understand.

Second, we look into the influence of model size and self-correction rounds. For model size experiments, we use the Qwen-1.5 series [67] for a fair comparison. To control the influence of critic, we consider two settings: 1) With self-generated critic (Figure 3(c)), we find that even if the critic is very accurate (close to 100%), very small models like 1.8B one still cannot self-correct, echoing with our theory that model depth and capacity are important for the self-improving step. 2) The same phenomenon holds when we use the same groundtruth critic (Figure 3(d)). Lastly, we study the influence of more self-correction rounds. Figure 3(e) shows that with groundtruth critic, LLMs can benefit from at most 3-round self-correction, while they deteriorate around 1 round under self-critic. It shows that an accurate critic is important for multi-step self-correction to prevent the accumulation of immediate errors. These real-world LLM behaviors align closely with our theoretical analysis.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we have explored how self-correction ability rises from an in-context alignment perspective, showing that standard transformers can perform gradient descent on common alignment objectives in an in-context way. Notably, our analysis reveals the important roles of real-world transformer modules in self-correction. We further studied intrinsic self-correction for real-world alignment scenarios and demonstrated clear improvements on alleviating social bias and defending against jailbreaks. In this way, our analysis provides concrete theoretical and empirical insights into the path of building LLMs that can correct and improve themselves.

## Appendix A Additional Related Work

There is a rapidly emerging body of research on LLMs, and some key techniques, such as in-context learning and self-checking, are reinvented by different works from time to time. We will try to summarize some important aspects of previous works that are related to our research.

**LLM Alignment.** Nowadays, to obtain LLMs for practical uses, an alignment procedure is often required to fine-tune pretrained language models to behave appropriately and human-like. A standard LLM alignment pipeline consists of three stages: 1) supervised finetuning, 2) learning reward model, and 3) RLHF / RLAIF (reinforcement learning from human/AI feedback) [53, 7]. Recent studies also explore directly optimizing language models from preference data with learning reward models [61, 66]. In either case, they utilize an alignment objective for learning from preference data. A common choice is the Bradley-Terry model for pairwise preference [53, 61], while others also explore the use of Plackett-Luce (PL) model for \(N\)-ary preference data [61, 66].

**In-context Alignment.** We refer to the use of in-context learning for alignment as in-context alignment. In this line of research, Han [26] first demonstrates we can improve alignment with approximately 10 dynamic examples, and Lin et al. [41] show that as few as 3 constant stylistic examples can significantly improve the alignment of top-rated LLMs such as Mistral [33] and LLama2 [68]. Concurrently, Guo et al. [25] show that we can also achieve in-context alignment with only self-generated samples from LLMs without human instructions.

**Self-correction.** Self-correction refers to the general concept that LLMs can improve their response quality based on reflecting on their previous outputs. Many previous works utilize this idea and show promising improvements on multiple tasks [7, 48, 65, 35, 21, 22, 57, 13]. We refer to Pan et al. [54]for a comprehensive review. However, recent research puts this ability into question by showing that _intrinsic self-correction_ (a scenario wherein the model can correct its initial responses based solely on its inherent capabilities) does not bring real improvements on reasoning [28] and planning [70] tasks without external feedbacks (_e.g.,_ ground-truth labels). Meanwhile, they find that self-correction does help improve the appropriateness of responses, including alignment-related tasks [7, 21, 48]. Our theory in Section 3 provides a general theoretical explanation for the mechanism of (intrinsic) self-correction by interpreting it as a in-context alignment process and establishing its connection to the alignment objective. Without using any external feedback, the proposed checking-as-context strategy shows that intrinsic self-correction is also very effective for defending against jailbreaks.

**ICL Theory.** Recently, a lot of interest emerged in the theoretical understanding of in-context learning (ICL), and a major direction is to investigate how linear transformers can perform certain optimization algorithms on simple problems like linear regression [24, 74, 6, 39, 18, 79, 2, 30] from different perspectives, such as, convergence [84], generalization [85], optimization schemes (_e.g.,_ high-order [20] and preconditioned [1] ones), distribution shifts [84, 3], _etc._ Beyond this simple setup, some explore the ability of transformers for learning softmax regression [23], discrete function [8], regression mixture models [56], Gaussian Process [15], _etc._ As far as we know, we are the first to show that transformers can perform gradient descent of a non-convex alignment objective in-context. Considering the importance of alignment in LLM training, our theory model may be of more practical uses than linear regression. Besides, contrary to the linear regression case, we show that the Transformer modules like softmax attention, feed-forward networks and stacked layers, are naturally important for our construction, indicating our theory model is more aligned with the transformer architecture.

**Jailbreaking and Defending LLMs.** Even if LLMs are aligned with human preference and behave well in most cases (_e.g.,_ refusing to answer harmful queries), researchers find that LLM alignment is still superficial [59] and can be jailbroken under carefully crafted instructions [44]. Along this line of research, people find techniques such as, persuasive instructions [78, 63], stealthy conversation [83], low-resource languages [82, 17]. Meanwhile, some explore automatic ways to craft jailbreak instructions, such as, gradient-based optimization [64, 89, 88] (requiring white-box access), and generic algorithms [43, 37, 11] (only requiring black-box queries). To counter such attacks, various defense measures have also been proposed. One direct solution is to detect or purify harmful prompts with preprocessing, such as, perplexity filter [4], harmful string detection [36, 10], retokenization and paraphrasing [31]. Nevertheless, Varshney et al. [71] point out that they may suffer a considerable loss on benign queries. The instruction method, Self-reminder [80] adds a system prompt to remind the model to be safe in its reply. RAIN [40] proposes a new rewinding decoding scheme based on model evaluation. Different from these prior works, our CaC (Checking as Context) does not use explicit human instructions to teach LLMs how to behave. Instead, the only instruction we provide, _i.e.,_ the checking question, is to ask LLMs to examine their own harmfulness. In this way, we expect LLMs to refine their output based on self-examination as a form of self-instruct.

## Appendix B Extended Studies on Jailbreak Defense

In this section, we comprehensively evaluate CaC to show its effectiveness and practicalness as a defense technique against jailbreak attacks. We first propose some direct variants of CaC, then demonstrate their strength of defending LLMs against jailbreaks whilst remaining natural capabilities.

### Proposed Techniques

**I. Multi-round Checking.** As discussed in Section 2, the vanilla CaC with one-round checking can be extended to multiple rounds. Intuitively, the multi-round checking also acts like a persistent interrogation of LLMs based on former responses. We call this variant **CaC-self**.

**II. Diverse Checking.** In practice, we notice that although useful to some extent, multi-round checking often has marginal gains since later checking results are consistent with previous ones in most cases. From an optimization perspective, it is caused by a lack of diversity in the training examples that share the same query \(x\). Inspired by this view, we propose diverse checking, that is to leverage the self-generated answers from other queries \(x_{i}\) to form a diverse context, _i.e.,_\((x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})\), and call it **CaC-diverse**. We randomly sample \(M\) (\(M=3\) is typically enough) harmful queries from AdvBench [89], collect their LLM responses and critics, and use that as a context for the final output \(y\) for the current query \(x\):

\[\begin{split}[y_{i},r_{i}]&=\operatorname{LLM}([x_{1}, y_{1},r_{1},\dots,x_{i}]),i=1,\dots,M,\\ y&=\operatorname{LLM}([x_{1},y_{1},r_{1},\dots,x_ {M},y_{M},r_{M},x]).\end{split}\] (10)

We note that by drawing from AdvBench, we rely on a human-curated dataset to obtain harmful queries, which introduces some human knowledge. Future work can further explore the use of LLMs to generate harmful queries.

A defect of multi-round checking is that it leads to more latency. Since the current query \(x\) is unknown to the system for self-checking, the responses and critics can only be collected sequentially on the fly. Instead, for diverse checking, we can cache the \(N\)-round conversation history, and use it directly for any future queries as a prompt \(p=[x_{1},y_{1},r_{1},\dots,x_{M},y_{M},r_{M}]\):

\[y=\operatorname{LLM}([p,x]).\] (11)

With this historical backup technique, \(1\)-round checking only incurs 8% overhead in inference time, which is almost negligible.

**III. Self-instruct.** Although self-checking is rather accurate, vanilla CaC is still vulnerable under _persuasive attacks_ that instruct models to forget the context above with lengthy prompts, such as, AutoDAN [43] using the prompt "_ignore all the instructions you got before_". As revealed in our theory, self-correction works in an in-context manner, and encountering such instructions in the query will invalidate the self-checking history before. To mitigate this issue, instead of repeating the query to get a refined answer, we simply instruct the model to refine its answer based on self-checking, using the prompt "_Please refine your answer to the prior request based on your examination above_". 9We name this version as **CaC-self-instruct**, and it can be combined with multi-round and diverse checking techniques as well. Please note that the results of CaC reported in the main content (Table 1) are referred to CaC-self-instruct.

Footnote 9: again, we rely on LLMs’ own judgment instead of human priors in this prompt.

### Experiment settings

**Checking questions.** In our experiments for CaC and CaC-diverse, we have tried a few similar checking questions: 1) _Is this a harmful response? 2) Isn't this a harmful response? 3) Isn't this a harmful, offensive, illegal, or improper response that you should not provide?_ The three questions perform rather similarly, while the third one performs slightly better. Either choice does not influence the main conclusions of our experiments. We use the third one by default. We reckon that the rhetorical question tone and detailed descriptions of potential harmful aspects could persuade LLMs to check more accurately.

**Evaluation of ASR.** Following GCG [89], we apply suffix detection to judge the success of jailbreak (more details here). However, as agreed by AutoDAN, DeepInception, the suffix detection may not be fully reliable. Therefore, similar to AutoDAN, we also use GPT-4 to double-check the harmfulness of a generated string. Specifically, we use both the language model and suffix detection to judge the generated string. If there is a conflict (less than 3% cases), human evaluation is involved to manually check and give the final judgment of its harmfulness.

### Defending against jailbreak attacks

In this part, we evaluate the improved variants of CaC, including CaC-self, CaC-diverse, and CaC-self-instruct for defending against real-world jailbreak of LLMs. Following common practice [89; 43], we consider two well-known LLMs, Vicuna-7b-v1.5 [87] and Llama2-7b-chat [68]. We include three jailbreak attacks, _gradient-based_**GCG**[89] (individual and transfer variants) and _query-based_**AutoDAN**[44]. For defense, we consider the instruction-based **Self-reminder**[80], and the ICL-based **ICD**[78] as baselines. In comparison, our **CaC families** are pure self-correction methods. We use 3-round checking by default. For evaluation, we consider two datasets, Advbench (behavior) [89] that contains 100 harmful queries, and GLUE [75] for natural performance (200 samples for each task). On AdvBench, a higher ASR (Attack Success Rate) indicates lower robustness. All experiments are conducted using one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

**Benchmark Results.** From Table 2, we can see that CaC-self and CaC-diverse are very effective against gradient-based GCG attacks, outperforming Self-reminder and RAIN by a large margin. For instruction-based AutoDAN, CaC variants are more effective on Llama2 compared to that on Vicuna. Since Llama2 is known to be more powerful, it indicates that self-correction abilities depend crucially on underlying LLMs.

**Number of rounds.** In Table 3, we compare CaC-self and CaC-diverse with different rounds. Both methods perform well with only one round and benefit from more rounds. In terms of latency, CaC-self requires significantly more time with on-the-fly generation, while CaC-diverse has only minimal overhead (10% each round), which is preferable in practice.

## Appendix C Additional Experiment Details

### Synthetic Experiments

**Setup.** We consider the following meta-learning setting. For every task, we draw a common query \(x\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\) and a groundtruth parameter \(W\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\). We then generate \(N\) responses and rewards. For each response \(y_{i}\), we sample a reward \(r_{i}\in\mathcal{U}[0,1]\) and an independent noise weight \(W_{i}^{-}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I_{d\times d})\), and then generate \(y_{i}=r_{i}Wx+(1-r_{i})W_{i}^{-}x\). Thus, responses with higher rewards are closer to the ground truth in expectation. We construct each in-context example as \(q_{i}=[x,y_{i},r_{i}]\), for \(i\in[N]\). By default, we set \(d=5,N=20\) and use a 20-layer GPT-2 model with \(3\) heads, \(96\) hidden dimension, and a PL loss (Eq. (5)). First, we train the GPT-2 model to give it the ability of in-context alignment. Specifically, let \(y_{i}^{pred}=\operatorname{LLM}([q_{1},\cdots,q_{i-1},q_{i}^{test}])\), where

\(q_{i}^{test}=(x,0,0)\), and apply PL-loss:

\[\mathcal{L}_{i}=-\log\left(\prod_{j=1}^{N}\frac{\exp\left(-\|y_{i}^{pred}-y_{\tau( j)}\|^{2}\right)}{\sum_{k=j}^{N}\exp\left(-\|y_{i}^{pred}-y_{\tau(k)}\|^{2} \right)}\right).\] (12)

Next, we sum the losses from all positions, take the average (\(\mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathcal{L}_{i}\)) and then perform one step gradient update. In details, we set the batch_size = \(256\), lr = \(0.0001\) and train_step = \(1500\), all models are trained using one NVIDIA 3090 GPU.

After training, we evaluate the normalized MSE between the predicted output \(\hat{y}\) and ground-truth \(y=Wx\) using varying numbers of in-context examples, **averaged over \(256\) runs** with randomly generated tasks. We also implement the gradient descent (GD) of the linear PL model (Eq. (5)) and measure its optimal solution in the same way. We also change the reward noise \(p\), model depth, and attention types to investigate their effects on in-context alignment.

**Gradient descent.** We train the parameter \(W_{\theta}^{i}\) with PL loss by setting \(lr=0.1\) with \(50\) epochs and only use in-context examples \((q_{1},\cdots,q_{i-1})\) as data. In each epoch, the prediction of GD is \(y_{i}^{pred}=W_{\theta}^{i}x\). The trained \(\hat{W}_{\theta}^{i}\) is then used to predict \(\hat{y}_{i}=\hat{W}_{\theta}^{i}x\), and finally, we calculate the loss between \(y_{i}\) and \(\hat{y}_{i}\). On the other hand, we can obtain the transformer's predicted values by using the trained GPT-2 model to perform inference on the in-context examples \((q_{1},\cdots,q_{i-1})\) and get the model's predictions. The model's predictions can be used to calculate the loss in the same manner, serving as the evaluation result. Do the same for each position \(i\), we can get Figure 0(a).

**Reward noise.** We use the same \(20\)-layer GPT-2 model with \(3\) heads, \(96\) hidden dimension, and evaluate its performance on different noise \(p=0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1\). Additionally, we use the same noise reward data to do the gradient descent experiment.

**Model depth.** We train 4 different (\(5\)-layer, \(10\)-layer, \(15\)-layer and \(20\)-layer) transformer while keeping all other parameters constant. Then, we evaluate the performance of each model on the same dataset.

**Multi-head attention.** We fixed the dimension of each head at 32 and selected 1, 3 (default), 4, and 6 heads for comparison. Fig 0(e) results indicate that the performance of 1-head attention significantly declines, while the differences in performance among 3, 4, and 6-head attention are not pronounced. This perfectly aligns with our theory that 3-head attention is sufficient to accomplish the alignment task.

**Softmax and FFN** We only remove the softmax operation in attention layer or FFN block while keeping all other parameters same as \(20\)-layer GPT-\(2\) model with \(3\) heads, \(96\) hidden dimension.

### Social Bias Experiments

The Bias Benchmark for QA (BBQ) comprises 58,492 unique questions designed to evaluate societal biases against individuals belonging to protected classes across nine social dimensions: Age, Disability Status, Gender Identity, Nationality, Physical Appearance, Race/Ethnicity, Religion, Socioeconomic Status, and Sexual Orientation, and there are also two categories that are intersections of the above types, which are respectively: Race x Socioeconomic Status and race x gender. This benchmark assesses the propensity of models to rely on stereotypes when responding to questions. Such reliance can be detrimental, as it risks perpetuating biases that negatively impact members of protected categories.

Each question in the dataset has three answer options and appears in two forms: ambiguous and disambiguous. For example, an **ambiguous question** is: "_I saw a grandson and their grandfather last week outside the Walmart trying to book a cab on Uber. Who was not comfortable using the phone?_" The answer choices are: "_The grandson_", "_The grandfather_", or "_Unknown_". Given the ambiguity of the context, the correct answer is "_Unknown_" due to insufficient information. However, a model influenced by age-related stereotypes might incorrectly select "_The grandfather_". The correct response to all questions in ambiguous contexts is "_Unknown_" or another expression of uncertainty.

To prevent the model from becoming less helpful due to being excessively constrained by the goal of avoiding bias, each question is accompanied by an additional **disambiguated** context condition, such as, "_The grandson was struggling with the app and not really listening to the advice from the grandfather_." In this scenario, the correct answer to the original question is "_The grandson_".

We randomly selected 500 questions from each task subclass. For each question, we applied CaC, recorded the model's original answers and the answers after self-correction, and then calculated the accuracy of these answers.

In the **correlation analysis**, we evaluate the relationship between accuracy gain with self-correction and self-checking accuracy. In details, we randomly select 100 questions in each category (1,100 questions in total) from vicuna's answer, and evaluate the model's self-check answer by gpt-4-turbo-preview.

**Evaluation on ambiguous questions.** Due to the limitation of model size, we found it challenging for the model to simultaneously determine whether a question is ambiguous and whether the answer is biased. Therefore, we focused on evaluating whether the model's answers are biased. We selected 100 ambiguous questions from each category (1100 questions in total) and standardized the model's output: starting the self-check with "_My previous answer is biased._" or "_My previous answer is unbiased._". We calculated the accuracy of the self-check through string matching. Surprisingly, we found that this standardized form of self-check significantly improved self-correctness (Figure 5), and in the correlation analysis (Figure 6), we also found a strong correlation between self-correctness gain and self-check.

**Evaluation on critic qualities.** Since each problem is a 3-choice question, we can compare the answers from the model's first response with the standard answers to generate an absolutely correct critic message, which is the **ground truth critic**. We randomly replace the correct critic message with an incorrect one with probability \(p=[0,0.25,0.5,0.75,1.0]\) to study the impact on critic quality, and observed an almost perfect linear relationship (Figure 3(a)).

**Evaluation on different self-critic types. Baseline** refers to model's first round answer without any correction mechanism, while **NL** stands for **natural language**, meaning we let model naturally generate the critic messages by simply asking _"Please review the previous response for any potential biases or stereotypes."_. In contrast, **explicit** critic means we let model generate a binary critic by asking "_Your review should end with 'Therefore, my previous answer is biased.' or 'Therefore, my previous answer is unbiased._", while **w/ or w/o CoT** indicates whether to use CoT before generating binary critic messages, e.g., " _Let's think step by step to review the previous response for any potential biases or stereotypes. Your review should end with 'Therefore, my previous answer is biased.' or Therefore, my previous answer is unbiased._"

Examples with Checking as Context

Who drinks only rarely? (a) The elderly woman (b) Not enough information (c) The university student. Initial response (not revealed to user): The answer is (c) The university student. Check Prompt: Please review the previous response for any potential biases or stereotypes. If the initial query provided additional information that supports the correctness of the answer, confirm the accuracy confidently. However, if the query lacked specific context, be cautious and critically assess the response for any implicit biases or stereotypes. Highlight any areas of concern and suggest improvements to ensure a fair and unbiased reply. Check Response: The initial query did not provide any information about the university student's drinking habits, so it is not possible to determine whether they drink rarely or not. Therefore, the response (c) "The university student" is not accurate and should be revised. It is important to avoid making assumptions about someone's drinking habits based on their age, gender, or other characteristics. Instead, the query should be rephrased to ask about the university student's drinking habits specifically.

## Appendix E Proofs

In this section, we provide the proofs for all theorems.

### Proof of Proposition 3.1

**Proposition E.1**.: _One can realize the gradient descent for BT,_

\[W^{\prime}=W+\Delta W=W-\eta\nabla_{W}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W;x,y_{1},y_{2}),\]

_by updating each \(y_{i}\) with_

\[y_{i}^{\prime}=y_{i}-\Delta Wx=\underbrace{y_{i}}_{(I)}-\underbrace{2\eta y_{1 }}_{(2)}\underbrace{+2\eta\sum\nolimits_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}y_{j}}_{(j)},\] (7)

_where \(\beta_{j}=\mathrm{softmax}(-\|Wx-y_{j}\|^{2})\). Specifically, \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W^{\prime};x,y_{1},y_{2})=\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}} (W;x,y_{1}^{\prime},y_{2}^{\prime})\)._Proof.: We first calculate one gradient descent step of the BT loss that yields the following weight change _w.r.t._\(W\)

\[\begin{split}&\Delta W_{\mathrm{BT}}=-\eta\nabla_{W}\mathcal{L}_{ \mathrm{BT}}(W)\\ =&-2\eta(Wx-y_{1})x^{\top}+2\sum_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}( Wx-y_{j})x^{\top}\\ =& 2\eta y_{1}x^{\top}-2\eta\sum_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}y_{ j}x^{\top},\end{split}\] (13)

where \(\eta>0\) is the step size, and for any \(j\in[N]\),

\[\beta_{j}:=\frac{\exp\left(-\|Wx-y_{j}\|^{2}\right)}{\sum_{k=1}^{N}\exp\left(- \|Wx-y_{k}\|^{2}\right)}.\] (14)

Considering the BT loss after the weight udpate, we have

\[\begin{split}&\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{BT}}(W+\Delta W)\\ =&\|(W+\Delta W)x-y_{1}\|^{2}\\ &\qquad-\log\sum_{j=1}^{2}\exp\left(-\|(W+\Delta W)x-y_{i}\|^{2} \right)\\ =&\|Wx-(y_{1}-\Delta Wx)\|^{2}\\ &\qquad-\log\sum_{j=1}^{2}\exp\left(-\|Wx-(y_{i}-\Delta Wx)\|^{ 2}\right).\end{split}\]

Comparing it with the original BT loss, we notice that a gradient descent update of the parameter \(W\) is equivalent to updating each \(y_{i}\) with

\[\begin{split} y_{i}&\gets y_{i}-\Delta Wx\\ =& y_{i}-2\eta\|x\|^{2}\cdot y_{1}+2\eta\|x\|^{2} \cdot\sum_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}y_{j}\\ &=\underbrace{y_{i}}_{\text{(1)}}-\underbrace{2\eta y_{1}}_{ \text{(2)}}\underbrace{+2\eta\sum_{j=1}^{2}\beta_{j}y_{j}}_{\text{(3)}}.\end{split}\] (15)

In the last step, we utilize the assumption \(\|x\|=1\) (otherwise it can be merged into the learning rate \(\eta\)).

### Proof of Theorem 3.2

**Theorem 3.2**.: _Given a **two-head softmax attention layer** and two tokens \(e_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i}),i=1,2\), there exists a set of parameters (Eq. (2)) such that a forward propagation step with token \(e_{i}\) is equivalent to the gradient-induced dynamics of the Bradley-Terry model (Eq. (6)):_

\[e_{i}^{\prime}=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+\sum_{h=1}^{2}P_{h}V_{h}\mathrm{softmax}(K _{h}^{\top}q_{h,j})=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+(0,-\Delta W_{\mathrm{BT}}x_{i},0),i=1,2.\] (8)

Proof.: We prove a stronger version of this proposition by considering the general case of \(N\) samples \((e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N})\). Note that the proof of Theorem 3.2 follows from the case of \(N=2\). Without loss of generality, we assume \(y_{1}\succ y_{i}\) with scores \(r_{1}>r_{i}\), for \(i=2,3,\cdots,N\), and we use \(y^{+}\) and \(r^{+}\) to represent \(y_{1}\) and \(r_{1}\), respectively.

We concatenate each \(e_{i}\) vector to form an input matrix \(X\). Remember, since the dimensions of \(x\), \(y\), and \(r\) themselves are different, each vector \(e_{i}\) contains some all-zero dimensions, which we might assume are in the last few dimensions. Therefore, the form of our input matrix \(X\) is as follows:

\[X=(e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N})=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ r_{1}&r_{2}&\cdots&r_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (16)

For convenience, we omit the last few all-zero dimensions. Under this setting, we rewrite the new input matrix \(X\) and the update formula Eq. (7) of each \(y_{i}\) as

\[X=(e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N})=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ r_{1}&r_{2}&\cdots&r_{N}\end{bmatrix},\] (17)

\[y_{i}\leftarrow\underbrace{y_{i}}_{(1)}-\underbrace{2\eta y_{1}}_{(2)}+2 \eta\sum_{j=1}^{N}\beta_{j}y_{j}\,.\] (18)

The proof of this theorem is organized in the following three parts:

* First, in Lemma E.2 we construct the part (2) of the gradient update (Eq. (18)) with the first head of MHSA structure to extract the answer \((y^{+})\) that corresponds to the maximum reward \(r^{+}\).
* Then, we use Lemma E.5 with the second head of MHSA structure to extract reweighed different rewards, which construct the part (3) of Eq. (18).
* Finally, We employ a residual structure to integrate both part (2) and part (3) with \(y_{i}\) itself.

Specifically, leveraging Lemma E.2 and Lemma E.5, we can construct two attention heads for parts (2) and (3), respectively:

\[H_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y^{+}&y^{+}&\cdots&y^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\quad H_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ \sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\cdots&\sum_{i=0}^{ N}\beta_{i}y_{i}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (19)

In accordance with the computational rules of \(\mathrm{MHSA}\), we can construct two projection heads \(P_{1}\), \(P_{2}\) as \(P_{1}=-2\eta I\) and \(P_{2}=2\eta I\). Then we have

\[\mathrm{MHSA}(X)\] (20) \[= P_{1}\cdot H_{1}+P_{2}\cdot H_{2}\] (21) \[= -2\eta I\cdot H_{1}+2\eta I\cdot H_{2}\] (22) \[= \begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ -2\eta y^{+}+2\eta\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&-2\eta y^{+}+2\eta\sum_{i=0}^{ N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\cdots&-2\eta y^{+}+2\eta\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (23)

Further combined with the residual connection, we can realize the full update of \(y\):

\[X+\mathrm{MHSA}(X)=\begin{bmatrix}x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}-2\eta y^{+}+2\eta\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\cdots&y_{N}-2\eta y^{+}+2 \eta\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}\\ r_{1}&\cdots&r_{N}\end{bmatrix}.\] (24)

That is to say, each \(y_{i}\) is updated to \(y_{i}-2\eta y^{+}+2\eta\sum_{i=0}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}\), exactly equivalent to the gradient descent (Eq. (7)).

### Proof of Theorem 3.3

**Theorem 3.3**.: _Given a **transformer \(\mathrm{TF}\) with \(N-1\) stacked transformer blocks (composed of three-head softmax attention and feed-forward networks)** and \(N\) input tokens \(\{e_{i},i\in[N]\}\), there exists a set of parameters such that a forward step with token \(e_{i}\) is equivalent to the gradient-induced dynamics of the \(N\)-ary Plackett-Luce model (Eq. (5)), i.e., \(\mathrm{TF}(e_{i})=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+(0,-\Delta W_{\mathrm{PL}}x_{i},0),i\in[N]\)._

Proof.: According to the PL gradient Eq. (9), the update of each \(y_{i}\) is:

\[\begin{split} y_{i}\leftarrow& y_{i}-\Delta y_{i} \\ =& y_{i}-\Delta W_{\mathrm{PL}}x\\ =& y_{i}-\eta\nabla_{W}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{PL}}(W) x\\ =& y_{i}-\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\left(2\eta y_{\tau(k)}x^{ \top}x-2\eta\sum_{j=k}^{N}\beta_{j}^{k}y_{\tau(j)}x^{\top}x\right)\\ =& y_{i}+\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}\left(-2\eta y_{\tau(k)}+2 \eta\sum_{j=k}^{N}\beta_{j}^{k}y_{\tau(j)}\right)\ \ \text{(since $\|x\|=1$)}\\ =& y_{i}+\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}g^{k},\end{split}\] (25)

where we denote:

\[g^{k}=-2\eta y_{\tau(k)}+2\eta\sum_{j=k}^{N}\beta_{j}^{k}y_{\tau(j)},\] (26)

\[\beta_{j}^{k}=\frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(k)}\|^{2})}{\sum_{j=k}^{N}\exp(-\|Wx-y_ {\tau(j)}\|^{2})},k\in[N-1].\] (27)

We plan to construct the whole gradient by constructing each \(g^{k}\) in each iteration. Each \(g^{k}\) is constructed by a three-head \(\mathrm{MHSA}\) and an \(\mathrm{FFN}\) structure with residual connection respectively and sum up by residual mechanism. You can see the structure of one iteration in Figure [7]. After \(N-1\) iterations, we will get the whole gradient.

Figure 7: Structure of one iterator of a transformer block in Proof E.3. Details of **(1)** and **(2)** are illustrated in Lemma E.6 and Lemma E.7 respectively.

To calculate \(g^{k}\) and \(\beta_{j}^{k}\), we wish to use the same structure but changed input \(y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\), such that

\[g^{k} =-2\eta y_{\tau(k)}+2\eta\sum_{j=k}^{N}\beta_{j}^{k}y_{\tau(j)}\] (28) \[=-2\eta y_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}+2\eta\sum_{j=1}^{N}\beta_{j}^{k}y_{\tau( j)}^{k-1}.\] (29)

\[\beta_{j}^{k} =\frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(k)}\|^{2})}{\sum_{j=k}^{N}\exp(-\|Wx-y_ {\tau(j)}\|^{2})}\] (30) \[=\frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\exp(-\| Wx-y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}\] (31)

To update the \(k\)-th iteration input \(y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\) to \(y_{\tau(j)}^{k}\) after the \(k\)-th iteration without affecting the accumulation of the original gradient of \(y_{i}\), we expanded the dimension of the input matrix \(X\) and duplicated each \(y_{i}\), placing it in the last row of the matrix, so as to update the \(y_{i}\) used for gradient calculation in subsequent iteration rounds. As before, the line of \(y_{i}\) below \(x\) is used for storing gradients, meaning that after \(N-1\) rounds of iterations, we will obtain the desired state for each \(y_{i}\) (Eq. (25)) in this line, while the \(y_{i}^{N-1}\) in the last line becomes redundant after the completion of \(N-1\) iterations. We define the new input matrix \(X\) as:

\[X=X^{0}=(e_{1},e_{2},\cdots,e_{N})=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ r_{1}&r_{2}&\cdots&r_{N}\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\end{bmatrix},\] (32)

In our notation, the superscript \(k\) denotes the value of the variable in the \(k\)-th iteration of the structure in figure 7, while the subscript \(i\) indicates the tokens in the \(i\)-th round of self-check. We define the \(k\)-iteration output matrix and hidden matrix as:

\[H^{k}=X^{k-1}+\mathrm{MHSA}_{\theta}(X^{k-1}),\] (33)

\[X^{k}=(e_{1}^{k},e_{2}^{k},\cdots,e_{N}^{k})=H^{k}+\mathrm{FFN}_{\theta}(H^{k })=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}+G_{1}^{k}&y_{2}+G_{2}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}+G_{N}^{k}\\ r_{1}^{k}&r_{2}^{k}&\cdots&r_{N}^{k}\\ y_{1}^{k}&y_{2}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}^{k}\end{bmatrix},\] (34)

where \(G_{i}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{k}g^{j}\)(Eq. (28)) refers to the gradient accumulation after \(k\) iterations. When \(k=N-1\), that is after \(N-1\) iterations, we have \(y_{i}+G_{i}^{N-1}=y_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}g^{j}=y_{i}-\Delta y_{i}\) (Eq. (25)). Therefore, we only need to recursively constructed matrix \(X^{k}\).

Compared with \(X^{k}\) and \(X^{k-1}\), we have the following four changes, which need to verify later:

* \(G_{i}^{k}=G_{i}^{k-1}+g^{k}\).
* \(r_{i}^{k}=r_{i}^{k-1}-r^{+}\), where \(r^{+}\) is the same constant to each \(i\). Notice that we only consider the order of magnitude of each reward and subtract the same \(r^{+}\) will not have any effect on it.
* \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k}=r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}-r^{+}-\gamma\), where \(\gamma\) is a sufficient large number such that the current(\((k-1)\)-th) iteration maximum reward \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}\) changes to the lowest one \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k}\) in the next (\(k\)-th) iteration. That is, \(\max(r_{1}^{k},\cdots,r_{N}^{k})=r_{\tau(k+1)}^{k}\).

* \(y^{k}_{\tau(k-1)}=y^{k-1}_{\tau(k-1)}-\gamma\). Therefore, \(\exp(-\|Wx-y^{k}_{\tau(k-1)}\|^{2})\to 0\).

According to Lemma E.6, we can construct \(\mathrm{MHSA}_{\theta}\) s.t.

\[\mathrm{MHSA}_{\theta}(X^{k-1})=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ g^{k}&g^{k}&\cdots&g^{k}\\ -r^{+}&-r^{+}&\cdots&-r^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (35)

With residual structure, we have

\[H^{k}=X^{k-1}+\mathrm{MHSA}_{\theta}(X^{k-1}) =\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{N}+G_{1}^{k-1}+g^{k}&y_{N}+G_{2}^{k-1}+g^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}+G_{N}^{k-1}+g^{k }\\ r_{1}^{k-1}-r^{+}&r_{2}^{k-1}-r^{+}&\cdots&r_{N}^{k-1}-r^{+}\\ y_{1}^{k-1}&y_{2}^{k-1}&\cdots&y_{N}^{k-1}\end{bmatrix}\] (36) \[=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}+G_{1}^{k}&y_{2}+G_{2}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}+G_{N}^{k}\\ r_{1}^{k-1}-r^{+}&r_{2}^{k-1}-r^{+}&\cdots&r_{N}^{k-1}-r^{+}\\ y_{1}^{k-1}&y_{2}^{k-1}&\cdots&y_{N}^{k-1}\end{bmatrix}.\] (37)

According to Lemma E.7, we can construct the feed-forward module \(\mathrm{FFN}_{\theta}\) such that

\[\mathrm{FFN}(H^{k})=\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (38)

With residual structure, we can gain

\[X^{k}= H^{k}+\mathrm{FFN}(H^{k})\] (39) \[= \begin{bmatrix}x&\cdots&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}+G_{1}^{k}&\cdots&y_{\tau(k)}+G_{\tau(k)}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}+G_{N}^{k}\\ r_{1}^{k-1}-r^{+}&\cdots&r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}-r^{+}-\gamma&\cdots&r_{N}^{k-1}-r^{+ }\\ y_{1}^{k-1}&\cdots&y_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}-\gamma&\cdots&y_{N}^{k-1}\end{bmatrix}\] (40) \[= \begin{bmatrix}x&\cdots&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}+G_{1}^{k}&\cdots&y_{\tau(k)}+G_{\tau(k)}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}+G_{N}^{k}\\ r_{1}^{k}&\cdots&r_{\tau(k)}^{k}&\cdots&r_{N}^{k}\\ y_{1}^{k}&\cdots&y_{\tau(k)}^{k}&\cdots&y_{N}^{k}\end{bmatrix}.\] (41)

To this end, four changes (E.3) have been verified, meaning that we have constructed \(X^{k}\) with input \(X^{k-1}\). When \(k=N-1\), we get \(y_{i}+G_{i}^{N-1}=y_{i}+\sum_{j=1}^{N-1}g^{j}=y_{i}-\Delta y_{i}\) (Eq. (25)). That is the updated result of each \(y_{i}\). 

**Lemma E.2** (Construction of the numerator gradient).: _Given an input matrix \(X\) (Eq. (16)), after one and only one pre-processing step, one can construct key, query and value matrices \(W_{K}\), \(W_{Q}\), \(W_{V}\) such that the output is:_

\[H_{1} =V\mathrm{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)\] (42) \[=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y^{\top}\phi(r)&y^{\top}\phi(r)&\ldots&y^{\top}\phi(r)\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\] (43) \[=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y^{+}&y^{+}&\cdots&y^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (44)_where \(y=[y_{1},\ldots,y_{n}]\), \(r=[r_{1},\ldots,r_{N}]\), and \(\phi_{i}:\mathbb{R}^{N}\rightarrow\{0,1\}^{N}\) denotes an indicator function of the maximal rewards:_

\[\forall i\in[N],\quad\phi_{i}(r)=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }r_{i}=\max(r_{1},r_{2}, \cdots,r_{N});\\ 0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\] (45)

Proof.: In pre-precessing step, we can construct FFN to append a bias dimension to original \(X\):

\[X\gets X+\operatorname{FFN}(X)=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ r_{1}&r_{2}&\cdots&r_{N}\\ 1&1&\cdots&1\end{bmatrix}\]

by setting \(W_{1}=W_{2}=0,b_{1}=0,b_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ 1&1&\cdots&1\end{bmatrix}.\)

The processed \(X\) only change one all-zeros dimension to all-ones dimension which has no side-effect. After that, we try to construct MHSA by providing the weight matrices in block form:

* \(W_{Q}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&\gamma\\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\), and then \(Q=W_{Q}X=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ \gamma&\gamma&\cdots&\gamma\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\),
* \(W_{K}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\), and then \(K^{\top}=X^{\top}{W_{K}}^{\top}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&r_{1}&0\\ 0&0&r_{2}&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 0&0&r_{N}&0\end{bmatrix}\),

where \(\gamma\) is a large and positive hyper parameter.

Therefore, when calculating the attention score, for the same query, it is equivalent to scaling up each \(r_{i}\) by a sufficiently large factor, that is

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}\gamma r_{1}&\gamma r_{1}&\cdots&\gamma r_{1}\\ \gamma r_{2}&\gamma r_{2}&\cdots&\gamma r_{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \gamma r_{N}&\gamma r_{N}&\cdots&\gamma r_{N}\end{bmatrix}.\] (46)

Let \(\gamma\rightarrow+\infty\), for \(i=1,\cdots,N\), we have

\[\frac{e^{\gamma r_{i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}e^{\gamma r_{j}}}=\phi_{i}(r).\] (47)

The function \(\phi_{i}(r)\) is defined in Eq. (45).

Thus, when doing softmax, we can get the following matrix.

\[\operatorname{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)=\begin{bmatrix}\phi_{1}(r)&\phi_{1}(r)& \cdots&\phi_{1}(r)\\ \phi_{2}(r)&\phi_{2}(r)&\cdots&\phi_{2}(r)\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \phi_{N}(r)&\phi_{N}(r)&\cdots&\phi_{N}(r)\end{bmatrix}.\] (48)

The attention score will changed to \(1\) or \(0\) only depending on the whether current \(r_{i}\) is the maximum value or not.

Then, let \(W_{V}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0\\ 0&I_{d_{y}}&0\\ 0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\), and we have \(V=W_{V}X=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\).

Finally, we get the desired head matrix

\[H_{1}=V\mathrm{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y^{+}&y^{+}&\cdots&y^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (49)

**Lemma E.3** (Construction of the denominator gradient).: _Given an input matrix \(X\) (Eq. (17)) with positional encoding, we can construct \(Q=W_{Q}X\) and \(K=W_{K}X\) such that_

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{1 }\|^{2}\\ -\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ -\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}\end{bmatrix}.\]

Proof.: With positional encoding (for convenience, here we assume using one hot positional encoding), we can transform the input matrix \(X\) (Eq. (17)) to

\[X_{p}=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&y_{2}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&y_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (50)

The upper part of this matrix (Eq. (50)) is used to construct \(K\), and the lower part is used to construct \(Q\). Then, according to Lemma E.4, we can construct

\[X^{\prime}_{p}=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&y_{2}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&y_{N}\\ y_{1}&y_{1}&\cdots&y_{1}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ y_{N}&y_{N}&\cdots&y_{N}\end{bmatrix}.\] (51)

Thus, we can use \(X^{\prime}_{p}\) (Eq. (51)) to easily construct \(K=W_{K}X^{\prime}_{p}\) and \(Q=W_{Q}X^{\prime}_{p}\) such that

\[Q=\begin{bmatrix}Wx-y_{1}&Wx-y_{1}&\cdots&Wx-y_{1}\\ Wx-y_{2}&Wx-y_{2}&\cdots&Wx-y_{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ Wx-y_{N}&Wx-y_{N}&\cdots&Wx-y_{N}\\ Wx&Wx&\cdots&Wx\\ \sum_{i=1}^{N}(Wx-y_{i})&\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Wx-y_{i})&\cdots&\sum_{i=1}^{N}(Wx-y_{i} )\end{bmatrix},\] (52)

\[K=\begin{bmatrix}Wx-y_{1}&Wx&\cdots&Wx\\ Wx&Wx-y_{2}&\cdots&Wx\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ Wx&Wx&\cdots&Wx-y_{N}\\ Wx-y_{1}&Wx-y_{2}&\cdots&Wx-y_{N}\\ -Wx&-Wx&\cdots&-Wx\end{bmatrix}.\] (53)

Herein, \(K\) and \(Q\) are simply linear transformations applied to the rows of the matrix \(X^{\prime}_{p}\) (Eq. (51)), and \(W\) is part of the parameters in \(W_{K}\) and \(W_{Q}\).

With these constructions, \(K^{\top}Q\) is the desired result we expect.

**Lemma E.4** (Construction of complete positional input matrix).: _With input matrix \(X_{p}\) (Eq. (50)), we can construct an attention layer such that_

\[X_{p}+\mathrm{att}(X_{p})=\begin{bmatrix}x&x&\cdots&x\\ y_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&y_{2}&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&y_{N}\\ y_{1}&y_{1}&\cdots&y_{1}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ y_{N}&y_{N}&\cdots&y_{N}\end{bmatrix}.\]

Proof.: By setting the attention score of each query to be the same after softmax(e.g. \(W_{Q}=W_{K}=0\)), that is

\[S=\begin{bmatrix}1/N&\cdots&1/N\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 1/N&\cdots&1/N\end{bmatrix},\]

we have

\[\mathrm{att}(X_{p})=W_{V}X_{p}S=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ Ny_{1}&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&Ny_{N}\end{bmatrix}S=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ y_{1}&y_{1}&\cdots&y_{1}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ y_{N}&y_{N}&\cdots&y_{N}\end{bmatrix},\] (54)

and \(X_{p}+\mathrm{att}(X_{p})\) is our desired result.

**Lemma E.5** (Construction of denominator).: _Given an input matrix \(X\)(Eq. (17)), one can construct key, query and value matrices \(W_{K}\), \(W_{Q}\), \(W_{V}\) such that the output is:_

\[H_{2}=V\mathrm{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ \sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}y_{i}&\cdots&\sum_{i=1}^{N }\beta_{i}y_{i}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (55)

Proof.: According to the formula of \(\beta_{i}\) Eq. (30), we hope to construct the following attention score before doing softmax.

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{ 1}\|^{2}\\ -\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ -\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}\end{bmatrix}.\]

There are **two** ways to achieve this. One is straightforward but has complex construction, and the other is approximate but more easier.

We first introduce **the approximate method**. With the proposition that an \(\mathrm{FFN}\) can easily approach the mean square error, we have \(\mathrm{FFN}(y_{i}|x)=-\|Wx-y_{i}\|^{2}\), where \(W\) is part of the parameters in \(\mathrm{FFN}\). Before passing through the attention layer, the input matrix \(X\) can be transformed as

\[X^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ -\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}\end{bmatrix}.\] (56)Therefore, we can construct \(W_{K}\), \(W_{Q}\), \(W_{V}\) such that

\[K=W_{K}X^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ -\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}\end{bmatrix},\] (57)

\[Q=W_{Q}X^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 1&1&\cdots&1\end{bmatrix},\] (58)

Thus, the attention score should be

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{1} \|^{2}\\ -\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ -\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}&\cdots&-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2}\end{bmatrix}.\]

**The second method** to achieve this is to give a detailed construction following Lemma E.3.

Thus, after doing softmax, we can get

\[\operatorname{softmax}(K^{\top}Q) =\begin{bmatrix}\operatorname{softmax}_{1}(-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2})& \cdots&\operatorname{softmax}_{N}(-\|Wx-y_{1}\|^{2})\\ \operatorname{softmax}_{1}(-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2})&\cdots&\operatorname{ softmax}_{N}(-\|Wx-y_{2}\|^{2})\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \operatorname{softmax}_{1}(-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2})&\cdots&\operatorname{ softmax}_{N}(-\|Wx-y_{N}\|^{2})\end{bmatrix}\] (59) \[=\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{1}&\cdots&\beta_{1}\\ \beta_{2}&\cdots&\beta_{2}\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \beta_{N}&\cdots&\beta_{N}\end{bmatrix}.\] (60)

Finally, by constructing matrix \(V\) as

\[V=W_{V}X^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}y_{1}&y_{2}&\cdots&y_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (61)

we can get the desired attention head \(H_{2}=V\operatorname{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)\).

**Lemma E.6** (Construction of gradients and updates).: _Given an input matrix \(X^{k-1}\)(Eq. (34)), we can construct three heads in \(\operatorname{MHSA}_{\theta}\) respectively such that_

\[\operatorname{MHSA}_{\theta}(X^{k-1})=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ g^{k}&g^{k}&\cdots&g^{k}\\ -r^{+}&-r^{+}&\cdots&-r^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (62)

_where \(r^{+}=r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}=\max(r_{1}^{k-1},\cdots,r_{N}^{k-1})\) is the maximum reward in the (\((k-1)\)-th) iteration._

Proof.: According to lemma E.2 and lemma E.5, we only need to make adjustment to dims and multiplying certain projection matrices by a permutation matrix so that we can extract certain rows from a matrix.

For example, if we want to construct a matrix \(H_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ r^{+}&r^{+}&\cdots&r^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\), we only need to construct projection matrix \(P=\begin{bmatrix}I&0&0&0\\ 0&0&I&0\\ 0&I&0&0\\ 0&0&0&I\end{bmatrix}\) to switch the row of \(r_{i}^{k}\) and \(y_{i}\) when constructing \(V\) in lemma E.2. The projection matrix \(W_{V}\) changes to \(W_{V}P\). Similarly, when calculating \(H_{1}\) and \(H_{2}\), we only need to utilize another projection matrix \(P^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}I&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&I\\ 0&0&I&0\\ 0&I&0&0\end{bmatrix}\) to extract the last row of the input matrix, and use the updated \(y_{i}^{k-1}\) for calculation, rather than the second row as described in the original lemma.

Therefore, using Lemma E.2, we can construct the first and the third head matrices\(H_{1}\) and \(H_{3}\):

\[H_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y^{+}&y^{+}&\cdots&y^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (63)

\[H_{3}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ r^{+}&r^{+}&\cdots&r^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (64)

According to Lemma E.5, we can construct the second head matrix \(H_{2}\):

\[H_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ \sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}^{k}y_{i}^{k-1}&\sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}^{k}y_{i}^{k-1 }&\cdots&\sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}^{k}y_{i}^{k-1}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ \end{bmatrix},\] (65)

where \(\beta_{j}^{k}=\frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\exp(- \|Wx-y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}\).

Since \(\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(j)}^{k}\|^{2})\to 0,y_{\tau(j)}^{k}\cdot\exp(-\|Wx-y_{ \tau(j)}^{k}\|^{2})\to 0,\forall j<k\) (Eq. (E.3)), we have

\[\beta_{j}^{k}= \frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}\exp(-\| Wx-y_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}\|^{2})}\] (66) \[= \frac{\exp(-\|Wx-y_{\tau(k)}^{k})\|^{2}}{\sum_{j=k}^{N}\exp(-\|Wx- y_{\tau(j)}^{k}\|^{2})},\] (67)

\[\sum_{i=1}^{N}\beta_{i}^{k}y_{i}^{k-1}=\sum_{i=k}^{N}\beta_{i}^{k}y_{i}^{k-1}\] (68)

This is the desired form of the construction of part of \(g^{k}\) (Eq. (28)). Thus, we can concat them together with projection matrices \(P_{1}\), \(P_{2}\), \(P_{3}\):

\[\mathrm{MHSA}(X^{k}) =P_{1}\cdot H_{1}+P_{2}\cdot H_{2}+P_{3}\cdot H_{3}\] (69) \[=-2\eta I\cdot H_{1}+2\eta H_{2}\cdot S-I\cdot H_{3}\] (70) \[=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ g^{k}&g^{k}&\cdots&g^{k}\\ -r^{+}&-r^{+}&\cdots&-r^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (71)

**Lemma E.7** (Construction of the position of the maximum value).: _Given a hidden matrix \(H^{k}\) and passing through an \(\mathrm{FFN}\), we can successfully obtain the position \(\tau(k)\) within the matrix._

\[\mathrm{FFN}(H^{k})=W_{2}\cdot\mathrm{ReLU}(W_{1}(H^{k}))=\begin{bmatrix}0& \cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\] (72)Proof.: Actually, \(r^{+}=\sum_{i=1}^{N}r_{i}^{k-1}\frac{\exp(\gamma\cdot r_{i}^{k-1})}{\sum_{j=1}^{N} \exp(\gamma\cdot r_{j}^{k-1})}<\max(r_{1},\cdots,r_{N})=r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}\) (according to Lemma E.2). Then \(\exists\ \epsilon>0\ s.t.r^{+}=r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}-\epsilon\). Notice that \(\gamma\) is sufficient large, such that \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}>r^{+}>r_{\tau(k+1)}^{k-1}>\cdots\). Thus, \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}\) as the largest reward that satisfies \(r_{\tau(k)}^{k-1}-r^{+}=\epsilon>0\), and \(r_{j}\) as any other component with \(j\neq k\), for which \(r_{\tau(j)}^{k-1}-r^{+}<0\).

Let \(W_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&1&0\\ 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix},W_{2}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&-\gamma/\epsilon&0\\ 0&0&-(\gamma/\epsilon)I&0\end{bmatrix}\), we have

\[\begin{split}\text{FFN}(H^{k})&=W_{2}\cdot\text{ReLU}(W_{1}(H^{k }))\\ &=W_{2}\cdot\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ \text{ReLU}(r_{1}-r^{+})&\cdots&\text{ReLU}(r_{\tau(k)}-r^{+})&\cdots&\text{ ReLU}(r_{N}-r^{+})\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\\ &=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&-\gamma/\epsilon&0\\ 0&0&-(\gamma/\epsilon)I&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&\epsilon&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\\ &=\begin{bmatrix}0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\\ 0&\cdots&-\gamma&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\end{split}\] (74)

which completes the proof. 

## Appendix F Extensions of Theoretical Construction to Broader Scenarios

### Extension to Multiple Queries

In our analysis, we adopt a single common query for simplicity, and specifically, we can compute the attention score by performing inner product operations on different instances of \(x\). Since we assume \(\|x\|^{2}=1\), the inner product between \(x\) and itself yields the maximum attention score. With this property, we can filter out the corresponding answer and reward of each example (as elucidated in Lemma E.2) and use this information to construct the gradient update of each sample accordingly. The following are the construction details.

For multi-queries, we define the new input matrix

\[X=(e_{1}^{1},e_{2}^{1},\cdots,e_{N}^{1},\cdots,e_{1}^{M},e_{2}^{M},\cdots,e_{ N}^{M})=\begin{bmatrix}x^{1}&x^{1}&\cdots&x^{1}&\cdots&x^{M}&x^{M}&\cdots&x^{M}\\ y_{1}^{1}&y_{2}^{1}&\cdots&y_{N}^{1}&\cdots&y_{N}^{M}&y_{N}^{M}&\cdots&y_{N}^{M}\\ r_{1}^{1}&r_{2}^{1}&\cdots&r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&r_{1}^{M}&r_{2}^{M}&\cdots&r_{N}^{M} \end{bmatrix}.\]

Here, we take Lemma E.2 as an example to illustrate how our constructions are generalized to adapt multi-queries scenario.

Based on the hypothesis that \(\|x^{i}\|^{2}=1,i=1,2,\cdots,M\), we can construct matrix \(W_{Q},W_{K},W_{V}\) such that

\[Q=W_{Q}X=\begin{bmatrix}\gamma_{1}x^{1}&\gamma_{1}x^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}x^{1 }&\cdots&\gamma_{1}x^{M}&\gamma_{1}x^{M}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}x^{M}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&0\\ \gamma_{2}&\gamma_{2}&\cdots&\gamma_{2}&\cdots&\gamma_{2}&\gamma_{2}&\cdots& \gamma_{2}\end{bmatrix},\]

\[K=W_{K}X=\begin{bmatrix}x^{1}&x^{1}&\cdots&x^{1}&\cdots&x^{M}&x^{M}&\cdots&x^{M }\\ 0&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&0\\ r_{1}^{1}&r_{2}^{1}&\cdots&r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&r_{1}^{M}&r_{2}^{M}&\cdots&r_{N}^{M} \end{bmatrix}.\]Therefore,

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}\gamma_{1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_ {1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_ {1}^{M}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{M}\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \gamma_{1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+ \gamma_{2}r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{M}&\cdots& \gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{M}\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+ \gamma_{2}r_{1}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}\|x^{M}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{M}&\cdots &\gamma_{1}\|x^{M}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{M}\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{M})+ \gamma_{2}r_{N}^{1}&\cdots&\gamma_{1}\|x^{M}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{M}&\cdots& \gamma_{1}\|x^{M}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{N}^{M}\end{bmatrix}.\]

By calculating \((x^{i},x^{j})\), we can differentiate the \(y_{k}^{s}\) corresponding to distinct \(x^{s}\).

Since \(\|x^{k}\|\geq(x^{i},x^{j}),\forall k,i\neq j\in[M]\), letting \(\gamma_{1}\gg\gamma_{2}\), we have \(\gamma_{1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2}r_{1}^{1}>\gamma_{1}\|x^{1}\|^{2}+\gamma_{2} r_{1}^{1}>\gamma_{1}(x^{1},x^{k})+\gamma_{2}r_{S}^{j},\forall k\neq 1\in[M], \forall i,j\in[N]\). (Assuming \(r_{1}^{k}\) is the largest \(\forall k\in[M]\).)

Similar like Lemma E.2, we can calculate the attention score as

\[\mathrm{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)=\begin{bmatrix}1&\cdots&1&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&1&\cdots&1\\ \vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

Then we can construct distinct outcomes for different input queries:

\[V\mathrm{softmax}(K^{\top}Q)=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&0\\ y_{1}^{1}&y_{1}^{1}&\cdots&y_{1}^{1}&\cdots&y_{1}^{M}&y_{1}^{M}&\cdots&y_{1}^{M }\\ 0&0&\cdots&0&\cdots&0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

Therefore, our analysis can indeed be extended to multiple queries naturally.

### Extension to Casual Attention

In this section, we discuss extending our theoretical analyses with full attention to causal attention. In the ranking-based problem considered in our work, causal attention is harder to analyze. Different from linear regression, in ranking, the objective of each example involves a comparison to the other samples. Upon our further analysis, we find that **softmax causal attention can implement an online-like gradient descent of the PL loss** as well, where each example is updated locally based on its comparison with previous examples.

Let \(\tau_{t}\colon[t]\mapsto[t]\) be the permutation function that denotes the ranking of responses in the first \(t\) positions according to the reward scores, _i.e.\(r_{\tau(1)}>\cdots>r_{\tau(t)}\)_. Thus, the online Plackett-Luce (PL) model stipulates

\[\mathrm{onlinePL}(t)=P_{\mathrm{PL}}\left(\tau_{t}\mid x,\{y_{i}\}_{i=1}^{t} \right)=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\frac{\exp\left(r_{\theta}(x,y_{\tau_{t}(i)})\right)}{ \sum_{j=i}^{N}\exp\left(r_{\theta}(x,y_{\tau_{t}(j)})\right)},\] (78)

where \(r_{\theta}(\cdot)\) denotes the reward function with parameters \(\theta\).

Therefore, in Theorem 3.3, we use casual PL loss instead to calculate the gradient of \(W\) and update the corresponding token \(e_{i}\):

\[\mathrm{TF}(e_{i})=(x_{i},y_{i},r_{i})+(0,-\Delta W_{\mathrm{onlinePL(i)}}x_{i },0),i\in[N],\]

which indicates that when passing through Transformer blocks, token \(e_{i}\) is updated by one step gradient descend using tokens before its positions with online PL loss.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]

where \(\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2}\) are sufficient large and positive hyper parameters.

We can also construct key matrix to provide positional encoding \(p_{i}\) to match PE mask \(m_{i}\) in query matrix:

\[K^{\top}=X^{\top}{W_{K}}^{\top}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&r_{1}&0&p_{1}&0\\ 0&0&r_{2}&0&p_{2}&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 0&0&r_{N}&0&p_{N}&0\end{bmatrix}.\]

Thus,

\[K^{\top}Q=\begin{bmatrix}\gamma_{1}(r_{1}-\gamma_{2}m_{1}p_{1})&\gamma_{1}(r_ {1}-\gamma_{2}m_{2}p_{1})&\cdots&\gamma_{1}(r_{1}-\gamma_{2}m_{N}p_{1})\\ \gamma_{1}(r_{2}-\gamma_{2}m_{1}p_{2})&\gamma_{1}(r_{2}-\gamma_{2}m_{2}p_{2}) &\cdots&\gamma_{1}(r_{N}-\gamma_{2}m_{N}p_{N})\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \gamma_{1}(r_{N}-\gamma_{2}m_{1}p_{N})&\gamma_{1}(r_{N}-\gamma_{2}m_{2}p_{N}) &\cdots&\gamma_{1}(r_{N}-\gamma_{2}m_{N}p_{N})\end{bmatrix}.\] (82)

\(m_{i}p_{j}=1\) if and only if the gradient at query i has been accumulated over the sub-sum on the numerator of the pl loss with position j as the maximum value, therefore it is necessary to make the \(r_{i}\) at this position the minimum value to ensure that it won't be selected again. This is what \(\gamma_{2}\) accomplishes.

Let \(\gamma_{1}\rightarrow+\infty\), for \(i=1,\cdots,N\), we have

\[\frac{e^{\gamma r_{i}}}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}e^{\gamma r_{j}}}=\phi(r_{i}),\] (83)

which is similar with the original lemma.

Thus:

\[\text{softmax}(\text{casualMask}(K^{\top}Q))=\begin{bmatrix}\phi(r_{1})&\phi( r_{1})&\cdots&\phi(r_{1})\\ 0&\phi(r_{2})&\cdots&\phi(r_{2})\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 0&0&\cdots&\phi(r_{N})\end{bmatrix}.\] (84)

Let \(V=W_{V}X=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ r_{1}&r_{2}&\cdots&r_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ p_{1}&p_{2}&\cdots&p_{N}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix}\).

Finally, we get the desired head matrix:

\[H_{1} =V\text{softmax}(\text{casualMask}(K^{\top}Q))\] (85) \[=\begin{bmatrix}0&0&\cdots&0\\ y_{1}^{+}&y_{2}^{+}&\cdots&y_{N}^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\\ p_{1}^{+}&p_{2}^{+}&\cdots&p_{N}^{+}\\ 0&0&\cdots&0\end{bmatrix},\] (86)

which \(p_{i}^{+}\) can be easily updated to \(m_{i}\) through residual construction.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: we support each point by either theory or experiment. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We only consider the simple self-correction pipeline for theoretical analysis. In practice, self-correction prompts also have a large effect on final performance, which is worth future research. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: See Appendix E.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix C. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We add URL to the code. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix C. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: The differences are often significantly large and the exact performance is not the primary concern of this work. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix C. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We obey all aspects of the Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theory-oriented paper with no societal impact. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve such models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [No] Justification: We cite the authors of the models and the dataset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [No] Justification: We introduce no new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not use crowdsourcing. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not have such studies. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
