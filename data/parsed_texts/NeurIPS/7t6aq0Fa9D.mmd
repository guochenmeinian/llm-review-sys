###### Abstract

Topic models have been evolving rapidly over the years, from conventional to recent neural models. However, existing topic models generally struggle with either effectiveness, efficiency, or stability, highly impeding their practical applications. In this paper, we propose FASTopic, a fast, adaptive, stable, and transferable topic model. FASTopic follows a new paradigm: Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR). Instead of previous conventional, VAE-based, or clustering-based methods, DSR directly models the semantic relations among document embeddings from a pretrained Transformer and learnable topic and word embeddings. By reconstructing through these semantic relations, DSR discovers latent topics. This brings about a neat and efficient topic modeling framework. We further propose a novel Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method. Rather than early straightforward approaches, ETP explicitly regularizes the semantic relations as optimal transport plans. This addresses the relation bias issue and thus leads to effective topic modeling. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our FASTopic shows superior effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability, compared to state-of-the-art baselines across various scenarios. 1

## 1 Introduction

Due to the unsupervised fashion and interpretability, topic models have derived a broad spectrum of applications [12; 14], such as content recommendation [39; 79], generation [17; 88], and trend analysis [18; 36]. Early conventional topic models follow probabilistic graphical models [10; 8] or non-negative matrix factorization [35; 58]. But they rely on laborious model-specific derivations and fall short on large-scale data [75]. Due to this, recent neural topic models have attracted more attention [90; 75], including VAE-based [42; 43; 61] and clustering-based [59; 89; 24].

However, existing neural topic models lack either efficiency, effectiveness, or stability. First, VAE-based topic models, while effective, are limited by their low efficiency. They follow the VAE framework [31] and often incorporate extra modules like graph neural networks [87; 1] or external knowledge [66; 80], resulting in complicated modeling structures. Owing to this, they suffer from intensive time complexity, _e.g._, consuming hours to process a dataset of 10k documents [65]. Second, clustering-based topic models [89; 24] excel in efficiency as they require no training, but they sacrifice effectiveness. They tend to yield repetitive topics other than desired diverse ones or infer inaccurate topic distributions of documents [73; 1]. What is worse, these neural topic models suffer from low performance stability. They are extremely sensitive to hyperparameters, especially when applied to various scenarios concerning data domains, vocabulary sizes, and document length [27]. In consequence, these challenges hinder the applications of topic modeling in practice.

To tackle these challenges, we in this paper propose a **F**ast, **A**daptive, **S**table, and **T**ransferable topic model (**FASTopic**). Different from existing conventional, VAE-based, or clustering-based approaches, we introduce a new paradigm for topic modeling: **Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR)** as illustrated in Figure 2. Instead of complicated neural networks, DSR only considers three parameters: document embeddings from a pretrained Transformer, and topic and word embeddings. DSR models the dual semantic relations between (1) document and topic embeddings, and (2) topic and word embeddings, and interprets them as distributions for topic modeling. By reconstruction with these relations, DSR discovers latent topics in a neat and efficient framework, avoiding the complicated structures in prior studies. To model these relations, we further propose the novel **Embedding Transport Plan (ETP)**. Rather than simple parameterized softmax [37; 21], ETP regularizes these relations as the optimal transport plans between document, topic, and word embeddings. This mitigates the relation bias issue and produces distinct topics and accurate topic distributions, enabling effective topic modeling. Following the DSR paradigm with ETP, FASTopic provides a solid solution to the challenges of current topic models. As reported in Figure 1, FASTopic shows both superior efficiency and effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally FASTopic shows high

Here we model these relations as the transport plans to alleviate the relation bias issue.

transferability, robust adaptivity and stability across various scenarios, delivering better performance without hyperparameter tuning. We conclude the main contributions of this paper as follows:

* We propose a novel topic model with a new dual semantic-relation reconstruction paradigm that models semantic relations among document, topic, and word embeddings, bringing about a neat and efficient topic modeling framework.
* We further propose a novel embedding transport plan method that regularizes the semantic relations as optimal transport plans, which avoids the relation bias issue and leads to effective topic modeling.
* We conduct extensive experiments and demonstrate that our model shows high effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

## 2 Related Work

Conventional Topic ModelsThese models have two types. The first type is probabilistic topic models [25; 7; 9; 8], _e.g.,_ LDA [10], using probabilistic graphical models with topics as latent variables and inferred by Gibbs sampling [62] or Variational Inference [11]. The second type uses non-negative matrix factorization [29; 58]. These models have been extended to several scenarios like short texts [82; 67], multilingual [45], and dynamic topic modeling [9; 64]. But they require model-specific derivations for parameter inference and cannot well handle large-scale datasets.

VAE-based Neural Topic ModelsThese models follow the Variational AutoEncoder [VAE, 31; 55] framework and directly use gradient backpropagation to optimize parameters [42; 43; 61; 19; 83; 84; 81; 47; 68; 85; 84; 81; 46; 86; 87; 76; 77; 74]. Although some work [91; 65; 86] like ECRTM [73] also uses optimal transport, we highlight that our method differs from them in that: (**i**) While they still follow the traditional complicated VAE framework, our FASTopic leverages the neat and efficient dual semantic-relation reconstruction paradigm; (**ii**) While they use optimal transport only as alternative distance measures or regularization for VAE, our FASTopic leverages the novel embedding transport plan to model semantic relations. These differences not only bring about faster running speed, but also lead to higher topic modeling performance.

Clustering-based Neural Topic ModelsThey cluster pretrained word embeddings via clustering algorithms like KMeans to yield topics [59; 2; 89], but mostly cannot infer topic distributions of documents. BERTopic [24] clusters the document embeddings and approximates the topic distributions by comparing documents to each document cluster. Different from simple clustering in these studies, we focus on explicitly modeling the complex relations among the embeddings of documents, topics, and words, which enhances topic modeling performance.

Some recent studies leverage large language models and describe topics as conceptual descriptions [53], rather than the word distributions in LDA [10]. They can reach higher interpretability, but we emphasize their two limitations: (i) They require more resources. They need to input each document as prompts to LLMs. This is time-consuming and computationally intensive, especially when handling large-scale datasets. (ii) They cannot produce precise distributions for topics and documents, which limits their applications in downstream tasks.

## 3 Methodology: FASTopic

In this section, we first recall the problem setting of topic modeling. Then we propose the new paradigm Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction (DSR) and the novel Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method. Finally we introduce our new **FASTopic**.

### Problem Setting and Notations

Consider a collection \(\{\mathbf{x}^{(1)},\ldots,\mathbf{x}^{(N)}\}\) with \(N\) documents and vocabulary size \(V\). Topic modeling targets to discover \(K\) latent topics from the collection. Following LDA [10], Topic\(\#k\) is defined as a distribution over all words, _i.e.,_ topic-word distribution, denoted as \(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{k}\!\in\!\mathbb{R}^{V}\). We have \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\!=\!(\boldsymbol{\beta}_{1},\ldots,\boldsymbol{\beta}_{K})\! \!\!\in\!\!\mathbb{R}^{V\times K}\) as the topic-word distribution matrix of all topics. Topic modeling also infers the topic distributions of a document (what topics a document contains), _i.e.,_ doc-topic distribution. We denote the doc-topic distribution of \(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\) as \(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(i)}\!\!\in\!\!\Delta_{K}\), with \(\Delta_{K}\) as a probability simplex.

### Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction

In this section, we propose a new, neat, and efficient paradigm for topic modeling, **Dual Semantic-relation Reconstruction** (**DSR**). Figure 2 illustrates the differences between DSR and previous VAE-based and clustering-based methods.

Parameterizing Documents, Topics, and WordsAt the beginning, we parameterize documents, topics, and words as embeddings. Specifically, we embed documents into an \(H\)-dimensional semantic space via a pretrained Transformer \(f_{\text{doc}}\), _e.g.,_ BERT [16] or Sentence-BERT [54]. Let \(\textbf{D}{=}(\mathbf{d}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{d}_{N}){\in}\mathbb{R}^{H\times N}\) denote all document embeddings, where \(\mathbf{d}_{i}{=}f_{\text{doc}}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})\) refers to the embedding of \(i\)-th document. Then we randomly project all topics and words into the same semantic space as \(K\) topic embeddings \(\textbf{T}{=}(\mathbf{t}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{t}_{K}){\in}\mathbb{R}^{H\times K}\) and \(V\) word embeddings \(\textbf{W}{=}(\mathbf{w}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{w}_{V}){\in}\mathbb{R}^{H\times V}\). Notably we do _not_ use pretrained word embeddings like word2vec [44] or GloVe [51], because they may not belong to the same semantic space as document embeddings, which hinders correctly measuring their distance.

Reconstruction through Dual Semantic RelationsThen we model the dual semantic relations between the embeddings of (1) documents and topics, and (2) topics and words. We interpret these relations as doc-topic distributions and topic-word distributions respectively. To be specific, we model \(\theta_{k}^{(i)}\), the probability of Topic#k given \(i\)-th document as the semantic relation between embeddings \(\mathbf{d}_{i}\) and \(\mathbf{t}_{k}\). Similarly, we model \(\beta_{jk}\), the probability of \(j\)-th word given Topic#k as the semantic relation between embeddings \(\mathbf{t}_{k}\) and \(\mathbf{w}_{j}\). We detail how to model them later in Sec. 3.3. We learn these relations through reconstruction. As shown in Figure 2, we reconstruct document \(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\) as \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(i)}\), where we transport the semantics from \(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\) to each topic through \(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(i)}\) and then from each topic to each word through \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\). Hence we formulate the objective for DSR as the reconstruction error:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{DSR}}=-\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\mathbf{x}^{(i)})^{\top} \log(\boldsymbol{\beta}\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(i)})\] (1)

where we transform \(\mathbf{x}^{(i)}\) into the Bag-of-Words following previous studies [42; 43; 61]. By minimizing this objective, we expect to push each topic embedding close to the embeddings of its semantically related documents and words; therefore we can learn informative semantic relations, _i.e.,_ meaningful topic-word distributions \(\boldsymbol{\beta}\) for latent topics and doc-topic distributions \(\boldsymbol{\theta}^{(i)}\) for documents.

The above DSR presents a neat and efficient topic modeling paradigm. Previous VAE-based methods incorporate complicated modeling structures with diverse objectives [5; 80; 73; 1]. Different from them, DSR solely includes the objective Eq. (1) that only involves the embeddings of documents, topics, and words. This sufficiently simplifies the topic modeling procedure and hence facilitates efficiency. Moreover, while prior clustering-based methods [24] depend on indirect approximations, DSR explicitly models topic-word distributions and doc-topic distributions, resulting in higher effectiveness (See experiments in Sec. 4).

Figure 3: **(a, b)**: Relation weights of topics to documents. **(c, d)**: t-SNE visualization [63] of document (), and topic () embeddings under 50 topics (\(K{=}50\)). While most topic embeddings gather together in Parameterized Softmax (a,c) as it causes biased relations, ETP (b,d) separates all topic embeddings with regularized relations, avoiding the bias issue.

### Embedding Transport Plan

In this section, we analyze how to model the semantic relations for topic modeling, and then propose a new solution **Embedding Transport Plan** (**ETP**).

How to Model Semantic Relations?We emphasize this is a _non-trivial_ problem. A common answer is the widely-used parameterized softmax function [28; 37; 21]:

\[\theta_{k}^{(i)}=\frac{\exp(-\|\mathbf{d}_{i}-\mathbf{t}_{k}\|^{2}/\tau)}{\sum _{k^{\prime}=1}^{K}\exp(-\|\mathbf{d}_{i}-\mathbf{t}_{k^{\prime}}\|^{2}/\tau) },\quad\beta_{jk}=\frac{\exp(-\|\mathbf{t}_{k}-\mathbf{w}_{j}\|^{2}/\tau)}{ \sum_{j^{\prime}=1}^{V}\exp(-\|\mathbf{t}_{k}-\mathbf{w}_{j^{\prime}}\|^{2}/ \tau)}\] (2)

where we measure the relation between embeddings as their Euclidean distance with hyperparameter \(\tau\). Unfortunately, this straightforward way is ineffective, because it incurs the **relation bias issue**: most relations are minor as quantitatively illustrated in Figure 2(a). In consequence, most topic embeddings fail to cover informative and distinct semantics but gather together in the space as shown in Figures 2(c) and 2(a). This issue leads to repetitive topics and less accurate doc-topic distributions (See ablation studies in Sec. 4.7). Someone may guess this issue is because of the large topic number. We note that the relation bias issue still happens even under a small number of topics (See experimental supports in Table 9). Owing to these, we need alternatives to model the semantic relations.

Transport Plan from Documents to TopicsMotivated by the above analysis, we propose the new Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) to address the relation bias issue with effective regularization.

To regularize relations, we model them as the transport plan of a specifically defined optimal transport problem. In detail, we define two discrete measures \(\gamma_{1}\) and \(\rho_{1}\) over document and topic embeddings: \(\gamma_{1}\)=\(\sum_{i=1}^{N}\frac{1}{N}\delta_{\mathbf{d}_{i}}\) and \(\rho_{1}\)=\(\sum_{k=1}^{K}s_{k}\delta_{\mathbf{t}_{k}}\), where \(\delta_{x}\) denotes the Dirac unit mass on \(x\). We set the weight of each document embedding as \(1/N\) and the weight of each topic embedding as \(s_{k}\), where \(\mathbf{s}\)=\((s_{1},\ldots,s_{K})\) is a weight vector summing to 1. This later produces normalized doc-topic distributions. With these two, we formulate their entropic regularized optimal transport problem as

\[\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{\pi}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{N\times K}}\mathcal{L}_ {\text{OT}}(\gamma_{1},\rho_{1};\varepsilon_{1})\!\!=\!\!\sum_{i=1}^{N}\sum_{k =1}^{K}\!C_{ik}^{(1)}\pi_{ik}\!+\!\varepsilon_{1}\pi_{ik}(\log\pi_{ik}\!\!-\! 1),\text{ s.t. }\bm{\pi}\mathds{1}_{K}\!\!=\!\!\frac{\mathds{1}_{N}}{N}\text{ and }\bm{\pi}^{\top}\mathds{1}_{N}\!\!=\!\!\mathbf{s}.\] (3)

The first term is the original optimal transport problem, and the second term is the entropic regularization with hyperparameter \(\varepsilon_{1}\) to make this problem tractable [13; 52]. This equation aims to find a transport plan \(\bm{\pi}\) that minimizes the total cost of transporting the weights of document embeddings to topic embeddings under the two conditions [15], where \(\mathds{1}_{K}\) denotes a \(K\)-dimensional column vector of ones. Here \(\pi_{ik}\) refers to the transport weight from \(\mathbf{d}_{i}\) to \(\mathbf{t}_{k}\). The transport cost between them is measured as Euclidean distance \(C_{ik}^{(1)}\!\!=\!\!\|\mathbf{d}_{i}-\mathbf{t}_{k}\|^{2}\), with \(\mathbf{C}^{(1)}\) as the transport cost matrix.

We can alleviate the relation bias issue with transport plan \(\bm{\pi}\) as the semantic relations. Eq. (3) constraints \(\bm{\pi}\) by two conditions. We set \(\mathbf{s}\!=\!\operatorname*{softmax}(\mathbf{s}_{0})\), where \(\mathbf{s}_{0}\) is a learnable variable uniformly initialized as \(\frac{1}{K}\mathds{1}_{K}\). The uniform initialization and softmax function prevent excessively biased \(\mathbf{s}\)[28]. Therefore as illustrated in Figures 2(b) and 2(d), this avoids biased \(\bm{\pi}\) as it is constrained by \(\mathbf{s}\), which mitigates the relation bias issue (See experiment results in Sec. 4.7). Besides, this approach flexibly captures the varying weight of each topic within the document collection, since some topics may appear more frequently in the collection while others less, which aligns with the reality (See more interpretations in Appendix E).

Transport Plan from Topics to WordsWe further employ the transport plan between topic and word embeddings. We define two discrete measures over topic and word embeddings: \(\gamma_{2}\!=\!\sum_{k=1}^{K}\frac{1}{K}\delta_{\mathbf{t}_{k}}\) and \(\rho_{2}\!\!=\!\!\sum_{j=1}^{V}u_{j}\delta_{\mathbf{w}_{j}}\). Here we specify the weight of each topic embedding as \(1/K\) and the weight of each word embedding as \(u_{j}\), where \(\mathbf{u}\) is a weight vector and its sum is 1. This is to produce normalized topic-word distributions later. Following Eq. (3), we write the entropic regularized optimal transport problem between the two measures as

\[\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\bm{\phi}\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{K\times V}}\mathcal{L}_ {\text{OT}}(\gamma_{2},\rho_{2};\varepsilon_{2})\!\!=\!\!\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{j =1}^{V}C_{kj}^{(2)}\phi_{kj}\!+\!\varepsilon\phi_{kj}(\log\phi_{kj}\!\!-\!1), \text{ s.t. }\bm{\phi}\mathds{1}_{K}\!\!=\!\!\frac{\mathds{1}_{K}}{K}\text{ and }\bm{\phi}^{\top}\mathds{1}_{K}\!\!=\!\!\mathbf{u}.\] (4)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

[73] also solve the optimal transport problem, but their objectives involve complicated encoders and decoders inherent from VAE, which slows them down.

Moreover, FASTopic needs much fewer hyperparameters. It mainly has hyperparameters for Sinkhorn's algorithm \(\varepsilon_{1}\) and \(\varepsilon_{2}\) in Eq. (3) and (4). VAE-based models, like CombinedTM [5], ECRTM [73], and GINopic [1], require hyperparameters to set their encoders, decoders (dimensions, number of layers, and dropout), and prior distributions (Gaussian or Dirichlet). BERTopic needs hyperparameters to set its clustering and dimension reduction modules, like the number of neighbors and components of UMAP; the min cluster size, min samples, metrics of HDBSCAN.

### Inferring Doc-Topic distributions for New Documents

Finally we discuss how to infer doc-topic distributions for new documents. Considering a new document \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) and its document embedding \(\mathbf{d}^{\prime}{=}f_{\text{doc}}(\mathbf{x}^{\prime})\), we may directly follow the learning process in Sec. 3.3 and infer its doc-topic distribution \(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\) by computing the transport plan between \(\mathbf{d}^{\prime}\) and learned topic embeddings \(\mathbf{T}\). Unfortunately, this way is unworkable. It transports the weight of one document to all topics; hence for any \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\), the transport plan invariably becomes the learned topic weights \(\mathbf{s}\). Such trivial results are certainly unreasonable. To this end, we compute \(\bm{\theta}^{\prime}\) as

\[\theta^{\prime}_{k}=\frac{p_{k}}{\sum_{k^{\prime}=1}^{K}p_{k^{\prime}}},\quad \text{where}\quad p_{k}=\frac{\exp(-\|\mathbf{t}_{k}-\mathbf{d}^{\prime}\|^{2}/ \tau)}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\exp(-\|\mathbf{t}_{k}-\mathbf{d}_{i}\|^{2}/\tau)}\] (9)

with \(\tau\) as a temperature hyperparameter. Here we model the relation between \(\mathbf{d}^{\prime}\) and \(\mathbf{t}_{k}\) as the Euclidean distance and regularize it by the total relations between \(\mathbf{t}_{k}\) and all training documents to approximate the learned topic weight in Sec. 3.3. Then we compute \(\theta^{\prime}_{k}\) by normalizing over all topics. Since topic and word embeddings have been refined after training (Sec. 3.4), we can infer accurate doc-topic distributions for new documents in this way. See empirical results in Sec. 4.2 and 4.3.

### Experiment Setup

DatasetsWe adopt six benchmark datasets for experiments: **(i) 20NG** [20Newsgroup, 33] is one of the most commonly-used datasets, covering news articles with 20 labels. **(ii) NYT** includes news articles from the New York Times with 12 categories. **(iii) WoS** [Web Of Science, 32] contains published papers from the Web of Science website with 7 categories. **(iv) NeurIPS** is a dataset with papers published at the NeurIPS conference from 1987 to 2017. **(v) ACL** [6] contains research articles from the ACL anthology from 1970 to 2015. **(vi) Wikitext-103**[41] includes Wikipedia articles. See more dataset details in Appendix B.

Evaluation MetricsAlthough topic modeling evaluation is still an open problem [26], we follow mainstream studies [19; 91; 73] and evaluate the topic quality and doc-topic distribution quality. For topic quality, we consider: **(i) Topic Coherence** measures the coherence between top words of discovered topics. We employ the widely-used coherence metric \(C_{V}\), which has been shown to outperform earlier NPMI, UCI, and UMass [46; 34; 56]. We use a widely-used large Wikipedia article collection as the external reference corpus to compute \(C_{V}\). **(ii) Topic Diversity** means the differences between discovered topics. We measure this with the Topic Diversity (TD) metric [19], which calculates the proportion of unique words in the topics. In terms of doc-topic distribution quality, we conduct document clustering, evaluated by Purity and NMI [38] following Zhao et al. [91]. We do not evaluate the perplexity since our method does _not_ follow the VAE framework [42; 43], and the perplexity is incomparable across topic models as evidenced by early studies [90; 75].

Baseline ModelsWe consider the following baselines in three paradigms. For conventional topic models, we adopt **(i) LDA-Mallet**[40], a prominent method competitive to some neural models [26]; **(ii) NMF**, using non-negative matrix factorization. For clustering-based topic models, we have **(iii) BERTopic**[24], clustering document embeddings and discovering topics by TF-IDF.

### Effectiveness: Topic Quality and Doc-Topic Distribution Quality

We demonstrate the superior effectiveness of FASTopic compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Table 1 presents the topic quality results of topic coherence (\(C_{V}\)) and topic diversity (TD). We see that our FASTopic commonly surpasses all baselines with the highest performance across all datasets. Moreover, Table 2 reports the doc-topic distribution quality results concerning the Purity and NMI of document clustering. We observe that FASTopic reaches top performance as well. These results manifest that FASTopic produces high-quality topics and doc-topic distributions, showing better effectiveness. This also verifies the capability of our new DSR paradigm. See Appendix H for the examples of discovered topics.

### Effectiveness: Text Classification as Downstream Task

We consider text classification as a downstream task to evaluate topic models in an extrinsic manner. Following Wu et al. [73], we train SVM classifiers with the inferred doc-topic distributions as document features and then predict the class of each testing document. We measure this performance by Accuracy (Acc) and F1. Figure 4 reports that our FASTopic consistently outperforms baselines. We note that the improvements of FASTopic are statistically significant at 0.01 level. These results demonstrate that FASTopic can benefit more downstream classification tasks.

### Efficiency: Running Speed

We show the exceptionally fast running speed of FASTopic. Table 3 reports the running time of each model on each dataset. The running time indicates the duration from the completion of data loading to the finish of training. We see that our FASTopic consistently emerges as the fastest one by a large margin, statistically significant at 0.01 level. FASTopic completes running within 1 minute, while the longest takes 30 minutes. We notice that LDA-Mallet has increasing running time on the datasets with longer documents. For instance, it escalates from 50 seconds on 20NG to 2000 seconds on Wikitext-103. In contrast, FASTopic maintains its rapid performance regardless of document length. Figure 0(b) also evidences the fast speed of FASTopic in terms of varying dataset sizes. This is because FASTpoic adopts our neat and efficient DSR paradigm, which relieves from the complicated modeling structures in previous studies. See more running time analysis in Appendix G.

### Transferability

We verify the high transferability of FASTopic. In detail, we train a topic model on Wikitext-103, a general dataset with diverse topics, and then use it to infer the doc-topic distributions of documents in other datasets 20NG, NYT, and WoS. Following the previous setting, we use these doc-topic distributions as features to train SVM classifiers for text classification. This measures the transferability of a topic model from one data domain to another. Figure 4 shows that the transferability of FASTopic significantly outperforms baselines. The reason lies in that previous methods often rely on the Bag-of-Words [80; 20; 73]. Differently, FASTopic leverages richer representations, the pretrained document embeddings, and learns the doc-topic distributions through the effective ETP method, bringing about higher transferability.

### Adaptivity and Stability

We demonstrate the adaptivity and stability of FASTopic across various scenarios using the WoS dataset. First, Tables 4 and 5 summarize the performance under different topic numbers (\(K\) from 75 to 200). We observe that FASTopic generally remains top performance across these variations. Second, Tables 13 and 14 report the results under varying dataset sizes (\(N\) from 15k to 40k). These results show that FASTopic mostly reaches the best results. As aforementioned in Figure 0(b), FASTopic also has the fastest running speed. Third, we experiment with different vocabulary sizes (\(V\) from 20k to 50k) in Tables 15 and 16. Similarly, our FASTopic exhibits stable and high performance. We note that FASTopic uses the same hyperparameters in all these experiments (See Appendix D). The above results together highlight that our FASTopic can smoothly adapt to various scenarios with stable performance. This is a vital advantage of our model for practical applications.

### Ablation Study

We validate the necessity of our Embedding Transport Plan (ETP) method with ablation studies. Table 6 shows that using parameterized softmax rather than ETP (w/o ETP) to model semantic relations incurs degraded performance, concerning both topic and doc-topic distribution quality (See also the results on other datasets in Table 8). For instance, the \(C_{V}\) and TD decrease from 0.426, 0.983 to 0.368, 0.391; the Purity and NMI decrease from 0.577, 0.525 to 0.401, 0.452, indicating low-quality repetitive topics and less accurate doc-topic distributions. We observe similar results even with only 10 topics (\(K\)=10) in Table 9. This is because our ETP properly regularizes semantic relations, which addresses the relation bias issue. These results manifest the necessity of our ETP to reach effective topic modeling.

## 5 Model Usage

We have released our FASTopic as a Python package at PyPI 2. Users can easily install FASTopic through _pip_. Figure 5 shows a code example to use FASTopic on a dataset. After preprocessing the given dataset, it discovers top words and infers doc-topic distributions. With these simple APIs, users can smoothly handle their data for their various purposes. See our GitHub 3 for more tutorials and documentation of FASTopic.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose FASTopic, a fast, adaptive, stable, and transferable topic model. Rather than traditional VAE-based or clustering-based approaches, FASTopic employs the new dual semantic-relation reconstruction paradigm to model latent topics with semantic relations and uses the new transport plan relation method to tackle the relation bias issue. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the significantly superior performance of FASTopic in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, adaptivity, stability, and transferability. These advantages manifest the strong capability of FASTopic in practice, which benefits a wide range of real-world applications.

## Appendix A Limitations

Our method achieves promising performance, but we mention that one limitation is the max input length of pretrained document embedding models. This may hamper the performance on extremely long documents. However, we show that our method can well handle long documents like academic papers in Sec. 4, and this issue can be well resolved by newer and stronger pretrained models like large language models [48; 50; 78; 49].

## Appendix B Preprocessing Datasets

We follow the dataset preprocessing steps of TopMost [76]4: (1) tokenize documents and convert to lowercase; (2) remove punctuation; (3) remove tokens that include numbers; (4) remove tokens less than 3 characters; (5) remove stopwords.

iterations as 1,000 and the stop tolerance as 0.005 for the Sinkhorn's algorithm [15]. We set \(\varepsilon_{1}\) as 1/3 and \(\varepsilon_{2}\) as 1/2. We set \(\tau\) as 1.0 in Eq. (9). We optimize the model parameters through Adam [30] with 200 epochs and learning rate as 0.002. We highlight that we use the above same hyperparameters for all reported experiments to demonstrate the stability of our FASTopic.

## Appendix E Interpreting Learned Topic and Word Weights

As aforementioned, our FASTopic learns \(\mathbf{s}\), the weight of each topic within the document collection and \(\mathbf{u}\), the weight of each word within all topics. Figure 8 plots the relationship between the topic/word weights and the word frequency in the collection. Generally, topics with higher weights include top words of higher frequency, and words with higher weights also exhibit higher frequency. These observations confirm the validity of learned topic and word weights.

## Appendix F Influence of Document Embedding Model

We investigate the influence of document embedding models. Apart from the mentioned all-MiniLM-L6-v2, we also experiment with all-mpnet-base-v2 and all-distilroberta-v1 as document embedding models in Tables 10 and 11. We notice that the performance is overall stable across these models. Moreover, the performance grows with all-mpnet-base-v2 and all-distilroberta-v1, especially on document clustering. This is because these two produce document embeddings of relatively higher quality [54].

## Appendix G Running Time Breakdown

To precisely compare BERTopic and FASTopic, we break down their running time. Table 12 shows that they both load document embeddings, but BERTopic takes more steps. BERTopic has to reduce embedding dimensionality, cluster embeddings, and compute word weights; in contrast, our FASTopic enjoys faster training. This is because FASTopic employs Sinkhorn's algorithm to solve the optimal transport, which is quite fast as proven by previous studies [15, 22]. Moreover, its objective is simple and straightforward as it only optimizes four parameters: topic and word embeddings and their weight vectors (Eq. (8).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r} \hline \hline \multicolumn{2}{c}{BERTopic} \\ \hline Step 1: Load doc embeddings & 7.10 \\ Step 2: Reduce dimenionality & 23.13 \\ Step 3: Cluster doc embeddings & 0.21 \\ Step 4: Compute word weights & 1.97 \\ \hline

Here we list all the discovered topics of different models. Compared to prior CombinedTM and BERTopic, FASTopic anchors topics with more specific and relevant words. Specifically in the NeurIPS dataset, the topics of CombinedTM and BERTopic usually contain high-frequency words like "algorithm", "data", "model", "learning", "neural", and "network". Admittedly they are related to some extent, but they are too general to anchor topic semantics [3; 4]. For instance, Topic#30 of BERTopic is about chip manufacturing, but contains general words like "neural", and "weight". In contrast, Topic#28 of FASTopic includes more specific ones like "silicon", "transistor", "cmos", and "neuromorphic". In the Wikitext-103 dataset, Topic#7 of BERTopic is about species, but has general words "known", "long", "large", "small", and "white". Differently Topic#2 FASTopic covers specific words "breeding", "prey", "subspecies", and "predators". See quantitative results of discovered topics in Sec. 4.2.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The main claims in the abstract and introduction reflect the contributions of our proposed new topic model, FASTopic. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification:

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe our model in detail in Sec. 3 and appendix D. We also upload our code with our submission. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We upload our code with our submission. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include experimental settings and details in Sec. 4.1 and appendices B and D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report statistical significance tests in Sec. 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report experiments compute resources in Appendix D. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We conform with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss societal impacts in Sec. 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the original sources of code, data, and models in Sec. 4.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
