###### Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems possess significant potential to drive societal progress. However, their deployment often faces obstacles due to substantial safety concerns. Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) emerges as a solution to optimize policies while simultaneously adhering to multiple constraints, thereby addressing the challenge of integrating reinforcement learning in safety-critical scenarios. In this paper, we present an environment suite called Safety-Gymnasium, which encompasses safety-critical tasks in both single and multi-agent scenarios, accepting vector and vision-only input. Additionally, we offer a library of algorithms named Safe Policy Optimization (SafePO), comprising 16 state-of-the-art SafeRL algorithms. This comprehensive library can serve as a validation tool for the research community. By introducing this benchmark, we aim to facilitate the evaluation and comparison of safety performance, thus fostering the development of reinforcement learning for safer, more reliable, and responsible real-world applications.

## 1 Introduction

AI systems possess enormous potential to spur societal progress. However, their deployment is frequently hindered by substantial safety considerations [1; 2; 3; 4]. Distinct from pure reinforcement learning (RL), Safe reinforcement learning (SafeRL) seeks to optimize policies while concurrently adhering to multiple constraints, addressing the challenge of employing RL in scenarios with critical safety implications [5; 6; 7; 8; 9]. This strategy proves particularly pertinent in real-world applications such as autonomous vehicles [10] and healthcare [11], where system failures or unsafe actions can result in grave consequences, such as accidents or harm to individuals. In large language models (LLMs), some studies have also shown that the toxicity of the models can be reduced through SafeRL [12; 13]. Incorporating safety constraints ensures adherence to predefined boundaries and regulatory standards, fostering trust and enabling exploration in environments with high-risk potential. Overall, SafeRL is instrumental in guaranteeing the dependable operation of intelligent systems in intricate and high-stake domains.

Simulation environments have become instrumental in fostering the advancement of RL. Eminent examples such as Gym [14], Atari [15], and dm-control [16] underline their importance. These versatile platforms permit researchers to swiftly design and execute varied tasks, thus enabling efficient evaluation of algorithmic effectiveness and intrinsic limitations. However, within the sphere of SafeRL, there is a notable dearth of dedicated simulation environments, which impedes comprehensive exploration of SafeRL. In recent years, there have been strides to address this gap. DeepMind presented AI-Safety-Gridworlds, a suite of RL environments showcasing various safety properties of intelligent agents [17]. Afterward, OpenAI introduced the Safety Gym benchmark suite, a collection of high-dimensional continuous control environments incorporating safety-robot tasks [18]. Over the past two years, several additional environments have been developed by researchers, including safe-control-gym [19], MetaDrive [20], etc.

**Compared to Safety Gym1 Safety-Gymnasium inherits and expands the settings of some tasks of Safety Gym, aiming to bolster the community's growth further. Compared with Safety Gym, we have made the following major improvements:**

Footnote 1: Again, we have no intention of attacking Safety Gym; the contribution of Safety Gym to the SafeRL community cannot be ignored, and Safety Gym also inspired this work. We hope that through our efforts, Safety-Gymnasium can further promote the development of SafeRL and give back to the entire RL community.

* **Refactoring of the physics engine.** Safety Gym utilizes _mujoco-py_ to enable Python-based customization of MuJoCo components. However, _mujoco-py_ stopped updates and support after 2021. In contrast, Safety-Gymnasium supports MuJoCo directly, eliminating the reliance on _mujoco-py_. This facilitates access to the latest MuJoCo features (_e.g._, rendering speed and accuracy improved, etc.) and lowers the entry barrier, particularly due to _mujoco-py's_ dependency on specific GCC versions and more.
* **Extension of Agent and Task Components.** Safety Gym initially supports only three agents and tasks. On this basis, Safety-Gymnasium has been further expanded, introducing more diverse agents and task components and expanding safety tasks to cover multi-agent domains. Finally, Safety-Gymnasium launched a high-dimensional test component based on Issac-Gym [21], further enriching the benchmark.
* **Enhanced Visual Task Support.** The visual components of Safety Gym are simplistic (consisting of basic geometric shapes), and _mujoco-py_ relies on OpenGL for visual rendering, which results in significant virtualization performance loss on headless servers. In contrast, Safety-Gymnasium, built on MuJoCo, achieves rendering speeds on CPU that are twice as fast as the former. Additionally, it offers more comprehensive visual component support.
* **Easy Installation and High Customization.** Safety Gym is cumbersome to install and relies heavily on the underlying software. One of the design motivations of Safety-Gymnasium is the ease of use so that everyone can focus on algorithm design. Safety-Gymnasium can be easily installed with one simple command pip install safety-gymnasium. While benefiting from the highly integrated framework, Safety-Gymnasium only needs 100 lines of code to customize the required environment.

In this work, we introduce Safety-Gymnasium, a collection of environments specifically for SafeRL, built upon the Gymnasium [14; 22] and MuJoCo [23]. Enhancing the extant Safety Gym framework [18], we address various concerns and expand the task scope to include vision-only and multi-agent scenarios. Additionally, we released SafePO, a single-file style algorithm library containing over 16 state-of-the-art algorithms. Collectively, our contributions are enumerated as follows:

* **Environmental Components.** We provide various safety-oriented tasks under the umbrella of Safety-Gymnasium. These tasks encompass single-agent, multi-agent, and vision-based challenges, each with varying constraints. Our environments are categorized into two primary types: Gymnasium-based, featuring agents of escalating complexity for algorithm verification and comparison, and Issac-Gym-based, incorporating sophisticated agents that harness the parallel processing power of Issac-gym's GPU. This empowers researchers to explore SafeRL algorithms in complex scenarios. Further details can be found in Section 4.
* **Algorithm Components.** We offer the SafePO algorithm library, which comprises a single-file style housing 16 diverse algorithms. These algorithms encompass both single-agent and multi-agent approaches, along with first-order and second-order variants, as well as Lagrangian-basedand Projection-based methods. Through meticulous decoupling, each algorithm's code resides in an individual file. A more in-depth exploration of SafePO is presented in Section 5.
* **Insights and Analysis.** Combining Safety-Gymnasium and SafePO, we conduct a detailed analysis of existing algorithms. Our analysis encompasses 16 algorithms across 54 distinct environments, covering various scenarios such as single-agent and multi-agent setups with varying constraint complexities. This analysis delves into each algorithm's strengths, constraints, and avenues for enhancement. We provide access to all metadata, fostering community verification and encouraging further research. Further details can be found in Section 6.

## 2 Related Work

Safety EnvironmentsIn RL, agents need to explore environments to learn optimal policies by trial and error. It is currently typical to train RL agents mostly or entirely in simulation, where safety concerns are minimal. However, we anticipate that challenges in simulating the complexities of the real world (_e.g._, human-AI collaborative control [1; 2]) will cause a shift towards training RL agents directly in the real world, where safety concerns are paramount [20; 24; 25]. OpenAI includes safety requirements in the Safety Gym [18], which is a suite of high-dimensional continuous control environments for measuring research progress on SafeRL. Safe-control-gym [19] allows for constraint specification and disturbance injection onto a robot's inputs, states, and inertial properties through a portable configuration system. DeepMind also presents a suite of RL environments, AI-Safety-Gridworlds [17], illustrating various safety properties of intelligent agents.

SafeRL AlgorithmsCMDPs have been extensively studied for different constraint criteria [26; 27; 28; 29]. With the rise of deep learning, CMDPs are also moving to more high-dimensional continuous control problems. CPO [30] proposes the first general-purpose policy search algorithm for SafeRL with guarantees for near-constraint satisfaction at each iteration. However, CPO's policy updates hinge on Taylor approximations and the inversion of high-dimensional Fisher information matrices. These approximations can occasionally lead to inappropriate policy updates. FOCOPS [31] applies a primal-dual approach to solve the constrained trust region problem directly and subsequently projects the solution back into the parametric policy space. Similarly, CUP [32] offers non-convex implementations through a first-order optimizer, thereby not requiring a strong approximation of the convexity of the objective.

## 3 Preliminaries

### Constrained Markov decision process

SafeRL [6; 33] is often formulated as a Constrained Markov decision process (CMDP) [6], which is a tuple \(\mathcal{M}=(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P},R,\mathcal{C},\mu,\gamma)\). Here \(\mathcal{S}\) and \(\mathcal{A}\) are the state space and action space correspondingly. \(\mathbb{P}(s^{\prime}|s,a)\) is the probability of state transition from \(s\) to \(s^{\prime}\) after taking action \(a\). \(R(s^{\prime}|s,a)\) denotes the reward obtained by the agent performing action \(a\) in state \(s\) and transitioning to state \(s^{\prime}\). The set \(\mathcal{C}=\left\{(c_{i},b_{i})\right\}_{i=1}^{m}\), where \(c_{i}\) are cost functions: \(c_{i}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) and the cost thresholds are \(b_{i},i=1,\cdots,m\). \(\mu(\cdot):\mathcal{S}\rightarrow[0,1]\) is the initial state distribution and the discount factor \(\gamma\in[0,1)\).

A stationary parameterized policy \(\pi_{\theta}\) is a probability distribution defined on \(\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\), \(\pi_{\theta}(a|s)\) denotes the probability of taking action \(a\) in state \(s\). We use \(\Pi_{\theta}=\{\pi_{\theta}:\theta\in\mathbb{R}^{p}\}\) to denote the set of all stationary policies and \(\theta\) is the network parameter needed to be learned. Let \(\bm{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}\in\mathbb{R}^{|S|\times|S|}\) denotes a state transition probability matrix and the components are: \(\bm{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}[s,s^{\prime}]=\mathbb{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}(s^{\prime}|s)= \sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\pi_{\theta}(a|s)\mathbb{P}(s^{\prime}|s,a)\), which denotes one-step state transition probability from \(s\) to \(s^{\prime}\) by executing \(\pi_{\theta}\). Finally, we let \(d^{\pi_{\theta}}_{\pi_{\theta}}(s)=(1-\gamma)\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t} \mathbb{P}_{\pi_{\theta}}(s_{t}=s|s_{0})\) to be the stationary state distribution of the Markov chain starting at \(s_{0}\) induced by policy \(\pi_{\theta}\) and \(d^{\mu}_{\pi_{\theta}}(s)=\mathbb{E}_{s_{0}\sim\mu(\cdot)}[d^{\mu}_{\pi_{ \theta}}(s)]\) to be the discounted state visitation distribution on initial distribution \(\mu\).

The objective function is defined via the infinite horizon discounted reward function where for a given \(\pi_{\theta}\), we have \(J^{R}(\pi_{\theta})=\mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}R(s_{t+1}|s_{t},a _{t})|s_{0}\sim\mu,a_{t}\sim\pi_{\theta}]\). The cost function is similarly specified via the following infinite horizon discount cost function: \(J^{C}_{i}(\pi_{\theta})=\mathbb{E}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\gamma^{t}C_{i}(s_{t+1}| s_{t},a_{t})|s_{0}\sim\mu,a_{t}\sim\pi_{\theta}]\).

Then, we define the feasible policy set \(\Pi_{\mathcal{C}}\) as : \(\Pi_{\mathcal{C}}=\cap_{i=1}^{m}\{\pi_{\theta}\in\Pi_{\theta}\;\;\text{and}\;\;J_{ i}^{C}(\pi_{\theta})\leq b_{i}\}\). The goal of CMDP is to search the optimal policy \(\pi_{\star}\): \(\pi_{\star}=\arg\max_{\pi_{\theta}\in\Pi_{\mathcal{C}}}J^{R}(\pi_{\theta})\).

### Constrained Markov Game

Safe multi-agent reinforcement learning is often formulated as a Constrained Markov Game \((\mathcal{N},\mathcal{S},\mathcal{A},\mathbb{P},\mu,\gamma,R,\bm{C},\bm{b})\). Here, \(\mathcal{N}=\{1,\ldots,n\}\) is the set of agents, \(\mathcal{S}\) and \(\mathcal{A}=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathcal{A}^{i}\) are the state space and the joint action space (_i.e._, the product of the agents' action spaces), \(\mathbb{P}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{S}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is the probabilistic transition function, \(\mu\) is the initial state distribution, \(\gamma\in[0,1)\) is the discount factor, \(R:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is the joint reward function, \(\bm{C}=\big{\{}C_{j}^{i}\big{\}}_{1\leq j\leq m^{i}}^{i\in\mathcal{N}}\) is the set of sets of cost functions (every agent \(i\) has \(m^{i}\) cost functions) of the form \(C_{j}^{i}:\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}^{i}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\), and finally the set of corresponding cost threshold is given by \(\bm{b}=\big{\{}b_{j}^{i}\big{\}}_{1\leq j\leq m^{i}}^{i\in\mathcal{N}}\). At time step \(t\), the agents are in a state \(\mathrm{s}_{t}\), and every agent \(i\) takes an action \(\mathrm{a}_{t}^{i}\) according to its policy \(\pi^{i}\left(\mathbf{a}^{i}\mid\mathbf{s}_{t}\right)\). Together with other agents' actions, it gives a joint action \(\mathbf{a}_{t}=\left(\mathrm{a}_{t}^{1},\ldots,\mathrm{a}_{t}^{n}\right)\) and the joint policy \(\bm{\pi}(\mathbf{a}\mid\mathbf{s})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\pi^{i}\left(\mathbf{a}^{i} \mid\mathbf{s}\right)\). The agents receive the reward \(R\left(\,\mathrm{s}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}\right)\), meanwhile each agent \(i\) pays the costs \(C_{j}^{i}\left(\,\mathrm{s}_{t},\mathrm{a}_{t}^{i}\right)\), \(\forall j=1,\ldots,m^{i}\). The environment then transits to a new state \(\mathrm{s}_{t+1}\sim\mathbb{P}\left(\,\cdot\mid\mathrm{s}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t}\right)\).

The objective of reward function are \(J(\bm{\pi})\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{\mathrm{s}_{0}\sim\rho^{0},\mathbf{a}_{0, \infty}\sim\bm{\pi},\mathbf{s}_{1,\infty}\sim\mathbb{P}}[\sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^{t}R(\mathbf{s}_{t},\mathbf{a}_{t})]\), and costs function are \(J_{j}^{i}(\bm{\pi})\triangleq\mathbb{E}_{\mathrm{s}_{0}\sim\rho^{0},\mathbf{a }_{0,\infty}\sim\bm{\pi},\mathbf{s}_{1,\infty}\sim\mathbb{P}}\left[\sum_{t=0}^ {\infty}\gamma^{t}C_{j}^{i}\left(\,\mathrm{s}_{t},\mathrm{a}_{t}^{i}\right) \right]\leq c_{j}^{i}\), \(\forall j=1,\ldots,m^{i}\).

We are examining a fully cooperative setting where all agents share a common reward function. Consequently, the goal of safe multi-agent RL is to identify the optimal policy that maximizes the expected total reward while simultaneously ensuring that the safety constraints of each agent are satisfied. Then we define the feasible joint policy set \(\bm{\pi}_{\mathcal{C}}=\cap_{i=1}^{n}\{\pi_{\theta}\in\Pi_{\theta}\;\;\text{and}\;\;J_ {j}^{i}(\bm{\pi})\leq c_{j}^{i},\forall j=1,\ldots,m^{i}\}\). The goal of CMG is to search the optimal policy \(\bm{\pi}_{\star}=\arg\max_{\pi_{\theta}\in\Pi_{\mathcal{C}}}J(\pi_{\theta})\).

## 4 Safety Environments: Safety-Gymnasium

Safety-Gymnasium provides a seamless installation process and minimalistic code snippets to basic examples, as shown in Figure 1. Due to the limited space of the paper, we provide a more detailed description (_e.g._, detailed instructions, the composition of the robot's observation space and action space, dynamic structure, physical parameters, etc.) in Appendix B and Online Documentation2.

Footnote 2: Online Documentation: www.safety-gymnasium.com

### Gymnasium-based Learning Environments

In this section, we introduce Gymnasium-based environment components from three aspects: (1) the robots (both single-agent and multi-agent); (2) the tasks that are supported within the environment; (3) the safety constraints that are upheld.

Figure 1: Using Safety-Gymnasium to create, step, render a specific safety-task environment.

Supported RobotsAs shown in Figure 2, Safety-Gymnasium inherits three pre-existing agents from Safety Gym [18], namely Point, Car, and Doggo. By meticulously adjusting the model parameters, we have successfully mitigated the issue of excessive oscillations during the runtime of Point and Car agents. Building upon this foundation, we have introduced two additional robots: racecar [34; 35], and ant [23], to enrich the single-agent scenarios. As for multi-agent robots, we have leveraged certain configurations from multi-agent MuJoCo [36], deconstructing the original single-agent structure and enabling multiple agents to control distinct body segments. This design choice has been widely adopted in various research works [37; 38; 39].

Supported TasksAs shown in Figure 3, the Gymnasium-based learning environments support the following tasks. For a more detailed task specification, please refer to our online documentation3.

Footnote 3: Task Specification Documentation: https://www.safety-gymnasium.com/en/latest/components_of_environments/tasks.html

* _Velocity._ The robot aims to facilitate coordinated leg movement of the robot in the forward (right) direction by exerting torques on the hinges.
* _Run._ The robot starts with a random initial direction and a specific initial speed as it embarks on a journey to reach the opposite side of the map.
* _Circle._ The reward is maximized by moving along the green circle and not allowed to enter the outside of the red region, so its optimal path follows the line segments \(AD\) and \(BC\).
* _Goal._ The robot navigates to multiple goal positions. After successfully reaching a goal, its location is randomly reset while maintaining the overall layout.
* _Push._ The objective is to move a box to a series of goal positions. Like the goal task, a new random goal location is generated after each achievement.
* _Button._ The objective is to activate a series of goal buttons distributed throughout the environment. The agent's goal is to navigate towards and contact the currently highlighted button, known as the goal button.

Supported ConstraintsAs shown in Figure 3, the Gymnasium-based environments support the following constraints. For a more detailed task specification, please refer to our online documentation.

* _Velocity-Constraint_ involves safety tasks using MuJoCo agents [23]. In these tasks, agents aim for higher reward by moving faster, but they must also adhere to velocity constraints for safety. Specifically, in a two-dimensional plane, the cost is computed as the Euclidean norm of the agent's velocities (\(v_{x}\) and \(v_{y}\)).

Figure 2: **Upper: The Single-Agent Robots of Gymnasium-based Environments. Lower: The Multi-Agent Robots of Gymnasium-based Environments.**

* _Pillars_ are employed to represent large cylindrical obstacles within the environment. In the general setting, contact with a pillar incurs costs.
* _Hazards_ are utilized to model areas within the environment that pose a risk, resulting in costs when an agent enters such areas.
* _Sigwalls_ are designed specifically for Circle tasks. Crossing the wall from inside the safe area to the outside incurs costs.
* _Vases_ represent static and fragile objects within the environment. Touching or displacing these objects incurs costs for the agent.
* _Gremlins_ represent moving objects within the environment that can interact with the agent.

#### 4.1.1 Vision-only tasks

Vision-only SafeRL has gained significant attention as a focal point of research, primarily due to its applicability in real-world contexts [40; 41]. While the initial iteration of Safety Gym offered rudimentary visual input support, there is room for enhancing the realism of its environment. To effectively evaluate vision-based SafeRL algorithms, we have devised a more realistic visual environment utilizing MuJoCo. This enhanced environment facilitates the incorporation of both RGB and RGB-D inputs (as shown in Figure 5). An exemplar of this environment is depicted in Figure 4, while comprehensive descriptions are available in Appendix B.5.

### Issac-Gym-based Learning Environments

In this section, we introduce Safety-DexterousHands, a collection of environments built upon DexterousHands [42] and the Isaac Gym engine [21]. Leveraging GPU capabilities, Safety-DexterousHands enables large-scale parallel sample collection, significantly accelerating the training process. The environments support both single-agent and multi-agent settings. These environments involve two robotic hands (refer to Figure 6 (a) and (b)). In each episode, a ball randomly descends near the right hand. The right hand needs to grasp and launch the ball toward the left hand, which subsequently catches and deposits it at the target location.

Figure 4: Vision-only Tasks of Gymnasium-based Environments.

Figure 3: **Upper: Tasks of Gymnasium-based Environments; Lower: Constraints of Gymnasium-based Environments.**

For timestep \(t\), let \(x_{b,t}\), \(x_{g,t}\) to be the position of the ball and the goal, \(d_{p,t}\) to denote the positional distance between the ball and the goal \(d_{p,t}=\|x_{b,t}-x_{g,t}\|_{2}\). Let \(d_{a,t}\) denote the angular distance between the object and the goal, and the rotational difference is \(d_{r,t}=2\arcsin\min\{|d_{a,t}|,1.0\}\). The reward is defined as follows, \(r_{t}=\exp\{-0.2(\alpha d_{p,t}+d_{r,t})\}\), where \(\alpha\) is a constant balance of positional and rotational reward.

**Safety Joint** constrains the freedom of joint 4 of the forefinger (refer to Figure 6 (c) and (d)). Without the constraint, joint 4 has freedom of \([-20^{\circ},20^{\circ}]\). The safety tasks restrict joint 4 within \([-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]\). Let \(\text{ang\_4}\) be the angle of joint 4, and the cost is defined as: \(c_{t}=\mathbb{I}(\text{ang\_4}\not\in[-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}])\).

**Safety Finger** constrains the freedom of joints 2, 3 and 4 of forefinger (refer to Figure 6 (c) and (e)). Without the constraint, joints 2 and 4 have freedom of \([0^{\circ},90^{\circ}]\) and joint 4 of \([-20^{\circ},20^{\circ}]\). The safety tasks restrict joints 2, 3, and 4 within \([22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}]\), \([22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}]\), and \([-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]\) respectively. Let \(\text{ang\_2}\), \(\text{ang\_3}\), \(\text{ang\_4}\) be the angles of joints 2, 3, and the cost is defined as:

Footnote 4: Safety-Starter-Agents: https://github.com/openai/safety-starter-agents

\[c_{t}=\mathbb{I}(\text{ang\_2}\not\in[22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}],\text{ or }\text{ang\_3}\not\in[22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}],\text{ or }\text{ang\_4}\not\in[-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]).\] (1)

## 5 Safe Policy Optimization Algorithms: SafePO

This section provides a detailed discussion of the design of SafePO. Features such as strong performance, extensibility, customization, visualization, and documentation are all presented to demonstrate the advantages and contributions of SafePO.

CorrectnessFor a benchmark, it is critical to ensure its correctness and reliability. Firstly, each algorithm is implemented strictly according to the original paper (_e.g._, ensuring consistency with the gradient flow of the original paper, etc.). Secondly, we compare our implementation with those line by line for algorithms with a commonly acknowledged open-source code base to double-check the correctness. Finally, we compare SafePO with existing benchmarks (_e.g._, Safety-Starter-Agents5 and RL-Safety-Algorithms6) and SafePO outperforms or achieves comparable performance with other existing implementations, as shown in Table 1.

## 6 Experiments and Analysis

**Reward and Cost.** Episodic reward and cost exhibit a trade-off relationship. Unconstrained algorithms aim to maximize reward through risky behaviors. HAPPO [37] achieves higher rewards compared to MAPPO [38] across 8 velocity-based tasks, accompanied by a simultaneous increase in average costs. SafeRL algorithms tend to maximize reward while adhering to constraints. As depicted in Table 2, in the velocity task, compared to PPO [43], PPO-Lag [18] achieves a reduction of \(98\%\) in cost while only experiencing a decrease of \(45\%\) in reward.

**Randomness and Oscillation.** The randomness of tasks is correlated with the oscillation of algorithms' performance. All SafeRL algorithms achieve average episodic costs within the cost_limit for velocity tasks. The divergence in episodic rewards between algorithms is negligible, and the distribution of optimal policies is tightly clustered. However, pronounced oscillations are present in navigation tasks characterized by high stochasticity. Out of the 20 navigation tasks examined,

**Lagrangian vs. Projection.** In contrast to projection-based methods, the Lagrangian-based methods tend to display more oscillation. A notable disparity becomes apparent upon examining the oscillatory patterns in the episodic cost around the designated safety constraints during training, as presented in Figure 8(b). Both CPO [30] and PPO-Lag [18] demonstrate oscillations; however, those exhibited by PPO-Lag are more conspicuous. This discrepancy is manifested in a higher proportion of instances classified as _Strongly Unsafe_ and _Strongly Safe_ for PPO-Lag, while CPO maintains a more centered distribution. Nevertheless, an excessively cautious policy has the potential to undermine performance. In contrast, the projection-based method PCPO [3] exhibits lower average costs and rewards in navigation and velocity tasks than CPO. This distinction is further accentuated when examining the contrast between MACPO and MAPPO-Lag.

**Lagrangian vs. PID-Lagrangian.** Incorporating a PID controller within the Lagrangian-based framework proves to be effective in mitigating inherent oscillations. As shown in Figure 8, CPPO-PID [44] displays episodic rewards during training that closely resemble those of PPO-Lag. However, CPPO-PID demonstrates a reduced frequency of instances entering the _Strongly Unsafe_ region, resulting in a more significant proportion of _Safe_ states and improved safety performance.

## 7 Limitations and Future Works

Ensuring safety remains a paramount concern. Across various tasks, safety concerns can be transformed into corresponding constraints. However, a limitation of this study is its inability to encompass all forms of constraints. For instance, safety constraints related to human-centric considerations are paramount in human-AI collaboration, yet these considerations have not been fully integrated within the scope of this study. This work focuses on safety tasks within a simulated environment and introduces an extensive testing component. However, the transferability of the results to complex real-world safety-critical applications may be limited. A promising work for the future involves transferring policy refined within the Safety-Gymnasium to physical robotic platforms, which holds profound implications.

Details of Experimental Results

### Hyperparameters Analysis

This section presents the disclosure of SafePO hyperparameters settings and their rationales. We employed the Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE)[45] method to estimate the values of rewards and cost advantages and used Adam[46] for learning the neural network parameters.

**Single-agent Algorithm Settings.** The models employed in the single-agent algorithms were 3-layer MLPs with Tanh activation functions and hidden layer sizes of [64, 64], for more intricate navigation agents Ant and Doggo, hidden layers of [256, 256] were employed.

**Multi-agent Algorithms Settings.** The models employed in the multi-agent algorithms were 3-layer MLPs with ReLU activation functions and hidden layer sizes of [128, 128].

**Lagrangian Multiplier Settings.** Lagrangian-based methods are sensitive to hyperparameters. We present the following detailed description of the settings for both the naive and the PID-controlled Lagrangian multiplier.

* Lagrangian Initial Value: The initial value of the Lagrangian multiplier. It impacts the early-stage performance of the Lagrangian-based methods. A higher initial value promotes safer exploration but may impede task completion. Conversely, a lower initial value delays the agent's exploration of safe policies.
* Lagrangian Learning Rate: The learning rate of the Lagrangian multiplier. A high learning rate induces excessive oscillations, impedes convergence speed, and hinders the algorithm's ability to attain the desired solution. Conversely, a low learning rate slows down convergence and adversely affects training.
* PID Controller Kp: The PID controller's proportional gain determines the output's response to changes in the episodic costs. If pid_kp is too large, the Lagrangian multiplier oscillates, and performance deteriorates. If pid_kp is too small, the Lagrangian multiplier updates slowly, also impacting performance negatively.
* PID Controller Kd: The PID controller's derivative gain governs the output's response to changes in the episodic costs. If pid_kd is too large, the Lagrangian multiplier becomes excessively sensitive to noise or changes in the episodic costs, leading to instability or oscillations. If pid_kd is too small, the Lagrangian multiplier may not respond quickly or accurately enough to changes in the episodic costs.
* PID Controller Ki: The PID controller's integral gain determines the controller's ability to eliminate the steady-state error by integrating the episodic costs over time. If pid_ki is too large, the Lagrangian multiplier may become overly responsive to previous errors, adversely affecting performance.

### Performance Table of Safety-Gymnasium

All experimental outcomes were derived from 10 assessment iterations encompassing multiple random seeds and under the experimental setting of cost_limit=25.00. The \(\uparrow\) indicates higher rewards are better, while the \(\downarrow\) indicates lower costs (when beyond the threshold of 25.00) are better. _Gray_ and _Black_ depicts breach and compliance with the cost_limit, while _Green_ represents the optimal policy, maximizing reward within safety constraints.

### Experimental Results Analysis.

During the observation of the experimental results, we have discovered some Insightful findings that are presented below:

* The Lagrangian method is a promising yet constrained baseline approach, successfully optimizing rewards while adhering to constraints. However, its effectiveness heavily relies on hyperparameters configuration, as discussed in Table A.1. Consequently, despite being a dependable baseline, the Lagrangian method is not exempt from limitations.
* Second-order algorithms perform worse in achieving higher rewards in the MuJoCo velocity series but better in navigation series tasks that require higher safety standards, _i.e._, achieving similar or approximate rewards while minimizing the number and smoothness of cost violations.

**Car:** As shown in Figure 10, the robot in question operates in three dimensions and features two independently driven parallel wheels, along with a freely rolling rear wheel. This design requires coordinated operation of the two drives for both steering and forward/backward movement. While the robot shares similarities with a basic Point robot, it possesses added complexity. The overall information of Car, the specific action and observation space of Car is shown in Table 9, Table 10, Table 11.

**Racecar.** As shown in Figure 11, the robot is closer to realistic car dynamics, moving in three dimensions, it has one velocity servo and one position servo, one to adjusts the rear wheel speed to

### Task Representation

As shown in Figure 14, the Gymnasium-based learning environments support the following tasks:

**Velocity:** the robot aims to facilitate coordinated leg movement of the robot in the forward (right) direction by exerting torques on the hinges.

**Run:** the robot starts with a random initial direction and a specific initial speed as it embarks on a journey to reach the opposite side of the map.

**Circle:** the reward is maximized by moving along the green circle, and the agent is not allowed to enter the outside of the red region, so its optimal constrained path follows the line segments \(AD\) and \(BC\). The reward function: \(R(s)=\frac{v^{T}[-y,x]}{1+||[x,y]||_{2}-d|}\), the cost function is \(C(s)=\mathbf{1}\left[|x|>x_{\mathrm{lim}}\right]\), where \(x,y\) are the coordinates in the plane, \(v\) is the velocity, and \(d,x_{\mathrm{lim}}\) are environmental parameters.

**Goal:** the robot navigates to multiple goal positions. After successfully reaching a goal, its location is randomly reset while maintaining the overall layout. Achieving a goal position, indicated by entering the goal circle, yields a sparse reward. Additionally, a dense reward encourages the robot's progress by rewarding proximity to the goal.

**Push:** the objective is to move a box to a series of goal positions. Like the goal task, a new random goal location is generated after each successful achievement. The sparse reward is earned when the yellow box enters the designated goal circle. The dense reward consists of two components: one for moving the agent closer to the box and another for bringing the box closer to the final goal.

**Button:** the objective is to activate a series of goal buttons distributed throughout the environment. The agent's goal is to navigate towards and make contact with the currently highlighted button, known as the goal button. Once the correct button is pressed, a new goal button is selected and highlighted while preserving the rest of the environment. The sparse reward is earned upon successfully pressing the current goal button, while the dense reward component provides a bonus for progressing toward the highlighted goal button.

### Constraint Specification

**Velocity-Constraint** consists of a series of safety tasks based on MuJoCo agents [23]. In these tasks, agents, such as Ant, HalfCheetah, and Humanoid, are trained to move faster for higher rewards, while also being imposed a velocity constraint for safety considerations. Formally, for an agent moving on a two-dimensional plane, the velocity is calculated as \(v(s,a)=\sqrt{v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2}}\); for an agent moving along a straight line, the velocity is calculated as \(v(s,a)=|v_{x}|\), where \(v_{x}\), \(v_{y}\) are the velocities of the agent in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions respectively. Then, \(cost(s,a)=[v(s,a)>v_{limit}]\), Here, \([P]\) denotes a notation where the value is \(1\) if the proposition \(P\) is true, and \(0\) otherwise.

**Pillars** are employed to represent large cylindrical obstacles within the environment. In the general setting, contact with a pillar incurs costs.

**Hazards** are utilized to model areas within the environment that pose a risk, resulting in costs when an agent enters such areas.

**Sigwalls** are designed specifically for Circle tasks. They serve as visual representations of two or four solid walls, which limit the circular area to a smaller region. Crossing the wall from inside the safe area to the outside incurs costs.

**Vases** are specifically designed for Goal tasks. They represent static and fragile objects within the environment. Touching or displacing these objects incurs costs for the agent.

**Gremlins** are specifically employed in the Button tasks. They represent moving objects within the environment that can interact with the agent.

### Vision-only Tasks

In recent years, vision-only SafeRL has gained significant attention as a focal point of research, primarily due to its applicability in real-world contexts [40; 41]. While the initial iteration of Safety Gym offered rudimentary visual input support, there is room for enhancing the realism and complexity of its environment. To effectively evaluate vision-based safe reinforcement learning algorithms, we have devised some more realistic visual tasks utilizing MuJoCo. This enhanced environment facilitates the incorporation of both RGB and RGB-d inputs. More details can be

### Some Issues about Safety Gym

Figure 21: The difference between Safety-Gymnasium and Safety Gym.

Figure 20: Overview of FormulaOne tasks.

The bug of Natural Lidar.As shown in Figure 21, the original Natural Lidar in Safe-Gym7 has a problem of not being able to detect low-lying objects, which may affect comprehensive environmental observations.

Footnote 7: https://github.com/openai/safety-gym

**The problem of observation space.** In Safety Gym, by default, the observation space is presented as a one-dimensional array. The implementation leads to all ranges in observation space to be \([-\infty,+\infty]\), as shown in the following code:

``` ifself.observation_flatten: self.obs_flat_size=sum([np.prod(i.shape)foriin self.obs_space_dict.values()]) self.observation_space=gym.spaces.Box(-np.inf,np.inf, (self.obs_flat_size,),dtype=np.float32) ```

While this representation does not lead to behavioral errors in the environment, it can be somewhat misleading for users. To address this issue, we have implemented the Gymasium's flatten mechanism in the Safety Gym to handle the representation of the observation space. This mechanism reorganizes the observation space into a more intuitive and easily understandable format, enabling users to process and analyze the observation data more effectively.

``` self.obs_info.obs_space_dict=gymnasium.spaces.Dict(obs_space_dict) ifself.observation_flatten: self.observation_space=gymnasium.spaces.utils.flatten_space( self.obs_info.obs_space_dict) else: self.observation_space=self.obs_info.obs_space_dict
8 assertself.obs_info.obs_space_dict.contains( obs),f'Badobs{obs}{self.obs_info.obs_space_dict}' ifself.observation_flatten: obs=gymnasium.spaces.utils.flatten(self.obs_info.obs_space_dict, obs) returnobs ```

**Missing cost information.** In Safety Gym, by default, there are only two possible outputs for the cost: 0 and 1, representing whether a cost is incurred or not.

```
#Optionallyremoveshapingfromrewardfunctions. ifself.constrain_indicator: forkinlist(cost.keys()): cost[k]=float(cost[k]>0.0)#Indicatorfunction ```

We believe that this representation method loses some information. For example, when the robot collides with a vase and causes the vase to move at different velocities, there should be different cost values associated with it to indicate subtle differences in violating constraint behaviors. Additionally, these costs incurred by the actions are accumulated into the total cost. In typical cases, algorithms use the total cost to update the policy if the total cost generated by different obstacles is limited to only two states 0 and 1, the learning potential for multiple constraints is lost when multiple costs are triggered simultaneously.

**Neglected dependency maintenance leads to conflicts.**

### Supported Agents

Safety-DexteroudsHand is based on Bi-DexHands (refer to [42] for more details). Bi-DexHands aims to establish a comprehensive learning framework for two Shadow Hands, enabling them to possess a wide range of skills similar to those of humans. The Shadow Hand's joint limitations are as follows (refer to Table 26). The thumb exhibits 5 degrees of freedom with 5 joints, while the other fingers have 3 degrees of freedom and 4 joints each. The joints located at the fingertips are not controllable. Similar to human fingers, the distal joints of the fingers are interconnected, ensuring that the angle of the middle joint is always greater than or equal to that of the distal joint. This design allows the middle phalange to be curved while the distal phalange remains straight. Additionally, an extra joint (LF5) is located at the end of the little finger, enabling it to rotate in the same direction as the thumb. The wrist comprises two joints, facilitating a complete 360-degree rotation of the entire hand.

Stiffness, damping, friction, and armature are also important physical parameters in robotics. For each Shadow Hand joint, we show our DoF properties in Table 27. This part can be adjusted in the Isaac Gym simulator.

### Task Representation

#### Hand Over

This scenario encompasses a specific environment comprising two Shadow Hands positioned opposite each other, with their palms facing upwards. The objective is to pass an object between these hands. Initially, the object will randomly descend within the area of the Shadow Hand on the right side. The hand on the right side then grasps the object and transfers it to the other hand. It is important to note that the base of each hand remains fixed throughout the process. Furthermore, the hand initially holding the object cannot directly make contact with the target hand or roll the object towards it. Hence, the object must be thrown into the air, maintaining its trajectory until it reaches the target hand.

In this task, there are 398-dimensional observations and 40-dimensional actions. The reward function is closely tied to the positional discrepancy between the object and the target. As the pose error diminishes, the reward increases significantly. The detailed observation space for each agent can be found in Table 29, while the corresponding action space is outlined in Table 30.

**Observations** The observational space for the Hand Over task consists of 398 dimensions, as indicated in Table 29. However, it is important to highlight that in this particular task, the base of the dual hands remains fixed. Therefore, the observation for the dual hands is compared to a reduced 24-dimensional space, as described in Table 28.

**Actions** The action space for a single hand in the Hand Over task comprises 40 dimensions, as illustrated in Table 30.

**Rewards** Let the positions of the object and the goal be denoted as \(x_{o}\) and \(x_{g}\) respectively. The translational position difference between the object and the goal, represented as \(d_{t}\), can be computed as \(d_{t}=\|x_{o}-x_{g}\|_{2}\). Similarly, we define the angular position difference between the object and the goal as \(d_{a}\). The rotational difference, denoted as \(d_{r}\), is then calculated as \(d_{r}=2\arcsin(\mathrm{clamp}(\|d_{a}\|_{2},\text{max}=1.0))\).

The rewards for the Hand Over task are determined using the following formula:

\[r=\exp(-0.2(\alpha d_{t}+d_{r}))\] (2)

Here, \(\alpha\) represents a constant that balances the rewards between translational and rotational aspects.

### Hand Over Catch

This environment is made up of a half Hand Over, and Catch Underarm [42], the object needs to be thrown from the vertical hand to the palm-up hand.

**Observations** The observational space for this combined task encompasses 422 dimensions, as illustrated in Table 31.

**Actions** The action space, consisting of 52 dimensions, is illustrated in Table 32, providing a comprehensive representation of the available actions.

**Rewards** Let's denote the positions of the object and the goal as \(x_{o}\) and \(x_{g}\), respectively. The translational position difference between the object and the goal denoted as \(d_{t}\), can be calculated as \(d_{t}=\|x_{o}-x_{g}\|_{2}\). Additionally, we define the angular position difference between the object and the goal as \(d_{a}\). The rotational difference, denoted as \(d_{r}\), is given by the formula \(d_{r}=2\arcsin(\text{clamp}(\|d_{a}\|_{2},\text{max}=1.0))\). Finally, the rewards are determined using the specific formula:

\[r=\exp[-0.2(\alpha d_{t}+d_{r})]\] (3)

Here, \(\alpha\) represents a constant that balances the translational and rotational rewards.

### Constraint Specification

**Safety Joint** constrains the freedom of joint 1 of the forefinger (please refer to Figure 23 (c) and (d)). Without the constraint, joint 1 has freedom of \([-20^{\circ},20^{\circ}]\). The safety tasks restrict joint 1 within \([-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]\). Let \(\text{ang\_4}\) be the angle of joint 1, and the cost is defined as:

\[c_{t}=\mathbb{I}(\text{ang\_4}\not\in[-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]).\] (4)

**Safety Finger** constrains the freedom of joints 1, 2 and 3 of forefinger (please refer to Figure 23 (c) and (e)). Without the constraint, joints 1 and 2 have freedom of \([0^{\circ},90^{\circ}]\) and joint 1 of \([-20^{\circ},20^{\circ}]\). The safety tasks restrict joints 1, 2, and 1 within \([22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}]\), \([22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}]\), and \([-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]\) respectively. Let \(\text{ang\_2},\text{ang\_3},\text{ang\_4}\) be the angles of joints 1, 2, and the cost is defined as:

\[c_{t}=\mathbb{I}(\text{ang\_2}\not\in[22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}],\text{ or }\text{ang\_3}\not\in[22.5^{\circ},67.5^{\circ}],\text{ or }\text{ang\_4}\not\in[-10^{\circ},10^{\circ}]).\] (5)
