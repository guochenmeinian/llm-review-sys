###### Abstract

We introduce a decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, for large language models, which only caches key-value pairs once. It consists of two components, i.e., a _cross-decoder_ stacked upon a _self-decoder_. The self-decoder efficiently encodes global key-value (KV) caches that are reused by the cross-decoder via cross-attention. The overall model behaves like a decoder-only Transformer, although YOCO only caches once. The design substantially reduces GPU memory demands, yet retains global attention capability. Additionally, the computation flow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output, thereby significantly speeding up the prefill stage. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable performance compared to Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and number of training tokens. We also extend YOCO to 1M context length with near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. The profiling results show that YOCO improves inference memory, prefill latency, and throughput by orders of magnitude across context lengths and model sizes.

## 1 Introduction

Decoder-only Transformer [40] has become the de facto architecture for language models. By caching the previously computed key/value vectors, the model can reuse them for future generation steps. The key-value cache avoids encoding the history again for each token, greatly improving the inference speed. The compelling feature establishes the decoder-only architecture as the standard option.

However, as the number of serving tokens increases, the key-value (KV) caches occupy a lot of GPU memory, rendering the inference of large language models memory-bounded [29]. For the example of a 65B-size language model (augmented with grouped-query attention [1] and 8-bit KV quantization), 512K tokens occupy about 86GB GPU memory, which is even larger than the capacity of one H100-80GB GPU. In addition, the prefilling latency of long-sequence input is extremely high. For instance, using four H100 GPUs, the 7B language model (augmented with Flash-Decoding [6] and kernel fusion) requires about 110 seconds to prefill 450K tokens, and 380 seconds for 1M length. The above bottlenecks make it difficult to deploy long-context language models in practice.

In this work, we propose a decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, for large language models, which only caches KV pairs once. Specifically, we stack cross-decoder upon self-decoder. Given an input sequence, the self-decoder utilizes efficient self-attention to obtain KV caches. Then the cross-decoder layers employ cross-attention to reuse the shared KV caches. The decoder-decoder architecture is conceptually similar to encoder-decoder, but the whole model behaves more like a decoder-only model from the external view. It naturally fits into autoregressive generation tasks, such as languagemodeling. First, because YOCO only caches once2, the GPU memory consumption of KV caches is significantly reduced. Second, the computation flow of the decoder-decoder architecture enables prefilling to early exit before entering the self-decoder. The nice property speeds up the prefill stage dramatically, improving user experience for long-context language models. Third, YOCO allows for more efficient system design for distributed long-sequence training. In addition, we propose gated retention for self-decoder, which augments retention [35] with a data-controlled gating mechanism.

Footnote 2: The word “once” refers to global KV cache. Strictly, self-decoder also needs to store a certain number of caches. As the self-decoder utilizes an efficient attention module, the cache size is bounded to a constant, which can be ignored compared to global caches when the sequence length is large.

We conduct extensive experiments to show that YOCO achieves favorable language modeling performance and has many advantages in terms of inference efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO can be scaled up with more training tokens, larger model size, and longer context length. Specifically, we scale up the 3B YOCO model to trillions of training tokens, attaining results on par with prominent Transformer language models, such as StableLM [39]. Moreover, the scaling curves ranging from 160M to 13B show that YOCO are competitive compared to Transformer. We also extend the context length of YOCO to 1M tokens, achieving near-perfect needle retrieval accuracy. In the multi-needle test, YOCO obtains competitive results even compared to larger Transformers.

In addition to good performance on various tasks, the profiling results show that YOCO improves the GPU memory footprint, prefill latency, throughput, and serving capacity. In particular, the memory of KV caches can be reduced by about \(80\times\) for 65B models. Even for a 3B model, the overall inference memory consumption can be reduced by two times for 32K tokens and by more than nine times for 1M tokens. The prefill stage is speeded up by \(71.8\times\) for the 1M context and \(2.87\times\) for the 32K input. For example, for a 512K context, YOCO reduces the Transformer prefilling latency from 180 seconds to less than six seconds. The results position YOCO as a strong candidate model architecture for future large language models with native long-sequence support.

## 2 Related Work

Numerous efforts have been made to reduce KV caches for inference. Efficient attention mechanisms are proposed, such as sparse Transformer [4], linear attention [18], and recurrent modeling [27; 13; 46; 3; 19]. Another strand of research drops KV caches to achieve sparsity [49; 43; 11]. In comparison, we keep one global KV cache and still conduct full cross-attention for better long-context modeling. Moreover, some previous methods are complementary to our proposed architecture. For example, multi-/grouped-query attention [33; 1] and multi-latent attention [7] can be used in YOCO. Low-bit KV quantization [14; 25; 34] can also be used together to reduce memory consumption. In addition, the intriguing property of YOCO greatly speeds up the prefill stage.

## 3 You Only Cache Once (YOCO)

The proposed architecture, named YOCO, is designed for autoregressive modeling, such as large language models (LLMs). As shown in Figure 1, the decoder-decoder architecture has two parts, i.e., self-decoder and cross-decoder. Specifically, YOCO is stacked with \(L\) blocks, where the first \(\frac{L}{2}\) layers are self-decoder while the rest modules are cross-decoder. Given an input sequence \(x=x_{1}\cdots x_{|x|}\), the input embeddings are packed into \(X^{0}=[\bm{x}_{1},\cdots,\bm{x}_{|x|}]\in\mathbb{R}^{|x|\times d_{\text{model}}}\), where \(d_{\text{model}}\) is hidden dimension. We first obtain contextualized vector representations \(X^{l}=\operatorname{Self-Decoder}(X^{l-1}),l\in[1,\frac{L}{2}]\), where \(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}}\) is used to produce KV caches \(\hat{K},\hat{V}\) for cross-decoder. Then we compute \(X^{l}=\operatorname{Cross-Decoder}(X^{l-1},\hat{K},\hat{V}),l\in[\frac{L}{2}+1,L]\) to get the output vectors \(X^{L}\). After obtaining \(X^{L}\), a \(\operatorname{softmax}\) classifier performs next-token prediction over the vocabulary.

Both self- and cross-decoder follow a similar block layout (i.e., interleaved attention and feed-forward network) as in Transformer [40]. We also include pre-RMSNorm [48], SwiGLU [32], and grouped-query attention [1] as improvements. The difference between the two parts lies in attention modules. Self-decoder uses efficient self-attention (e.g., sliding-window attention). In comparison, cross-decoder uses global cross-attention to attend to the shared KV caches produced by the output of the self-decoder. Notice that the whole model behaves like a decoder-only model. The tokens generated by cross-decoder are also fed back to self-decoder.

### Self-Decoder

Self-decoder takes embeddings \(X^{0}\) as input and compute intermediate vector representation \(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}}\):

\[Y^{l} =\mathrm{ESA}(\mathrm{LN}(X^{l}))+X^{l}\] (1) \[X^{l+1} =\mathrm{SwiGLU}(\mathrm{LN}(Y^{l}))+Y^{l}\]

where \(\mathrm{ESA}(\cdot)\) represents efficient self-attention, \(\mathrm{SwiGLU}(X)=(\mathrm{swish}(XW_{G})\odot XW_{1})W_{2}\), and RMSNorm [48] is used for \(\mathrm{LN}(\cdot)\). Causal masking is used for efficient self-attention.

The key property of the efficient self-attention module is \(\mathcal{O}(1)\) inference memory, i.e., constant number of KV caches. For example, the cache size of sliding-window attention [4] depends on the window size instead of the input length. More design choices (e.g., gated retention) of the efficient self-attention module are detailed in Section 4.

### Cross-Decoder

First, the output of the self-decoder \(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}}\) generates global KV caches \(\hat{K},\hat{V}\) for cross-decoder:

\[\hat{K}=\mathrm{LN}(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}})W_{K},\quad\hat{V}=\mathrm{LN}(X ^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}})W_{V}\] (2)

where \(W_{K},W_{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) are learnable. Then, cross-decoder layers are stacked after self-decoder to obtain the final output \(X^{L}\). The KV caches \(\hat{K},\hat{V}\) are reused by all the \(\frac{L}{2}\) cross-decoder modules:

\[Q^{l} =\mathrm{LN}(X^{l})W_{Q}^{l}\] (3) \[Y^{l} =\mathrm{Attention}(Q^{l},\hat{K},\hat{V})+X^{l}\] \[X^{l+1} =\mathrm{SwiGLU}(\mathrm{LN}(Y^{l}))+Y^{l}\]

where \(\mathrm{Attention}(\cdot)\) is standard multi-head attention [40], and \(W_{Q}^{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) is a learnable matrix. Causal masking is also used for cross-attention. Because cross-attention is compatible with group query attention [1], we can further save the memory consumption of KV caches.

Figure 1: Overview of the decoder-decoder architecture. Self-decoder generates the global KV cache. Then cross-decoder employs cross-attention to reuse the shared KV caches. Both self-decoder and cross-decoder use causal masking. The overall architecture behaves like a decoder-only Transformer, autoregressively generating tokens.

### Inference Advantages

In addition to competitive language modeling results, YOCO significantly reduces serving costs and improves inference performance. We report detailed inference comparisons in Section 5.4.

Saving GPU Memory and Serving More Tokens.Table 1 compares the memory complexity between Transformers and YOCO. Specifically, because global KV caches are reused and efficient self-attention needs constant caches, the number of caches is \(\mathcal{O}(N+CL)\), where \(N\) is the input length, \(C\) is a constant (e.g., sliding window size), and \(L\) is the number of layers. For long sequences, \(CL\) is much smaller than \(N\), so about \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) caches are required, i.e., you only cache once. In comparison, Transformer decoders have to store \(N\times L\) keys and values during inference. So YOCO roughly saves \(L\) times GPU memory for caches compared to Transformer. Because the bottleneck of inference capacity becomes KV caches, our method enables us to serve many more tokens without being out of GPU memory. The increased batch size is also beneficial to inference throughput.

Reducing Prefilling Time and Improving Throughput.As shown in Figure 2, because the cross-decoder reuses the outputs of self-decoder, we can exit early before entering the cross-decoder during the prefill stage. The intriguing property of computation dependency greatly accelerates the prefilling speed. First, only half the layers are needed for forward computation, i.e., at least half prefilling latency reduction. Second, the efficient attention modules of the self-decoder are usually fast. For the example of 512K context length, we can decrease the prefilling latency from 180 seconds (Transformer with optimized inference, such as Flash-Decoding) to less than 6 seconds (Figure 9). Even for 32K length, YOCO has about three times speedup in terms of prefilling time. Table 2 compares prefilling time complexity of attention modules between Transformer and YOCO.

## 4 Design Choices of Self-Decoder

We can choose various efficient self-attention methods for self-decoder. As long as the module only requires constant inference memory, the self-decoder's cache memory complexity depends on the number of layers. Moreover, a good module choice improves both training and deployment costs. In this work, we use sliding-window attention (Section 4.1) or gated retention (Section 4.2).

### Sliding-Window Attention

Sliding-window attention [4] restricts the attention range into a fixed window size \(C\). In contrast, vanilla Transformer decoders attend to all previous tokens. During inference, the KV cache memory complexity can be reduced from \(\mathcal{O}(N)\) to \(\mathcal{O}(C)\), i.e., the memory usage is constant rather than increasing with sequence length. Similar to multi-head self-attention [40], we compute the output of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline  & **KV Cache Memory** \\ \hline Transformer & \(\mathcal{O}(LND)\) \\ YOCO & \(\mathcal{O}((N+L)D)\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Inference memory complexity of KV caches. \(N,L,D\) are the sequence length, number of layers, and hidden dimension.

Figure 2: YOCO Inference. **Prefill**: encode input tokens in parallel. **Generation**: decode output tokens one by one. The computation flow enables prefilling to early exit without changing the final output, Table 2: Prefilling time complexity of attention modules. \(N,L,D\) are the same as above.

sliding-window attention via:

\[\begin{split} Q=XW_{Q},\quad K=XW_{K},\quad V=XW_{V}\\ \mathrm{head}_{i}=\mathrm{softmax}(Q_{[i]}K_{[i]}^{\intercal}+B)V, \quad B_{ij}=\begin{cases}0,&i-C<j\leq i\\ -\infty,&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\\ \mathrm{SWA}(X)=\mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head}_{1},\cdots,\mathrm{head}_{h}) W_{O}\end{split}\] (4)

where \(W_{Q},W_{K},W_{V},W_{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) are learnable matrices, and the window causal mask \(B\) controls each query only attends to the previous keys whose distances are less than \(C\). The pre-normalization and residual connection are also applied to the module.

### Gated Retention

Gated retention (gRet, aka gRetNet) augments retention [35] with a data-dependent gating mechanism. We use gRet as the default efficient self-attention module. The method unifies the parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent computation paradigms, which are equivalent and can obtain the same computation results. The training process usually uses the parallel or chunkwise recurrent paradigms, while the inference stage can employ the recurrent paradigm for constant KV memory.

The Parallel RepresentationThe gated retention is defined as:

\[\begin{split} Q=(XW_{Q})\odot\Theta,\quad K=(XW_{K})\odot \overline{\Theta},\quad V=XW_{V},\quad\Theta_{n}=e^{in\theta}\\ \gamma=\mathrm{sigmoid}(XW_{\gamma})^{1/\tau},\quad D_{nm}= \begin{cases}\prod\nolimits_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i},&n\geq m\\ 0,&n<m\end{cases}\\ \mathrm{gRet}(X)=(QK^{\intercal}\odot D)V\end{split}\] (5)

where \(W_{Q},W_{K},W_{V}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) and \(W_{\gamma}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times 1}\) are learnable weights, and the temperature term \(\tau\) encourages \(\gamma\) to 1 for better memorization [46]. The data-controlled decay is head-wise [19] rather than element-wise so that the computation can fully utilize NVIDIA tensor cores. Refer to [35] for more details about the other designs.

The Recurrent RepresentationBeing equivalent to Equation (5), the output of gated retention can be computed recurrently. For the \(n\)-th timestep, the output is obtained via:

\[\begin{split} S_{n}=\gamma_{n}S_{n-1}+K_{n}^{\intercal}V_{n}\\ \mathrm{gRet}(X_{n})=Q_{n}S_{n},\quad n=1,\cdots,|x|\end{split}\] (6)

where \(Q,K,V,\gamma\) are the same as in Equation (5). During auto-regressive inference, the self-decoder maintains \(S_{n}\) as the intermediate state for an efficient generation.

The Chunkwise Recurrent RepresentationThe chunk-wise representation is a unified formulation of recurrent and parallel representations. Given chunk size \(B\), the outputs are computed chunk by chunk. The computation is divided into inner-chunk and cross-chunk parts. Denote \([i]\) as the \(i\)-th chunk, i.e., \(x_{[i]}=x_{(i-1)B+1},\cdots,x_{iB}\), we compute the \(i\)-th chunk as:

\[\begin{split}\beta_{(i-1)B+j}&=\prod\limits_{k=(i- 1)B+1}^{(i-1)B+j}\gamma_{k},\quad D_{[i]}(j,k)=\frac{\beta_{(i-1)B+k}}{\beta_{ (i-1)B+j}}\ \ \mathrm{if}\ \ j\leq k\ \ \mathrm{else}\ \ 0\\ R_{i}&=K_{[i]}^{\intercal}(V_{[i]}\odot\frac{ \beta_{iB}}{\beta_{[i]}})+\beta_{iB}R_{i-1},\ \ \beta_{[i]}(j,k)=\beta_{(i-1)B+j}\\ \mathrm{gRet}(X)&=\underbrace{(Q_{[i]}K_{[i]}^{ \intercal}\odot D_{[i]})V_{[i]}}_{\text{Inner-Chunk}}+\underbrace{(Q_{[i]}R_{i -1})\odot\beta_{[i]}}_{\text{Cross-Chunk}}\end{split}\] (7)

where \(R_{i}\) is the intermediate state of the \(i\)-th chunk, and \(\beta\) summarizes the data-controlled decay \(\gamma\). Appendix B proves the equivalence between the computation paradigms. The chunkwise paradigm combines the best of parallelism and recurrence, i.e., saving FLOPs compared to fully parallel computation and reducing iterations compared to recurrent computation. During the training and prefill stages, the chunk-wise representation increases throughput and reduces GPU memory consumption.

Multi-Head Gated RetentionSimilar to multi-head attention [40] and multi-scale retention [35], we apply gated retention to each head and combine the outputs together:

\[\mathrm{head}_{i} =\mathrm{gRet}(X)\] (8) \[Y =\mathrm{GroupNorm}_{h}(\mathrm{Concat}(\mathrm{head}_{1},\cdots, \mathrm{head}_{n}))\] \[\mathrm{MHGR}(X) =(\mathrm{swish}(XW_{G})\odot Y)W_{O}\]

where \(W_{G},W_{O}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) are learnable matrices, and \(\mathrm{GroupNorm}\)[42] normalizes each head [41]. We also apply \(\mathrm{swish}\) gate to increase non-linearity [35].

## 5 Experiments

We evaluate YOCO for large language models from the following perspectives. First, we follow the setting of StableLM-3B-4E1T [39] to scale up training tokens (Section 5.1). Second, we present the scaling curves of the proposed architectures (Section 5.2). Third, we scale up the YOCO model to 1M context length and evaluate its long-sequence modeling capability (Section 5.3). Fourth, we analyze the deployment advantages, including GPU memory footprint, serving capacity, prefilling time, and throughput (Section 5.4). Experimental results show that YOCO achieves competitive performance in various evaluation metrics and significantly reduces the inference cost.

### Language Modeling Evaluation

We train a 3B-size YOCO language model by scaling up the number of training tokens. Then we compare the checkpoints with strong Transformer-based language models. We use a similar training recipe to that in StableLM-3B-4E1T [39]. Detailed hyperparameters are described in Appendix D.

ResultsTable 3 compares YOCO with OpenLLaMA-v2-3B [12], StableLM-base-alpha-3B-v2 [38], and StableLM-3B-4E1T [39]. We use LM Eval Harness [10] to evaluate zero-shot performance on various downstream tasks. OpenLLaMA-v2-3B and StableLM-base-alpha-3B-v2 are trained with 1T tokens. The intermediate numbers of StableLM-3B-4E1T are taken from its technical report [39]. Experimental results indicate that YOCO achieves comparable results with previous well-tuned Transformer language models. Both the checkpoints trained with 1T tokens and 1.6T tokens obtain a consistent trend. Moreover, the results show that YOCO is scalable in terms of training tokens.

### Scalability Compared with Transformers

We compare the scaling curves between Llama Transformer [40; 37], YOCO with gated retention (YOCO\({}_{\text{gRet}}\); Section 4.2), and YOCO with sliding-window attention (YOCO\({}_{\text{SWA}}\); Section 4.1). We train language models of various sizes (i.e., 160M, 400M, 830M, 1.4B, 2.7B, 6.8B, and 13B) using the same training data and settings. We augment the Transformer architecture with Llama [37] improvements, such as RMSNorm [48], SwiGLU [32], and removing bias. The sliding window size of YOCO\({}_{\text{SWA}}\) is 1,024. The training batch size is 0.25M tokens with a 2k sequence length. We train the models with 40k steps, i.e., 10B tokens. In practice, we find that the setting is effective for loss convergence, and scaling laws can be well-fitted. More hyperparameters are detailed in Appendix E.

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: Eval Harness [10] accuracy compared with well-trained Transformer language models. We scale the 3B model to 1.6 trillion training tokens. The 1T and 1.6T results of StableLM-3B-4E1T are taken from its technical report [39]. YOCO-3B-1M is extended to the context length of 1M tokens.

ResultsFigure 3 reports the validation loss with various parameter counts. We also fit the scaling curves as in [17]. YOCO obtains comparable performance from 160M to 13B compared to the Llama-optimized transformer architecture. The findings demonstrate that YOCO scales effectively with respect to model size. Moreover, YOCO\({}_{\text{gRet}}\) outperforms Transformer and YOCO\({}_{\text{SWA}}\). The gains come from hybrid architectures of attention and retention, whose inductive biases tend to be complementary to each other. Recent hybrid architectures [21] also confirm similar findings.

### Long-Context Evaluation

We extend the context length of YOCO-3B (Section 5.1) to 1M tokens. We continue the model training with longer lengths progressively. The length schedule is 64K, 256K, and 1M tokens. Training data is up-sampled according to sequence length [9]. For a fair comparison, we do not use long-instruction tuning data. More training details are described in Appendix F.

Needle In A Haystack with 1M ContextThe pressure test evaluates whether models can retrieve "needles" from a long document [16]. We follow the evaluation setting of Gemini 1.5 [30] and LWM [24]. The needles are constructed as a city with a magic number. We run 10 times at the same depth and length. The average accuracy is reported. Figure 4 shows that YOCO-3B-1M passes the Needle-In-A-Haystack test with near perfect accuracy. The results indicate that YOCO has strong long-context modeling capability.

Multi-Needle RetrievalBesides single-needle retrieval, we conduct a multi-needle evaluation. We compare YOCO-3B-1M with previous long-context language models, including MiniCPM-128K [15], ChatGLM3-128K [47], YaRN-Mistral-128K [28], and LWM-1M-text [24]. The evaluation is conducted in 128K sequence length, because most previous models are tuned with this length.

Table 4 presents accuracy results with \(N\) needles. LWM-1M-text and YOCO-3B-1M are trained with a 1M context length, while the others are of 128K length. Although LWM-1M-text continues training of Llama-2-7B, YOCO-3B-1M can still achieve comparable performance with half the model size. Moreover, the 7B-size YaRN-Mistral-128K [28] obtained by position interpolation lags behind the other models. Compared to MiniCPM-128K and ChatGLM3-128K, YOCO-3B-1M also outperforms these well-trained language models.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline
**Model** & **Size** & \(N=1\) & \(N=2\) & \(N=4\) & \(N=8\) \\ \hline YaRN-Mistral-128K [28] & 7B & 0.02 & 0.12 & 0.08 & 0.20 \\ LWM-1M-text [24] & 7B & 1.00 & 0.90 & 0.76 & 0.62 \\ MiniCPM-128K [15] & 2.4B & 1.00 & 1.00 & 0.54 & 0.56 \\ ChatGLM3-128K [47] & 6B & 0.94 & 0.72 & 0.52 & 0.44 \\ YOCO-3B-1M & 3B & 0.98 & 0.98 & 0.84 & 0.56 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Multi-needle retrieval accuracy. \(N\) indicates the number of needles. \(N=1\) is single-needle retrieval used as a reference, and \(N>1\) indicates the multi-needle test. The evaluation is conducted in 128K length, because most previous long-context models are tuned with this length.

Perplexity over Long SequencesFigure 5 shows the cumulative average negative log-likelihood (NLL) as a function of context length. We evaluate both book and repository-level code data. We follow the setting of [30] and filter validation data that are longer than 1M tokens. NLL decreases consistently with longer sequence length. The results indicate that YOCO can effectively utilize long-distance dependency for language modeling. We also observe that the NLL-length curves tend to fit the power law, where the gaps are affected by the noise within the validation examples.

### Inference Advantages

We analyze inference efficiency from various perspectives, such as GPU memory footprint, prefilling latency, throughput, and serving capacity. We show that YOCO reduces the deployment cost by orders of magnitude, especially for long-sequence inference. More importantly, the user experience (such as latency) is improved while maintaining good performance and reducing expenses.

We compare YOCO\({}_{\text{gRet}}\) with Transformer. The default model configuration follows Section 5.1. Notice that Transformer uses grouped-query attention [1], Flash-Decoding [6], and kernel fusion for a fair comparison. As described in Section 4.2, gated retention uses the chunk-recurrent representation in the prefill stage, and the recurrent representation in the generation stage. The chunk size is set to 256. We implement a Triton [36] kernel for gated retention. The evaluation sequence length ranges from 32K to 1M. The last 1,024 tokens are supposed to be generated, while the previous tokens are given input context. The experiments are conducted with H100-80GB GPU cards.

GPU MemoryThe inference memory consumption is made up of three parts, namely model weights, intermediate activation, and KV cache. Figure 6 presents the breakdown memory profiling results. Along with an increase in context length, the main memory bottleneck becomes KV caches, while model weights consume constant memory. The results show that YOCO\({}_{\text{gRet}}\) alleviates the activation cost and KV cache memory footprint.

As shown in Figure 7, the memory cost is significantly reduced using YOCO. Moreover, the memory consumption of YOCO increases slowly along the sequence length. For example of 1M length, the overall inference memory usage is only 12.4GB, while Transformers occupy \(9.4\times\) GPU memory. YOCO makes it feasible to deploy long-sequence modeling on customer-level GPUs. Even with a 32K sequence length, YOCO requires about \(2\times\) less memory than Transformer. Although we compare 3B-size models here, the reduction ratio becomes larger as the number of layers increases.

Figure 8 reports the GPU memory consumption of KV cache for each token. As YOCO only caches one layer of global key-value pairs, it needs roughly \(L\) times less memory compared to Transformer.

Figure 5: Cumulative average negative log-likelihood on book and repository-level code. We filter the validation examples that are longer than 1M tokens. YOCO achieves improved performance with longer context, i.e., utilizing long-distance information for language modeling.

Figure 6: Breakdown memory consumption in 1M context length.

For example, YOCO can serve 128K tokens with 1GB GPU memory, while Transformer with GQA [1] can only support 1.6K tokens at 65B model size.

#### 5.4.2 Prefilling Latency

In the prefill stage, the model encodes input tokens in parallel. As shown in Figure 10, the prefilling latency is a pain point of user experience for long-context models. For 512K- and 1M-length input sequences, Transformer needs about 180 seconds and 300 seconds, respectively. The computational complexity of Transformer is \(\mathcal{O}(N^{2})\), which requires a large number of FLOPs for long context. In contrast, YOCO's prefilling time is \(\mathcal{O}(N)\), growing linearly (Section 3.3) along the sequence length. Figure 10 shows that YOCO reduces the Transformer prefilling time from 180 seconds to less than 6 seconds for 512K context. As described in Section 3.3, the prefill stage can early exit before entering cross-decoder. So, there is at least two times speedup of prefilling latency even for short context. For example, YOCO is \(2.87\times\) faster than Transformer for 32K length.

#### 5.4.3 Throughput

The throughput indicates how many tokens the model can process per second, involving both pre-filling and generation time. Figure 10 shows that YOCO achieves higher throughput across context lengths compared to Transformer. For the example of 512K queries, Transformer's throughput is 4.5 token/s while YOCO reaches 43.1 token/s, i.e., achieving \(9.6\times\) speedup. The throughput is improved for the following reasons. First, YOCO decreases the time required for prefilling as previously demonstrated. Second, as the memory consumption is reduced, we can use larger batch size for inference, which also contributes to the throughput improvement.

### Comparisons with Transformer Variants

We compare YOCO\({}_{\text{gRet}}\) and YOCO\({}_{\text{SWA}}\) with Transformer and other variants, including H3 [5], RetNet [35], Mamba [13], and gRetNet (Section 4.2). All models have 160M parameters with 12 layers and a hidden dimension of 768. The weights of word embedding and \(\operatorname{softmax}\) projection are shared. For Mamba, we follow the details in [13], where double-SSM layers are implemented instead of "SSM + SwiGLU". For H3, the experiment uses a hybrid version following the original paper [5], where two attention layers are inserted after the first and \(\frac{L}{2}\)-th layers.

Fine-Grained LM PerplexityTable 5 reports the fine-grained validation perplexity for language modeling. Following Zoology [2], we divide the perplexity into "_Ar-Hit_" and "_First-Occur_". Specifically, "_Ar-Hit_" considers the predicted tokens that are bigrams previously seen in the previous context, which evaluates the associative recall capability. "_First-Occur_" considers the tokens that cannot be recalled from the context.

Long-Context EvaluationFigure 11 reports the answer perplexity with varying context length (ranging from 4K to 16K) on the ZeroSCROLLS [31] benchmark. We continue training the above models in 16,384 length with 2B tokens. The rotation base scaling [44] is used for length extension. For sparse Transformer, we use the context window of 2,048 and keep RoPE \(\theta\) unmodified. As shown in Figure 11, YOCO and Transformer consistently outperform other methods across tasks and lengths, which is consistent with the findings in Section 5.3. Moreover, the results highlight the importance of global attention for long-context modeling. Notice that the 12K and 16K results in Qasper are similar because the lengths of most documents are shorter than 16K.

### Ablation Studies

As shown in Table 6, we explore different layout configurations for YOCO. First, we compare the ratio of self-decoder to cross-decoder layers. For example, YOCO\({}_{[1:1]}\) is the default setting, where each module contains \(\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}\) layers. The results show that YOCO\({}_{[1:1]}\) is comparable to YOCO\({}_{[3:1]}\) and outperforms both YOCO\({}_{[1:3]}\) and YOCO\({}_{[0:1]}\). We use \([1:1]\) as the default layout. Future work can refine a scaling law to guide the choice of layer ratio. Second, the setting "Unstacked YOCO\({}_{[1:1]}\)" uses word embeddings \(X^{0}\) as input to the cross-decoder, rather than stacking cross-decoder upon self-decoder (i.e., using \(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}}\) in Equation (3)). Third, the model "Interleaved & Hybrid" is a hybrid architecture that interleaves gRetNet and Transformer layers.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we propose a decoder-decoder architecture (YOCO) for large language modeling. YOCO achieves significantly better inference efficiency and competitive performance compared to Transformers. Experimental results demonstrate that YOCO achieves favorable results for large language models in various settings, i.e., scaling up the number of training tokens, scaling up model size, and scaling up context length to 1M tokens. Profiling results also show that YOCO improves inference efficiency by orders of magnitude, especially for long-sequence modeling.

Chunk Parallelism for Long-Sequence Training of YOCO

We introduce chunk parallelism for YOCO to reduce the communication frequency, accelerating long-sequence training in Section 5.3. Dividing long sequences into different devices is essential when the training length is extremely long [20, 8]. However, the overall throughput tends to be bounded by GPU communication [23]. Cross-decoder disentangles self-attention dependency while preserving modeling capability, bringing intriguing advantages to distributed long-sequence training.

In self-decoder, the dependency only exists in the adjacent devices. For example, gated retention only requires the hidden state \(S_{n}\) in Equation (6), and sliding-window attention attends to tokens within the context window. Therefore, the communication amount of self-decoder is relatively small. In the cross-decoder, the all-gather operation is only triggered once for the KV cache, rather than communicating in each layer. The hardware-friendly architecture gives more flexibility to distributed long-sequence training.

## Appendix B Chunk-wise Representation of Gated Retention

We illustrate the equivalence between recurrent representation and chunkwise recurrent representation of gated retention. For the output \(O_{n}\), \(n\) can be split as \(n=kB+r\) where \(B\) is the chunk size:

\[O_{n}=\sum_{m=1}^{n}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}Q_{n}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m} =\sum_{m=kB+1}^{n}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}Q_{n}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m}+\sum_{m=1}^{kB}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}Q_{n}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m}\] (9) \[\sum_{m=kB+1}^{n}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}Q_{n}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m} =(Q_{n}K_{kB+1:n}^{\intercal}\odot\Gamma_{kB+1:n})V_{kB+1:n}\] \[\sum_{m=1}^{kB}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}Q_{n}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m} =(Q_{n}\prod_{i=kB+1}^{n}\gamma_{i})\sum_{c=0}^{k-1}\sum_{m=1}^{B} (K_{m+cB}^{\intercal}V_{m+cB}\prod_{i=m+cB+1}^{(c+1)B}\gamma_{i})\prod_{i=(c+1) B+1}^{kB}\gamma_{i}\] \[=(Q_{n}\prod_{i=kB+1}^{n-1}\gamma_{i})\sum_{c=1}^{k}(K_{[c]}^{ \intercal}(V_{[c]}\odot\zeta_{[c]}))\prod_{i=c+1}^{k}\alpha_{i}\] \[=(Q_{n}\prod_{i=kB+1}^{n-1}\gamma_{i})R_{i-1}\]

Figure 12: Chunk parallelism of YOCO training on two GPU devices. The training strategy is to partition the sequence into different chunks. \(M\) denotes the intermediate representation \(X^{\nicefrac{{L}}{{2}}}\), i.e., the output of self-decoder. The keys and values in the cross-decoder are only gathered once.

where \(\Gamma_{i}=\prod_{k=i+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}\), \(\zeta_{[c]}(j,k)=\prod_{i=(c-1)B+j+1}^{cB}\gamma_{i}\), \(\alpha_{i}=\prod_{j=(i-1)B+1}^{iB}\gamma_{j}\), \([i]\) indicates the \(i\)-th chunk, i.e., \(x_{[i]}=[x_{(i-1)B+1},\cdots,x_{iB}]\). \(R_{n}\) is written as a recurrent function:

\[R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\intercal}(V_{[i]}\odot\zeta_{[i]})+\alpha_{i}R_{i-1}\] (10)

Denote \([i]\) as the \(i\)-th chunk, i.e., \(x_{[i]}=[x_{(i-1)B+1},\cdots,x_{iB}]\), \(\beta_{(i-1)B+j}=\prod_{k=(i-1)B+1}^{(i-1)B+j}\), \(\beta_{[i]}(j,k)=\beta_{(i-1)B+j}\), We concatenate the output in a block together:

\[O_{[n]} =\sum_{m=kB+1}^{[n]}\beta_{[n]}Q_{[n]}K_{m}^{\intercal}V_{m}+ \sum_{m=1}^{kB}\beta_{[n]}Q_{[n]}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}K_{m}^{ \intercal}V_{m}\] \[\sum_{m=kB+1}^{[n]}\beta_{[n]}Q_{[n]}K_{m}^{\intercal}V_{m} =(Q_{[n]}K_{[n]}^{\intercal}\odot D_{[n]})V_{[n]},\quad D_{[n]}(j,k)=\frac{\beta_{(n-1)B+k}}{\beta_{(n-1)B+j}}\text{ if }\ j\leq k\text{ else }0\] \[\sum_{m=1}^{kB}\beta_{[n]}Q_{[n]}\prod_{i=m+1}^{n}\gamma_{i}K_{m}^ {\intercal}V_{m} =\beta_{[n]}Q_{[n]}R_{i-1},\quad R_{i}=K_{[i]}^{\intercal}(V_{[i] }\odot\frac{\beta_{iB}}{\beta_{[i]}})+\beta_{iB}R_{i-1},\] \[O_{[n]} =\underbrace{(Q_{[n]}K_{[n]}^{\intercal}\odot D_{[n]})V_{[n]}}_{ \text{Inner-Chunk}}+\underbrace{(Q_{[n]}R_{n-1})\odot\beta_{[n]}}_{\text{ Cross-Chunk}}\]

Finally, we show that the chunkwise recurrent representation of gated retention is equivalent to the other two representations.

## Appendix C Pseudo Code of Gated Retention

We present pseudocode for the three computation paradigms of gated retention (Section 4.2). Parallel implementation enables training parallelism to fully utilize GPUs. The recurrent paradigm enables low-cost inference. Chunkwise retention combines the above advantages (i.e., parallel within each chunk and recurrent across chunks), which has linear memory complexity for long sequences.

## Appendix D Hyperparameters for YOCO-3B (Section 5.1)

We adjust the head dimension to 128 instead of 80 as in StableLM for better kernel support. To keep the model size unchanged, we set the hidden size to 3072 and the number of layers to 26. Grouped-query attention [1] is used, where the number of query heads is 24, and the number of key-value heads is 8. We train YOCO with gated retention (Section 4.2). The non-embedding parameter count is 2.8B. In comparison, StableLM-3B-4E1T is 2.7B and OpenLLaMA-v2-3B [12] is 3.2B. The training sequence length is 4096. The batch size is 4M tokens. We use the AdamW [26] optimizer with \(\beta=0.9,0.95\). The maximal learning rate is 3.2e-4 with 1000 warmup steps and linear decay to 1.28e-5. The total schedule is set to 5T tokens. Given the resource budget, we train the model with 400k steps (1.6T tokens). The curated training corpus is similar to [39]. We use tiktoken-cl100k_base as the tokenizer. The hidden dimension is set to 3072. The number of layers is 26. The number of query heads is 24, and the number of key/value heads is 8 with grouped-query attention [1]. The total number of parameters without embedding is 2.83B. The training batch size is 4M tokens. We use 4096 training length. The optimizer is AdamW [26] with \(\beta=(0.9,0.95)\). The learning rate is \(3.2\times 10^{-4}\) with 1000 warmup steps. We set a 5T-token learning rate schedule with linear decay to \(1.28\times 10^{-5}\).

## Appendix E Hyperparameters for Scaling Curves (Section 5.2)

Table 8 reports the hidden dimension, number of layers, and number of heads used for different model sizes. The head dimension of gated retention is set to 256. To align the number of parameters, the FFN size for Transformer is \(\frac{8}{3}d\) while the FFN size for YOCO is \(3d\). The training length is set to 2048. The batch size is set to 0.25M tokens. We use the AdamW [26] optimizer with \(\beta_{1}=0.9,\beta_{2}=0.98\). The learning rate is \(1.5\times 10^{-4}\) for 160M to 1.4B sizes and \(7.5\times 10^{-5}\) for 2.7B to 13B sizes. The

warmup step is 375 with linear rate decay. The weight decay is set to 0.05. We train the models with 40k steps, i.e., 10B tokens.

## Appendix F Hyperparameters for Length Extension

We progressively extend the context length to 1M tokens in Section 5.3. The length schedule is 64K, 256K, and 1M. We up-sample the documents that are longer than the training length [9]. Table 9 shows that we use different RoPE \(\theta\) and learning rate for each stage.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction is carefully written. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Limitations are discussed in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: There is no theoretical result in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experiment can be easily reproduced based on the model description, hyperparameter, and any well-known pre-training corpus. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code will be released in camera-ready version. All of the data we use is public-available. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Hyperparameters are attached in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: For large language models, the variance between different runs is negligible. Moreover, the evaluation pipeline is deterministic. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The corresponding resources are stated in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We follow the NeurIPS Code of Ethics in the research. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: We work on fundamental research that has no direct societal impact. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not pose safety risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We carefully follow the licenses of open-source code, data, and models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
