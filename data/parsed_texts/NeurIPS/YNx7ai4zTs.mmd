###### Abstract

Machine unlearning (MU) empowers individuals with the 'right to be forgotten' by removing their private or sensitive information encoded in machine learning models. However, it remains uncertain whether MU can be effectively applied to Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), particularly in scenarios of forgetting the leaked visual data of concepts. To overcome the challenge, we propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU), to unlearn the visual recognition of a concept by fine-tuning a single associated image for few steps. SIU consists of two key aspects: (i) Constructing multifaceted fine-tuning data. We introduce four targets, based on which we construct fine-tuning data for the concepts to be forgotten; (ii) Joint training loss. To synchronously forget the visual recognition of concepts and preserve the utility of MLLMs, we fine-tune MLLMs through a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss combined with Cross Entropy loss. Alongside our method, we establish MMUBench, a new benchmark for MU in MLLMs and introduce a collection of metrics for its evaluation. Experimental results on MMUBench show that SIU completely surpasses the performance of existing methods. Furthermore, we surprisingly find that SIU can avoid invasive membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore MU in MLLMs. We will release the code and benchmark in the near future.

## 1 Introduction

Recent years have witnessed the great success of Large Language Models (LLMs) [33, 3] and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) [47, 49]. They play dominant roles in NLP [5, 37] and multimodal applications [50, 17] ascribed to the large-scale pre-training data [2, 35, 29]. Unfortunately, these data may contain overlooked elements of personal privacy and copyright infringement, posing potential risks of data leakage [32, 36]. Retraining the models from scratch to exclude the risky data is a waste of resource and practically untenable due to the inaccessible pre-training data. To address the issue, prior works [12, 46, 45, 27, 31] have shown that approximate machine unlearning (MU) methods can forget specific pieces of knowledge embedded within LLMs.

Nevertheless, it remains unclear if such strategies of knowledge forgetting are transferable to MLLMs, especially for forgetting the visual recognition of various concepts. The challenge of unlearning visual recognition in MLLMs is formidable. A primary obstacle is **limited training data**. Recent work [12] utilizes a text of original book (2.1M tokens) combined with synthetic sentences (1M tokens) as the forgetting dataset. To forget the character '_Harry Potter_', this work fine-tunes Llama-7b-chat-hf [41] on the entire forgetting dataset for 3 epochs. However, in the real scenario of unlearning the visual recognition of concepts, collecting sufficient images of targeted concepts is challenging. The limited amount of training data poses a significant barrier to unlearning all concept-wise visual knowledge encoded in pre-trained MLLMs. Another challenge is **model degradation**[52, 19], which pervasively exists in large generative models. Researchers [46] discover that LLMs could stop generating harmful texts by employing Gradient Ascent (GA) on forgetting datasets, thus reducing the need for synthetic data. However, GA often results in meaningless outputs such as only a _whitespace_ or _repeated tokens_, which eliminate the utility of LLMs. To address this issue, several studies [45, 46] combine GA with minimizing KL-divergence between unlearned and original LLMs to preserve the utility of LLMs. Despite mitigating the meaningless response problem, the method may output self-contradictory answers, as if the concept is not unlearned. This issue may arise from a conflict between objectives of GA and KL-divergence. GA aims to make LLMs cease generating tokens of targeted unlearning concepts, whereas KL-divergence seeks to align the output probability distribution of the unlearning model with that of the original model. The distribution includes the probabilities of generating tokens of targeted unlearning concepts, which are high in the original model.

To address the challenges, we take the first step to explore MU in MLLMs and propose an efficient method, Single Image Unlearning (SIU). SIU requires only a single training image of the targeted concepts to enable MLLMs to forget the visual recognition of these concepts. We first put forward four targets, namely Aligning with Unseen Concepts, Assigning New Visual Description, Decoupling Factual Knowledge and Preserving Non-targeted Knowledge. In accordance with these four targets, we construct the fine-tuning data. Moreover, we introduce an innovative Dual Masked KL-divergence (DMK) Loss to be jointly trained with Cross Entropy Loss. Different from prior works, the joint training loss is optimized by Gradient Descent. The DMK Loss incorporates two levels of masking on fine-tuning data, which are Token-Level Masking and Vocabulary-Level Masking. At the token-level, it masks tokens contradicting original knowledge in the sentence to exclude them from KL loss calculations. At the vocabulary-level, it specifically masks tokens of the targeted unlearning concepts across the entire vocabulary during KL loss computation.

Alongside our method we introduce MMUBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess MU within MLLMs. This benchmark includes a curated dataset with a minimum of 50 images for each of 20 concepts. One image per concept is designated for the forgetting training set, with the remainder serving to assess generality. To provide a thorough evaluation of MU, we develop an evaluation scheme including efficacy, generality, specificity, fluency and diversity. Efficacy and generality assess the effectiveness of the unlearning methods, while specificity, fluency and diversity evaluate the utility of MLLMs post-unlearning. MMUBench includes the application of existing methods as baselines, facilitating comparative analysis. The experimental results reveal that our approach surpasses these methods in all evaluation metrics. We observe that SIU could trigger positive butterfly effects, details of which are discussed in the experimental sections. Furthermore, we conduct membership inference attack and jailbreak attack [24, 34] experiments to examine the robustness of unlearning methods.

We summarize main contributions as follows:

* To the best of our knowledge, we are the pioneers in exploring unlearning the visual recognition of concepts in MLLMs, extending machine unlearning to multimodal settings.
* We propose a new method, namely SIU, to efficiently forget the visual recognition of concepts with only one training image. SIU incorporates Multifaceted Fine-tuning Data and Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss, both of which significantly enhance unlearning performance.
* We establish MMUBench, a new benchmark to evaluate the efficacy, generality, specificity, fluency and diversity of machine unlearning methods in MLLMs.
* The experimental results on MMUBench demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to existing methods. Furthermore, the ability to defend against membership inference attacks and jailbreak attacks reveal the robustness of our method.

Related Work

**Machine Unlearning.** In recent years, there has been a notable increase in interest concerning machine unlearning (MU) problems. The primary works [13; 6; 8] mainly focused on MU in classification tasks. However, the research of MU in LLMs is far from being developed. Different from classification task, MU in LLMs [39; 51] should not only stop generating harmful or private texts, but also remain the utility of LLMs. Yao et al. [46] employ Gradient Ascent (GA) method to forget original harful output. Wang et al. [42] propose a method to align the knowledge between the pre-trained model and fine-tuning model. Chen and Yang [7] introduce an efficient method to handle a deletion quest by introducing lightweight unlearning layers. Yao et al. [45] combine GA with KL-divergence to constrain the output probability distribution. Eldan and Russinovich [12] construct a dictionary of generic prediction to substitute the unlearning target in fine-tuning data. In our paper, we further extend the MU setting to MLLMs and propose a new method to efficiently forget the visual recognition of concepts for MLLMs.

**Multimodal Large Language Model.** MLLMs are architected by integrating a language model with a visual encoder, linked through an intermediary connector. A pioneering method introduced by [1] employs a query-based cross-attention mechanism, establishing an advanced and robust vision-language interaction module. In contrast, BLIP-2 [23] employs a Q-Former, which is a streamlined Transformer model, in place of the typical cross-attention. Enhancements in BLIP-2's performance are achieved by MiniGPT-4 [54] and InstructBLIP [10], which both incorporate instruction tuning datasets collected from a diverse range of public sources. To augment the models' comprehension capabilities, LLaVA, mPLUG-2 and Otter [26; 44; 21] have developed a system of instructional data. Progressing beyond earlier training methodologies, a novel three-stage training strategy [4] has been proposed to further refine multimodal representations. Additionally, CogVLM [43] introduces a visual expert system to elevate model performance.

## 3 Problem Definition

In our work, we mainly focus on unlearning the visual recognition of the concepts (e.g., Recognize Donald Trump in an image) rather than forgetting the factual knowledge (if have, e.g., Donald Trump is the former president) in MLLMs. The reason is that prior works [12; 42; 7] have explored the unlearning of factual knowledge extensively. Furthermore, the factual knowledge is embedded in the LLM and does not pertain much to the pre-training phase of MLLMs. Formally, let \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) denote the original MLLM, where \(\theta\) is the parameters of original MLLM. \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) is trained with a dataset that encompasses pairs of visual and textual data, \(\mathcal{D}=\{(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\), where \(\mathcal{I}_{i}\) represents an image and \(\mathcal{T}_{i}\) is a text consisting of \(t_{i}\) tokens \(\left\{w_{1}^{i},w_{2}^{i},\ldots,w_{t_{i}}^{i}\right\}\). We define the forgetting set \(\mathcal{D}^{f}=\{(\mathcal{I}_{j}^{\mathcal{C}},\mathcal{T}_{j}^{\mathcal{C }})\}_{j=1}^{K}\) as a collection of \(K\) image-text pairs associated with the visual recognition of targeted unlearning concepts \(\mathcal{C}\). Each \(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}}\) is an image depicting \(\mathcal{C}\) and each \(\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}}\) is the question-answer text about the image content pointing to \(\mathcal{C}\), where the answer reflects the forgetting of \(\mathcal{C}\). To facilitate the unlearning process and assess its impact, we partition \(\mathcal{D}^{f}\) into a training subset \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\) and a testing subset \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{test}\). \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\) contains a single image-text pair used to train the unlearned model, and \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{test}\) contains the remainder of the pairs used to evaluate the generality of unlearning.

We define the goal of MU in MLLMs as follows:

Machine unlearning in MLLMs aims to eliminate learned patterns associated with visual recognition of specific "to-be-forgotten" concepts, while preserving the MLLMs' prediction capabilities on inputs unrelated to those eliminated patterns.

By employing the negative log-likelihood of predicting the next token, the training objective is to obtain an unlearned model \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) and can be formulated as follows:\[\arg\min_{\hat{\theta}}\Bigg{\{}\mathbb{E}_{(\mathcal{I}_{j}, \mathcal{T}_{j})\in\mathcal{D}^{f}}\Big{[}-\sum_{t=1}^{t_{j}}\log P_{\mathcal{M}_ {\hat{\theta}}}(w_{t}^{j}|\mathcal{I}_{j},w_{1}^{j},\ldots,w_{t-1}^{j})\Big{]}\] (1) \[\qquad+\mathbb{E}_{(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})\in\mathcal{ D}\setminus\mathcal{D}^{f}}\Big{[}-\sum_{t=1}^{t_{i}}\log P_{\mathcal{M}_{ \hat{\theta}}}(w_{t}^{i}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i},\ldots,w_{t-1}^{i})\Big{]} \Bigg{\}},\mathcal{T}=w_{1},\ldots,w_{t}.\]

## 4 Methodology

In this section, we present our proposed method, namely SIU, for MU in MLLMs. As shown in Figure 1, we take _Donald Trump_ as an example of \(\mathcal{C}\). SIU consists of two parts, Multifaceted Fine-tuning Data and Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss. MMUBench will be introduced in Section 5.

### Multifaceted Fine-tuning Data

As stated in Section 3, for each \(\mathcal{C}\) we have a single image-text pair as forgetting training subset \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\). Based on \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\), we construct fine-tuning data centering on four targets. The details of fine-tuning data are shown in Figure 7 and Appendix A.3.

**Aligning with Unseen Concepts.** Different from classification models, where a simple reassignment of label is sufficient [20; 8], MLLMs require a logical continuity in their output. Our question here is, _what kind of response is reasonable? Is it enough for MLLMs to just answer 'I don't know'?_[12; 31; 9]

Our approach reinterprets the objective of MU, aiming to align the output distribution of \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) with that of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) under \(\mathcal{D}^{f}\) when the visual representations of \(\mathcal{C}\) are not present during the pre-training phase. To find the characteristics of output distribution, we conduct a set of tiny experiments on 190 private images of people that surely have not appeared in the pre-training phase of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) (detailed in Appendix A.1). We observe that \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) is unaware of concepts they have not seen and tends to generate factually vague or incorrect responses such as _'man'_, _'woman'_ or _'John'_. We assume though an incorrect response might be a hallucination, it actually achieves the purpose of unlearning. Moreover, in MU of classification tasks the model after unlearning would also output a wrong label [13; 6]. Thus, to guide \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) output incorrect names, the fine-tuning data for the first target is shown in Figure (a)a. The proof of effectiveness of this target is presented in Appendix A.2.

Figure 1: Overview of the Unlearning Process in MLLMs Using SIU. The process starts with a user request to unlearn the visual recognition of concepts, utilizing MMUBench (introduced in Section 5) to provide concepts for unlearning. SIU has two elements which are Multifaceted Fine-tuning Data and Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss. After unlearning, the unlearned MLLM is evaluated for generality, specificity, diversity, fluency, and resistance to membership inference and jailbreak attacks.

**Assigning New Visual Description.** In our primary experiments, it is found that utilizing only the fine-tuning data of the first target will lead MLLMs to recognize \(\mathcal{C}\) as both _Donald Trump_ and the new incorrect name. This phenomenon indicates that MLLMs correspond the same visual representations to the original name and the newly given name. Thus, we mitigate the risk of the MLLMs confusing the original and the new name by fabricating a new visual description for \(\mathcal{C}\). The constructed data for the target is shown in Figure 6(b).

**Decoupling Factual Knowledge.** Leveraging fine-tuning data only of the first two objectives could lead MLLMs to completely forget \(\mathcal{C}\) including the factual knowledge. This observation contradicts our definition in Section 3. For _Donald Trump_, he possesses many attributes, such as being a former U.S. President and a politician. Therefore, to decouple the factual knowledge of the concept, we use a specific factual piece of knowledge about him as fine-tuning data as depicted in Figure 6(c).

**Preserving Non-targeted Knowledge.** We find that only fine-tuning MLLMs on data associated with \(\mathcal{C}\) may lead to the forgetting of non-targeted knowledge. However, it is essential to ensure that unlearning process does not diminish its ability to accurately respond to other unrelated knowledge domains. Finally, we introduce examples which describe the knowledge of non-targeted concepts to alleviate this issue as shown in Figure 6(d).

### Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss

We propose a novel Dual Masked KL-divergence (DMK) Loss which refines the unlearning process by incorporating a dual masking technique into KL-divergence loss. The motivation of DMK is discussed in Appendix B. The masks of DMK are twofold:

**Token-Level Masking.** This mask operates at the token level, masking out tokens that contradicts original knowledge. Masked tokens are excluded from the computation of the KL divergence, preventing the model from increasing their probability in the output distribution. For instance, as stated in Section 4.1, we assign an alternative name such as _'Jacob Campbell'_ for _Donald Trump_. We then apply the mask to the tokens of _'Jacob Campbell'_ in the fine-tuning sentence, where the KL-divergence loss is not computed. Formally, for a training sample \(\mathcal{T}\) consisting of \(\{w_{1},w_{2},\dots,w_{n}\}\), the token-level mask is defined as:

\[K_{\mathcal{S}}=\{m_{1},m_{2},\dots,m_{n}\},\text{ where }m_{j}=\begin{cases}0,& \text{if }w_{j}\text{ is a specified token},\\ 1,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\] (2)

**Vocabulary-Level Masking.** The second level of masking operates across the entire vocabulary. For those tokens where KL-divergence loss is computed, we introduce a mask within the MLLMs' vocabulary specifically for the tokens of \(\mathcal{C}\)'s name. Mathematically, if \(\mathcal{V}\) is the vocabulary, the vocabulary-level mask for the vocabulary is:

\[K_{\mathcal{V}}=\{m_{v_{1}},m_{v_{2}},\dots,m_{v_{|\mathcal{V}|}}\},\text{ where }m_{v_{i}}=\begin{cases}0,&\text{if }v_{i}\in\mathcal{C},\\ 1,&\text{otherwise}.\end{cases}\] (3)

The formulation of the DMK Loss is as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}_{DMK}(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i};\hat{\theta})=\sum_{t=1}^{t _{i}}K_{\mathcal{S}}\cdot K_{\mathcal{V}}\cdot P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(w_{t }^{i}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})\log\frac{P_{\mathcal{M}_{ \theta}}(w_{t}^{i}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})}{P_{\mathcal{M} _{\hat{\theta}}}(w_{t}^{i}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})}.\] (4)

Finally, we optimize Cross Entropy Loss and \(\mathcal{L}_{DMK}\) using Gradient Descent:

\[\mathcal{L}_{total}(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i};\hat{\theta})=-\alpha\cdot \sum_{t=1}^{t_{i}}\log P_{\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}}(w_{t}^{i}|\mathcal{I}_{ i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})+\beta\cdot\mathcal{L}_{DMK}(\mathcal{I}_{i}, \mathcal{T}_{i};\hat{\theta}),\] (5)

where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are the hyper-parameters of weighing the two losses.

MMUBench

We establish MMUBench, a comprehensive benchmark for advancing MU within MLLMs. MMUBench is designed to evaluate the process of unlearning across various dimensions of model performance and behavior. The construction of dataset is detailed in Appendix C.1. In this section, we introduce the evaluation settings of MMUBench:

**Efficacy.** This dimension assesses how effectively \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) have unlearned seen examples. Efficacy measures the accuracy of answers given the inputs of \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\). It inspects if the \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\)'s outputs are now aligned with the objectives of the MU in MLLMs.

**Generality.** Generality examines the \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\)'s ability on \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{test}\). This evaluation ensures that MLLMs does not recognize \(\mathcal{C}\) across a set of unseen images. In addition to the visual generality, we also test the \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\)'s adaptability to a variety of textual prompts, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\)'s ability to generalize the unlearning process across both modalities. Generality is quantified using three types of measurements within MMUBench, which are Exact Match (EM), GPT-4 Evaluation (G-Eval) and \(\mathcal{C}\) Probability Distance (\(\mathcal{C}\)-Dis). The three measurements are detailed in Appendix C.3.

**Specificity.** Specificity measures the impact of unlearning on non-targeted knowledge. As we have no access to the whole remaining data of the pre-training phase, we employ a diverse set of public multimodal benchmarks to assess specificity. The evaluation benchmarks include GQA [18], VQA-v2 [14], VisWiz [15], SQA 1[30], VQA \({}^{\text{T}}\)[40], POPE [25], MMB [28], Mm-Vet [48]. We take the average of all benchmark performance as Specificity.

**Fluency.** Fluency evaluates the readability of responses of \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\), which ensures the utility of \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\). We compare the perplexity of sentences generated by the model before and after unlearning. When the name of \(\mathcal{C}\) appears in the output from \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\), we apply a mask to avoid distorting the fluency measurement:

\[Fluency=\exp(-\frac{1}{t_{i}}\sum_{t=1}^{t_{i}}\log P^{mask}_{ \mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}}(w^{i}_{t}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w^{i}_{1},\dots,w^{i}_{ t-1}),\] (6) \[P^{mask}_{\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}}(w^{i}_{t}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w^{i}_{1},\dots,w^{i}_{t-1})=\begin{cases}\frac{P_{\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta} }}(w^{i}_{t}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w^{i}_{1},\dots,w^{i}_{t-1})}{\text{ vocabulary size}},&\text{if }w^{i}_{t}\in\mathcal{C},\\ \end{cases}\]

where 'vocabulary size' is dependent on the specific MLLM.

**Diversity.** Diversity can measure whether \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) can generate unique answers. It also ensures that the output of \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) does not over-fit to a few templates that appear in the unlearning process. We count the number of unique words in the total generated output.

**Membership Inference Attack.** Membership inference attacks (MIA) could reveal whether the visual representations of \(\mathcal{C}\) are still encoded in \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\). As we could not get access to the pre-training data of MLLMs, we use Min-K% PROB [38], an MIA method without knowing the pre-training data. The detailed calculation of this measurement is stated in Appendix D.2.

**Jailbreak.** Jailbreak attacks are designed to assess how \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) performs under deliberately challenging or edge-case conditions, checking if \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) truly cannot generate outputs related to \(\mathcal{C}\). We utilize multilingual test [11] and multi-hop question test [53] as our jailbreak experiments.

## 6 Experiments

### Experiment setup

**Model and Training.** As stated in Appendix C.1, the concept filtering process is implemented by LLAVA [26] to construct dataset. To accurately compare the knowledge before and after unlearning, we also use LLAVA (7B and 13B) to obtain the unlearned model. The optimizer is Adam and the learning rate is 3e-4. Lora [16] is employed to fine-tune LLAVA with batch size 4. The training step is set to 6. We use four A100 40G GPUs to train the model. \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are 0.9 and 0.75 respectively.

**Baselines.** We compare our method with several existing methods: (i) Preference Optimization (PO). Following TOFU [31], we use _'I do not know.'_ and its variants as the responses to the questionscorrespond with \(\mathcal{C}\). (ii) Gradient Ascent (GA) [46]. It optimizes MLLMs to decrease their ability to recall or generate texts related to \(\mathcal{C}\). (iii) GA+KL [45]. To preserve the utility of MLLMs, KL-divergence loss is combined with GA.

**Evaluate Concepts.** In the experimental section, we primarily present the experimental results related to _Donald Trump_ due to the limited space. We report several other concepts covering different types, such as Cartoon concepts (_Hello Kitty_ and _Mario_) and abstract concepts about painting style (_Doodle_, _Picasso_ and _Van Gogh_). Moreover, we evaluate the effects of synchronously unlearning all the 20 concepts of MMUBench. The details of \(\mathcal{D}_{train}^{f}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{test}^{f}\) are presented in Appendix C.2.

### Experiment Results

**Main Results.** The experimental results in Table 1 present a comprehensive evaluation of various methods for machine unlearning in MLLMs. The observations are as follows: (i) Efficacy across all methods is at 100%, which indicates that each method is equally capable of unlearning the seen examples and aligning well with the objectives of machine unlearning. (ii) GA shows an outstanding performance in G-Eval with 1.8 score. However, this high score in generality is a result of GA's method always outputting _whitespace_ or _repeated tokens_. SIU also performs a high Generality with 99.0% EM score, showcasing its effectiveness at extending unlearning to unseen data. (iii) GA performs 9.0 in Specificity score, indicating that there's a strong impact on the model's knowledge base. SIU achieves a reasonable balance, with a score of 60.7, illustrating that it maintains a good level of model performance on non-targeted tasks. (iv) Fluency is where the GA method notably fails, with a score of 373.6. In contrast, SIU's fluency score of 61.2 suggests that it manages to retain coherent language outputs post-unlearning. (v) The PO method seems to have maintained a degree of diversity, as indicated by a moderate score. GA+KL shows a limited score of 48.0 in Diversity. GA's score is essentially at rock bottom (6.3), due to its most responses of _whitespace_ or _repeated tokens_. SIU performs admirably with a score of 97.0, indicating its maintenance in generating diverse responses post-unlearning. (vi) As the model size increases from 7B to 13B, there is a noticeable decline in the effectiveness of non-SIU methods in Generality. For example, the EM score for GA falls from 36.3% to 24.7%, and both PO and GA+KL experience severe drops in their generality scores. This sharp decline highlights a critical vulnerability in these methods due to the change in model size. (vii) SIU shows a relatively minor decline in generality (from 99% to 90% EM) when scaling up from the 7B to the 13B model. This slight reduction indicates that SIU is more adaptable and stable. (vii) Across all methods, there is an observed improvement in specificity, fluency, and diversity from the 7B to the 13B models. This enhancement suggests a trade-off between the effectiveness of unlearning and the preservation of model utility.

**Ablation Study of DMK Loss.** We perform an ablation study to evaluate the significance of Token-Level Masking and Vocabulary-Level Masking as shown in Table 2. Every masking is individually subjected to ablation to examine its effect. We use Mm-Vet benchmark as the specificity. It could be observed that the EM score without Token-Level Masking and Vocabulary-Level Masking both de

examination reveals an additional layer to this phenomenon. As can be seen in Figure 10, when the image is cropped to only include Melania Trump and presented to \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\), it accurately recognizes her and'remember' her relationship with Donald Trump. This discovery points to a fascinating aspect of machine unlearning: the selective retention of knowledge. The reason of this observation might be that the model's failure to identify the central male figure as Trump in the original image leads to an inference that the adjacent female could not be Melania. These positive butterfly effects suggest that unlearning is not a blunt tool that erases all traces of a concept but rather can result in a refined restructuring of knowledge within the model.

**Results of Unlearning Multiple Concepts Simultaneously.** Table 3 reports the results of synchronously unlearning all the concepts of MMUBench. We concat all the forgetting training sets of these concepts as fine-tuning data and the training step is set to 120. We find that after unlearning, the utility of MLLMs collapses using GA and GA+KL. All the responses of GA and GA+KL are repeated tokens _'image image...'_. It could be observed that there is some decline in Specificity and Fluency of PO. In contrast, each metric is nearly the same with unlearning a single concept utilizing SIU, which illustrates the robustness of SIU.

**MIA and Jailbreak.** Table 4 displays the results of MIA and Jailbreaks tests. The experimental details of MIA are stated in Appendix D.2. It could be observed that SIU achieves the lowest ROUGE-L score, indicating that the outputs of SIU diverge most from that of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\). We find PO also performs well under MIA. The reason may be that it tends to output _'I do not know.'_, leading to a low similarity score with the output of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\).

For Jailbreak, we conduct two types of tests, which are multilingual test and multi-hop question test. The experiments are detailed in Appendix D.3 and Appendix D.4. Combining Table 1 and Table4, we find that the performance of GA+KL and SIU on multilingual are both slightly improved from 2.8 to 2.9 and from 1.9 to 2.3. The case studies are shown in Figures 12 to 14. From the specific examples we find PO always outputs _'I do not know.'_ in different languages. The outputs of SIU are diverse in different languages, illustrating the preservation of utility. For multi-hop question test, as shown in Table 4, it could be observed that SIU performs well in Multi-hop questions, indicating the capability of defending hard examples. The case study of Multi-hop question is displayed in Figure 15. We find that though GA+KL avoids generating the name of \(\mathcal{C}\), it could still answer the right factual knowledge of the question. This self-contradictory answer illustrates the analysis in Section

## 7 Conclusion

We introduce SIU, an efficient method to unlearn the visual recognition of concepts in MLLMs with only one training image. We propose four targets to construct little fine-tuning data. To mitigate the degradation of MLLMs, we introduce Dual Masked KL-divergence Loss to be jointly trained with Cross Entropy Loss. Together with the method we present MMUBench, a benchmark to evaluate machine unlearning in MLLMs. The benchmark is composed of 1000 images, with 50 images for each of the 20 concepts, and a set of evaluation metrics. The experimental results illustrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method. For future work, we would try to extend this work mainly in the following aspects: (i) exploring new machine unlearning methods in MLLMs; (ii) evaluating machine unlearning for data points rather than concept-wise knowledge in MLLMs.

Fine-tuning Data

### Visit the output of unseen concepts

As the objective of unlearning is to achieve a model where forgetting data is not present in the training phase, we explore how do MLLMs respond when queried about unseen concepts. We collect the images of 190 people that are definitely not contained in the pre-training data of MLLMs. The use of these images has been explicitly approved by these people. We query the MLLMs with the prompt _Please give the specific name of this person.'_ The output distribution is shown in Figure 5. The results show that MLLMs will not answer _'I do not know.'_ when queried about unseen people. They tend to output general names such _'John'_ and _'Jason'_, or output a vague answer _'a man or woman'_. Though the answer _'I do not know.'_ is the most reasonable, it breaks the characteristics of MLLMs' output. We suppose that the characteristics gradually forms during the pre-training phase (perhaps there is little data containing the answer _'I do not know'_). Thus we assign a random name for the targeted unlearning concept in accordance with the characteristics of MLLMs' output. The candidate names are shown in Figure 6.

### Proof of Aligning with Unseen Concepts

Below, we provide a perspective on the target of _Aligning with Unseen Concepts_. We prove that our target can achieve the objective of MU in MLLMs. We first formalize each element in the reinterpretation of the objective of MU in MLLMs as stated in Section 4.1.

**Definition**.: Unlearned MLLM is fine-tuned with the forgetting training set \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}=\{(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{*}}_{j},\mathcal{T}^{ \mathcal{C}^{*}}_{j})\}_{j=1}^{K}\), which can be formulated as \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\leftarrow\{(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{*}}_{j}, \mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}^{*}}_{j})\}_{j=1}^{K}\). The pre-trained MLLM is trained with a collection of image-text pairs \(\mathcal{D}_{pre}=\{(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\), and the formula is \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\leftarrow(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N}\). All the pre-training data associated with \(\mathcal{C}\) is a subset of \(\mathcal{D}_{pre}\), denoted as \(\mathcal{D}^{c}_{pre}=\{(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{*}}_{o},\mathcal{T}^{ \mathcal{C}^{*}}_{o})\}_{q=1}^{M}\). The objective of MU in MLLM is to achieve a model that assumes the absence of \(\mathcal{D}^{c}_{pre}\) during its pre-training phase. Such model can be formulated as \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}\leftarrow\mathcal{D}_{pre}\setminus\mathcal{D} ^{c}_{pre}=\{(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{T}_{i})\}_{i=1}^{N-M}\). The training objective of _Aligning with Unseen Concepts_ is to achieve \(\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^ {c}_{test})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u},\mathcal{T}^{u})\), where \(\mathcal{I}^{u}\) and \(\mathcal{T}^{u}\) are the images and texts definitely not present in the pre-training phase of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\), while \(\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test}\) and \(\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test}\) are the image-text pairs in the forgetting test set. The objective of MU in MLLMs can be formulated as \(P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}}_{test},\mathcal{T }^{c}_{test})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}}_{test}, \mathcal{T}^{c}_{test})\).

**Proposition**.: _The training objective of Aligning with Unseen Concepts \(P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test})\cong P _{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u}_{i},\mathcal{T}^{u})\) equals to the objective of MU in MLLMs \(P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{ test})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{ test})\)._

Proof.: As \(\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test}\) and \(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\) both completely contain the visual representations of \(\mathcal{C}\), they are identically distributed. Moreover, \(\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test}\) is also identical to \(\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\) because they both query the recognition of \(\mathcal{C}\). Thus we have:

Figure 5: The output distribution of LLAVA when queried about the visual recognition of unseen concepts.

\[\begin{split} T^{c}_{test}&\cong\mathcal{I}^{\prime}_{C},\\ \mathcal{T}^{c}_{test}&\cong\mathcal{T}^{\prime}_{C}, \\ P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test}, \mathcal{T}^{c}_{test})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^ {C^{\prime}},\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}).\end{split}\] (7)

As \(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\) are not present in the pre-training phase of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}\), \((\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}},\mathcal{T}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}})\) is also an unseen image-text pair for \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}\). We have:

\[P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u},\mathcal{T}^{u})\cong P_ {\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c^{\prime}},\mathcal{T}^{ \mathcal{C}^{\prime}})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^ {c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test}).\] (8)

The difference between \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) is the absence of \(\mathcal{D}^{c}_{pre}\) during the pre-training phase. Because the representations of \(\mathcal{I}^{u}\) are completely different from that of \(\mathcal{I}^{\mathcal{C}^{\prime}}\), they are independent and distributed differently. Thus deleting \(\mathcal{D}^{c}_{pre}\) in the pre-training phase will not affect the prediction probability distribution of the model for \(\mathcal{I}^{u}\). We have:

\[P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u},\mathcal{T}^{u})\cong P_{ \mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u},\mathcal{T}^{u})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{ \theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test}).\] (9)

Assuming we have achieved the training objective \(P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{test})\cong P _{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{u},\mathcal{T}^{u})\), combined with Formula 9, we achieve \(P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta^{\prime}}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{ test})\cong P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(x|\mathcal{I}^{c}_{test},\mathcal{T}^{c}_{ test})\).

### Constructing fine-tuning data

Our constructed fine-tuning data for _Donald Trump_ are shown in Figure 7. The data is centered on four targets. '<image>' represents including the training image as part of the input for the current batch. For both _Aligning with Unseen Concepts_ and _Assigning New Visual Description_ the training image is input into the model, while another two targets do not take images as input. Moreover, we utilize GPT-4 [33] to rephrase four pieces of fine-tuning data for each target.

Figure 6: Candidate names for targeted unlearning concepts.

## Appendix B Motivation of DMK Loss

The Dual Masked KL-divergence (DMK) loss aims to address a core challenge that arises when unlearning concepts from MLLMs using traditional KL-divergence. While the standard KL-divergence loss function is effective in maintaining the overall utility of MLLMs, it can inadvertently introduce logical inconsistencies when applied to unlearning. The essence of the problem with using traditional KL-divergence for unlearning stems from its tendency to pull the probability distribution of tokens related to \(\mathcal{C}\) closer to the distribution of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\). This is contradictory to the goal of unlearning, where the aim is to suppress the MLLMs' ability to recall \(\mathcal{C}\). For example, considering the training phase, the input is the training image of \(\mathcal{C}\) and the prompt _'What's the name of the central figure in this photograph?'_. When MLLMs predict the next token and encounter the phrase _'This is'_, the token _'Donald Trump'_ should ideally have a reduced probability in the token distribution. However, since _Donald Trump'_ might have a high probability in \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\), standard KL divergence would work against the unlearning goal by increasing the likelihood of MLLMs predicting _'Donald Trump'_ after _'This is'_.

Table 5 further illustrates the motivation of DMK Loss. We utilize pre-trained LLAVA to generate the next-token probability distribution. The colored data shows relatively high probabilities for the token 'Donald' and 'Trump'. For the red colored data token \(w_{t}\) after 'President', we could formulate the probability distribution as \(P(w_{t})=P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(w_{t}|\mathcal{I}_{i},The,picture,features, President)\). It could be found that the probability of 'Donald' plus that of 'Trump' is near to 1, which indicates the probability of \(\mathcal{C}\) would be extremely high after the token 'President'. Directly minimizing the KL-divergence between \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) on the red colored tokens would cause unlearned model output higher probability of \(\mathcal{C}\), which is contrary to the objective of machine unlearning. Thus, in Token-Level Masking we mask the whole distribution to those tokens where the probability of \(\mathcal{C}\)-related tokens is extremely high. For the orange colored tokens (the token of the beginning and the token after 'features'), while the max probability is other token, the probability of 'Donald' and 'Trump' is also high. It would also improve the probability of generating \(\mathcal{C}\) if directly employing KL-divergence. To this end, we apply the vocabulary-level masks to the tokens of 'Donald' and 'Trump' in the vocabulary. As to the reason why we do not apply vocabulary-level mask to the red colored tokens, the probability of \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) generating other tokens is remarkably low on the red colored tokens. If only mask the tokens of 'Donald' and 'Trump' in the vocabulary, the probability of generating other tokens would also be seriously reduced for \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) due to KL-divergence loss, which harms the utility of MLLMs.

## Appendix C MMUBench Construction

### Dataset Construction

To construct a reliable and effective benchmark for evaluating MU within MLLMs, we initiated a comprehensive data collection and curation process.

**Concept Sampling.** Our first step was to sample a diverse set of 300 concepts from the MIKE dataset [22]. The MIKE dataset ensures that each concept is visually distinctive, which is crucial for MLLMs to unlearn these concepts.

**Image Collecting.** For each of these concepts, we employed an extensive image collection process using Google's search engine. We gathered at least 50 images per concept, resulting in a substantial pool of visual data. The rationale behind collecting such a large number of images was to robustly evaluate the generalization of the model's unlearning capabilities.

**Concept Filtering.** Upon collecting the images, we undertook a filtering process. A seed image for each concept from the MIKE dataset was used as a benchmark to evaluate the relevance of the collected images. We discarded any image where the depicted concept did not align with the concept represented by the seed image. This step was crucial to maintain consistency and ensure that the variations within the images did not introduce any ambiguity regarding the concept.

Following this filtering, we subjected the remaining images to a recognition test by inputting them into \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) with the prompt "What's the name of the central figure in this photograph?" If \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) correctly identifies the concept, this indicates that the concept presents within the pre-training phase and thus the images and concept are retained. If any image of the concept cannot be recognized by \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\), the concept was removed. After the filtering step, we finally retained 20 concepts.

### Forgetset Construction

**Images Splitting.** We select one image per concept to act as \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\) for the unlearning process. A critical consideration in this selection is the exclusivity of the target concept within the image. The chosen training images are those in which the concept was the central and singular focus, devoid of any additional elements that might lead to confusion. This is particularly important during the training phase where the MLLM must clearly understand which specific concept is to be unlearned. The rest of images are use as \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{test}\)

**Generation of Questions.** We utilize GPT-4 to generate the questions of \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{train}\) and \(\mathcal{D}^{f}_{test}\). We describe the task we wanted to evaluate to GPT-4, then provide a concept name to GPT-4, and ask it to generate 100 related questions that precisely correspond to this concept, returning the questions to us. After the questions are generated, we manually screen them and regenerate any that were not satisfactory, ensuring that each concept is associated with 100 questions. For example, the prompt given to GPT-4 to generate the questions of Donald Trump is _'My current task is to evaluate whether a multimodal large language model has forgotten Donald Trump. Please help me generate 100 questions for testing with given input images, along with the correct answer keywords (e.g., trump, yes). Organize the questions and keywords in JSON format, with prompt corresponding to the relevant questions and 'target phrase' corresponding to the keywords.'_ All the questions of Donald Trump are shown in Figure 23 and Figure 24.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Token & The & picture & features & President & Donald & Trump &. & \textless{}/s\(\succ\) \\ \hline max prob & 0.57 & 0.77 & 0.92 & 0.42 & 0.68 & 0.94 & 0.45 & 0.99 \\ Donald & 0.06 & 3.2e-5 & 1.2e-9 & 0.22 & **0.68** & 4.2e-5 & 1.2e-7 & 2.5e-6 \\ Trump & 0.08 & 4.8e-7 & 8.2e-9 & 0.02 & **0.31** & **0.94** & 6.3e-8 & 3.1e-9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Token probabilities of pre-trained LLVA given the image of Donald Trump and the prompt ‘who is in the picture?’. The first line is the max probability of current token. The second and the third lines report the probability of ‘Donald’ and ‘Trump’ of the current token.

### Three measurements of Generality

We have three measurements for Generality: (i) Exact Match (EM). The first measurement is a straightforward way to determine if \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\varrho}}\) correctly identifies the name of \(\mathcal{C}\) in \(\mathcal{D}_{test}^{f}\). The prompts we utilize include either masking \(\mathcal{C}\)'s name or eliciting a binary yes/no response regarding the presence of \(\mathcal{C}\). (ii) GPT-4 Evaluation (G-Eval). The second measurement involves the use of GPT-4 to evaluate the \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\varrho}}\)'s responses. GPT-4 evaluates whether a response indicates that \(\mathcal{C}\)'s visual recognition has been forgotten. The instructions for G-Eval are shown in Figure 8. (iii) \(\mathcal{C}\) Probability Distance (\(\mathcal{C}\)-Dis). To further quantitatively measure the effectiveness of unlearning, we introduce a metric that examines the distance between the probability distributions of the model outputting the name of \(\mathcal{C}\) before and after the unlearning process, which can be formulated as follows:

\[Distance=\mathbb{E}_{(\mathcal{I}_{i},\mathcal{I}_{i})\in\mathcal{D}_{test}^{f }}\Big{[}-P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(\mathcal{C}|\mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i}, \dots,w_{t-1}^{i})\log\frac{P_{\mathcal{M}_{\theta}}(\mathcal{C}|\mathcal{I}_ {i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})}{P_{\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\varrho}}}(\mathcal{C}| \mathcal{I}_{i},w_{1}^{i},\dots,w_{t-1}^{i})}\Big{]}.\] (10)

## Appendix D Additional Results

### The Correlation between Utility and the Characteristics of MLLMs' Output

We suppose the key to our method achieving the best utility (Specificity, Fluency and Diversity) is that we follow the characteristics of MLLMs' output. As stated in Section 4.1 and Appendix A.1, MLLMs tend not to respond _'I do not know.'_ when queried about unseen concepts. The characteristics likely stems from the instruction tuning phase, where the training data will hardly give a answer of _'I do not know.'_

Preference Optimization (PO) method, which prompts the model to respond with "I don't know," appears to contravene this ingrained output characteristics. As shown in Figure 11, even though

Figure 8: Instructions for G-Eval.

fine-tuning data of PO solely contains _'I do not know.'_ and its variants, MLLMs would respond confidentially when queried about Donald Trump's appearance in plain text mode. This response does not reflect actual forgetting of the Trump's appearance and it seems to sign a confidentiality agreement with MLLMs. Moreover, as shown in Table 1, though the EM score of PO is relatively high, low \(\mathcal{C}\)-Dis of 0.4 illustrates that PO still tends to output a high probability of tokens related to \(\mathcal{C}\). **This low distance indicates that it may only learn this question-and-answer form rather than forget \(\mathcal{C}\).**

The GA and GA+KL methods frequently exhibit outputs where a single character is repeated excessively, highlighting a downside of the GA method. Ga method is more arbitrary in the optimization direction of next token prediction, which diverges from MLLMs' typical output characteristics. The breaking of output characteristics makes the model lose utility after unlearning.

SIU adheres closely to the MLLMs' output characteristics while effectively unlearning specific concepts. The high performance of each evaluation metric shown in Table 1 illustrates a balanced strategy that forgets targeted unlearning concepts without undermining its inherent capabilities.

### Membership Inference Attack

Min-K% PROB utilizes the minimum token probabilities within a text for detection purposes. We first gather a set of queries and about the visual recognition of \(\mathcal{C}\). To find the suspicious queries,

Table 6: The performance of other concepts. The model we use is LLAVA\({}_{7\text{B}}\)we compare the Min-K% PROB between \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\). If the ratio of scores falls in the range of \(\big{(}\frac{1}{1.15},1.15\big{)}\), we regard the query as a suspicious query. We use \(\mathcal{M}_{\hat{\theta}}\) and \(\mathcal{M}_{\theta}\) to generate answers by inputting suspicious queries. Rouge-L is utilized to calculate the similarity between the generated answers.

### Multilingual Jailbreak

We translate the questions in Generality into Spanish, French, Chinese, German, Japanese and Russian for multilingual jailbreak to check whether the targeted unlearning concepts are truly forgotten. We use G-Eval to evaluate the multilingual test. As shown in Figure 12, Figure 13 and Figure 14, we display the examples in all languages. The original questions are 'Who is the blonde in this photo?',

Figure 10: The butterfly effects of SIU (2).

Figure 9: The butterfly effects of SIU (1).

*Is this a photo that includes Donald Trump?' and 'Who often wears a suit and tie in this photo?' respectively for the three figures. We find GA+KL is more vulnerable to the multilingual jailbreak attack. For instance, in Figure 13 and Figure 14, GA+KL both generates the name of Donald Trump in Chinese. It could be observed that SIU may make up some lies as shown in Figure 14. Rather than 'Jacob Campbell', SIU outputs some other names in different languages. This observation verifies the robustness of SIU under multilingual jailbreak.

### Multi-hop Jailbreak

Multi-hop question Jailbreak is a kind of secluded attack and provides hard examples. We ask about the factual knowledge of \(\mathcal{C}\) rather than directly query the specific name. The questions for this experiment are generated using GPT-4. For the evaluation we use the accuracy of responding the right answer of the question. Figure 15 shows examples of multi-hop jailbreak. It could be seen that PO answers each question with 'I do not know...' As stated in Appendix D.1, PO may only learn the question-and-answer form rather than forgetting.

## Appendix E Limitations

The main limitation of our work is the diversity of MLLMs. The reason we only train LLAVA is stated in Section 6.1. As the construction of MMUBench is aided by LLAVA including the filtering step, we want to accurately compare the model response before and after unlearning. Thus we train LLAVA rather than other MLLMs to conduct the experiments. However, we employ various sizes of LLAVA in the experiment section to illustrate the impact of model size.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The contributions and the scope of this paper are accurately reflected in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: See Section 3 and Appendix A.2.  Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We claim the details of methods and the experiments settings in our paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the code and data in our supplemental material. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings are detailed in Section 6.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 6.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 6.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix A.1. The use of private images has been given explicit consent. These images will not be included in supplementary material to prevent the exposure of personally identifiable information. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix C.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Appendix C.1. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
