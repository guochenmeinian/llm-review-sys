###### Abstract

Multi-object 3D Grounding involves locating 3D boxes based on a given query phrase from a point cloud. It is a challenging and significant task with numerous applications in visual understanding, human-computer interaction, and robotics. To tackle this challenge, we introduce D-LISA, a two-stage approach incorporating three innovations. First, a dynamic vision module that enables a variable and learnable number of box proposals. Second, a dynamic camera positioning that extracts features for each proposal. Third, a language-informed spatial attention module that better reasons over the proposals to output the final prediction. Empirically, experiments show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on multi-object 3D grounding by 12.8% (absolute) and is competitive in single-object 3D grounding.1

## 1 Introduction

Building agents that can operate in real-world environments with humans has been a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence. Importantly, the agent would need to understand the 3D scene and natural language to take instructions from humans. To benchmark these capabilities, there is an increasing amount of interest in the task of object grounding in 3D [2, 4, 8, 17, 21, 23, 39, 40, 46, 50]. Recently, the task of multi-object 3D grounding [52] has been proposed, _i.e_., given a text description and a 3D scene localize _all_ objects referred by the description.

Along with the benchmark, Zhang et al. [52] proposes, M3DRef-CLIP, a two-stage approach that first detects all the potential objects (capped at a maximum number) from the 3D scene, and then reasons about which of the objects are relevant to the text description by extracting features for each of the objects. Specifically, they leverage both 3D features from the point cloud, and 2D features extracted from renderings of the detected objects at fixed camera poses. These object features along with the text embedding are passed into a Transformer to make the final prediction. Model training is formulated as multi-output classification, where each potential object is classified based on whether it is referred to by the text.

In this work, we identify several directions in which M3DRef-CLIP could be improved. First, the generation of object proposals is based on a _fixed_ maximum. Prior work [30] points out the dilemma of deciding the number of boxes in the 3D grounding task under the two-stage detection-and-selection diagram. Excessive proposals may increase complexity and lead to redundant computations while sparse proposals may miss critical information in the scene. Second, the camera poses of the renderer are _fixed_ to hand-selected viewpoints, which seems unlikely to be ideal given the variability in object sizes. Third, the fusion module does not effectively reason over the spatial relationship of the objects based on the text description.

To address these shortcomings, we propose D-LISA, a two-stage approach that incorporates three innovative modules. First, instead of using all detected objects, we use a dynamic proposal module to select the key box proposals. Second, we incorporate a dynamic multi-view renderer module that optimizes the viewing angles tailored to a specific scene. Third, we introduce a language-informed spatial fusion module that uses textual description to guide reasoning based on spatial relations.

To evaluate our proposed method, we conduct experiments on the Multi3DRefer benchmark for multi-object 3D grounding and achieve a substantial 12.8% absolute increase over the existing baseline M3DRef-CLIP. We also validate the effectiveness of our method by achieving the state-of-the-art performance on ScanRefer benchmark [8] and competitive results on Nr3D benchmark [2] for single-object 3D grounding. **Our contributions are summarized as follows:**

* We introduce a dynamic box proposal module that automatically determines the key box proposals for the later reasoning stage, which could potentially replace the fixed object proposals prevalent in existing two-stage grounding pipelines. Also, we learn the camera pose for 2D rendering dynamically based on the scene, enhancing the quality of auxiliary object features in uncertain environments.
* We propose a language-informed spatial fusion module that dynamically captures the spatial relations among objects, significantly improving the model's contextual understanding and performance in the multi-object 3D grounding task.
* We conduct thorough experiments to validate the proposed framework. The proposed approach not only significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multi-object 3D grounding, but also maintains robust performance in the single-object 3D grounding task.

## 2 Related Work

**2D grounding** aims to identify the target object in a 2D image based on a natural language description. The conventional detection-and-selection two-stage pipeline first extracts the visual features for the proposals and language features for the description then employs the attention mechanism to effectively align the visual features and language features [15; 27; 42; 48; 55]. Alternatively, one-stage methods directly regress the target boxes by integrating object detection and language understanding [28; 33; 44; 45]. While relational graphs have been used to explicitly model the object relations in 2D images [29; 37; 43], extending the modeling to 3D is challenging due to larger number of objects and more complex spatial relations.

**3D grounding.** Similar to 2D grounding, 3D grounding aims to target the language-referred object in a 3D scene. There have been a variety of datasets [1; 2; 8] and approaches [50; 17; 39; 40; 5] to tackle this challenging problem. M3DRef-CLIP [52] is the pioneered work to explore targeting multiple objects that match the language description. Other than the one-stage methods that directly identify the target box [30; 38], two-stage methods like M3DRef-CLIP following the detection-and-selection diagram are facing the issue of determining the number of boxes from the detection stage. We propose a module that dynamically selects the key box proposals from object candidates.

2D features have been widely used to assist with 3D grounding [4; 17; 21; 46; 23] as well as other 3D tasks [3; 31; 36; 47; 51]. However, most studies rely on fixed camera poses to generate these 2D image features, which is sub-optimal given the varying object sizes across different 3D scenes. In contrast, we propose to learn scene-conditioned camera poses for object rendering.

Many works have studied how to model the object relations in complex 3D scenes [7; 16; 18; 19; 20; 34; 49; 53]. For example, 3DVG-Trans [53] and M3DRef-CLIP [52] model the spatial relations based on distances. ViL3DRef [9] and CORE-3DVG [41] incorporate language and hand-selected features to guide the spatial relations. Differently, we propose a simple yet effective language-informed balancing strategy to explicitly reason over the spatial relation that solely depends on distances.

## 3 Approach

Given a 3D point cloud of a scene \(\mathcal{S}\), and a text description \(\mathcal{T}\), the task of multi-object 3D grounding aims to predict the set of bounding boxes \(\mathcal{P}\) for objects that are referred to in the text description. Our proposed Multi-Object 3D Grounding with **D**ynamic Modules and **L**anguage **I**nformed **S**patialAttention (**D-LISA**) follows the detection-and-selection paradigm for multi-object 3D grounding task [52]. This paradigm involves three components: (i) a text encoder to extract text features; (ii) a vision module to detect object proposals and extract corresponding features given a point cloud; (iii) a fusion module that combines the text and object features to select the final referred bounding-boxes. Specifically, our D-LISA is designed with a novel vision module that allows for a dynamic number of proposal boxes and extracts features from dynamic viewpoints (Sec. 3.1) per scene. Furthermore, we propose a fusion model that is spatially aware with explicit language conditioning (Sec. 3.2). An overview of our approach is illustrated in Fig. 1.

### Dynamic Vision Module

Our dynamic vision module takes a 3D scene point cloud \(\mathcal{S}\) as the input and generates a set of box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\) with corresponding visual features \(\mathcal{F}\). As in prior work [52], we adopt the backbone detector of PointGroup [25] to obtain a fixed number of \(M\) box candidates \(\mathcal{C}\), _i.e._, \(|\mathcal{C}|=M\). To eliminate irrelevant detected objects, we employ a dynamic box proposal module with non-maximum suppression (NMS). This module dynamically selects a subset with variable sizes, from the \(M\) candidates, to form the set of box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\), which are then used by the fusion model.

**Dynamic box proposal.** To achieve box proposals with a flexible number, we learn a dynamic proposal probability \(\alpha_{m}\) for each of the \(M\) box candidates.

We model the proposal probability \(\alpha_{m}\) as a normalized linear function of the detector score \(s_{m}\), _i.e._,

\[\alpha_{m}=\mathrm{Sigmoid}(\mathrm{Linear}(s_{m})).\] (1)

At prediction time, an object candidate would be selected if the dynamic proposal probability exceeds the filtering threshold \(\tau_{f}\):

\[\mathcal{B}^{\prime}=\{b_{m}\in\mathcal{C}\mid\alpha_{m}>\tau_{f}\},\] (2)

where \(b_{m}\) denotes the 3D box of the \(m^{\text{th}}\) object.

We then use non-maximum suppression (NMS) [14] to remove overlapping boxes from the box proposal candidates \(\mathcal{B}^{\prime}\) and finalize the box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\). First, the proposal probabilities \(\alpha_{i}\) are sorted in descending order. Then we sequentially select the candidate with the highest probability as a box proposal and remove other box proposal candidates that have an Intersection over Union (IoU) greater than a threshold \(\tau_{\text{NMS}}\). The NMS module ensures the box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\) do not include duplicated boxes for the same object.

Figure 1: **Illustration of the overall pipeline. Our D-LISA processes the 3D point cloud through the dynamic visual module (Sec. 3.1) and encodes the text description through a text encoder. The visual and word features are fused through a language informed spatial fusion module (Sec. 3.2).**

Dynamic Proposal loss.To train this proposal probability, we incorporated a regularization term penalizing the expected value of the number of boxes

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}}=\sum_{m=1}^{M}\alpha_{m}.\] (3)

This loss encourages the model to use as few box proposals as possible while maintaining the grounding performance.

Object proposal feature extraction.Given the \(N\) box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\), _i.e._, \(|\mathcal{B}|=N\), we extract visual features \(\mathcal{F}\) that is a concatenation of both the 3D features \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{3D}}\) from the detector and 2D features \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{2D}}\) from our dynamic multi-view renderer.

3D feature from detector backbone.Each box \(b_{n}\) in the box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\) has a corresponding 3D feature \(\bm{f}_{i}^{\text{3D}}\) that can be extracted from the detector backbone. Next, to ensure that the proposal probability \(\alpha_{m}\) reflect the quality of the box \(b_{m}\), we weight the 3D features with the probability, _i.e._,

\[\mathcal{F}^{\text{3D}}=\{\alpha_{1}\cdot\bm{f}_{1}^{\text{3D}},\alpha_{2} \cdot\bm{f}_{2}^{\text{3D}},\ldots,\alpha_{N}\cdot\bm{f}_{N}^{\text{3D}}\}.\] (4)

2D feature from Dynamic multi-view renderer.The dynamic multi-view renderer takes as input the box proposals \(\mathcal{B}\) and generates the corresponding 2D features \(\mathcal{F}^{\text{2D}}\). Instead of using fixed camera poses for rendering all objects across different scenes, we learn scene-conditioned camera poses for rendering. We predefined \(V\) base camera poses \(\bm{d}_{j}^{\text{cam}}\) for \(j=1,2,\ldots,V\). Next, we calculate the average size of all boxes denoted as \(\bar{\bm{q}}\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\) with the average length, width, and height respectively. We use a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to learn the camera pose offset for each view \(j\) based on the average box size \(\bar{\bm{q}}\):

\[\Delta\bm{p}_{j}^{\text{cam}}=\operatorname{MLP}_{j}(\bar{\bm{q}}).\] (5)

The final camera pose for each view \(j\) is

\[\bm{p}_{j}^{\text{cam}}=\bm{d}_{j}^{\text{cam}}+\Delta\bm{p}_{j}^{\text{cam}}.\] (6)

For each view \(j\), the renderer generates the 2D image for each box proposal \(b_{i}\) with camera pose \(\bm{p}_{j}^{cam}\). The pre-trained CLIP image encoder extracts the 2D features for each view. Finally, we compute the average over all the extracted features from each view to obtain the 2D features

\[\mathcal{F}^{\text{2D}}=\left\{\frac{1}{V}\sum_{j=1}^{V}\operatorname{CLIP}( \operatorname{Render}(b_{n},\bm{p}_{j}^{\text{cam}}))\;\middle|\;b_{n}\in \mathcal{B}\right\}.\] (7)

### Language-Informed Spatial Fusion Module

Given the visual features \(\mathcal{F}\) from the dynamic vision module and the word features \(\mathcal{W}\) from CLIP's text encoder, the language-informed spatial fusion module predicts a probability \(p_{n}\) on whether the object in box \(b_{n}\) is targeted in the text description. The module consists of a stack of transformer layers followed by an MLP grounding head.

To better capture the spatial relationship among objects, we introduce the language-informed spatial attention (LISA) block that balances the visual attention weights and the spatial relations using the sentence feature \(\bm{g}\), a weighted sum over all word features. Each transformer layer comprises a language-informed spatial attention block and a cross-attention block, as illustrated in Fig. 1. Finally, we only predicted a box if the associated probability \(p_{n}\) exceeds a threshold \(\tau_{\text{pred}}\), _i.e._, the predicted box set is

\[\mathcal{P}=\{b_{n}\;|\;p_{n}>\tau_{\text{pred}}\}.\] (8)

We now discuss the details of LISA. The details of the cross-attention block are provided in Appendix Sec. A4.

Language informed spatial attention (LISA).Given the visual feature matrix \(\bm{F}=[\bm{f}_{1},\bm{f}_{2},\ldots,\bm{f}_{N}]^{T}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times d_{ o}}\) where \(\bm{f}_{n}\in\mathcal{F}\) and the sentence feature \(\bm{g}\), language-informed spatial attention block (Fig. 2) updates the visual features with spatial information by balancing the visual attention weights and spatial relations guided by language.

LISA follows the standard self-attention mechanism proposed by Vaswani et al. [35] consisting of queries, keys, and values. Given \(\bm{F}\), the queries \(\bm{Q}\), keys \(\bm{K}\) and values \(\bm{V}\) are computed as follows:

\[\bm{Q}=\bm{F}\bm{W}_{Q},\quad\bm{K}=\bm{F}\bm{W}_{K},\quad\bm{V}=\bm{F}\bm{W}_{V}\] (9)

with linear projections \(\bm{W}_{Q/V/K}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{o}\times d}\).

To explicitly build in spatial reasoning, we introduce spatial scores \(\bm{B}\), conditioned on the sentence feature and visual features, to weight between the standard attention terms and a spatial distance matrix \(\bm{D}\). The overall language-informed spatial attention is as follows:

\[\mathrm{LISA}(\bm{F},\bm{g},\bm{D})=\mathrm{softmax}\left((\bm{1}_{N}-\bm{B}) \odot\frac{\bm{Q}\bm{K}^{T}}{\sqrt{d}}+\bm{B}\odot\bm{D}\right)\bm{V},\] (10)

where \(\bm{1}_{N}\) is an all-ones matrix and \(\mathrm{softmax}\) normalizes along each row. We now describe \(\bm{B}\) and \(\bm{D}\).

_Spatial scores \(\bm{B}\)_. Given a variety of objects in a complex scene, we want the model to dynamically learn whether an object should pay more attention to the spatial relationship based on text description. For the \(i^{\text{th}}\) object in the box proposal, we predict the normalized score \(\beta_{i}\) by concatenating the visual feature \(\bm{f}_{i}\) and the sentence feature \(\bm{g}\), followed by a linear projection. To align with the attention weights, we construct the spatial scores \(\bm{B}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\) as

\[\bm{B}=\begin{bmatrix}\beta_{1}&\beta_{1}&\cdots&\beta_{1}\\ \beta_{2}&\beta_{2}&\cdots&\beta_{2}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \beta_{N}&\beta_{N}&\cdots&\beta_{N}\end{bmatrix},\quad\text{where }\beta_{i}= \mathrm{Sigmoid}(\mathrm{Linear}(\bm{g}\oplus\bm{f}_{i}))\] (11)

and \(\oplus\) denotes a concatenation.

_Spatial distance matrix \(\bm{D}\)_. We model the spatial relationship among objects through relative distances. We construct this matrix \(\bm{D}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times N}\) by computing the pairwise \(l_{2}\)-distance between the box centers \(c_{i}\) and \(c_{j}\), _i.e_., \(d_{ij}=||c_{i}-c_{j}||_{2}\). To ensure that closer objects should receive greater attention, we define \(\bm{\bar{D}}_{ij}=\frac{1}{d_{ij}}\).

### Training details

In addition to the dynamic proposal loss for our dynamic box proposal module, we follow the loss functions of the prior work [52] for end-to-end training. These include detection loss, reference loss, and contrastive loss. We briefly discuss these losses for completeness.

Figure 2: **Illustration of language informed spatial attention (LISA).** We model the object relations through spatial distance \(\bm{D}\). For each box proposal, a spatial score is predicted to balance the visual attention weights and spatial relations.

Detection loss.We use Pointgroup [25] as our detector backbone and adopt their training losses. The detection loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{det}}\) consists of four components: a) a semantic segmentation loss, b) an offset regression loss, c) an offset direction loss, and d) a proposal score loss.

Reference loss.For multi-object 3D grounding, we adopt the binary cross-entropy loss over the detected objects as the reference loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{ref}}\). We apply the Hungarian algorithm [26] to find an optimal match based on the pairwise IoU between the detected objects and ground truth. A detected box is successfully grounded if it matches one ground truth box in the Hungarian solution and the pairwise IoU is greater than a threshold \(\tau_{\text{train}}\). For single-object 3D grounding, we use the cross-entropy loss. We identify the highest IoU between the detected boxes and the ground truth box and consider it a success if this maximal IoU is greater than the threshold \(\tau_{\text{train}}\).

Contrastive loss.We apply a symmetric contrastive loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{ctr}}\) between the object features and the word features. A positive pair is formed if the object features and the word features come from the same scene-instruction pair, while a negative pair is formed if they come from different scene-instruction pairs. For computing efficiency, we only identify the positive and negative pairs within a single batch. This loss has been proven effective for learning better multi-modal embeddings [52].

The total loss function is a weighted sum over all loss terms

\[\mathcal{L}=\lambda_{\text{det}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{det}}+\lambda_{\text{ref}} \mathcal{L}_{\text{ref}}+\lambda_{\text{ctr}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{ctr}}+\lambda _{\text{dyn}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{dyn}},\] (12)

where \(\lambda_{i}\) is the individual loss weight for each loss term \(\mathcal{L}_{i}\).

## 4 Experiments

We conduct experiments on the Multi3DRefer [52] dataset. We also compare our model with other two-stage methods on single-object grounding using the ScanRefer [8] and the Nr3D [2] datasets. Finally, we ablate the effectiveness of each proposed module.

### Multi-object 3D grounding

**Dataset and evaluation metric.** Multi3DRefer is a dataset based on ScanRefer [8]. It contains 61,926 descriptions of 11,609 objects, with each text description potentially referencing zero, single, or multiple target objects.

Using the standard evaluation protocol [52], we report the F1 score at the intersection over union (IoU) threshold of 0.5 over five different categories: a) zero target without distractors of the same semantic class (ZT w/o D); b) zero target with distractors (ZT w/D); c) single target without distractors (ST w/o D); d) single target with distractors (ST w/D); and e) multiple targets (MT). The average over these categories is reported as an overall score.

**Baselines.** Following prior work [52], we consider two-stage methods that perform well on the ScanRefer dataset as baselines; including, 3DVG-Trans [53], D3Net [9], 3DJCG [6] and M3DRef-CLIP [52]. We also report the performance of M3DRef-CLIP with NMS after the first-stage detector for a fair comparison.

**Implementation details.** We train our model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. We set the batch size to 4 with the AdamW optimizer using a learning rate of \(5e^{-4}\). We follow the same train/val set split as the baselines [52]. For the PointGroup detector, we use the same pre-trained PointGroup

\begin{table}

module following Zhang et al. [52] with the same loss coefficients. We set the dynamic proposal loss coefficient \(\alpha_{dyn}\) to 5. We set the \(\tau_{\text{train}}\) to 0.25 and search for the optimal value of \(\tau_{\text{ped}}\) over {0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25} during evaluation for M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS and our model.

**Results.** We compare the F1@0.5 metric of our model and state-of-the-art baselines on Multi3DRefer val set in Tab. 1. Our D-LISA achieves a 12.8% absolute increase in the overall F1@0.5 score over M3DRef-CLIP. Comparing M3DRef-CLIP and M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS, we observe that NMS is a key factor in the final F1 score, successfully removing duplicate predictions leading to improved recall.

Next, D-LISA achieves a better overall F1 score, especially for multiple targets and sub-categories where the distractors of the same semantic class exist. We further provide qualitative results over our method and the baselines in Fig. 3. The top two rows are examples from multiple target categories. Our D-LISA successfully identifies more objects that match the text description. The last row shows an example of a single target with distractors. Our D-LISA accurately identifies the object while the baselines are affected by the distractors and predict additional incorrect targets.

### Single-object 3D grounding.

**Dataset and evaluation metric.** We evaluate the single-object 3D grounding performance on the ScanRefer and the Nr3D datasets. The ScanRefer dataset contains 51,583 human-written sentences for 800 scenes in ScanNet [13]. ScanRefer divides scenes into "Unique" and "Multiple" subsets based on whether the semantic class of the target object is unique in the scene.

The Nr3D dataset consists of 41,503 human-annotated text descriptions across 707 indoor scenes from ScanNet. Nr3D divides scenes into "Easy" and "Hard" subsets based on whether there exist the distractors of the same semantic class, and into "View-dependent" and "View-independent" subsets based on whether a specific viewpoint is required to identify the target. Both ScanRefer and Nr3D are annotated for single-object grounding. Different from ScanRefer, Nr3D _assumes perfect object proposals_ are provided.

Following prior work [52], for the ScanRefer dataset we report Acc@0.5 on both val and test sets over different subsets. The number represents the proportion of predicted target boxes that have an IoU value greater than 0.5 compared to the ground truth box. For the Nr3D dataset, we report the accuracy of selecting the target bounding box among all candidate proposals on the test set over different subsets.

Figure 3: **Qualitative examples of Multi3DRefer val set. For each scene-text pair, we visualize the predictions of M3DRef-CLIP, M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS, D-LISA and ground truth labels in magenta/blue/green/red separately.**

**Baselines.** We focus on comparing the two-stage methods designed for the situation where the ground truth box proposals are not provided. For the ScanRefer dataset, we compare with the baselines: TGNN [20], FFL-3DOG [16], InstanceRefer [49], 3DVG-Trans [53], 3DJCG [6], D3Net [9], UniT3D [12], HAM [10], CORE-3DVG [41] and M3DRef-CLIP [52]. For joint captioning and grounding models 3DJCG, D3Net, and UniT3D, we compare their best grounding performance with extra captioning training data. For the Nr3D dataset, we compare with the above baselines which reported the performance in their paper.

**Implementation details.** We follow the multi-object setting to adapt to the single-object setting. Differently, we let the fusion module return the _most likely_ box among all the proposal boxes instead of using a threshold. For the Nr3D dataset, we follow the prior work [52] to directly crop the box features from the detector backbone based on the ground truth bounding boxes. We follow the same train/val/test set split for both datasets as the baselines.

**Results.** We report the Acc@0.5 of different methods on the ScanRefer val set and test set in Tab. 2. Comparing M3DRef-CLIP and M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS, we could see that non-maximum suppression slightly improves the performance. Our D-LISA outperforms all existing baselines on both the ScanRefer val set and test set, especially for the subsets where there are multiple objects with the semantic class of the target object in the scene.

Next, we report the grounding accuracy of different methods on the Nr3D test set in Tab. 3. Our D-LISA outperforms all baselines on the Nr3D test set over all subsets. For more comparison with other methods on the ScanRefer and the Nr3D datasets, see Sec. A2 in the Appendix.

_Limitations:_ As with other two-stage methods, the grounding performance of our designed two-stage model is upper bounded by the detector quality. From Tab. 1 and Tab. 2, we can see that our model achieves better performance for complex scenarios but sacrifice some performance for the simpler single-object settings.

### Ablation studies

We conduct ablation studies on the proposed modules to validate their effectiveness under the multi-object grounding setting on the M3DRef dataset. The ablations follow the same experiment settings for the multi-object grounding in Sec. 4.1. The baseline Row #1 shows the result of M3DRef-CLIP w/NMS.

**Dynamic box proposal.** In Tab. 4, comparing Row #3 with baseline Row #1, we validate the effectiveness of the dynamic box proposal module. We also validate the number of box candidates in the reasoning stage after using the dynamic box proposal module. For our complete model Row #5, an average of 30.5 boxes are selected for the fusion stage on the M3DRefer val set. This is a much smaller number of boxes compared to the 62.4 boxes used in baseline Row #1.

**Dynamic multi-view renderer.** In Tab. 4, comparing Row #2 with baseline Row #1, we validate the effectiveness of the dynamic multi-view renderer module. We provide the qualitative results for the dynamic multi-view renderer in Fig. 4. Instead of using fixed camera poses, the dynamic renderer adapts different camera poses from scene to scene, enhancing the quality of 2D object features.

**Language informed spatial fusion.** In Tab. 4, comparing Row #4 with baseline Row #1, we validate the effectiveness of the language-informed spatial fusion module, especially for the sub-categories where distractors exist (ZT w/D and ST w/D). For more ablation results on the language-informed spatial fusion module, please refer to Appendix Sec. A3.

**Computational cost.** We report the FLOPs and inference time of each proposed module and a comparison with the baseline model M3DRef-CLIP in Tab. 5. All experiments are conducted on Multi3DRefer validation set on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU. The reported FLOPs and inference time are the average over the validation set. We observe that the dynamic box proposal module

Figure 4: **Qualitative results of dynamic multi-view renderer. On the left, we show the learned pose distribution over the Multi3DRefer val set and visualize one camera ray example. On the right, we present examples of comparison between rendering with fixed pose and dynamic learned pose.**and the dynamic multi-view renderer in the dynamic vision module contribute marginally to the computation. The additional computations in the language-informed spatial fusion module are also minimal. In other words, our model achieves better grounding performance without significantly increasing computations.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present D-LISA, a two-stage pipeline for multi-object 3D grounding, featuring three novel components. Our dynamic box proposal module dynamically selects the key box proposals from detected objects. We enhance the 2D features through optimized scene-conditioned rendering poses using a dynamic multi-view renderer. Furthermore, our language-informed spatial fusion module facilitates explicit reasoning over the object spatial relations. Our proposed approach not only outperforms the state-of-the-art model in multi-object 3D grounding but also is competitive in single-object 3D grounding.

## Appendix

The appendix is organized as follows:

* In Sec. A1, we provide additional results on the Multi3DRefer dataset for multi-object grounding.
* In Sec. A2, we provide additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets for single-object grounding.
* In Sec. A3, we provide additional comparisons and ablation results for our proposed LISA block.
* In Sec. A4, we provide additional details for D-LISA.
* In Sec. A5, we provide additional qualitative results.

## Appendix A1 Additional multi-object grounding results

**F1@0.25 evaluation on Multi3DRefer validation set.** We provide additional comparisons with M3DRef-CLIP over F1@0.25 in Tab. A1. We observe that our D-LISA achieves a better overall F1@0.25 score, especially for multiple targets and sub-categories where the distractors of the same semantic class exist. This aligns with our observation for F1@0.5 results in Tab. 4.

**Additional ablation results on question types.** Additional ablations for different query types, including queries with spatial, color, texture, and shape information are reported in Tab. A2. We observe that each proposed module effectively improves the performance for the queries that contain spatial, color, and shape information, and is competitive with the baseline for queries with texture information. The overall model achieves better grounding performance across all query types than the baseline.

**Additional ablation results on the filtering threshold \(\tau_{f}\).** To determine the optimal filtering threshold \(\tau_{f}\) in Eq. (2), we conduct experiments with different filtering threshold on Multi3DRefer dataset. The result is shown in Tab. A3. We observe that using 0.5 results in the best performance.

**Additional comparison on the NMS module.** We show the additional comparison between our proposed D-LISA and D-LISA without NMS on Multi3DRefer in Tab. A4. We observe that ourdesigned D-LISA outperforms the baseline M3DRef-CLIP both with and without the NMS module. Using the NMS module would lead to a higher F1 score compared to not using it.

## Appendix A2 Additional single-object grounding comparisons

We provide additional comparisons with state-of-the-art methods on ScanRefer and Nr3D datasets for single-object grounding. These methods do not follow the detection-and-selection two-stage diagram. Different from ScanRefer, Nr3D assumes _perfect object proposals are provided_. We focus on the grounding performance on the ScanRefer dataset as the task setting is more realistic. We report the grounding performance on both ScanRefer and Nr3D for completeness.

**ScanRefer dataset.** We provide additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on the ScanRefer dataset in Tab. A5. For the methods using object proposals as input instead of the 3D scene, typically a separate pre-trained detector is used to pre-process the scene [11, 21, 39, 46, 54]. Our D-LISA outperforms all existing methods and achieves the best grounding accuracy on both the validation set and test set, which further validates the effectiveness of our proposed modules.

**Nr3D dataset.** We provide additional comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods on the Nr3D dataset in Tab. A6. Our D-LISA still achieves comparable results.

## Appendix A3 Additional results for LISA

We provide more experimental results on our designed language informed spatial attention (LISA) module. We show the ablation results on the design choice and compare our module with other language-guided attention modules.

**Design choice.** We analyze the factors that affect the spatial score \(\beta\) and report the F1@0.5 metric on Multi3DRefer dataset in Tab. A7. The result shows using both the sentence feature and object feature to predict the spatial score \(\beta\) yields the best grounding performance.

**Additional comparison.** We compare our designed LISA with the spatial self-attention in ViL3DRef [11], which also models the object relations guided by language. ViL3DRef pre-defines object relations through hand-crafted features. These hand-selected features work with ground truth object proposals but lead to worse performance when the object proposals are predicted, i.e. noisy. As is shown in Tab. A5 and Tab. A6, though ViL3DRel works well on the Nr3D benchmark which provides ground truth box proposals, the performance is much worse when validating on the ScanRefer benchmark where no ground truth proposals are provided.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

### Additional qualitative results

We provide additional qualitative comparisons for MT category (Fig. A1) and ST w/D category (Fig. A2). For MT category examples, our D-LISA successfully identifies all objects that match the text description. For ST w/D category examples, our D-LISA accurately identifies the object without being distracted by the distractors.

## Appendix A

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Sec. 3 and Sec. 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Sec. 4.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations. 3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical result. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see Sec. 4 and Sec. A4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: The code is available at https://github.com/haomengz/D-LISA. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Sec. 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: The evaluation setting for the experiments in this paper does not involve reporting error bars, confidence intervals or other statistical significance tests. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report the training resource in Sec. 4.1 and Sec. 4.3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: No violation of the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: The scope of this work is an recognition task in computer vision. There are no obvious and direct societal impacts. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Sec. 4 and Sec. A4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We open-source the code and model at https://github.com/haomengz/D-LISA. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA]. Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
