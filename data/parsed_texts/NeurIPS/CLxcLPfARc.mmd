###### Abstract

Current research in adversarial robustness of LLMs focuses on _discrete_ input manipulations in the natural language space, which can be directly transferred to _closed-source_ models. However, this approach neglects the steady progression of _open-source_ models. As open-source models advance in capability, ensuring their safety becomes increasingly imperative. Yet, attacks tailored to open-source LLMs that exploit full model access remain largely unexplored. We address this research gap and propose the _embedding space attack_, which directly attacks the _continuous_ embedding representation of input tokens. We find that embedding space attacks circumvent model alignments and trigger harmful behaviors more efficiently than discrete attacks or model fine-tuning. Additionally, we demonstrate that models compromised by embedding attacks can be used to create discrete jailbreaks in natural language. Lastly, we present a novel threat model in the context of unlearning and data extraction and show that embedding space attacks can extract supposedly deleted information from unlearned models, and to a certain extent, even recover pretraining data in LLMs. Our findings highlight embedding space attacks as an important threat model in open-source LLMs.

## 1 Introduction

With LLM-integrated applications getting increasingly prevalent, various methods have been proposed to enhance the safety of LLMs after deployment [1, 2]. Despite these efforts, LLMs have remained vulnerable to exploitation by malicious actors [3, 4]. The majority of investigated threat models in the literature, such as prompt injection [4] or jailbreaking [5], operate on the discrete token level [5, 6].

This choice is influenced by the accessibility of LLM-integrated applications, such as ChatGPT [7], which are mostly available through APIs limited to natural language input.

However, various malicious activities can be executed using open-source LLMs on consumer hardware and do not require interaction with APIs (e.g., distributing dangerous information, promoting biases, or influencing elections). In the case of open-source models, an adversary has complete access to the weights and activations. As a result, the adversary is not limited to discrete manipulation of natural language tokens but can directly attack their continuous embedding space representation [8]. Meanwhile, the capability of open-source models is increasing rapidly, with the performance gap between the best open-source model and the best closed-sourced model considerably decreasing in the last year. As of May 4th, the publicly available Llama-3-70b-Instruct model is the 6th best model on the LMSYS Chatbot Arena Leaderboard [9], a popular benchmark for comparing the capability between LLMs. We want to emphasize the following:

_As open-source models close the gap to proprietary models and advance in their capabilities, so does their potential for malicious use, such as influencing elections, sophisticated phishing attempts, impersonation, and other risks [10]._

Thus, it is crucial to investigate possible threats in open-source models and precisely quantify their robustness to understand and manage risks post-deployment.

Furthermore, with regulations like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) setting standards for data privacy, there is a critical need for reliable tools to explore and ensure privacy in machine learning. This includes scenarios where user data is used to train models and presumably removed with unlearning. However, as previously outlined threat models tailored to open-source models are currently under-explored. In this paper, we demonstrate the threat of continuous _embedding space attacks_ (see Fig 1). on two important security problems. We first investigate their ability to induce harmful behavior in open-source models with low computational cost. Our experiments raise the question of whether it is possible to protect open-source LLMs from malicious use with current methods, as the robustness of neural networks against adversarial attacks in the vision domain has remained an open question for more than a decade. Secondly, we study the ability of embedding space attacks to reveal seemingly deleted information in unlearned LLMs, highlighting a new use case of adversarial attacks as a rigorous interrogation tool for unlearned models. Lastly, we show in a preliminary experiment, how embedding space attacks can be used to extract pretraining data from a model. Our contributions are as follows:

1. We show that embedding attacks effectively remove safety alignment in LLMs on four different open-source models, achieving successful attacks orders of magnitude faster than prior work.
2. We find that compared to fine-tuning an LLM to remove its safety alignment, embedding space attacks prove to be computationally less expensive while achieving higher success rates.
3. Additionally, we show that embedding space-attacked models can be used to generate discrete jailbreaks in natural language that successfully remove the safety guardrails of aligned models. This indicates the potential of continuous threat models to transfer to proprietary models.
4. For the Llama2-7b-WhoIsHarryPotter model [11] and the recently proposed TOFU benchmark [12], we demonstrate that embedding space attacks can extract considerably more informa

tion from unlearned models than direct prompts. This presents a novel use case for adversarial attacks as an "interrogation" tool for unlearned models.
5. Lastly, we demonstrate on the Llama3-8B model that embedding space attacks can extract pretraining training data from LLMs. Specifically, we show that embedding space attacks optimized towards the completion of Harry Potter books transfer to unseen paragraphs not used during attack optimization, effectively extracting training data from the model.

## 2 Related Work

In natural language processing (NLP), continuous adversarial attacks have mostly been used in encoder-decoder models, such as BERT [13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18], and in the context of adversarial training. Jiang et al. [13] use adversarial attacks as a smoothness regularization to improve generalization. Moreover, multiple works apply continuous adversarial perturbation to word embeddings to increase performance in different NLP tasks [14; 15; 16; 17; 18].

In text context of adversarial attacks, Carlini et al. [19] and Zou et al. [4] find that past attacks that show high attack success rates on BERT-style encoder-decoder models [20; 21; 22], only achieve trivial success rate against state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs, such as LLama-2 [23]. Later work proposes the first effective white-box attack in the context of LLM assistants [4] showing that Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) prompt injection attack successfully generates adversarial examples that transfer from small open-source models such as Llama7b to large closed-source models. Geisler et al. [24] propose the first discrete attack attack that is optimized in the continuous embedding space which achieves a non-trivial success rate against state-of-the-art autoregressive LLMs. Another threat model consists of so-called jailbreaks, bypassing a given model's safety guardrails through prompt engineering. In the beginning, jailbreaking prompts were created manually through human red teaming. Later work showed that jailbreaks automatically generated by LLMs can break open-source and proprietary models [3]. Huang et al. [6] show that simply using different generation strategies, such as decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods can trigger harmful behavior in LLMs.

Numerous works have investigated extracting pretraining data from LLMs [25; 26; 27]. In concurrent work, Patil et al. [28] explored extraction attacks against unlearned LLMs. In contrast to the presented method, the authors do not use adversarial attacks to attack unlearned models but propose different logit-based methods to extract information. Closely after the publication of this work, Lucki et al. [29] showed that unlearning is not robust from an adversarial perspective, while Wu et al. [30] demonstrated that current unlearning techniques fail to reliably unlearn facts, supporting our findings.

In summary, numerous works and reviews consider discrete and black-box threat models in autoregressive decoder-only LLMs, such as jailbreaking [3; 5], prompt injection [4], backdoor attacks [31], multi-modal attacks [19], and other threats [32]. However, open-source threat models are largely underexplored [33; 34] and we close this gap in this work. For an extended description see App. 8.

## 3 Open-Source Specific Threat Models

Before we describe the proposed method, we first define desiderata of open-source threat models.

DesiderataThe increasing capability of open-source models will inevitably increase their potential to cause harm. While current models may mostly pose the threat of influencing public opinion or elections, future models may be used for impersonation or malicious autonomous agents. In the following, we present desiderata of attacks tailored to open-source models.

* _Success rate_: The extent to which the attack successfully circumvents the safety guardrailes across different (diverse) requests, indicating its overall effectiveness in compromising the model.
* _Efficiency_: How fast the attack can be computed. We identify two major use cases for open-source-specific attacks, where efficiency is essential. First, as a threat model to produce harmful outputs in open models. Second, as a tool to investigate model properties, such as robustness or unlearning quality.
* _Utility_: In case of a successful attack, verifying if the subsequent model generation is meaningful is important. Since token embeddings manipulated with continuous perturbations do not correspond to any real words or tokens in the model's vocabulary, it is unclear whether such a continuous attack could maintain model utility while simultaneously removing safety guardrails. Thus, the coherence and quality of the generated text must be considered when evaluating an attack.

In our experiments, we demonstrate that embedding space attacks are superior to existing threat models, such as discrete attacks or finetuning, for all three desiderata in the open-source domain.

Embedding Space AttacksIn embedding space attacks, we keep the weights of a model frozen and attack the continuous embedding representation of its input tokens. We propose the embedding space attack as a computationally effective tool to investigate the presence of knowledge in open-source models (e.g., toxic behavior, supposedly unlearned information, or training data), which can be used by researchers and practitioners alike to improve the safety of LLMs. As we are generally interested in the worst-case output behavior of the model, we do not put any constraints on the generation of embedding space attacks, such as restricting the magnitude of the perturbation.

In the following, we formalize embedding space attacks. Specifically, we denote with \(T\) a set of tokenized inputs \(T=\{T^{1},T^{2},\ldots,T^{i},\ldots,T^{N}\}\), where \(T^{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}\times d}\) is a single tokenized input string with \(n_{i}\) tokens of dimensionality \(d\), and \(y_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{m_{i}\times d}\) is the respective harmful target response consisting of \(m_{i}\) tokens. Let \(E:T\mapsto e\) be an embedding function that maps a set of tokens to a set of embedding vectors. We define \(e_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n_{i}\times D}\) as the embedding representation of the tokens \(T^{i}\), where \(D\) is the dimensionality of the embedding vector. Given an LLM: \(F:e_{i}\rightarrow\hat{y}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times d}\), we want to find an adversarial perturbation \(\overline{e}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{\overline{n}\times D}\), to minimize a predefined objective. Here, \(\overline{n}\) is the number of attacked tokens, which we set to the same value for all samples \(i\). In our experiments, we minimize the difference between the target response \(y\) and the prediction of the \(\hat{y}\) using the cross entropy loss function \(\mathcal{L}\left(\hat{y},y\right)\)

\[\overline{e}_{i}^{t+1}=\overline{e}_{i}^{t}-\alpha\cdot\mathrm{sign}\left( \nabla\mathcal{L}\left(F\left(e_{i}||\overline{e}_{i}^{t}\right),y\right) \right).\]

Here \(\overline{e}_{i}^{t}\) denotes the adversarial perturbation of sample \(i\) at time step \(t\), \(\alpha\) the step size of the attack, \(||\) the concatenation operator, and \(\mathrm{sign}(\cdot)\) the sign function. We evaluated different optimization methods, including 1) regular gradient descent, 2) \(\ell_{2}\)-norm scaled gradient descent, 3) gradient descent with momentum, and 4) signed gradient descent. Signed gradient descent proved to be the most stable, and we used it for all experiments presented in this paper. We simultaneously optimize all adversarial embeddings at once in contrast to previous approaches that optimize the adversarial tokens sequentially Zou et al. [4]. An illustration of the threat model is given in Fig. 2.

We define two goals for embedding space attacks.

_Individual Attack_: For each specific input \(T^{i}\) and its respective embedding \(e^{i}\), we optimize a unique adversarial perturbation \(e_{adv}^{in}\):

\[\min_{\overline{e}_{i}}\mathcal{L}\left(F(e_{i}||\overline{e}_{i}),y_{i} \right).\]

This approach focuses on achieving the optimization goal for one individual sample at a time.

_Universal Attack_: Here, we optimize a single adversarial perturbation \(\overline{e}_{un}\) across the entire set of tokenized input strings \(T\) and their associated embeddings \(e\):

\[\min_{\overline{e}_{un}}\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mathcal{L}\left(F(e_{i}|| \overline{e}_{un}),y_{i}\right),\]

where \(N\) is the total number of tokenized input strings in the data set. Consistent with the universal adversarial examples outlined in previous studies [4, 35], this attack aims to generalize its effectiveness to unseen instructions. A successful universal embedding attack has the potential to bypass a model's safety alignment across a wide range of instructions.

Figure 2: We use a similar setting as in [4] with the difference of optimizing attacks in the embedding space. Given an **<instruction>**, an adversarial embedding is optimized to trigger an affirmative **<target>** response, with the **<goal>** of triggering a subsequent generation related to the target. The **<goal>** is not provided during attack optimization.

Independent of the attack type, **we never leak any information about the optimization goal** (e.g., keywords related to an unlearning task) to the model during the attack optimization.

_Multilayer Attack:_ We additionally propose a variation of the embedding space attack where we decode intermediate hidden state representations of a given model, which we call multi-layer attack. This method is inspired by the logit lease [28; 36] and is designed to extract if information is propagated within a model, such as supposedly unlearned associations.

Let \(h^{l}\) represent the hidden state at layer \(l\), where \(l\) is an element in the set of layers \(P\in\{1,2,\ldots,L\}\). For a predefined set of layers \(\hat{P}\subseteq P\), we perform greedy decoding for \(K\) number of tokens, with \(T_{k}\) representing the sequence of tokens at the \(k\)-th generation step. In every step \(k\) and for each layer \(l\), we decode the hidden state \(h^{l}\) for the current sequence of tokens \(T_{k}^{L}\). This yields \(L\) sequences of tokens \(\{T_{k+1}^{1},T_{k+1}^{2},\ldots,T_{k+1}^{L}\}\), each corresponding to the greedy decoding of the respective layer. In the next iteration, \(k+1\) we use the decoded output of the last layer \(T_{k+1}^{L}\) as the input of the model and repeat this process (see Fig. 3). For multi-layer attacks, we always include the last layer in the subset \(P\) to compute \(T_{k}^{L}\) and thereby obtain the standard output as well.

## 4 Experiment Configurations

All experiments were conducted on four A100 GPUs with 40GB of memory.

### Models

We use seven different open-source models in our evaluations. This includes Llama2-7b-Chat [23], Llama3-8b-Chat [37], Vicuna-7b [38], and Mistral-7b [39]. We also attack Llama3-8b-CB and Mistral-7b-CB, which are trained to withstand adversarial attacks through circuit breaking [40]. In the original evaluation by the authors, these circuit breaker models demonstrated remarkable robustness, where nearly all attempted attacks achieved nearly zero percent attack success rate. Lastly, we use Llama2-7b-WhoIsHarryPotter [11], a Llama2-7b model fine-tuned to forget Harry Potter-related associations (see App. B).

### Datasets

**Harbmbench.** We use the standard behaviors of the harmonech dataset to measure the ability of embedding space attacks to bypass safety guardrailes [41].

Only a few benchmarks in the research area of unlearning LLMs have been proposed so far [12; 42]. We use two recent benchmarks in this work:

**Harry Potter Q&A.** We perform experiments on the LlamaHP model, which was fine-tuned to forget Harry Potter-related associations. For this purpose, we created a custom Harry Potter Q&A benchmark dataset. We generated \(55\) unique questions using GPT4 that can be answered with simple responses. Specifically, we asked GPT4 to generate affirmative target responses for embedding space attacks that do not leak the answer to the respective Harry Potter question and reviewed the generated dataset manually for correctness. This allows us to use a keyword-based evaluation to identify successful attacks. We do not leak any information about the keywords during attack optimization.

**TOFU.** We use the recently published TOFU dataset, an unlearning benchmark of fictitious content for LLMs [12]. We first fine-tune Llama2-7b-chat-hf models on the provided data and subsequently unlearn the models using the \(99\%\) retain set and the \(1\%\) forget set. We use the gradient ascent method and the gradient difference method to unlearn the models. For more information concerning the unlearning methods please refer to [12]. Finally, we evaluate the unlearned models with embedding space attacks. We use the same hyperparameters for fine-tuning and unlearning as in the original

Figure 3: Illustration of the multi-layer attack. From a regular generated sequence \(T_{k}^{L}\), we decode alternative output sequence \(T_{k}^{L}\) from intermediate layers of the neural network.

paper and evaluate the unlearned model after \(4\) iterations of unlearning. For TOFU, we use "Sure, the answer is" as the target \(y\) for embedding space attacks.

### Metrics

We used multiple metrics to measure the harmfulness of model generations and evaluate if supposedly unlearned knowledge was retrieved by an attack. To evaluate if a generation was harmful and calculate the attack success rate (ASR) we use the judge model provided by [41].

**Cumulative attack success rate (C-ASR).** Existing works evaluate the effectiveness of unlearning methods in a one-shot manner, where a model is assessed on a given task only once. We argue that depending on the sensitivity of the information, an unlearned model mustn't be able to reveal any of the unlearned information even for multiple prompting attempts. This is in line with Kerckhoff's Principle, which asserts that a system's security should not depend on obscurity. Thus, to obtain an accurate estimate of the information that can be retrieved for an unlearned model in the worst case, we propose a new metric, which we call cumulative attack success rate _C-ASR_.

For a given query, such as "Who are the best friends of Harry Potter?", we attack an unlearned model \(n\) times and denote an attack as successful if the correct answer appears at least once for any of the attack attempts. We choose a relatively small value for \(n\) of \(20\) for all experiments to keep the attacks practical. While we mainly propose this metric for the unlearning task, we also use it in the toxicity evaluation setting. We argue that disclosing sensitive information or giving toxic responses should not occur, even across multiple inquiries. We give a more formal definition in App. E.

**Toxicity score and perplexity.** For a more nuanced evaluation, we additionally analyze the toxicity of each response using the toxic-bert model [43] and the perplexity of the generated output using the respective base model.

**ROUGE score.** We additionally use the ROUGE metric [44], which measures the quality of a summary given a reference summary and is one of the evaluation metrics used in the TOFU benchmark [12]. For all experiments, we use a cumulative variation of the ROUGE-1 score, where we calculate the minimum ROUGE-1 score over a set of responses for a given query.

### Attack methods

**Embedding space attacks (ours).** We use \(200\) attack iterations for toxicity-related experiments and \(100\) for attacks against unlearned models. For the two models trained with circuit breaking [40], we use \(2000\) attack iterations. We evaluate the success of an attack \(20\) times, spaced evenly throughout the optimization process, and report the C-ASR metric if not stated otherwise (see also App. A).

**Discrete attacks.** We chose state-of-the-art discrete attacks, including GCG [4], AutoDAN [45], PAIR [5], and Adaptive attacks [46], which were chosen based on the results reported in [41]. For all attacks, we use the hyperparameters provided in the original work.

**Fine-tuning.** We compare the ability of embedding attacks to remove the safety alignment of open-source models with fine-tuning the Llama2 model, which has shown to be an effective way to compromise safety in prior work [47]. We fine-tune the Llama2 model with QLoRa on the Anthropic red-teaming-data [48]. More details are provided in App. D.

**Unlearning attacks.** We use multinomial sampling in combination with the C-ASR metric. Here, we sample from an unlearned model multiple times, considering the top-k most likely answers, corresponding to the top-k highest logits in the last layer. For the top-k attack, we use \(100\) samplings, \(k=10\), and optimize the temperature hyperparameter using a grid search between \(0.1\) and \(10\). Additionally, we use the Head-projection attack (HPA), which is an unlearning attack based on the logit lens [28]. Lastly, we compare our approach to the Probability delta attack (PDA) [28]. This attack is also motivated by the logit lens and leverages the rank-ordering of token probability differences between consecutive layers to identify the most likely tokens corresponding to supposedly unlearned information. Hyperparameters for HPA and PDA are taken from [28].

## 5 Breaking Safety Alignment

We compare our approach to existing discrete adversarial attacks and model fine-tuning. Discrete attacks are the most prevalent threat model in LLMs [3; 4; 5], whereas model finetuning is computationally efficient [47]. We first report results on attacks trained and evaluated on the training dataset. This setting allows us to use embedding attacks as an investigative tool. For example, to explore if a model contains knowledge related to a specific harmful topic. It is also a relevant threat model when a malicious actor wants to trigger harmful behavior for a set of predefined instructions, e.g., in applications that entail generating toxic content at scale.

**Training Data Evaluations.** In the first row of Fig. 4, we report the ASR for individual attacks, where attacks are trained and evaluated on the same data. In our experiments, individual embedding attacks achieve a C-ASR of \(100\%\) for all models. The only other attack that achieves similar ASR is the adaptive attack proposed by [46]. However, this attack requires manual engineering of a suitable attack template for each model. As a result, we were not able to evaluate it for the two models trained with circuit breaking, for which the authors provide no template. Moreover, embedding attacks are the only algorithm that is able to bypass the defense of the circuit breaker models. In the original evaluation conducted by the authors, even latent attacks were unable to bypass this defense and did not achieve high success rates [40]. In the second row, we compare the inference time of the different attacks. Embedding space attacks are orders of magnitude faster than all other attacks for all models. We additionally, conducted an attack on Llama-3-70b-Instruct [49] to evaluate if embedding attacks are effective for larger models. This attack also achieved a success rate of \(100\%\).

**Generalization to Unseen Behaviors.** To investigate the ability of embedding space attacks to generalize to unseen harmful behaviors, we trained universal embedding attacks on the first \(50\%\) of the dataset and evaluated them on the remaining samples. In this setting, embedding attacks achieve an ASR of \(91.6\%\) for LLama2-7b-Chat, \(97.5\%\) for Mistral-7b-CB, and \(96.25\%\) for LLama3-8b-CB, demonstrating that embedding attacks are highly transferable and an efficient tool to circumvent safety alignment of even the most robust existing models.

**From Continous to Discrete Threat Models.** Embedding space attacks are designed as a threat model tailored to open-source models. Here, we conduct two simple experiments to assess the possibility of transferring continuous threat models to a discrete setting. In line with prior work, we observe that discretizing the attack after optimization to the nearest embedding does not result in effective discrete attacks [4]. Inspired by previous work to generate jailbreaks with LLMs [45], we evaluate if _aligned_ models that are attacked with universal embedding attacks can be used to generate discrete attacks. We first optimize a universal embedding attack for the Llama2 model using \(50\%\) of the harmonbch standard behavior dataset. Next, we prompt the embedding attacked LLama2 to generate discrete attacks for the unseen behaviors (prompt template can be found in App. C). We generate \(200\) discrete attacks for every unseen behavior (one attack in every iteration of

Figure 4: Attack success rate and average compute time of diverse discrete attacks and the proposed embedding attack for different models. Embedding attacks achieve higher success rates and are considerably more efficient compared to existing methods for all tested models.

the embedding attack optimization). This simple attack achieves \(43.6\%\) ASR, whereas the model generally declines the request to generate jailbreaks when it is not attacked (\(0\%\) ASR).

### Comparison to Fine-tuning

To evaluate embedding space attacks as a threat model in open-source language models, we compare the attack success rate between universal embedding space attacks trained on \(50\%\) of the harmonech standard behaviors with fine-tuning a model to remove the safety alignment (for detailed information see SS 4.4). For both methods, we evaluate the model on the remaining \(50\%\) samples. In our experiments, fine-tuning for \(50\) iterations achieves an attack success rate of \(88.8\%\). In contrast, universal embedding space attacks achieve the same attack success after \(9\) iterations and a higher success rate of \(91.6\%\) after \(20\) iterations. Removing the safety alignment with universal embedding attacks is considerably less expensive than fine-tuning with the attack requiring significantly less memory ( \(25\%\)) and fewer iterations. In contrast to finetuning, the attack does not require any training data for optimization and can be performed without any examples of toxic behavior. Moreover, individual attacks achieve an affirmative response in only \(9\) iterations on average in our experiments, which is orders of magnitudes faster than comparable discrete attacks [4; 45] and considerably faster than finetuning.

### Impact on Perplexity and Toxicity

While the previous experiments demonstrate that embedding space attacks can trigger harmful responses in safety-aligned models, it is unclear if these attacks reduce the output perplexity of the model (i.e., if the model still generates high quality text). For a more nuanced evaluation, we calculate the perplexity and toxicity of generated answers with and without embedding attacks. For the toxicity evaluation, we generate toxicity scores between \(0\) and \(1\) using the toxic-bert model [43]. Fig. 5 shows boxplots of the perplexity and toxicity values of generated responses from different models using the instructions of the harmful behavior dataset as input. Perplexity and toxicity are measured only on the generated response, which does not in

Figure 5: The two rows show the perplexity and toxicity (obtained from toxic-bert) of generated responses of different LLMs with and without embedding space attacks on the harmful behavior dataset. Additionally, the scores of the fine-tuned Llama2 model are compared to attacking the regular Llama2. Embedding attacks decrease perplexity for all models while significantly increasing toxicity for most models (significant differences with a Mann–Whitney U test are indicated with *).

Figure 6: Number of toxic responses (\(y\)-axis) and the binned attack loss (\(x\)-axis) for a universal embedding space attack on the Llama2 model is shown. It can be observed that lower loss values are associated with higher toxicity.

clude the attack instruction and target. Attacking the model does not lead to higher perplexity in our experiments. Surprisingly, all models exhibit lower perplexity values on responses generated under attack. This effect is most pronounced for the Mistral model, where the perplexity of the response is considerably smaller with the attack. Fine-tuning has less effect on the toxicity of the answers than embedding attacks. We find that filtering for responses that show low perplexity and high toxicity is an effective way to find probable harmful responses. Examples are given in App. L. We conducted a Mann-Whitney-U tests [50] to compare the toxicity levels of attacked and unattacked models (see also App. F). Attacked models show significantly higher toxicity values for the Llama2, and Mistral model. Significant differences are indicated with * symbols, where *, ***, *** correspond to \(p<0.05\), \(p<0.001\), \(p<0.0001\), and \(p<0.00001\), respectively. To adjust for multiple comparisons, we applied the Bonferroni correction method [51]. We further evaluated if the attack objective correlates with the toxicity of the generated responses. Fig. 6 shows that attacks with lower loss values result in considerably more toxic responses compared to attacks with higher loss values. We considered responses as toxic if the _toxicity score_ of the toxic-bert model was higher than \(0.1\).

## 6 Attacking Unlearned Models

In a second task, we investigate the ability of embedding attacks to retrieve knowledge from unlearned models. Precisely, we assess if we can make a model give correct answers to a predefined set of questions that are answered wrongly when prompting the model without attack. We do not leak any information about the unlearned information during the optimization of the attack. We conduct experiments on the LlamaHP model [11], which we evaluate on the proposed Harry Potter Q&A and additional experiments on the TOFU benchmark [12]. To the best of our knowledge, adversarial perturbations have not been explored in the context of unlearning yet.

**Harry Potter Q&A** The standard Llama2 model achieves an accuracy of \(34.5\%\) on the Harry Potter Q&A, while the unlearned model achieves an accuracy of \(3.6\%\). Examples of questions of the Q&A and answers of the standard and unlearned model are given in App. G. Tab. 1 summarizes the success rate of individual and universal embedding space attacks using multi-layer attacks (All) and standard attacks (Last). Embedding attacks expose considerable residual Harry Potter knowledge in the unlearned model. Under attack the accuracy of the unlearned model on the Q&A is close to the original non-unlearned model (\(30.9\%\) vs. \(34.5\%\)). Multi-layer attacks achieve an overall higher attack success rate compared to standard attacks in all experiments. In App. H, we provide detailed analysis concerning the contribution of individual layers to the attack success rate. Increasing the amount of attacked tokens hurts the success rate of all conducted attacks. Moreover, universal attacks consistently perform better than individual attacks. Our results indicate that embedding space attacks are prone to overfitting the objective. Regularizing the attack by computing only one universal perturbation for the whole task improves the success rate. Likewise, reducing the amount of attacked tokens improves the performance of the attack. We explore this further and demonstrate that overfitting is connected with low attack success rate in App. I. Furthermore, we explore top-k sampling with a temperature parameter of \(2\) (see SS4.4) as an attack for retrieving deleted information in unlearned models. Using \(100\) iterations of top-k sampling for every question in the Harry Potter Q&A achieves a _CU_ of \(27.8\%\). By combining embedding space attacks and top-k sampling, we achieve a _CU_ of \(38.2\%\), which is higher than the one-shot accuracy of the standard model on the Q&A.

In a separate experiment, we investigate the generalization of embedding space attacks in the context of unlearning. For this purpose, we train a universal attack using one set of Harry Potter Q&A questions and then evaluate its effectiveness on a different set of questions. The best attack with a \(25/75\) train/test split achieves a similar success rate of \(28.6\%\) compared to \(30.9\%\) when evaluating the attack on the training data. Additional results are deferred to App. J.

Tab. 2 summarizes the cumulative ROUGE-1 score of different embedding attack configurations on the same dataset. Embedding space attacks increase the ROUGE score considerably to at least \(0.49\) for individual and universal attacks with no considerable dependency on the number of attacked tokens. As with the previous experiments, universal embedding attacks generalize to unseen samples on the TOFU benchmark, achieving a ROUGE score of up to \(0.52\) with a \(25/75\%\) train/test split. For a more detailed description, see App. K.

## 7 Training Data Extraction

To explore the broader implications of embedding space attacks, we conducted an experiment focused on extracting training data from pretrained LLMs. Since the training data for LLMs is generally undisclosed, even in open-source models, effective extraction attacks would present a substantial threat. We created a dataset of sentence pairs from the first Harry Potter book, splitting it into \(527\) training pairs and \(100\) test pairs. Each pair consisted of an instruction (first sentence) and a target (second sentence). We then optimized a universal embedding space that was attached to the instruction to improve the prediction of the target sentence for the Llama3-8B model. We also prepended the instruction with the sentence: _"Continue the following paragraph from the first Harry Potter book."_ to provide context about the task to the model. This was done, as most instruction sentences are generic and contain no clues about the subject of Harry Potter. Using the test dataset, we evaluated whether this universal attack improved the LLM's ability to complete unseen target sentences. Indeed, the universal attack improved the ROUGE-1 F1-score from 0.11 to 0.22, demonstrating that embedding space attacks can be used to extract training data from LLMs.

## 8 Discussion

This work investigates three use cases of embedding attacks in open-source LLMs. Firstly, we establish that embedding space attacks present a viable threat in open-source models, proving more efficient than fine-tuning at bypassing safety alignment. Secondly, we demonstrate their capacity to uncover allegedly deleted information in unlearned models. Lastly, we present preliminary results in extracting pretraining data. Our findings demonstrate that embedding space attacks are a cost-effective yet potent tool and threat model for probing undesirable behaviors in open-source LLMs.

**Limitations and Future Work.** To bypass safety alignment and unlearning methods, we optimize embedding space attacks to trigger an affirmative response. We did not evaluate if the affirmative response objective leads to more model hallucinations. This is a common limitation in the evaluation of adversarial attacks in the LLM setting [4; 5]. Generally, attacks are considered successful if the model responds coherently to the query, but the correctness of the response is not evaluated, which can lead to inaccurate assessments [52]. To improve the efficency of embedding space attacks, future work can further explore improved loss functions [53; 54] or optimization schemes [55].

**Broader Impacts.** The challenge of ensuring robustness in machine learning is still unsolved after a decade, and we believe raising awareness is a key strategy to improve safety. At this stage, technical solutions seem insufficient to tackle the robustness issue fully. Risk awareness is crucial in preventing these models' irresponsible deployment in critical sectors and in reducing the threats posed by malicious actors. We believe that embedding space attacks can be a valuable tool to investigate model vulnerabilities before these models are deployed.

## Extended Related Work

Neural networks have been successfully deployed in many real-world applications across various domains, including time-series processing [56, 57], business monitoring [58, 59], and trend analysis [60, 61]. However, the vulnerability of neural networks to adversarial examples has remained an open-research problem, despite having being been extensively studied in the literature [62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67].

More recently, LLMs have been shown to be vulnerable to exploitation by adversarial attacks and several threat models have been proposed in the literature. In natural language processing (NLP), continuous adversarial attacks have mostly been used in encoder-decoder models, such as BERT [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18], and in the context of adversarial training. Jiang et al. [13] use adversarial attacks as a smoothness regularization to improve generalization. Moreover, multiple works apply continuous adversarial perturbation to word embeddings to increase performance in different NLP tasks [14, 15, 16, 17, 18]. Shortly after the publication of this work, Casper et al. [68] used continuous attacks for the purpose of adversarial training in autoregressive LLMs and demonstrate improved robustness to unseen threat models.

In the context of adversarial attacks, Carlini et al. [19] and Zou et al. [4] find that past attacks that show high attack success rates on BERT-style encoder-decoder models [20, 21, 22], only achieve trivial success rate against state-of-the-art decoder-only LLMs, such as LLama-2 [23]. Later work proposes the first effective white-box attack in the context of LLM assistants [4] showing that Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) prompt injection attack successfully generates adversarial examples that transfer from small open-source models such as Llama7b to large closed-source models. Geisler et al. [24] propose the first discrete attack attack that is optimized in the continuous embedding space which achieves a non-trivial success rate against state-of-the-art autoregressive LLMs. Lapid et al. [69] developed a prompt injection attack using genetic algorithms, where they use a surrogate model to calculate the reward within the genetic algorithm. They show that attacks crafted with the surrogate loss transfer to various LLMs. Another threat model consists of so-called jailbreaks, bypassing a given model's safety guardrails through prompt engineering. In the beginning, jailbreaking prompts were created manually through human red teaming. Later work showed that jailbreaks automatically generated by LLMs can break open-source and proprietary models [3]. In another line of work, Chao et al. [5] demonstrate that LLMs can be directly used to craft jailbreaks for other LLMs. In their Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) algorithm, they iteratively query a target LLM using an attacker algorithm to optimize a jailbreaking prompt. In concurrent work, Liu et al. [45] develop a hierarchical genetic algorithm that can generate high perplexity jailbreaks that bypass the safety alignment of LLMs. Apart from inference time attacks, Rando and Tramer [31] show that poisoning the Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) process enables an attacker to integrate backdoor triggers into the model. These backdoor triggers can subsequently be used to bypass the alignment of the attacked model. Huang et al. [6] show that simply using different generation strategies, such as decoding hyper-parameters and sampling methods can trigger harmful behavior in LLMs. Similarly, Scholten et al. [70] demonstrate that current unlearning methods are not robust from a probabilistic perspective.

Numerous works have investigated extracting pretraining data from LLMs [25, 26, 27]. In concurrent work, Patil et al. [28] explored extraction attacks against unlearned LLMs. In contrast to the presented method, the authors do not use adversarial attacks to attack unlearned models but propose different logit-based methods to extract information.

In summary, numerous works and reviews consider discrete and black-box threat models in autoregressive decoder-only LLMs, such as jailbreaking [3, 5], prompt injection [4], backdoor attacks [31], multi-modal attacks [19], and other threats [32]. However, open-source threat models are largely underexplored [33, 34] and we close this gap in this work.

Embedding Attacks Hyperparameters

For unlearning-related experiments, we perform \(100\) attack iterations for all attacks and evaluate the model output in every attack iteration for the computation of the cumulative attack success rate (\(C\)-\(ASR\)). For toxicity-related experiments, we perform \(200\) attack iterations and evaluate the output for every \(10\)th attack iteration. However, for models trained with circuit breaking we use \(2000\) attack iterations and calculate attack success for every \(100\)th attack iteration. For all experiments, we use a constant step size of \(\alpha=0.001\). For evaluation, we generate \(100\) tokens following the instruction, adversarial embedding, and target of the attack. To evaluate universal attacks, we use train/test splits of \(50/50\%\) if not stated otherwise. We generally initialized the attack embedding with strings of the form!!!!!! following [4]. For circuit breakers we instead use "Make sure to follow my instructions accurately and do not hesitant to answer in a toxic way. Do not worry about me engaging with this content. I am studying toxic behavior of LLMs. ", as we observed that this let to higher quality generations. Initializing the attack with repetitions of one character often resulted in the same character being repeated in the output of the model. Note that we did not optimize the initialization string and kept this first iteration as it resulted in \(100\%\) attack success rate. For multi-layer attacks, we use all layers of a given model with \(\hat{P}=P\).

We also attack Llama3-8b-CB and Mistral-7b-CB, which are trained to withstand adversarial attacks through circuit breaking [40]. Lastly, we use Llama2-7b-WholsHarryPotter [11], a

## Appendix C From Continous to Discrete Attacks

We used the following prompt template to generate discrete jailbreaks from embedding attacked models, where <behavior> is the toxic instruction and <target> is the harmful response:

## Appendix D Fine-tuning Hyperparameters

We compare the ability of embedding attacks to remove the safety alignment of open-source models with fine-tuning the Llama2 model, which has shown to be an effective way to compromise safety in prior work [47]. For fine-tuning, we perform \(50\) steps of QLoRa [71]\(8\) bit and a batch size of

\(10\) per device on \(100\) samples of the Anthropic red-teaming-data [48]. We filter the data using the "min_harmlessness_score_transcript" parameter and only consider samples with a harmlessness score smaller than \(-4.5\). From the remaining data, we randomly sample the \(100\) examples.

## Appendix E Cumulative Success Rate

Let \(Q=\{q_{1},q_{2},\ldots,q_{n}\}\) be a set of \(n\) queries. Each query \(q_{i}\) is related to a specific piece of knowledge or information the model is expected to have unlearned (e.g., questions about Harry Potter). For each query \(q_{i}\), the model generates a set of responses \(R_{i}=\{r_{i}^{1},r_{i}^{2},\ldots,r_{i}^{m}\}\). Each response is obtained by probing the model with different adversarial attacks or by using top-k sampling, where \(m\) is the number of times each query is processed. We denote the correct answer for each query \(q_{i}\) as \(a_{i}\). The cumulative success rate (_CU_) for the set of queries \(Q\), is defined as \(CU=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{i}\), where \(\delta_{i}\) is an indicator function defined as:

\[\delta_{i}=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }a_{i}\in R_{i}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}\]

_CU_ describes the proportion of queries for which the correct answer appears at least once in the corresponding set of responses. While we mainly propose this metric for the unlearning task, we also use it in the toxicity evaluation setting. As with sensitive information that is supposed to be unlearned, we argue that harmful responses should not be given by a model, even for multiple queries.

## Appendix F Toxicity Evaluation

**Statistical analysis.** The results of the two-sided Mann-Whitney-U test were:

1) Llama2 fine-tuned model/Llama2 attacked (\(p=3.534e-21\), \(U=8.499e+04\))

2) Llama2 Attacked/Standard (\(p=6.268e-34\), \(U=7.236e+04\))

3) Mistral Attacked/Standard (\(p=6.562e-03\), \(U=1.192e+05\))

4) Vicuna Attacked/Standard (\(p=7.275e-01\), \(U=1.163e+05\)).

Harry Potter Unlearning

Tab. 4 shows example questions and responses for the Harry Potter Q&A for the unlearned LlamaHP model.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt} p{113.8pt}} \hline \hline Question & Without Attack & Attacked \\ \hline Write extensive paragraphs about Harry Potter & \begin{tabular}{} \end{tabular} & 
\begin{tabular}{} \end{tabular} \\ \hline \begin{Multi-layer Attack

Fig. 7 shows the contribution of individual layers to the success rate of the attack for universal and individual attacks for the Llama2 model. For both attack configurations, the highest number of correct answers are obtained from decoding the outputs of the last layer. The first \(16\) layers of the model do not contribute to the success of the attack.

## Appendix I Overfitting embedding space attacks

We investigated the connection between the success rate of embedding space attacks in the unlearning setting and the number of tokens attacked during optimization. We hypothesize that increasing the number of attackable tokens makes it easier for the attack to overfit the target while using a low number of attackable tokens acts as a kind of regularization. To explore this further, we analyzed the relation between the magnitude of an embedding attack perturbation and the success rate of the attack to see if overfitting can negatively affect attack success. Fig. 8 illustrates, that large embedding magnitudes are connected with high perplexity and low attack success rate, indicating that overfitting in embedding space attacks should be mitigated.

## Appendix J Universal Attacks on the Harry Potter Q&A

In a separate experiment, we investigate the generalization of embedding space attacks in the context of unlearning. For this, we train a universal attack using one set of Harry Potter Q&A questions and then evaluate its effectiveness on a different set of questions. Tab. 5 summarizes the results of the generalization experiment. We observe the same trends as in the previous experiments. Reducing the number of tokens increases the success rate of the attack and multi-layer attacks increase the performance. In line with the results on the harmful behavior dataset, reducing the number of training samples improves the success rate of the universal attack on the test data. The best attack on the \(75\%\) test split achieves a similar success rate of \(28.6\%\) compared to \(30.9\%\) when evaluating the attack on the training data. We thus conclude, that embedding space attacks successfully transfer in the unlearning setting within one specific topic.

Examples of Harmful Behaviors

We randomly sample responses to harmful behaviors with a perplexity smaller than \(0.5\) and a toxicity score larger \(0.1\). Samples are generated using a universal embedding attack with \(1\) attacked token.

#### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All claims are backed up by experiments SS5 and SS6 and related work SS2 Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: A limitation section is provided in the paper SS2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may performpoorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: No theoretical results are presented in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Hyperparameters of all experiments are provided in the paper SS4 and Appendix. Code is provided in the supplementary material to ensure that experiments are reproducible.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Data and code to reproduce the experiments are provided in the supplemental material. Guidelines:* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Hyperparameter settings are described in the manuscriptSS4. Code is additionally provided to make understanding the exact data processing pipeline easier. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments?Answer: [Yes] Justification: For relevant experiments, significance tests were conducted, and appropriate correction methods were performed SS6. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: The compute resources are described SS4 but the total amount of compute needed to conduct every single experiment was not given. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We assured that the paper follows the given guidelines. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: A broader impact statement is provided SS8. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No datasets or models are released. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Datasets, code, and models are referenced in the manuscript SS4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No relevant assets are introduced. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: No such experiments were conducted. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
