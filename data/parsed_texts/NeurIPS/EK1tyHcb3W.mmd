[12, 13, 14, 15], as long as the posted prices are set correctly. This raises the main question of the current paper:

_How many samples are necessary from the value distributions of the buyers to find near-optimal posted prices for single item? Is there a difference between independent vs. correlated distributions or between welfare vs. revenue maximization?_

Despite being a natural question, the tight sample complexity bounds for single item posted pricing are unknown, both for independent/correlated and welfare/revenue settings.

### Model

Before stating our results, we formally describe our model.

**Posted pricing.** There is single copy of an item. Buyers \(i=1,\ldots,n\) arrive in order, each with a private value (willingness to pay) \(V_{i}\) for that item. Price \(\pi_{i}\) is offered to buyer \(i\), and the first buyer (if any) for whom \(V_{i}\geq\pi_{i}\) end up buying the item, "winning" the auction. The objective is to maximize either _welfare_, which is the value of the item to the winner, or _revenue_, which is the price paid by the winner.

**Distributions and policies.** We will assume that the vector of values \(\mathbf{V}=(V_{1},\ldots,V_{n})\) is drawn from an unknown but fixed distribution \(\mathbf{D}\) over \([0,1]^{n}\). If each \(V_{i}\) is drawn _independently_ from some marginal distribution \(D_{i}\), then \(\mathbf{D}\) is called a _product distribution_, written as \(\mathbf{D}=D_{1}\times\cdots\times D_{n}\). Meanwhile, _posted pricing policies_ are defined by a vector of prices \(\pi=(\pi_{1},\ldots,\pi_{n})\) that must be fixed before the first buyer arrives, and possibly restricted to some subclass \(\Pi\). The objective of policy \(\pi\) under buyer values \(\mathbf{V}\) is denoted by \(\pi(\mathbf{V})\), which equals \(V_{\operatorname*{argmin}\{i:\pi_{i}\leq V_{i}\}}\) and \(\pi_{\operatorname*{argmin}\{i:\pi_{i}\leq V_{i}\}}\) for the welfare and revenue objectives respectively, understood to be \(0\) if the item is not sold. We (abusively) let \(\pi(\mathbf{D}):=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{V}\sim\mathbf{D}}[\pi(\mathbf{V})]\) denote the expected objective of \(\pi\), and let \(\Pi(\mathbf{D}):=\sup_{\pi\in\Pi}\pi(\mathbf{D})\) denote the best expected objective of a policy in \(\Pi\) knowing \(\mathbf{D}\).

Note that if we are given the product distribution on buyer values, the optimal policy (for either objective) can be easily computed using dynamic programming [1]. Consequently, for product distributions we consider the full policy class \(\Pi=[0,1]^{n}\), and omit the dependence on \(\Pi\).

**Learning problem.** A _learning algorithm_ takes as input samples \(\mathbf{V}\) that are drawn independently and identically distributed (IID) from the unknown distribution \(\mathbf{D}\) and an error parameter \(\varepsilon\in(0,1)\), and seeks to return a policy \(\pi\in\Pi\) that satisfies \(\pi(\mathbf{D})\geq\Pi(\mathbf{D})-\varepsilon\), which is called an _\(\varepsilon\)-approximation_. Given a failure probability \(\delta\in(0,1)\), the _sample complexity_ is the minimum number of samples required for there to exist a learning algorithm that, under any distribution \(\mathbf{D}\), returns an \(\varepsilon\)-additive approximation with probability at least \(1-\delta\), noting that the randomness is over both the samples and any random bits in the algorithm. The sample complexity and learning algorithm will depend on the problem variant, defined by the objective (welfare or revenue), any parameters of the policy class \(\Pi\), and whether \(\mathbf{D}\) is restricted to be a product distribution or not. The sample complexity will also depend on the parameters \(\varepsilon,\delta>0\).

### Our Contributions to Posted Pricing for Product Distributions

The study of sample complexity for posted pricing goes back to at least the seminal work of Kleinberg and Leighton [11] who study revenue maximization for selling a single item to a single buyer (welfare maximization is trivial for single buyer since we just allocate the item by setting \(0\) price). For the general posted pricing problem with \(n\) buyers, the best known sample complexity bounds were due to Guo et al. [11], who showed that \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})\) samples suffice from each buyer's distribution for both welfare and revenue maximization objectives. Although there is a simple \(\Omega(1/\varepsilon^{2})\) lower bound for both welfare and revenue maximization settings, prior to our work it was unclear if polynomial dependency on the number of buyers \(n\) is necessary.

Our first result for product distribution shows that for welfare maximization using posted pricing (a.k.a. prophet inequality), the sample complexity is independent of the number of buyers \(n\).

**Theorem 1** (proved in Subsection 2.1).: _For product distributions, the sample complexity of welfare maximization is \(O(1/\varepsilon^{2}\cdot\log^{2}(1/\delta))\)._

**Proof sketch.** We start by constructing the product empirical distribution using the samples, where for each \(i\) we take the uniform distribution on the \(\tilde{O}(1/\varepsilon^{2})\) samples and then take the product distribution for different \(i\). Our main result is that the optimal policy (dynamic programming solution) on this product empirical distribution is an \(\varepsilon\)-approximation with high probability. Although one could use standard concentration bounds to bound the gap between the learned and optimal thresholds, such arguments lose a \(\operatorname{poly}(n)\) factor. This is because the difference between successive thresholds is bounded by \(1\), so naively the total variance of \(n\) thresholds could be \(\Omega(n)\). Our main idea is to instead study a martingale that adds up the errors made in the dynamic programming solution. This way, too high values for one buyer and too low values for another buyer balance each other. On this martingale, we use Freedman's inequality (which is a martingale variant of Bernstein's inequality), which allows us to bound the total variance in terms of conditional variances. A careful application of another concentration bound allows us to bound these conditional variances in terms of the change in the optimal value, whose sum is always at most \(1\). This latter concentration bound is what causes the additional factor of \(\log(1/\delta)\) in the sample complexity.

Our second result for product distribution shows a separation between welfare and revenue maximization using posted pricing, by proving that the \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})\) sample-complexity result of [1] for revenue maximization is tight up to log factors.

**Theorem 2** (proved in Subsection 2.2).: _For revenue maximization on product distributions, any learning algorithm requires \(\Omega(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) samples to return an \(\varepsilon\)-additive approximation with probability greater than 6/7._

**Proof sketch.** We construct for each buyer \(i\) two possible value distributions that add the same amount (roughly \(\frac{1}{n}\)) to the value-to-go of the optimal dynamic program. However, these distributions have different optimal prices, and making a mistake (choosing an incorrect price) in isolation loses roughly \(\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\) value. Although these mistakes accumulate in a non-linear fashion, we show that making \(M\) mistakes must lose in total \(\Omega(\frac{\varepsilon M^{2}}{nT^{2}})\). Finally, these value distributions have probabilities on the scale of \(\frac{1\pm\varepsilon}{n}\) with the same supports (essentially, only \(1/n\) of samples provide information), which means that \(\Omega(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) samples are needed to avoid making a constant fraction of mistakes.

### Our Contributions to Posted Pricing for Correlated Distributions

Independence among buyer valuations can be a strong modeling assumption for many applications. Although for arbitrary correlated distributions the optimal policy is not learnable, one could hope to learn the best policy in the class of all posted pricing policies. A recent work of Balcan et al. [1] can be applied to this setting to show that \(\tilde{O}(n/\varepsilon^{2})\) samples are sufficient to learn \(\varepsilon\)-optimal posted pricing. As discussed in Theorem 2, this linear in \(n\) dependency is necessary for revenue maximization, even for product distributions. Our first observation is that for correlated distributions, we need to lose this factor even for welfare maximization.

**Theorem 3** (corollary of Theorem 5).: _For welfare maximization with correlated buyers, any learning algorithm requires \(\Omega(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) samples to return an \(\varepsilon\)-additive approximation with constant probability._

Given this lower bound, a natural next question is to consider the subclass of posted pricing policies where the algorithm is only allowed to change its threshold at a small number of given locations. Can we now remove the linear in \(n\) dependency from sample complexity? The motivation to study this class comes from posted pricing applications where it is not possible for the algorithm designer to update the prices at each time step, e.g., due to business constraints.

Formally, for \(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}\), we say that posted pricing policy \(\pi\)_respects change-points_\(\mathcal{S}\) if \(\pi_{i}\) can differ from \(\pi_{i-1}\) only when \(i\in\mathcal{S}\). We let \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) denote the class of all policies that respect change-points \(\mathcal{S}\), noting that policies in \(\Pi(\emptyset)\) post a static price for all buyers, and \(\Pi(\{2,\ldots,n\})=[0,1]^{n}\). Our following result shows that one can obtain sample complexity that is independent of \(n\), depending only on the size of \(\mathcal{S}\).

**Theorem 4** (proved in Subsection 3.1).: _For correlated distributions, the sample complexity of welfare or revenue maximization is \(O\big{(}\frac{(1+|\mathcal{S}|)\log(1+|\mathcal{S}|)+\log(1/\delta)}{ \varepsilon^{2}}\big{)}\) when the policy is restricted to \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\), for any \(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}\)._

**Proof sketch.** By existing results in learning theory, it suffices to bound the pseudo-dimension of \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\). This will boil down to understanding the structure of "good sets", which are sets of the form \(\{\pi\in\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}:\pi(\mathbf{v})\geq z\}\), for some input \(\mathbf{v}\) and some target \(z\). We will show that for a natural parameterization of \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\), any good set can be expressed as the union and intersection of \(O(|\mathcal{S}|+1)\) halfspaces, which implies the pseudo-dimension of \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) is \(O((|\mathcal{S}|+1)\log(|\mathcal{S}|+1))\) by a result of [1]. This bound on the pseudo-dimension translates to the above sample complexity bound.

The learning algorithm which achieves the sample complexity bound in Theorem 4 is simply sample average approximation (SAA), which returns the policy in \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) with the highest objective value averaged over the samples. SAA can be computed in time \(O(Tn(Tn)^{1+|\mathcal{S}|})\). This is because there are \(1+|\mathcal{S}|\) prices to decide, each of which can take \(Tn\) possible values (one for each realized value in the \(T\) samples of length \(n\)), and evaluating each combination of prices over each of the \(T\) samples takes runtime linear in \(n\). We leave as an open question whether there is a more efficient algorithm.

Finally, we complement our sample complexity upper bounds for correlated distributions by giving matching lower bounds (up to polylogs).

**Theorem 5** (proved in Appendix A.5).: _For welfare or revenue maximization on correlated distributions, a learning algorithm requires \(\Omega(\frac{1+|\mathcal{S}|}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) samples to return an \(\varepsilon\)-additive approximation with constant probability, when restricted to the policy class \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) for any \(\mathcal{S}\subseteq\{2,\ldots,n\}\)._

**Proof sketch.** In the construction for Theorem 5, on each trajectory exactly one of the \(1+|\mathcal{S}|\) decision points (randomly selected) will be relevant, essentially diluting the samples by a factor of \(1+|\mathcal{S}|\) and leading to a lower bound of \(\Omega(\frac{1+|\mathcal{S}|}{\varepsilon^{2}})\).

### Further Related Work

In 2007, Hajiaghayi et al. [10] discovered connections between auction design and posted pricing via prophet inequalities. Since then, there is a long line of work on understanding the power of posted pricing for selling multiple items to combinatorial buyers [1, 2, 1, 1]. For single item revenue maximization with known distributions, Correa et al. [1] showed the equivalence of welfare and revenue maximization objectives for single item posted pricing.

For background on sample complexity, we suggest Wainwright's excellent textbook [21]. Sample complexity of auction design has been greatly studied; e.g., see [1, 1, 1]. We refer the readers to Guo et al. [1], who recently resolved single item revenue maximization in the offline setting, for an overview of the literature. In [1], Guo et al. generalized their techniques for revenue maximization over product distributions to all "strongly monotone" problems, which includes posted pricing for welfare and revenue maximization.

Recently, there is also a lot interest in learning auctions in limited feedback models like bandit and pricing queries [1, 2, 1]. We should note that sample complexity of optimal stopping (equivalent to our welfare maximization problem) has been previously studied in [1], who analyze linear stopping rules in a contextual setting. Our application of techniques from [1] to online algorithms over correlated sequences is also similar in spirit to some results from [1], who study a different application of inventory optimization.

Another related but tangential line of work focuses on prophet inequalities with samples [1, 1, 2], and the key distinction in these works is that their benchmark is the expected hindsight optimum, rather than the optimal online policy. Notably, any online algorithm incurs at least a factor of 2 loss compared to the hindsight optimum, even in the case of single-item prophet inequalities. As a result, this line of research aims to achieve \(O(1)\)-approximation guarantees, rather than the sublinear regret guarantees pursued in the current paper. Furthermore, their techniques differ significantly, as they often assume unbounded distributions. Finally, there is also work that explores the (non-)robustness of algorithms for the prophet inequality problem to inaccuracies in the distributions [1] and to dependencies in distributions [1, 2].

Product Distributions

In this section we first prove our improved upper bound on the sample complexity of welfare for product distributions, and then prove a new lower bounds on the sample complexity of revenue for product distributions.

### Positive Result for Welfare: Proof of Theorem 1

The reward of the optimal policy is given by the following backward induction: \(r_{n+1}^{*}=0\) and \(r_{i}^{*}=\mathbb{E}\left[\max\{r_{i+1}^{*},V_{i}\}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{ i}-r_{i+1}^{*})^{+}\right]+r_{i+1}^{*}\). It sets \(\pi_{i}=r_{i+1}^{*}\).

When we do not know the distributions but only have \(T\) samples from each of them, we can consider the optimal policy on the product empirical distribution, which corresponds to replacing the expectations in the above definitions by the empirical average. That is, we will analyze the policy that sets \(\pi_{i}=\hat{r}_{i+1}\), where \(\hat{r}_{i}\) is defined recursively by \(\hat{r}_{n+1}=0\), \(\hat{r}_{i}=\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}+\hat{r}_ {i+1}\).

Let \(r_{i}\) be the expected reward of this policy when starting with the \(i\)-th arrival. In order to prove the theorem, it is sufficient to show that with probability at least \(1-\delta\), we have \(r_{1}\geq r_{1}^{*}-\epsilon\) if \(T\geq(5\ln(2e/\delta)/\epsilon)^{2}\) for any choices of \(\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)\).

Let us define \(\eta_{i}=\hat{r}_{i}-\mathbb{E}\left[\max\{\hat{r}_{i+1},V_{i}\}\right]\) or equivalently as

\[\eta_{i}=\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}-\mathbb{E }\left[(V_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}\right]\enspace.\]

That is, \(\eta_{i}\) denotes the error introduced by using the empirical distribution for buyer \(i\) instead of the actual one. Note that \(\eta_{i}\) can both be positive and negative.

The two key steps of our proof are as follows. We first show that

\[r_{1}\geq r_{1}^{*}-2\max_{j\geq 1}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\right|\enspace.\] (1)

This inequality holds point-wise, that is for any samples drawn. Then, we show that for \(T\geq(5\ln(2e/\delta)/\epsilon)^{2}\) samples, we have \(\max_{j\geq 1}\left|\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\right|\leq\epsilon\) with probability at least \(1-\delta\).

In order to show (1), we first lower bound \(r_{1}\) in terms of \(\hat{r}_{1}\).

**Lemma 1**.: \(r_{1}\geq\hat{r}_{1}-\max_{j\in\{0,\dots,n\}}\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\)_._

Proof.: Let \(j\in\{0,1,\dots,n\}\) be the smallest index for which \(r_{j+1}\geq\hat{r}_{j+1}\), which exists because \(0=r_{n+1}\geq\hat{r}_{n+1}=0\). Note that we have \(r_{i}<\hat{r}_{i}\) for all \(1\leq i\leq j\). We rewrite \(r_{1}\) as

\[r_{1}=\textbf{Pr}\left[V_{1}<\hat{r}_{2}\right]r_{2}+\textbf{Pr}\left[V_{1} \geq\hat{r}_{2}\right]\mathbb{E}\left[V_{1}\mid V_{1}\geq\hat{r}_{2}\right]=r_ {2}+\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{1}-r_{2})\mathds{1}_{V_{1}\geq\hat{r}_{2}}\right].\]

Repeating this argument,

\[r_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\mathbb{E}[(V_{i}-r_{i+1})\mathds{1}_{V_{i}\geq\hat{r}_ {i+1}}]+\mathbb{E}[V_{j}\mathds{1}_{V_{j}\geq\hat{r}_{j+1}}+r_{j+1}\mathds{1} _{V_{j}<\hat{r}_{j+1}}].\]

Inductively, we can also establish that

\[\hat{r}_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+ }+\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t}\max\{V_{j}^{(t)},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}.\]

Combining these two equalities,

\[\hat{r}_{1}-r_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\left(\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)} -\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}-\mathbb{E}[(V_{i}-\underbrace{r_{i+1}}_{<\hat{r}_{i+1}}) \mathds{1}_{V_{i}\geq\hat{r}_{i+1}}]\right)\]

\[+\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\max\{V_{j}^{(t)},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}-\mathbb{E}[V_{j} \mathds{1}_{V_{j}\geq\hat{r}_{j+1}}+\underbrace{r_{j+1}}_{\geq\hat{r}_{j+1}} \mathds{1}_{V_{j}<\hat{r}_{j+1}}]\]

\[\leq\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\left(\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1}) ^{+}-\mathbb{E}[(V_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}]\right)+\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T} \max\{V_{j}^{(t)},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}-\mathbb{E}[\max\{V_{j},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}]\]

\[=\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}.\]

This implies \(\hat{r}_{1}-r_{1}\leq\max_{j\in\{0,\dots,n\}}\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\), completing the proof.

A similar proof allows us to prove the following lemma.

**Lemma 2**.: \(\hat{r}_{1}\geq r_{1}^{*}-\max_{j\in\{0,\ldots,n\}}(-\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i})\)_._

Proof.: Let \(j\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\}\) be the smallest index for which \(\hat{r}_{j+1}\geq r_{j+1}^{*}\), which exists because \(0=\hat{r}_{n+1}\geq r_{n+1}^{*}=0\). Note that we have \(\hat{r}_{i}<r_{i}^{*}\) for all \(1\leq i\leq j\), allowing us to derive

\[r_{1}^{*}-\hat{r}_{1} =\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\left(\mathbb{E}[(V_{i}-\underbrace{r_{i+1}^{*}} _{>\hat{r}_{i+1}})^{+}]-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\mathbb{E}[\max\{V_{j},\underbrace {r_{j+1}^{*}}_{\leq\hat{r}_{j+1}}\}]-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\max\{V_{j}^{(t)},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}\] \[\leq\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\left(\mathbb{E}[(V_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}]- \frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}\right)\] \[\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad\qquad+\mathbb{E}[\max\{V_{j},\hat{r}_{j+ 1}\}]-\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\max\{V_{j}^{(t)},\hat{r}_{j+1}\}\] \[=-\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}.\]

This implies \(r_{1}^{*}-\hat{r}_{1}\leq\max_{j\in\{0,\ldots,n\}}(-\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i})\), completing the proof. 

The last two lemmas imply (1). Thus, we need to bound \(\max_{j}\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\rvert\) to complete the proof.

**Lemma 3**.: _For every \(\epsilon,\delta>0\), with probability at least \(1-\delta\), we have \(\max_{j}\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\rvert\leq\epsilon\) if \(T\geq(5\ln(2e/\delta)/\epsilon)^{2}\)._

Proof.: Observe that

\[\left\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{j}\eta_{i}\right\rvert=\left\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{n}\eta_ {i}-\sum_{i=j+1}^{n}\eta_{i}\right\rvert\leq\lvert\sum_{i=1}^{n}\eta_{i} \rvert+\left\lvert\sum_{i=j+1}^{n}\eta_{i}\right\rvert\leq 2\max_{\tau} \left\lvert\sum_{i=\tau}^{n}\eta_{i}\right\rvert,\]

so it suffices to show that \(\max_{\tau}\lvert\sum_{i=\tau}^{n}\eta_{i}\rvert\geq\epsilon/2\) with probability at most \(\delta\). Reversing the quantity of interest to \(\max_{\tau}\lvert\sum_{i=\tau}^{n}\eta_{i}\rvert\) allows us to define a martingale, and use Freedman's inequality, which is a martingale version of Bernstein's inequality.

**Lemma 4** (Freedman, Theorem 1.6 in [15]).: _Consider a real-valued sequence \(\{X_{t}\}_{t\geq 0}\) such that \(X_{0}=0\) and \(\mathbb{E}\left[X_{t+1}\mid X_{t},X_{t-1},\ldots,X_{0}\right]=0\) for all \(t\). Assume that the sequence is uniformly bounded, i.e., \(\lvert X_{t}\rvert\leq M\) almost surely for all \(t\). Now define the predictable quadratic variation process of the martingale to be \(W_{t}=\sum_{j=0}^{t}\mathbb{E}\left[X_{j}^{2}\mid X_{j-1},\ldots,X_{0}\right]\) for all \(t\geq 1\). Then for all \(\ell\geq 0\) and \(\sigma^{2}\geq 0\), and any stopping time \(\tau\), we have_

\[\text{\bf Pr}\left[\left|\sum_{j=0}^{\tau}X_{j}\right|\geq\ell\text{ and }W_{\tau}\leq\sigma^{2}\right]\leq 2\exp\left(-\tfrac{\ell^{2}/2}{\sigma^{2}+M\ell/3}\right)\enspace.\]

A corollary of Freedman's inequality is that \(\text{\bf Pr}\left[\left|\sum_{j=0}^{\tau}X_{j}\right|\geq\ell\right]\leq 2 \exp\left(-\tfrac{\ell^{2}/2}{\sigma^{2}+M\ell/3}\right)+\text{\bf Pr}\left[W_{ \tau}\leq\sigma^{2}\right]\). In order to use Freedman's inequality, we consider \(nT\) random variables \(X_{1},\ldots,X_{nT}\), where \(X_{iT+t}=\frac{1}{T}\left((V_{n-i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{n-i-1})^{+}-\mathbb{E}\left[( V_{n-i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{n-i-1})^{+}\right]\right)\) for \(i\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}\) and \(t\in\{1,\ldots,T\}\). By this definition,

\[\eta_{i}=\sum_{t=1}^{T}X_{(n-i)T+t}\]

because \(V_{n-i}^{(t)}\) and \(V_{n-i}\) are identically distributed and independent of \(\hat{r}_{n-i-1}\). Moreover, for all \(j\),

\[\mathbb{E}\left[X_{j}\mid X_{1},\ldots,X_{j-1}\right]=0\enspace\text{and} \enspace|X_{j}|\leq\frac{1}{T}.\]Let \(\mathcal{E}\) be the event that \(\sum_{j=1}^{nT}\mathbb{E}\left[X_{j}^{2}\;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{j-1}\right]> \sigma^{2}:=\frac{e}{e+1}\frac{\ln(2e/\delta)}{T}\). By Freedman's inequality, using \(T\geq(5\ln(2e/\delta)/\epsilon)^{2}\), we have

\[\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\max_{\tau}\left|\sum_{i=\tau}^{n }\eta_{i}\right|\geq\frac{\varepsilon}{2}\right]\] \[\leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{\epsilon^{2}/8}{\sigma^{2}+\frac{\epsilon }{6\sqrt{T}}}\right)+\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]\] \[\leq 2\exp\left(-\frac{\left(\frac{5\ln(2e/\delta)}{\sqrt{T}} \right)^{2}/8}{-\frac{e}{e+1}\frac{\ln(2e/\delta)}{T}+\frac{5\ln(2e/\delta)}{6T \sqrt{T}}}\right)+\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]\] \[=2\exp\Big{(}-\frac{25}{\frac{8e}{e+1}+\frac{40}{6\sqrt{T}}}\ln( \frac{2e}{\delta})\Big{)}+\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]\] \[\leq 2\exp\left(-(1)\ln(\frac{4}{\delta})\right)+\operatorname{ \textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]=\frac{\delta}{2}+\operatorname{\textbf{ Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right].\]

It remains to show that \(\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]\leq\frac{\delta}{2}\). To this end, we observe that for any \(i\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}\) and \(t\in\{1,\ldots,T\}\),

\[\mathbb{E}\left[X_{iT+t}^{2}\;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{iT+t-1}\right]\] \[=\frac{1}{T^{2}}\mathbb{E}\left[\left((V_{n-i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{n-i -1})^{+}-\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{n-i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{n-i-1})^{+}\right]\right)^{2} \;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{iT+t-1}\right]\] \[\leq\frac{1}{T^{2}}\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{n-i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{n-i-1 })^{+}\;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{iT+t-1}\right]\] \[=\frac{1}{T^{3}}\sum_{t^{\prime}=1}^{T}\mathbb{E}\left[\left(V_{n -i}^{(t^{\prime})}-\hat{r}_{n-i-1}\right)^{+}\;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{iT}\right]\] \[=\frac{1}{T^{2}}\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1}\; \middle|\;\hat{r}_{i+1},\ldots,\hat{r}_{n}\right],\]

where the inequality uses \(\mathbb{E}\left[Y\right]\geq\mathbb{E}\left[Y^{2}\right]\geq\mathbb{E}\left[Y ^{2}\right]-(\mathbb{E}\left[Y\right])^{2}=\mathbb{E}\left[(Y-\mathbb{E}[Y])^ {2}\right]\) for any random variable \(Y\) with \(0\leq Y\leq 1\) almost surely. In total, we have

\[\sum_{j=1}^{nT}\mathbb{E}\left[X_{j}^{2}\;\middle|\;X_{1},\ldots,X_{j-1}\right] \leq\frac{1}{T}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1}\; \middle|\;\hat{r}_{i+1},\ldots,\hat{r}_{n}\right]\enspace.\]

As \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}(\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})=\hat{r}_{1}\leq 1\) almost surely, we have by Lemma 5 (see below) that

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1}\;\middle|\;\hat{r}_{i+ 1},\ldots,\hat{r}_{n}\right]\geq\frac{e}{e-1}\ln\left(\frac{2e}{\delta}\right)\]

with probability at most \(\frac{\delta}{2}\). Therefore, we have

\[\operatorname{\textbf{Pr}}\left[\mathcal{E}\right]\leq\operatorname{\textbf{ Pr}}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1}\; \middle|\;\hat{r}_{i+1},\ldots,\hat{r}_{n}\right]\geq\frac{e}{e-1}\ln\left( \frac{2e}{\delta}\right)\right]\leq\frac{\delta}{2}\enspace.\qed\]

**Lemma 5**.: _Let \(Y_{1},Y_{2},\ldots,Y_{n}\) be a sequence of (not necessarily independent) random variables in \([0,1]\) such that \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}\leq 1\) almost surely. Then, for any \(\delta>0\), with probability at most \(\delta\), we have_

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}\;\middle|\;Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]\geq \frac{e}{e-1}\ln\left(\frac{e}{\delta}\right)\enspace.\]

We defer the proof of Lemma 5 to the appendix.

### Negative Result for Revenue: Proof of Theorem 2

Each buyer \(i=1,\ldots,n\) has a marginal value distribution that could be \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) ("High") or \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\) ("Low"):

\[D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}&\text{w.p. }\frac{1}{2n}\\ \frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}&\text{w.p. }\frac{1}{2n}-16\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\\ 0&\text{w.p. }1-\frac{1}{n}+16\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\end{cases}\qquad\qquad D_{i}^{ \mathrm{L}}=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}&\text{w.p. }\frac{1}{2n}-8\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\\ \frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}&\text{w.p. }\frac{1}{2n}+8\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\\ 0&\text{w.p. }1-\frac{1}{n}\end{cases}\]

which are valid distributions as long as \(\varepsilon\leq 1/32\) and \(n\geq 2\). All \(2^{n}\) configurations of whether each buyer has the High or Low distribution are possible.

Optimal policyFix any configuration of whether each buyer has the High or Low distribution. Let \(r_{i}^{*}\) denote the expected revenue to be earned under the optimal dynamic program, if buyer \(i\) is about to arrive and the item is not yet sold. We show inductively that \(r_{i}^{*}=\frac{n+1-i}{4n}\). By definition \(r_{i+1}^{*}=0\), establishing \(r_{i}^{*}=\frac{n+1-i}{4n}\) for \(i=n+1\). Now consider \(i=n,\ldots,1\), and assume \(r_{i+1}^{*}=\frac{n-i}{4n}\). Note that it is better to offer one of the prices \(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\) or \(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\) than to reject the buyer by offering a price of 1, because both of these prices are greater than \(r_{i}^{*}\) (by the induction hypothesis). Thus, if buyer \(i\) has distribution \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\), then

\[\begin{array}{l}r_{i}^{*}=\max\left\{(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n})\frac{1}{2 n}+r_{i+1}^{*}(1-\frac{1}{2n}),(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n})(\frac{1}{n}-16 \frac{\varepsilon}{n})+r_{i+1}^{*}(1-\frac{1}{n}+16\frac{\varepsilon}{n}) \right\}\\ \quad=\max\left\{\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{2n},\frac{1}{4}\frac{1}{n}(\frac{1 }{n}-16\frac{\varepsilon}{n})\right\}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\quad=\quad\frac{n+1-i}{4 n}.\end{array}\]

Similarly, if buyer \(i\) instead has \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\), then

\[r_{i}^{*}=\max\left\{\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2n}-8\frac{\varepsilon}{n}),\frac{1 }{4}\cdot\frac{1}{n}\right\}+\frac{n-i}{4n}=\frac{n+1-i}{4n}.\]

In either case, we have \(r_{i}^{*}=\frac{n+1-i}{4n}\), completing the induction. Note that \(r_{1}^{*}=1/4\).

Bounding a policy's objective by its number of mistakesNow, consider an arbitrary policy \(\pi=(\pi_{1},\ldots,\pi_{n})\) decided by the learning algorithm. Let \(r_{i}\) denote its expected revenue earned if buyer \(i\) is about to arrive and the item is not yet sold (under the true configuration of buyer distributions). We can without loss assume \(\pi\) to lie in \(\{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n},\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\}^{n}\), because both prices are higher than \(r_{i+1}\), the expected revenue from rejecting (both prices are in fact higher than \(r_{i+1}^{*}\), an upper bound on \(r_{i+1}\)). We say that the policy _makes a mistake_ for buyer \(i\) if either \(\pi_{i}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\) when \(i\) has the High distribution, or \(\pi_{i}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}\) when \(i\) has the Low distribution. If the policy makes a mistake for \(i\), then we have

\[\begin{array}{l}r_{i}-r_{i+1}\leq\max\left\{(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{ i+1})(\frac{1}{n}-16\frac{\varepsilon}{n}),(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1})( \frac{1}{2n}-8\frac{\varepsilon}{n})\right\}\\ \quad=\frac{1}{4n}-4\frac{\varepsilon}{n}+(\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1})(\frac{1}{n }-16\frac{\varepsilon}{n});\end{array}\]

on the other hand, if the policy does not make a mistake for \(i\), then we have

\[r_{i}-r_{i+1}\leq\max\left\{(\frac{1}{2}+\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1})\frac{1}{2n}, (\frac{1}{4}+\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1})\frac{1}{n}\right\}=\frac{1}{4n}+(\frac{n- i}{4n}-r_{i+1})\frac{1}{n}.\]

Hence, if the policy makes \(M\) mistakes for some \(M\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\), then

\[r_{1}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(r_{i}-r_{i+1})\leq\frac{1}{4}-M\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}+ \sum_{i=1}^{n}(\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1})\frac{1}{n}.\]

Now, observe that \(\frac{n-i}{4n}-r_{i+1}=r_{i+1}^{*}-r_{i+1}\leq\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}\min\{n-i,M\}\), because the loss from making a mistake is at most \(4\frac{\varepsilon}{n}\), and starting from buyer \(i+1\), the number of mistakes can be at most \(n-(i+1)+1=n-i\) and also at most \(M\). Therefore,

\[\begin{array}{l}r_{1}\leq\frac{1}{4}-M\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}+\left((n-M) \frac{4\varepsilon}{n}M+\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}(M-1)+\cdots+\frac{4\varepsilon} {n}\right)\frac{1}{n}\\ \quad=\frac{1}{4}-M\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}(1-\frac{n-M}{n}-\frac{M-1}{2n})\ =\ \frac{1}{4}-2 \varepsilon\frac{M}{n}(\frac{M+1}{n}).\end{array}\]

Recalling that \(r_{1}^{*}=1/4\), this shows the additive error is \(\Omega(\varepsilon)\) as long as the fraction of mistakes \(M/n\) is a constant.

Computing the Hellinger distanceWe first analyze the Hellinger distance \(H(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}},D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}})\) between (a single observation of) \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) vs. \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\), which we note does not depend on the buyer \(i\). The squared Hellinger distance can be bounded using \(1-H^{2}(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}},D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}})\)

\[\begin{array}{l}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2n}(\frac{1}{2n}-8\frac{\varepsilon}{n})}+ \sqrt{(\frac{1}{2n}+8\frac{\varepsilon}{n}-24\frac{\varepsilon}{n})(\frac{1}{ 2n}+8\frac{\varepsilon}{n})}+\sqrt{(1-\frac{1}{n}+16\frac{\varepsilon}{n})(1- \frac{1}{n})}\\ \quad\geq\left(\frac{1}{2n}-\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}-\frac{(8\frac{\varepsilon}{ n})^{2}}{\frac{1}{2n}}\right)+\left(\frac{1}{2n}-\frac{4\varepsilon}{n}-\frac{( \frac{24\varepsilon}{n})^{2}}{\frac{1}{2n}+\frac{1\varepsilon}{n}}\right)+ \left(1-\frac{1}{n}+\frac{8\varepsilon}{n}-\frac{(\frac{16\varepsilon}{n})^{2}}{ \frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{n}}}\right)=1-O(\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{n}),\end{array}\]

where the inequality applies Lemma 6 below to each square root. This shows that \(H^{2}(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}},D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}})=O(\frac{\varepsilon^{2}}{n})\), and the squared Hellinger distance is additive across independent samples. Using the fact that the Total Variation distance is upper-bounded by \(\sqrt{2}\) times the Hellinger distance [1], we see that the Total Variation distance between \(T\) independent samples of \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) vs. \(T\) independent samples of \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\) is \(O(\sqrt{\frac{T}{n}}\varepsilon)\). The proof of Lemma 6 is deferred because it is elementary.

**Lemma 6**.: _Suppose \(C\in(0,1)\) and \(x\in[-\frac{3}{4}C,\frac{3}{4}C]\). Then \(\sqrt{C(C+x)}\geq C+\frac{x}{2}-\frac{x^{2}}{C}\)._Completing the proof of Theorem 2Suppose the distribution of each buyer is equally likely to be High or Low, independently across buyers. Fix any learning algorithm and the constant probability \(1/2\). By the computation of Hellinger distance above, if the number of samples \(T\) is less than \(C\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}}\) for some constant \(C\), then for any buyer \(i\), the Total Variation distance between the samples observed under \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) vs. \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\) is at most 1/2. (\(C\) depends on the choice of constant 1/2.) This means that w.p. at least \(1-1/2\), the price \(\pi_{i}\) decided by the learning algorithm cannot depend on whether buyer \(i\) had distribution \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) vs. \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\), which means that there exists an adversarial choice of \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) or \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\) for each buyer \(i\) under which the probability of making a mistake for buyer \(i\) is at least \((1-1/2)/2=1/4\).

Let \(M\) denote the (random) number of mistakes, under this adversarial configuration of whether each buyer \(i\) has distribution \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{H}}\) or \(D_{i}^{\mathrm{L}}\). We have that \(\mathbb{E}[\frac{M}{n}]\geq 1/4\). Although whether the algorithm makes a mistake could be arbitrarily correlated across buyers \(i\), applying \(\frac{M}{n}\leq 1\), we can employ Markov's inequality on the random variable \(1-\frac{M}{n}\) to see that

\[\mathbb{P}\left[(1-\frac{M}{n})\geq 7/8\right]\leq\tfrac{3/4}{7/8}=\tfrac{6}{7}.\]

The LHS equals \(\mathbb{P}[\frac{M}{n}\leq\frac{1}{8}]=1-\mathbb{P}[\frac{M}{n}>\frac{1}{8}]\), and hence \(\frac{1}{7}\leq\mathbb{P}[\frac{M}{n}>\frac{1}{8}]\). We have shown that unless \(T=\Omega(\frac{n}{\varepsilon^{2}})\), there is probability at least 1/7 of making a constant fraction of mistakes, in which case we showed above that the additive error would be \(\Omega(\varepsilon)\). This completes the proof of Theorem 2.

## 3 Correlated Distributions

In this section we prove our upper bound on the sample complexity of welfare/revenue maximization for correlated buyer distributions. We show nearly matching lower bounds in Appendix A.5.

### Positive Result for Welfare and Revenue: Proof of Theorem 4

To bound the sample complexity of posted pricing for correlated distributions, it suffices to bound the pseudo-dimension of the policy class \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\). We use the same approach for both the welfare and revenue objectives. By standard learning theory results [1], bounds on the pseudo-dimension translate to bounds on the sample complexity as follows.

**Theorem 6**.: _Let \(\mathrm{PDim}(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}})\) denote the pseudo-dimension of \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\). For any \(\epsilon>0\), any \(\delta\in(0,1)\) and any distribution \(\mathbf{D}\) over \([0,1]^{n}\), \(T=O(\frac{1}{\epsilon^{2}}(\mathrm{PDim}(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}})+\log\frac{1}{ \delta}))\) samples are sufficient to ensure that with probability at least \(1-\delta\) over the draw of samples \((\mathbf{v}_{1},\dots,\mathbf{v}_{T})\sim\mathbf{D}^{T}\), for all \(\pi\in\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\),_

\[\left|\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\pi(\mathbf{v}_{t})-\pi(\mathbf{D})\right| \leq\epsilon.\]

We will show that \(\mathrm{PDim}(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}})=O(k\log k)\), where \(k=|\mathcal{S}|+1\). This together with the above theorem immediately implies that Theorem 4 holds for the sample average approximation algorithm.

Let \(\mathcal{S}=\{i_{1},i_{2},i_{3},\dots,i_{k-1}\}\), where \(1<i_{1}<i_{2}<\dots<i_{k-1}\). For each \(j=1,2,\dots,k\), let \(I_{j}=\{i_{j-1},\dots,i_{j}-1\}\), with the convention that \(i_{0}=1\) and \(i_{k}=n+1\). In other words, \(I_{1},I_{2},\dots,I_{k}\) are consecutive intervals that partition \([n]\), and \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) is the class of policies that offers every customer in \(I_{j}\) the same price. Note that every policy \(\pi\in\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) can be parameterized by \(k\) prices \(\rho=(\rho_{1},\rho_{2},\dots,\rho_{k})\), where \(\rho_{j}\) is the price offered to customers in \(I_{j}\). In the rest of this proof, we will use \(\pi_{\rho}\) to denote the policy in \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) parameterized by \(\rho\).

By the definition of pseudo-dimension,

\[\mathrm{PDim}(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}})=\mathrm{VCdim}(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}),\] (2)

where \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}:=\{(\mathbf{v},z)\mapsto\mathds{1}\{\pi_{\rho}( \mathbf{v})\geq z\}:\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}\}\). Let \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\) denote the dual class of \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}\), so

\[\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}:=\left\{\rho\mapsto\mathds{1}\{\pi_{\rho}( \mathbf{v})\geq z\}:\mathbf{v}\in[0,1]^{n},z\in\mathbb{R}\right\}.\]

We will use a result from [1] to bound the VC dimension of \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}\). We state this result below in Definition 1 and Theorem 7. This result essentially says that the pseudo-dimension of the primal class is bounded if the dual class is well-structured. Here, "well-structured" essentially means that the domain can be partitioned into pieces defined by a small number of boundary functions, and the function is simple on each piece.

**Definition 1** (Definition 3.2 in [1]).: _A function class \(\mathcal{H}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{Y}}\) that maps a domain \(\mathcal{Y}\) to \(\mathbb{R}\) is \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable for a class \(\mathcal{G}\subseteq\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{Y}}\) of boundary functions and a class \(\mathcal{F}\subset\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{Y}}\) of piece functions if the following holds: for every \(h\in\mathcal{H}\), there are \(l\) boundary functions \(g^{(1)},\dots,g^{(l)}\in\mathcal{G}\) and a piece function \(f_{b}\in\mathcal{F}\) for each bit vector \(b\in\{0,1\}^{l}\) such that for all \(y\in\mathcal{Y},h(y)=f_{b_{y}}(y)\) where \(b_{y}=(g^{(1)}(y),\dots,g^{(l)}(y))\in\{0,1\}^{l}\)._

The main theorem in [1] states that if the dual class is \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable, then the pseudo-dimension of the primal class is bounded.

**Theorem 7** (Theorem 3.3 in [1]).: _Suppose that the dual function class \(\mathcal{U}^{*}\) is \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable with boundary functions \(\mathcal{G}\subseteq\{0,1\}^{\mathcal{U}}\) and piece functions \(\mathcal{F}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{\mathcal{U}}\). The pseudo-dimension of \(\mathcal{U}\) is bounded as follows:_

\[\mathrm{PDim}(\mathcal{U})=O((\mathrm{PDim}(\mathcal{F}^{*})+\mathrm{VCdim}( \mathcal{G}^{*}))\ln(\mathrm{PDim}(\mathcal{F}^{*})+\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{G }^{*}))+\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{G}^{*})\ln l).\]

We now apply Theorem 7 to bound the VC dimension of \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}\).5 To do so we must show that the dual class \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\) is \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable for "nice" classes \(\mathcal{F}\) and \(\mathcal{G}\). We will show that for both the welfare and revenue objectives, we can take \(\mathcal{F}\) to be the family of constant functions and \(\mathcal{G}\) to be the family of axis-aligned halfspaces. This will follow from the below lemma, whose proof is deferred to the Appendix for space reasons.

Footnote 5: Note Theorem 7 is stated to bound the pseudo-dimension, but the pseudo-dimension coincides with the VC dimension for function classes consisting of \(\{0,1\}\)-valued functions.

**Lemma 7**.: _Let \(\mathbf{v}\in[0,1]^{n}\) and let \(z\in\mathbb{R}\). Let \(G(\mathbf{v},z)=\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:\pi_{\rho}(\mathbf{v})\geq z\}\). For both the welfare and revenue objectives, there are \(l_{1},u_{1},\cdots,l_{k},u_{k}\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}\) such that_

\[G(\mathbf{v},z)=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}\left(u_{1},\infty\right)\times\cdots\times \left(u_{j-1},\infty\right)\times\left(l_{j},u_{j}\right]\times\mathbb{R}^{k-j}.\] (3)

**Corollary 1**.: \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\) _is \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable, where \(\mathcal{F}\) is the set of constant functions, \(\mathcal{G}\) is the set of axis-aligned halfspaces, and \(l=2(|\mathcal{S}|+1)\)._

Proof.: Consider a function \(h\in\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\). By definition of \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\), there exist \(\mathbf{v}\in[0,1]^{n}\) and \(z\in\mathbb{R}\) such that \(h(\rho)=\mathds{1}\{\pi_{\rho}(\mathbf{v})\geq z\}\). By Lemma 7, there are \(l_{1},u_{1},\ldots,l_{k},u_{k}\) such that

\[\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:h(\rho)=1\}=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}\left(u_{1},\infty \right)\times\cdots\times\left(u_{j-1},\infty\right)\times\left(l_{j},u_{j} \right]\times\mathbb{R}^{k-j}.\]

For each \(j\in[k]\), let \(L_{j}=\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:\rho_{j}>l_{j}\}\) and \(U_{j}=\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:\rho_{j}\leq u_{j}\}\). Note that \(L_{j}\) and \(U_{j}\) are axis-aligned halfspaces, and

\[\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:h(\rho)=1\}=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}\bar{U}_{1}\cap\bar{U}_ {2}\cap\cdots\cap\bar{U}_{j-1}\cap L_{j}\cap U_{j}.\]

Therefore, in the definition of \((\mathcal{F},\mathcal{G},l)\)-piecewise decomposable, we may take the boundary functions to be the \(2k\) functions corresponding to the halfspaces \(L_{1},U_{1},\ldots,L_{k},U_{k}\). On any given piece defined by these boundary functions, \(h\) is a constant function (equal to either 0 or 1). 

For \(\mathcal{F}\) the set of constant functions and \(\mathcal{G}\) the set of axis-aligned halfspaces in \(\mathbb{R}^{k}\), it is easy to check that \(\mathrm{PDim}(\mathcal{F}^{*})=0\) and \(\mathrm{VCdim}(\mathcal{G}^{*})=k\). Combining Corollary 1 with Theorem 7, we get that

\[\mathrm{VCdim}(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}})=O\left(k\ln k+k\ln 2k\right)=O(k \ln k).\]

This completes the proof of Theorem 4.

**Remark**.: If we directly apply Theorem 7 from [1] to bound \(\mathrm{PDim}(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}})\), then we would get

* A \(O(k\ln k)\) pseudo-dimension bound for the revenue objective;
* A \(O(k\ln(kn))\) pseudo-dimension bound for welfare objective.

In particular, the bound for welfare would grow with \(n\). This dependence on \(n\) is in fact unavoidable if one works with \(\Pi_{\mathcal{S}}\) directly, because for instances like \(\mathbf{v}=(\frac{1}{n},\frac{2}{n},\ldots,1)\), the dual function corresponding to \(\mathbf{v}\) is piecewise constant with \(\Theta(n)\) pieces, even if \(k=1\). This is why our Corollary 1 focuses on the indicator functions \(\widetilde{\Pi}_{\mathcal{S}}^{*}\) instead. Regardless, both the bounds for welfare and revenue require our Lemma 7 that analyzes the problem-specific structure of the "good sets".

Appendix

### Proof of Lemma 2

Proof.: Now, consider the smallest \(j\) so that \(\hat{r}_{j}\geq r_{j}^{*}\). Again, we know such a \(j\) exists because \(0=\hat{r}_{n+1}\geq r_{n+1}^{*}=0\). We claim that that \(\hat{r}_{1}\geq r_{1}^{*}+\min\{\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\eta_{i},0\}\).

Observe that there is nothing to be shown if \(j=1\) because then \(\hat{r}_{1}\geq r_{1}^{*}\). So, let's consider the case that \(j>1\). We can now write \(\hat{r}_{1}\) as a telescoping sum

\[\hat{r}_{1}=\hat{r}_{j-1}+\sum_{i=1}^{j-2}(\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})\enspace.\] (4)

Since \(\hat{r}_{j}\geq r_{j}^{*}\), we have

\[\hat{r}_{j-1} =\hat{r}_{j}+\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{j-1}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{j} )^{+}\;=\;\hat{r}_{j}+\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{j-1}-\hat{r}_{j})^{+}\right]+\eta_{ j-1}\] \[=\mathbb{E}\left[\max\{V_{j-1},\hat{r}_{j}\}\right]+\eta_{j-1}\; \geq\;\mathbb{E}\left[\max\{V_{j-1},r_{j}^{*}\}\right]+\eta_{j-1}\;=\;r_{j-1}^ {*}+\eta_{j-1}\enspace.\]

Observe that for \(i+1<j\), we have \(\hat{r}_{i+1}<r_{i+1}^{*}\). Therefore

\[\hat{r}_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1}=\tfrac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}(V_{i}^{(t)}-\hat{r}_{i+1} )^{+}=\mathbb{E}\left[(V_{i}-\hat{r}_{i+1})^{+}\right]+\eta_{i}\geq\mathbb{E} \left[(V_{i}-r_{i+1}^{*})^{+}\right]+\eta_{i}=r_{i}^{*}-r_{i+1}^{*}+\eta_{i}\enspace.\]

So, in combination with (4),

\[\hat{r}_{1}\geq r_{j-1}^{*}+\eta_{j-1}+\sum_{i=1}^{j-2}(r_{i}^{*}-r_{i+1}^{*}+ \eta_{i})=r_{1}^{*}+\sum_{i=1}^{j-1}\eta_{i}\enspace.\qed\]

### Proof of Lemma 5

Ignoring constants, a slick proof of this lemma is via another application of Freedman's inequality, where we define a martingale \(X_{i}=Y_{i}-\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}]\), and cut this martingale (stop) whenever the sum of conditional variances exceeds \(\log(1/\delta)\). This bounds the sum of conditional variances by \(\log(1/\delta)\), i.e. \(W_{\tau}\leq\sigma^{2}:=\log(1/\delta)\) w.p. 1. Since the lemma is upper-bounding the probability of the event that \(\sum_{i}X_{i}>\log(1/\delta)\), we can show that this probability is \(O(\delta)\) by substituting \(\ell=\log(1/\delta)\) into Freedman's inequality.

Below we give another, elementary proof of this lemma.

Proof.: Let \(Z=1\) if \(\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]\geq\frac {e}{e-1}\ln\left(\frac{e}{\delta}\right)\). By Markov's inequality, we have

\[\textbf{Pr}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}\leq 1\text{ and }Z=1\right]=\textbf{Pr}\left[Ze^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}}\geq e ^{-1}\right]\leq\mathbb{E}\left[Ze^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}}\right]\cdot e\]

Now, we have

\[\mathbb{E}\left[Ze^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[Z\prod_{i=1}^ {n}e^{-Y_{i}}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}\left[Z\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n} \right]\prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E}\left[e^{-Y_{i}}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1} \right]\right]\]

For every single conditional expectation, we obtain by convexity

\[\mathbb{E}\left[e^{-Y_{i}}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right] \leq\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}e^{-1}+(1-Y_{i})\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]\] \[=\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}(e^{-1}-1)\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]+1\] \[\leq\exp\left(\mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1} \right](e^{-1}-1)\right)\enspace.\]

Now, consider a fixed realization of \(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\). This realization fully determines \(Z\). If \(Z=0\), then

\[\mathbb{E}\left[Z\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\right]\prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E} \left[e^{-Y_{i}}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]=0\enspace.\]

Otherwise, with \(Z=1\), we have

\[\mathbb{E}\left[Z\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\right]\prod_{i=1}^{n}\mathbb{E} \left[e^{-Y_{i}}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]\leq\exp\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}\left[Y_{i}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right](e^{-1}-1)\right)\leq \frac{\delta}{e}\enspace.\]So, we have an upper bound of \(\frac{\delta}{e}\) regardless of the realization. Taking an expectation, we get

\[\mathbb{E}\left[\mathbb{E}\left[Z\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n}\right]\prod_{i=1}^{n} \mathbb{E}\left[e^{-Y_{i}}\mid Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{i-1}\right]\right]\leq\frac{ \delta}{e},\]

which implies \(\textbf{Pr}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}\leq 1\text{ and }Z=1\right]\leq\mathbb{E}\left[Ze^{-\sum_{i=1}^{n}Y_{i}}\right] \cdot e\leq\frac{\delta}{e}e=\delta\), completing the proof. 

### Proof of Lemma 6.

Proof.: Let \(f(x)=\sqrt{C(C+x)}=(C^{2}+Cx)^{1/2}\), which is a continuous function over \(x\in[-\frac{3}{4}C,\frac{3}{4}C]\). We have \(f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{2}(C^{2}+Cx)^{-1/2}C\) and \(f^{\prime\prime}(x)=-\frac{1}{4}(C^{2}+Cx)^{-3/2}C^{2}\), both of which exist over \(x\in[-\frac{3}{4}C,\frac{3}{4}C]\). Applying Taylor's theorem around 0, we get

\[f(x)=f(0)+f^{\prime}(0)x+\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(y)}{2}x^{2} =C+\frac{1}{2}x-\frac{1}{8}(C^{2}+Cy)^{-3/2}C^{2}x^{2}\] \[\geq C+\tfrac{x}{2}-\tfrac{1}{8}(C^{2}+C(-\tfrac{3}{4}C))^{-3/2}C^ {2}x^{2}\ =C+\tfrac{x}{2}-\tfrac{x^{2}}{C},\]

where \(y\) lies between \(0\) and \(x\) and the inequality holds because \(y\geq-\frac{3}{4}C\), completing the proof. 

### Proof of Lemma 7

If \(z\leq 0\) then \(G(\mathbf{v},z)=\mathbb{R}^{k}\), so we may take any values of \(l_{1},u_{1},\ldots,l_{k},u_{k}\) such that \(l_{1}=l_{2}=\cdots=l_{k}-\infty\) and \(u_{k}=\infty\).

For the rest of the proof, assume \(z>0\). First, consider the welfare objective. We show the lemma holds for \(l_{j}\) and \(u_{j}\) as follows:

Define \(l_{j}\) to be \(-\infty\) if \(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})_{1}\geq z\), and otherwise to be \(\max\{\mathbf{v}(I_{j})_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{v}(I_{j})_{m-1}\}\), where \(m\) is the smallest index such that \(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})_{m}\geq z\). (If \(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})_{m}<z\) for all \(m\), set \(l_{j}=\max(\mathbf{v}(I_{j}))\).)

Define \(u_{j}\) to be \(\max(\mathbf{v}(I_{j}))\).

Let \(G=\{\rho\in\mathbb{R}^{k}:\pi_{\rho}(\mathbf{v})\geq z\}\) and \(G^{\prime}=\bigcup_{j=1}^{k}(u_{1},\infty)\times\cdots\times(u_{j-1},\infty) \times(l_{j},u_{j}]\times\mathbb{R}^{k-j}\). To show that \(G=G^{\prime}\), we'll show \(G\subseteq G^{\prime}\) and \(G^{\prime}\subseteq G\).

Case 1 (\(G\subseteq G^{\prime}\)). If \(G=\emptyset\) we are done, so assume otherwise. Let \(\rho\in G\). Let \(j\) be the interval such that the algorithm (using thresholds \(\rho\)) accepts a value in \(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})\). Since a value in interval \(j\) was accepted, \(\rho_{j}\leq\max(\mathbf{v}(I_{j}))=u_{j}\). Also, since no value in the previous intervals were accepted, \(\rho_{i}>u_{i}\) for all \(i<j\). Finally, we must have \(\rho_{j}>l_{j}\), since otherwise the accepted value will be less than \(z\). Thus \(\rho\in G^{\prime}\).

Case 2 (\(G^{\prime}\subseteq G\)). Let \(\rho\in G^{\prime}\). Then \(\rho\in(u_{1},\infty)\times\cdots\times(u_{j-1},\infty)\times(l_{j},u_{j}] \times\mathbb{R}^{k-j}\) for some \(j\). Since \(\rho_{i}>u_{i}\) for all \(i<j\), the algorithm using thresholds \(\rho\) does not accept any value in the intervals \(i<j\). Since \(\rho_{j}\in(l_{j},u_{j}]\), the definitions of \(l_{j}\) and \(u_{j}\) imply that a value in \(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})\) is accepted, and this value is greater than or equal to \(z\). Thus \(\rho\in G\).

For revenue, the only difference is that we define \(l_{j}\) to be \(\min(z,\max(\mathbf{v}(I_{j})))\). (\(u_{j}\) is still defined to be \(\max(\mathbf{v}(I_{j}))\).) With these definitions of \(l_{j}\) and \(u_{j}\), a very similar analysis shows that \(G=G^{\prime}\) in the revenue case as well.

### Proof of Theorem 5

We let \(\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\subseteq\{1\}\cup\mathcal{S}\) be a subset of decision points such that price \(\pi_{i}\) can be freely chosen for all \(i\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\). For welfare maximization we require \(i+1\in\{1,\ldots,n\}\setminus\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\) for all \(i\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\), which can achieved while ensuring \(|\mathcal{S}^{\prime}|\geq\lfloor\frac{1+|\mathcal{S}|}{2}\rfloor\). Each decision point \(i\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\) has marginal value distribution(s) that could be "High" or "Low", separately for each decision point (i.e., all \(2^{|\mathcal{S}^{\prime}|}\) combinations are possible). For welfare maximization, they are defined as

* High: \(V_{i}=1/2\) with probability (w.p.) 1, \(V_{i+1}=1\) w.p. \(1/2+\varepsilon\), \(V_{i+1}=0\) w.p. \(1/2-\varepsilon\);
* Low: \(V_{i}=1/2\) w.p. 1, \(V_{i+1}=1\) w.p. \(1/2-\varepsilon\), \(V_{i+1}=0\) w.p. \(1/2+\varepsilon\).

For revenue maximization, they are defined as

* High: \(V_{i}=1\) w.p. \(1/2+\varepsilon\), \(V_{i}=1/2\) w.p. \(1/2-\varepsilon\);
* Low: \(V_{i}=1\) w.p. \(1/2-\varepsilon\), \(V_{i}=1/2\) w.p. \(1/2+\varepsilon\).

The overall distribution over trajectories \(\mathbf{V}\) is then correlated as follows. First, a decision point \(\tilde{i}\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\) is drawn uniformly at random. Then, \(V_{\tilde{i}}\) (as well as \(V_{\tilde{i}+1}\) in the case of welfare maximization) is drawn according to the distributions above, depending on whether decision point \(\tilde{i}\) is High or Low. All other buyer values are 0 on this trajectory.

Given this, only the prices for decision point \(\tilde{i}\) are relevant, which can without loss be restricted to \(\{1/2,1\}\). The policy should optimize \(\pi_{i}\) for each \(i\in\mathcal{S}^{\prime}\) as if \(\tilde{i}=i\). For either welfare or revenue maximization, the constructions above can be checked to satisfy the following properties:

1. Setting \(\pi_{i}\) (and \(\pi_{i+1}\) in the case of welfare maximization) to 1 is optimal for High and earns objective \(1/2+\varepsilon\) in expectation; setting to 1/2 is optimal for Low and earns objective \(1/2\);
2. Setting the wrong price earns expected objective 1/2 for High and \(1/2-\varepsilon\) for Low, incurring a loss of \(\varepsilon\) compared to optimal in both cases.
3. The High and Low distributions have the same support and probabilities that differ by \(2\varepsilon\).

We note that for welfare maximization, it does not matter whether \(\pi_{i+1}\in\mathcal{S}\), because the decision is on whether to accept buyer \(i\) when \(V_{i}=1/2\).

Finally, a policy has additive error \(\Omega(\varepsilon)\) as long as it has constant probability of setting the wrong price for a decision point. Due to property 3. above, the policy needs \(\Omega(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) relevant observations for a given decision point to avoid setting the wrong price for it with constant probability. However, each sample contains a relevant observation for a given decision point only with probability \(1/|\mathcal{S}^{\prime}|\), so \(\Omega(\frac{|\mathcal{S}^{\prime}|}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) samples are necessary for the number of relevant observations to be \(\Omega(\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}})\) with high probability. Because \(|\mathcal{S}^{\prime}|\geq\lfloor\frac{1+|\mathcal{S}|}{2}\rfloor\), this completes the proof of Theorem 5.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and the introduction clearly reflect our contributions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss in the related work section topics that are not in this paper's scope. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We clearly state all the assumptions needed for our theorems, and all the proofs are either in the body or the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not contain experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not contain experiments. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not contain experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not contain experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not contain experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research in this paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: There is no societal impact of the work performed. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not use existing assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
