###### Abstract

In this paper, we present Language Model as Visual Explainer (LVX), a systematic approach for interpreting the internal workings of vision models using a tree-structured linguistic explanation, without the need for model training. Central to our strategy is the collaboration between vision models and LLM to craft explanations. On one hand, the LLM is harnessed to delineate hierarchical visual attributes, while concurrently, a text-to-image API retrieves images that are most aligned with these textual concepts. By mapping the collected texts and images to the vision model's embedding space, we construct a hierarchy-structured visual embedding tree. This tree is dynamically pruned and grown by querying the LLM using language templates, tailoring the explanation to the model. Such a scheme allows us to seamlessly incorporate new attributes while eliminating undesired concepts based on the model's representations. When applied to testing samples, our method provides human-understandable explanations in the form of attribute-laden trees. Beyond explanation, we retrained the vision model by calibrating it on the generated concept hierarchy, allowing the model to incorporate the refined knowledge of visual attributes. To access the effectiveness of our approach, we introduce new benchmarks and conduct rigorous evaluations, demonstrating its plausibility, faithfulness, and stability.

## 1 Introduction

Unlocking the secrets of deep neural networks is akin to navigating through an intricate, ever-shifting maze, as the intricate decision flow within the networks is, in many cases, extremely difficult for humans to fully interpret. In this quest, extracting clear, understandable explanations from these perplexing mazes has become an imperative task.

While efforts have been made to explain computer vision models, these approaches often fall short of providing direct and human-understandable explanations. Standard techniques, such as attribution methods [46, 55, 90, 68, 1, 62, 65, 64], mechanical interpretability [22] and prototype analysis [10, 49], only highlight certain pixels or features that are deemed important by the model. As such, these methods often require the involvement of experts to verify or interpret the outputs for non-technical users. Natural language explanations [27, 7, 41, 35], on the other hand, present an attractive alternative, since the produced texts are better aligned with human understanding. Nevertheless, these approaches typically rely on labor-intensive and biased manual annotation of textual rationales for model training.

In this study, we attempt to explain AI decision in a human-understandable manner, for example, tree-structured language. We call this task _visual explanatory tree parsing_. To implement this, we present a systematic approach, Language Model as Visual Explainer (LVX), for interpreting vision models structured natural language, without model training.

A key challenge is that vision models, trained solely on pixel data, inherently lack comprehension of textual concepts within an image. For example, if a model labels an image as a "_dog_", it is unclear whether it truly recognizes the features like the _wet nose_ or _floppy ear_, or if it is merely making ungrounded guesses. To address this challenge, we link the vision model with a powerful external knowledge provider, to establish connections between textual attributes and image patterns. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT and GPT4 as our knowledge providers, combining them with the visual recognition system. Figure 1 (Left) describes a toy case, where the LLM is interacts with the vision model to explore its capability boundaries. By doing so, we gain insights into the what visual attributes can be recognized by the model.

The pipeline of our approach is illustrated in Figure 1, which comprises two main stages, the _construction phase_ and the _test phase_.

In the _construction phase_, our goal is to create an attribute tree for each category, partitioning the feature space of a visual model via LLM-defined hierarchy. We begin by extracting commonsense knowledge about each category and its visual attributes from LLMs using in-context prompting [45]. This information is naturally organized as a tree for better organization and clarity. Utilizing a text-to-image API, we gather corresponding images for each tree node. These images are subsequently inputted into the vision model to extract prototype embeddings, which are then mapped to the tree.

Once created, the tree is dynamically adjusted, based on the properties of the training set. Specifically, each embedding of the training sample is extracted by the vision model.Such embedding then navigates the parse tree based on their proximity to prototype embeddings. Infrequently visited nodes, representing attributes less recognizable, are pruned. Conversely, nodes often visited by the model indicate successful concept recognition. Those nodes are growaned, as the LLM introduces more detailed concepts. Consequently, LVX yields human-understandable attribute trees that mirror the model's understanding of each concept.

In the _test phase_, we input a test sample into the model to extract its feature. The feature is then routed in the parse tree, by finding its nearest neighbors. The root-to-leaf path serves as a sample-specific rationale for the model, offering an explanation of how the model arrived at its decision.

To assess our method, we compiled new annotations and developed novel metrics. Subsequently, we test LVX on these self-collected real-world datasets to access its effectiveness.

Beyond interpretation, our study proposes to calibrate the vision model by utilizing the generated explanation results. The utilization of tree-structured explanations plays a key role in enhancing the model's performance, thereby facilitating more reliable and informed decision-making processes. Experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method over existing interpretability techniques, highlighting its potential for advancing explainable AI.

To summarize, our main contributions are:

## 2 Problem Definition

We first define our specialized task, called **visual explanatory tree parsing**, which seeks to unravel the decision-making process of a vision model through a tree.

Let us consider the trained vision model \(f\), defined as a function \(f\colon\mathcal{X}\to\mathcal{Y}\), where \(\mathcal{X}\) represents the input image space and \(\mathcal{Y}\) denotes the output label space. In this study, our focus lies on the classification task, where \(f=g\circ h\) is decomposed into a feature extractor \(g\) and a linear classification head \(h\). The output space is \(\mathcal{Y}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\), where \(n\) signifies the number of classes. The model is trained on a labeled training set \(D_{tr}=\{\mathbf{x}_{j},y_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}\), and would be evaluated a test set \(D_{ts}=\{\mathbf{x}_{j}\}_{j=1}^{L}\).

The ultimate objective of our problem is to generate an explanation \(T\) for each model-input pair \((f,\mathbf{x})\) on the test set, illuminating the reasoning behind the model's prediction \(\hat{y}=f(\mathbf{x})\). This unique explanation manifests as a tree of attributes, denoted as \(T=(V,E)\), comprising a set of \(N_{v}\) nodes \(V=\{v_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{v}}\) and \(N_{e}\) edges \(E=\{e_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{e}}\). The root of the tree is the predicted category, \(\hat{y}\), while each node \(v_{i}\) encapsulates a specific attribute description of the object. These attributes are meticulously organized, progressing from the holistic to the granular, and from the general to the specific. Figure 2 provides an example of the parse tree.

Unlike existing approaches [53; 3] that explaining visual-language models [48; 47; 51; 86; 93], we address the more challenging scenario, on explaining vision models trained solely on pixel data. While some models can dissect and explain hierarchical clustering of feature embeddings [67; 77], they lack the ability to associate each node with a textual attribute. It is important to note that our explanations primarily focus on examining the properties of the established network, going beyond training vision model or visual-language model [2; 44] for reasoning hierarchy [20] and attributes [31] from the image. In other words, visual-language model, that tells the content in the image, can not explain the inner working inside another model. Notably, our approach achieves this objective _without supervision_ and in _open-vocabulary_ manner, without predefined explanations for model training.

## 3 Language Model as Visual Explainer

This section dives deeper into the details of LVX. At the heart of our approach is the interaction between the LLM and the vision model to construct the parsing tree. Subsequently, we establish a rule to route through these trees, enabling the creation of coherent text explanations.

### Tree Construction via LLM

Before constructing our trees, let's take a moment to reflect how humans do this task. Typically, we already hold a hierarchy of concepts in our minds. When presented with visual stimuli, we instinctively compare the data to our existing knowledge tree, confirming the presence of distinct traits. We recognize familiar traits and, for unfamiliar ones, we expand our knowledge base. For example, when we think of a dog, we typically know that it has a _furry tail_. Upon observing a dog, we naturally check for the visibility of its tail. If we encounter a _hairless tail_, previously unknown

to us, we incorporate it into our knowledge base, ready to apply it to other dogs. This process is typically termed Predictive Coding Theory [15] in cognitive science.

Our LVX mirrors this methodology. We employ LLM as a "knowledge provider" to construct the initial conceptual tree. Subsequently, we navigate through the visual model's feature space to assess the prevalence of each node. If a specific attribute is rarely observed, we remove the corresponding nodes from the tree. Conversely, if the model consistently recognizes an attribute, we enrich the tree by integrating more nuanced, next-level concepts. This iterative process ensures the refinement and adaptation of the conceptual tree within our pipeline, which gives rise to our LVX.

**Generating Textual Descriptions for Visual Concepts.** We leverage a large language model (LLM) as our "commonsense knowledge provider" [42, 95] to generate textual descriptions of visual attributes corresponding to each category. The LLM acts as an external database, providing a rich source of diverse visual concept descriptions. The process is illustrated in Figure 3.

Formally, assume we have a set of category names, denoted as \(C=\{c_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\), where \(i\) represents the class index. For each of these classes, we prompt an LLM \(L\) to produce visual attribute tree. We represent these attributes as \(d_{i}=L(c_{i},\mathcal{P})\), where \(d_{i}\) is a nested JSON text containing textual descriptions associated with class \(c_{i}\). To help generate \(d_{i}\), we use example input-output pairs, \(\mathcal{P}\), as in-context prompts. The process unfolds in two stages:

* **Initial Attribute Generation**: We initially generate keywords that embody the attributes of each class. This prompt follows a predefined template that instructs the LLM to elaborate on the attributes of a visual object. The template is phrased as (This is a <CLSUNAME> because). The output json contains four primary nodes: Concepts, Substances, Attributes, and Environments. As such, the LLM is prompted to return the attributes of that concept. Note that the initial attributes tree may not accurately represent the model; refinements will be made in the refinement stage.
* **Description Composition**: Next, we guide the LLM to create descriptions based on these attributes. Again we showcase an in-context example and instruct the model to output ("Generates sentences that describe a concept according to each attribute.").

Once the LLM generates the structured attributes \(d_{i}\), we parse them into an initial tree, represented as \(T_{i}^{(0)}=(V_{i}^{(0)},E_{i}^{(0)})\), using the key-value pairs of the json text. Those generated json tree is then utilized to query images corresponding to each factor.

**Visual Embeddings Tree from Retrieved Images.** In order to enable the vision model to understand attributes generated by the LLM, we employ a two-step approach. The primary step involves the conversion of textual descriptions, outputted by the LLM, into images. Then, these images are deployed to investigate the feature region that symbolizes specific attributes within the model.

The transition from linguistic elements to images is facilitated by the use of arbitrary text-to-image API. This instrumental API enables the generation of novel images or retrieval of existing images that bear strong relevance to the corresponding textual descriptions. An initial parse tree node, denoted by

Figure 3: Crafting text-image pairs for visual concepts. Through in-context prompting, we extract knowledge from the LLM, yielding visual attributes for each category. These attributes guide the collection of text-image pairs that encapsulate the essence of each visual concept.

\(v\), containing a textual attribute, is inputted into the API to yield a corresponding set of \(K\) support images, represented as \(\{\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i}\}_{i=1}^{K}=\mathtt{T2I}(v)\). The value of \(K\) is confined to a moderately small range, typically between 5 to 30. The full information of the collected dataset will be introduced in Section 4.

Our research incorporates the use of search engines such as Bing, or text-to-image diffusion models like Stable-Diffusion [56], to derive images that correspond accurately to the provided attributes.

Following this, the images are presented to the visual model to extract their respective embeddings, represented as \(\mathbf{p}_{i}=g(\widetilde{\mathbf{x}}_{i})\). As such, each tree node contains a set of support visual features \(P=\{\mathbf{p}_{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). This procedure allows for the construction of an embedding tree, consisting of paired text and visual features. These pairs are arranged in a tree structure prescribed by the LLM. It is important to note that the collected images are not employed in training the model. Instead, they serve as a support set to assist the model in understanding and representing the disentangled attributes effectively. As such, the visual model uses these embeddings as a map to navigate through the vast feature space, carving out territories of attributes, and laying down the groundwork for further exploration and explanation of a particular input.

**Tree Refinement Via Refine Prompt.** Upon construction, the parse tree structure is refined to better align with the model's feature spaces. This stage, termed _Tree Refinement_, is achieved through passing training data as a query to traverse the tree. Nodes that are seldom visited indicate that the model infrequently recognizes their associated attributes. Therefore, we propose a pruning mechanism that selectively eliminates these attributes, streamlining the tree structure. For nodes that frequently appear during the traversal, we further grow the tree by introducing additional or more detailed attributes, enriching the overall context and depth of the tree. The procedure is demonstrated in Figure 4.

Initially, we treat the original training samples, denoted as \((\mathbf{x}_{j},y_{j})\in D_{tr}\), as our query set. Each sample is passed to the visual model to extract a feature, represented as \(\mathbf{q}_{j}=g(\mathbf{x}_{j})\).

Next, the extracted feature traverses the \(y_{j}\)-corresponding tree. Its aim is to locate the closest semantic neighbors among the tree nodes. We define a distance metric between \(\mathbf{q}_{j}\) to support set \(P\) as the point-to-set distance \(D(\mathbf{q}_{j},P)\). This metric represents the greatest lower bound of the set of distances from \(\mathbf{q}_{j}\) to prototypes in \(P\). It is resilient to outliers and effectively suppresses non-maximum nodes.

\[D(\mathbf{q}_{j},P)=\inf\{d(\mathbf{q}_{j},\mathbf{p})|\mathbf{p}\in P\}\] (1)

In our paper, similar to [10, 58], we set \(d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})=-\log(1+\frac{1}{||\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}||^{2}})\)2. It emphasizes close points while moderating the impact of larger distances. Following this, we employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to locate the tree node closest to the query point \(\mathbf{q}_{j}\). After finding this node, each training point \((\mathbf{x}_{j},y_{j})\) is assigned to a specific node of the tree. Subsequently, we count the number of samples assigned to a particular node \(v^{*}\), using the following formula:

Footnote 2: In practice, we implement \(d(\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})=-\log(\frac{||\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}||^{2}+1}{|| \mathbf{q}-\mathbf{p}||^{2}+\epsilon})\), incorporating \(\epsilon>0\) to ensure numerical stability.

\[C_{v^{*}}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}\mathbbm{1}\{v^{*}=\operatorname*{argmin}_{v\in V_{y_{ j}}^{(0)}}D(\mathbf{q}_{j},P_{v})\}\] (2)

In this formula, \(\mathbbm{1}\) is the indicator function and \(P_{v}\) denotes the support feature for node \(v\). Following this, we rank each node based on the sample counter, which results in two operations to update the tree architecture \(T_{i}^{(\ell+1)}=\mathtt{Grow}(\mathtt{Prune}(T_{i}^{(\ell)}))\), where \(t\) stands as the iteration number

* **Tree Pruning.** Nodes with the least visits are pruned from the tree, along with their child nodes.

Figure 4: Tree refinement by traversing the embedding tree and querying the LLM model.

* **Tree Growing**. For the top-ranked node, we construct a new inquiry to prompt the LLM to generate attributes with finer granularity. The inquiry is constructed with an instruction template "Add visual attributes for the <NodeName> of a <CLassName>, to the json".
* **Common Node Discrimination**. In cases where different categories share common nodes (e.g. "human" and "dog" both have "ear"), we execute a targeted growth step aimed at distinguishing between these shared elements. To achieve this differentiation, we utilize a contrasting question posed to the LLM (The <NodeName> of <CLassName> is different from <CLassName> because").

The revised concept tree generated by the LLM provides a comprehensive and detailed representation of the visual attribute. To refine the attribute further, we employ an iterative procedure that involves image retrieval and the extraction of visual embeddings, as illustrated in Figure 1. This iterative process enhances the parse tree by incorporating new elements. As each new element is introduced, the attribute areas within the feature space become increasingly refined, leading to improved interpretability. In our experiment, we performed five rounds of tree refinement.

### Routing in the Tree

Once the tree is established, the model predicts the class of a new test sample \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) and provides an explanation for this decision by finding the top-k nearest neighbor nodes.

Specifically, the model predicts the category \(\hat{y}\) for the test instance \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) as \(\hat{y}=f(\mathbf{x}^{\prime})\). The extracted image feature \(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\) corresponding to \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) is routed through the tree. Starting from the root, the tree is traversed to select the top-k nearest neighbor nodes \(\{v_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}\) based on the smallest \(D(\mathbf{q}^{\prime},P_{v_{i}})\) values, representing the highest semantic similarity between \(\mathbf{q}^{\prime}\) and the visual features in the tree's nodes. The paths from the root to the selected nodes are merged to construct the explanatory tree \(T\) for the model's prediction.

This parse tree structure reveals the sequence of visual attributes that influenced the model's classification of \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) as \(\hat{y}\). It facilitates the creation of precise, tree-structured justifications for these predictions. Importantly, the routing process involves only a few feature similarity computations per node and does not require queries to the large language model, resulting in exceptionally fast computation.

### Calibrating through Explaining

The created parse tree offers a two-fold advantage. Not only does it illustrates the logic of a specific prediction, but it also serves as a by-product to refine the model's predictions by introducing hierarchical regularization for learned representation. Our goal is to use the parse tree as pseudo-labels, embedding this hierarchical knowledge into the model.

To operationalize this, we employ a hierarchical multi-label contrastive loss (HiMulCon) [92], denoted as \(\mathcal{L}_{HMC}\), to fine-tune the pre-trained neural network. This approach enhances the model by infusing structured explanations into the learning process, thus enriching the representation.

Specifically, we apply the LVX on all training samples. The explanatory path \(\hat{T}_{j}\) provides a hierarchical annotation for each training sample \(\mathbf{x}_{j}\). The model is trained with both the cross-entropy loss \(\mathcal{L}_{CE}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{HMC}\) as follows:

\[\min\sum_{j=1}^{M}\mathcal{L}_{CE}\Big{(}f(\mathbf{x}_{j}),y_{j}\Big{)}+ \lambda\mathcal{L}_{HMC}\Big{(}g(\mathbf{x}_{j}),\hat{T}_{j}\Big{)}\] (3)

Here, \(\lambda\) is a weighting coefficient. The explanation \(\hat{T}_{j}\) is updated every 10 training epochs to ensure its alignment with the network's evolving parameters and learning progress. Notably, the support set isn't used in model training, maintaining a fair comparison with the baselines.

## 4 Experiment

This section offers an in-depth exploration of our evaluation process for the proposed LVX framework and explains how it can be utilized to gain insights into the behavior of a trained visual recognition model, potentially leading to performance and transparency improvements.

### Experimental Setup

**Data Annotation and Collection.** To assess explanation plausibility, data must include human annotations. Currently, no large-scale vision dataset with hierarchical annotations is available to facilitate reasoning for visual predictions. To address this, we developed annotations for three recognized benchmarks: CIFAR10, CIFAR100 [39], and ImageNet [57], termed as H-CIFAR10, H-CIFAR100, and H-ImageNet. These annotations, detailed in Table 8, serve as ground truth for model evaluation, highlighting our dataset's unique support for hierarchical attributes and diverse visual concepts. Note that, we evaluate on hierarchical datasets only, as our method is specifically designed for structured explanations.

As an additional outcome of our framework, we have gathered three support sets to facilitate model explanation. In these datasets, each attribute generated by the LLM corresponds to a collection of images that showcase the specified visual concepts. These images are either retrieved from Bing search engine 3 using attributes as queries or are generated using Stable-diffusion. We subsequently filter the mismatched pairs with the CLIP model, with the threshold of 0.5. Due to the page limit, extensive details on data collection, false positive removal, limitations, and additional evaluation of user study and on medical data, such as X-ray diagnoses, are available in the supplementary material.

Footnote 3: https://www.bing.com/images/

**Evaluation Metrics.** In this paper, we evaluate the quality of our explanation from three perspectives: _Plausibility_, _Faithfulness_ and _Stability_.

* **Plausibility** measures how reasonable the machine explanation is compared to the human explanation. We measure this by the graph distance between the predicted and ground-truth trees, using two metrics: Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) [54, 33], and Tree Kernels (TK) [71]. We calculate their normalized scores respectively. Specifically, given a predicted tree \(T_{pred}\) and the ground-truth \(T_{gt}\), the MCS score is computed as \(\frac{|MCS|\times 100}{\sqrt{|T_{pred}||T_{gt}|}}\), and the TK score is computed as \(\frac{TK(T_{pred},T_{gt})\times 100}{\sqrt{TK(T_{pred},T_{pred})TK(T_{gt},T_{gt})}}\). Here, \(|\cdot|\) represents the number of nodes in a tree, and \(TK(\cdot,\cdot)\) denotes the unnormalized TK score. We report the average score across all validation samples.
* **Faithfulness** states that the explanations should reflect the inner working of the model. We introduce Model-induced Sample-Concept Distance (MSCD) to evaluate this, calculated as the

average of point-to-set distances \(\frac{1}{N_{v}}\sum_{v\in V}D(\mathbf{q}_{j},P_{v})\) between all test samples and tree nodes, reflecting the alignment between generated explanation and model's internal logic. The concept is simple: if the explanation tree aligns with the model's internal representation, the MSCD is minimized, indicating high faithfulness.
* **Stability** evaluates the resilience of the explanation graph to minor input variation, expecting minimal variations in explanations. The MCS/TK metrics are used to assess stability by comparing explanations derived from clean and slightly modified inputs. We include 3 perturbations, including Gaussian additive noise with \(\sigma\in\{0.05,0.1\}\) and Cutout [18] augmentation.

**Baselines.** We construct three baselines for comparisons: Constant, using the full category template tree; Random, which selects a subtree randomly from the template; and Subtree, choosing the most common subtree in the test set for explanations. Additionally, we consider TrDec Baseline [79], a strategy utilizing a tree-topology RNN decoder on top of image encoder. Given the absence of hierarchical annotations, the CLIP model verifies nodes in the template trees, serving as pseudo-labels for training. We only update the decoder parameters for interpretation purposes. These models provide a basic comparison for the performance of LVX. More details are in the appendix.

For classification performance, we compare LVX-calibrated model with neural-tree based solutions, including a Decision Tree (DT) trained on the neural network's final layer, DNDF [38], and NBDT [77].

**Models to be Explained.** Our experiments cover a wide range of neural networks, including various convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformers. These models consist of VGG [66], ResNet [26], DenseNet [29], GoogLeNet [72], Inceptionv3 [73], MobileNet-v2 [59], and Vision Transformer (ViT) [19]. In total, we utilize 12 networks for CIFAR-10, 11 networks for CIFAR-100, and 8 networks for ImageNet. For each model, we perform the tree refinement for 5 iterations.

**Calibration Model Training.** As described in Section 3.3, we finetune the pre-trained neural networks with the hierarchical contrastive loss based on the explanatory results. The model is optimized with SGD for 50 epochs on the training sample, with an initial learning rate in \(\{0.001,0.01,0.03\}\) and a momentum term of 0.9. The weighting factor is set to 0.1. We compare the calibrated models with the original ones in terms of accuracy and explanation faithfulness.

### LLM helps Visual Interprebility

**Plausibility Results.** We evaluated LVX against human annotations across three datasets, using different architectures, and calculating MCS and TK scores. The results, shown in Figure 5, reveal LVX outperforms baselines, providing superior explanations. Notably, TrDec, even when trained on CLIP induced labels, fails to generate valid attributes in deeper tree layers--a prevalent issue in long sequence and structure generation tasks. Meanwhile, SubTree lacks adaptability in its explanations, leading to lower scores. More insights are mentioned in the appendix.

**Faithfulness Results.** We present the MSCD scores for ResNet-18(RN-18), ResNet-50(RN-50), and ViT-S, contrasting them with SubTree and TrDec in Table 3. Thanks to the incorporation of tree refinement that explicitly minimizes MSCD, our LVX method consistently surpasses benchmarks, demonstrating lowest MSCD values, indicating its enhanced alignment with model reasoning.

**Stability Results.** The stability of our model against minor input perturbations on the CIFAR-10 dataset is showcased in Table 2, where MCS/TK are computed. The "Clean" serves as the oracle baseline. Our method, demonstrating robustness to input variations, retains consistent explanation results (MCS\(>\)60, TK\(>\)85). In contrast, TrDec, dependent on an RNN-parameterized decoder, exhibits higher sensitivity to feature variations.

**Model and Data Diagnosis with Explanation.** We visualize the sample explanatory parse tree on ImageNet validation set induced by ViT-B in Figure 6. The explanations fall into three categories: (1) correct predictions with explanations, (2) incorrect predictions with explanations, and (3) noisy label predictions with explanations. We've also displayed the 5 nearest neighbor node for each case.

What's remarkable about LVX is that, even when the model's prediction is wrong, it can identify correct attributes. For instance, in a case where a "white shark" was misidentified as a "killer whale" (b-Row 2), LVX correctly identified "fins", a shared attribute of both species. Moreover, the misrecognition of the attribute "wide tail flukes" indicates a potential error in the model, that could be later addressed to enhance its performance.

Surprisingly, LVX is able to identify certain noisy labels in the data, as shown in c-Row 2. In such cases, even experienced human observers might struggle to decide whether a "pig bank with band" should be classified "piggy bank" or "band aid". It again underscores the superior capabilities of our LVX system in diagnosing the errors beyond model, but also within the data itself.

**Calibration Enhances Interpretability and Performance.** Our approach involves fine-tuning a pre-trained model with the loss function outlined in Section 3.3, using parsed explanatory trees to improve model performance. Table 4 compares the classification performance of our model with that of other neural tree methods. Our model clearly outperforms the rest.

Neural tree models often face challenges in balancing interpretability with performance. In contrast, LVX achieves strong performance without relying on a strict decision tree. Instead, decisions are handled by the neural network, with concepts guided by the LLM through Equation 3. This approach enhances the model's ability to disentangle visual concepts while preserving high performance.

In addition, we compared the quality of the generated parsed tree with or without calibration, in Figure 5. The calibration process not only improved model performance, but also led to more precise tree predictions, indicating enhanced interpretability. We also test the calibrated model on OOD evaluations in Appendix, where we observe notable improvements.

## 5 Ablation Study and Analysis

In this section, we present an ablation study on the refinement stage of LVX. We also apply the method to different neural networks to observe variations in model's behavior.

**Ablation 1: No Refinement.** To study the impact of refinement stage, we present a baseline called _w/o Refine_. In this setup, the initial tree generated by LLMs is kept fixed. We evaluate the method using the MSCD for faithfulness and MCS for plausibility on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets.

The results show in Table 6 that incorporating image model feedback indeed improves tree alignment with the classifier's internal representation, as reflected in higher MCS scores. The refined trees also better match human-annotations.

**Ablation 2: Refinement Criteria.** In our original method, tree refinement is based on feature similarity to the training set. To explore an alternative, we use _average activation magnitude_ on generated data as the criterion for concept familiarity. Concepts with activation magnitudes \(\leq\eta\) are pruned. This method, referred to as _ActMag_, is evaluated on CIFAR-10. We report the MCS, MSCD for performance, and average tree depth as an indicator of tree complexity.

Table 7 shows that feature similarity achieves better results than _ActMag_. Specifically, setting a threshold is challenging for _ActMag_, leading shallow trees (\(\eta=0.3\)) or too deep ones (\(\eta=0.01\)).

**Analysis: CNN vs. Transformer.** We use our LVX to compare CNN and Transformer models and identify which concepts they miss. We compared ConvNeXt-T (CNN) and DeiT-B (Transformer) on 26,928 concepts we collected on ImageNet, from sub-categories of _Concepts_, _Substances_, _Attributes_, and _Environments_. We measured accuracy across 4 sub-categories and tree depths.

Results show that ConvNeXt-T is better at local patterns (Attributes, Substances), while DeiT-B perform better on Environments which needs global semantics. Additionally, DeiT-B is more accurate at shallow depths, whereas ConvNeXt-T performs better at deeper levels. These findings aligns with earlier research showing that CNN are biased towards textures over shape [23; 84].

## 6 Conclusion

In this study, we introduced LVX, an approach for interpreting vision models using tree-structured language explanations without hierarchical annotations. LVX leverages large language models to connect visual attributes with image features, generating comprehensive explanations. We refined attribute parse trees based on the model's recognition capabilities, creating human-understandable descriptions. Test samples were routed through the parse tree to generate sample-specific rationales. LVX demonstrated effectiveness in interpreting vision models, offering potential for model calibration. Our contributions include proposing LVX as the first approach to leverage language models for explaining the visual recognition system. We hope this study potentially advances interpretable AI and deepens our understanding of neural networks.

## Appendix A Appendix / supplemental material

This document presents supplementary experiments and information regarding our proposed LVX framework. In Section C, we provide an overview of the algorithm pipeline for LVX. In Section D, we detail the process of data collection and its subsequent analysis. In additionally, Section E provides the user study results; Section F shows the calibrated training further improve the OOD performance. Section G showcases the additional experimental results obtained from a specialized application on X-Ray diagnosis. Furthermore, in Section H, we demonstrate the explanation results achieved using self-supervised models. We also provide the raw experimental values in Section I. Finally, we outline the experimental setup, metric definitions, and dataset collection protocols.

## Appendix B Related Work

**Neural Tree.** Neural Trees (NTs) intend to harmonize the performance of Neural Networks (NNs) and interpretability of Decision Trees (DTs) [17; 21; 60; 96; 14] within a unified model. They evolved from mimicking NNs with DTs [17; 21; 60; 96; 14] to becoming inherently interpretable tree-structured networks, adapting their structure via gradient descent [70; 94; 32; 85; 75; 38]. Neural-Backed Decision Trees (NBDTs) [77] use a trained NN as a feature extractor, replacing its final layer with a decision tree. Our model builds on these advances to create a hierarchical tree from a pre-trained NN and provides _post-hoc_ explanations without additional training, which increases interpretability and potentially enhances performance.

**Prototype-based Explainable Model.** Prototype models use representative training data points to symbolize classes or outcomes [16; 30; 37]. Reviewed in deep learning and few-shot learning [69; 82], they justify decisions by comparing new instances to key examples [10; 88; 40]. Recent work has developed this approach through hierarchical and local prototypes [49; 34; 74]. However, the prototypes serve as an indirect explanation for model's prediction, necessitating further human justification. Our LVX addresses this by assigning semantic roles to prototypes through LLM, turning them from simple similarity points to data points with clear definitions, thereby enhancing explainability.

**Composing Foundation Models.** Model composition involves merging machine learning models to address tasks, often using modular models for sub-tasks [5; 28; 4; 83], restructured by a symbolic executor [89]. Recently, Language Learning Models (LLMs) have been used as central controllers, guiding the logic of existing models [63; 25; 87; 43] or APIs [61], with language as a universal interface [91]. However, composing language model with non-language ones lacks a unified interface for bilateral communication. In this study, we propose the use of a text-to-image API as a medium to enable the language model to share its knowledge with the visual task. This allows the vision model to benefit from the linguistic context and knowledge hierarchy, thereby enhancing its transparency.

## Appendix C Pseudo-code for LVX

In this section, we present the pseudocode for the LVX framework, encompassing both the _construction stage_ and the _test stage_. The algorithmic pipelines are outlined in Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2.

The category-level tree construction pipeline, as demonstrated in Algorithm 1, involves an iterative process that utilizes a large language model (LLM), like ChatGPT. This process allows us to construct an attribute tree for each category. It begins by generating prompts based on the category name and using them to gather attribute information. This forms the initial tree structure. Support images are collected using a text-to-image API, and their visual features are associated with the corresponding tree nodes. The process iterates until the maximum run, continuously refining the attribute tree for corresponding category.

During the test stage, as outlined in Algorithm 2, the test samples undergo a traversal process within the constructed category-level trees. The goal is to locate the subtree that best aligns with the correct prediction rationales. This sample-wise attribute tree process enables the identification of pertinent attributes and explanations linked to each test sample, providing insights into the decision-making process of the model.

In summary, the LVX employs an iterative approach to construct category-level trees, leveraging the knowledge of LLMs. These trees are then utilized during the test stage to extract relevant explanations. This methodology enables us to gain understanding of the model's decision-making process by revealing the underlying visual attributes and rationales supporting its predictions.

## Appendix D Data Collection and Analysis

### Annotation Creation

The creation of test annotations for three datasets involved a semi-automated approach implemented in two distinct steps. This process was a collaborative effort between human annotators, a language model (ChatGPT), and CLIP [53], ensuring both efficiency and reliability.

1. **Concept Tree Creation.** In this first step, we utilized ChatGPT 4 to generate initial attribute trees for each class with the category name, detailed Section 3.1. Footnote 4: https://chat.openai.com/
2. **Attribute Verification.** To determine whether an attribute was present or absent in an image, we employed an ensemble of predictions from multiple CLIP [53] models 5. We filtered the top-5 attributes predicted by CLIP and sought human judgments to verify their correctness. To streamline this process, we developed an annotation tool with a user interface, which is illustrated in Figure 7. Footnote 5: https://github.com/mlfoundations/open_clip
3. **Manual Verification.** In this phase, annotators examined the accuracy of existing attributes and introduced new relevant ones to enrich the concept trees. Subsequently, human annotators conducted a thorough review, refinement, and systematic organization of the attribute trees for each class.

### Support data

**Data Collection.** Our LVX model utilizes a custom support set for each task, created through a reject sampling method. Initially, images are generated using either Bing or the Stable Diffusion Model. Subsequently, CLIP is applied to determine if the CLIP score exceeds 0.5, based on the raw cosine similarities calculated by averaging CLIP ViT-B/32,ViT-B/16,ViT-B/14. If the score is above the specified threshold, the image is retained; otherwise, it is discarded.

To optimize the image collection process, we merge the retrieved images from all models, leading to time and effort savings. This approach allows us to reuse an image already in the dataset if it matches an attribute generated by the LLM. As a result, after the initial models have finished collecting data, subsequent models can simply pull relevant images from this existing pool instead of collecting new ones, saving both time and effort.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|} \hline
**Dataset Name** & **No. Categories** & **No. Attributes** & **No. Images** \\ \hline CIFAR-10 Support & 10 & 289 & 14,024 \\ CIFAR-100 Support & 100 & 2,359 & 19,168 \\ ImageNet Support & 1,000 & 26,928 & 142,034 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Support set Dataset Statistics.

Figure 7: Software tool interface for parse tree annotation.

**Data Statistics.** We present the statistics of the support datasets collected for CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, highlighting the diversity and comprehensiveness of our dataset. Table 8 and Figure 8 provide an overview of these statistics. Specifically, we include the number of attributes, the number of samples for each category, the total number of samples in the dataset, as well as the distribution of tree depths. This rich collection of data showcases the diverse range of attributes and categories covered in our dataset, making it a valuable resource for training and evaluation purposes.

### Limitations of Support Dataset Collection

While collecting a newly curated dataset can be advantageous for our tasks, it is important to acknowledge certain limitations when using such datasets for explanation purposes. Three key limitations arise: false positive images, the presence of out-of-distribution samples and potential bias in the dataset.

* **False Positive Images.** We observed that both Bing and the Stable Diffusion model occasionally generate imperfect images from textual descriptions, manifesting incorrect or entangled patterns. For instance, the word "crane" could represent either a construction machine or a bird, leading to ambiguity. Furthermore, an image described as "a dog with a long tail" could potentially include not only the tail but also the head and legs, reflecting a broader scope than intended.
* **Out-of-Distribution Samples.** Newly collected datasets may include samples that are out-of-distribution, i.e., they do not align with the source data distribution of interest. These out-of-distribution samples can introduce challenges in generating accurate and reliable explanations. As a result, explanations based solely on a newly collected dataset may not generalize well to unseen instances outside the support dataset distribution.
* **Data Bias.** Biases in the collection process or the underlying data sources can inadvertently influence the dataset, leading to biased explanations. Biases emerge due to various factors, such as data collection source, or imbalances in attribute distributions. Consequently, relying solely on a newly collected dataset for explanations may introduce unintended biases into the interpretation process.

Figure 8: Statistics of the support dataset sets of (Row1) CIFAR10, (Row2) CIFAR100 and (Row3) ImageNet. We examine the (a,d,g) Tree Depth, (b,e,h) Number of Attributes for each category and (c,f,i) Number of image for each category to demonstrate the diversity of collected attributes and the completeness of hierarchical annotations.

**Solutions.** To deal with mistakes in the gathered images, we used two approaches. First, we used the CLIP model to sift through the images because it's good at understanding how close an image is to text concepts, helping us remove most mixed-up and incorrect images. Second, we manually sorted out words that have more than one meaning. For instance, we made it clear whether "crane" refers to the bird or the machine by labeling it as "crane (bird)" or "crane (machine)".

To mitigate the challenges posed by OOD samples and data bias, we adopt a cautious approach. Specifically, we do not directly train our models on the newly collected support dataset. Instead, we utilize this dataset solely for the purpose of providing disentangled attributes for explanations. By decoupling the training data from the support data, we aim to reduce the impact of OOD samples and potential data biases, thus promoting a more robust and unbiased analysis.

Despite these limitations, our emphasis on obtaining a dataset with distinct attributes sharpens our analysis and interpretation of model behavior. This approach allows us to extract meaningful insights in a controlled and clear way.

## Appendix E User Study

The evaluation of visual decision-making and categorization can be uncertain and subjective, posing challenges in assessing the quality of explanations. To address this, we conducted a user study to verify the plausibility of our explanations.

**Experiment Setup.** Our study compared the performance of LVX, with three others: Subtree, TrDec, and a new baseline called Single. The key difference with the Single baseline is that it utilizes only the nearest neighbor node from the parse tree for its output. This contrasts with LVX, which employs the top-k neighbor nodes from the parse tree.

We recruited 37 participants for this study. Each was asked to respond to 15 questions, each with one image and 4 choices. In each question, they choose the explanation that best matched the image, based on their personal judgment. The format for each choice was arranged as "The image is a <CLASS_NAME> because <EXPLANATION>.".

**Results.** The user study results, as shown in Table 9, clearly indicate the superiority of the LVX method. It was selected by participants 57.66% of the time, a significantly higher rate compared to the other methods included in the study.

## Appendix F Experiments on Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Evaluation

In this section, we evaluate our calibrated model's performance in Out-of-Distribution (OOD) scenarios, focusing on its robustness and ability to generalize. This evaluation is conducted using a ResNet50 and ViT-S trained on ImageNet, with and without calibration training, and tested on the ImageNet-A and ImageNet-Sketch datasets.

**Results.** The results of OOD generalization, quantified by Top-1 Accuracy, are listed in Table 10. For both ResNet-50 and ViT-S 16 models, we notice significant improvements in accuracy in ImageNet-A and ImageNet-S compared to the baselines. This enhancement in Out-of-Distribution generalization confirms the effectiveness of model calibration in not only improving in-domain performance (shown in Figure 7 of the main paper) but also in boosting adaptability and robustness to out-of-domain data.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline \hline Method & Choice Percentage \\ \hline Subtree & 3.78\% \\ TrDec & 22.88\% \\ Single & 15.68\% \\ \hline LVX & **57.66\%** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: User Study Results.

## Appendix G Experiments on Chest X-Ray Diagnosis

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our LVX method in security-critical domains, specifically medical image analysis. We train neural networks for chest X-ray diagnosis and utilize LVX to interpret and calibrate the predictions.

We adopted the DenseNet-121 architecture for disease diagnosis in our study. The model was trained on the Chestx-ray14 dataset [78], which consists of chest X-ray images encompassing 14 diseases, along with an additional "No Finding" class. The DenseNet-121 architecture is specifically designed to generate 14 output logits corresponding to the different diseases. During training, we employed a weighted binary cross-entropy loss [78] for each disease category to optimize the model.

For optimization, we utilized the Adam optimizer [36] with an initial learning rate of 1e-4, a weight decay of 1e-5, and a batch size of 32. The model underwent training for a total of 18 epochs.

**Model Explanation.** To enhance interpretability, we incorporated our LVX framework into the model. Instead of acquiring images from online sources, we gathered the support set directly from the training data. To accomplish this, we utilized a parse tree generated by the ChatGPT language model. Leveraging this parse tree, we applied a MedCLIP [80] model to retrieve the most relevant images for each attribute from the training set. These retrieved images served as our support sets for the LVX framework.

Compared to applying the LVX framework on single-label classification, the Chestx-ray14 dataset poses a multi-label classification challenge. In this dataset, each sample can belong to multiple disease categories simultaneously. Therefore, we modified the LVX framework to accommodate and handle the multi-label nature of the classification task.

Specifically, for each input image \(\mathbf{x}\), we predict its label \(\hat{y}=f(\mathbf{x})\in\{0,1\}^{14}\). To create the visual parse tree, we begin by establishing the root node. If all elements of \(\hat{y}\) are 0, the root node is set to "No Findings". Conversely, if any element of \(\hat{y}\) is non-zero, the root node is labeled as "has Findings". For each positive finding, we construct a separate parse tree, with these sub-trees

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Model & ImageNet (In-Domain) & ImageNet-A & ImageNet-S \\  & Baseline/**Calibrated** & Baseline/**Calibrated** & Baseline/**Calibrated** \\ \hline ResNet-50 & 76.13**(76.54**(+**0.41**) & 18.96**23.32**(+**4.36**) & 24.10**/31.42**(+**7.32**) \\ ViT-S 16 & 77.85**(78.21**(+**0.36**) & 13.39**/18.72**(+**5.33**) & 32.40**/37.21**(+**4.81**) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

becoming the children nodes of the root. By combining these sub-trees, we obtain a comprehensive and coherent explanation for the image. This modification enables us to effectively handle the multi-label nature of the classification task, providing meaningful and interpretable explanations for images with multiple positive findings.

To establish the ground-truth explanation label, we adopt a MedCLIP [80] model to filter the top-5 attributes for each positive finding of the image. These attributes are then organized into a tree structure. This approach serves as an automatic explanation ground-truth, thereby eliminating the requirement for manual annotations from domain experts.

In addition to providing explanations, we aim to calibrate the model predictions with the parse tree. To achieve this, we apply a modified hierarchical contrastive loss individually on each finding. We then calculate the average of these losses, which serves as our overall loss term. We thus fine-tune the model for 3 epochs using the hieracical term and weighted cross-entropy.

**Explanation Results.** We compare the explanation performance of our proposed LVX against the Random and Constant baselines. The numerical results, depicted in Figure 9, highlight the superiority of our LVX approach.

Additionally, we showcase the parsed visual tree in Figure 10, to provide a clearer illustration of our results. Notably, our approach effectively interprets the decision-making process of black-box neural networks. For instance, in the case on the right, our method accurately identifies the presence of _visible fluid_ in the lung space and establishes its relevance to the model's prediction. Consequently, LVX enables clinical professionals to make well-informed justifications for their patients, enhancing the overall decision-making process.

**Calibration Results.** Table 11 presents the comparison between the baseline models and the model with calibration, measured in terms of the Area Under the Curve (AUC) score for each disease type. The AUC score provides a measure of the model's ability to discriminate between positive and negative cases.

The calibrated model shows notable improvements in several disease types compared to the baseline. Notably, Hernia demonstrates the most significant improvement, with an AUC score of 0.936 compared to 0.914 for the baseline. This indicates that the calibration process has enhanced the model's ability to accurately detect Hernia cases.

In summary, the LVX method markedly improves model accuracy, demonstrated by enhanced calibration performance across different disease types. The integration of visual attributes boosts both accuracy and reliability of predictions, leading to better diagnostic results. These findings underscore the LVX method's potential to elevate model performance, particularly in medical diagnostics.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c} \hline \hline
**Finding** & **Baseline** & LVX \\ \hline Atelectasis & 0.767 & **0.779** \\ Consolidation & 0.747 & **0.755** \\ Infiltration & 0.683 & **0.698** \\ Pneumothorax & 0.865 & **0.873** \\ Edema & 0.845 & **0.851** \\ Emphysema & 0.919 & **0.930** \\ Fibrosis & 0.832 & **0.830** \\ Effusion & 0.826 & **0.831** \\ Pneumonia & 0.721 & **0.719** \\ Pleural Thickening & 0.784 & **0.793** \\ Cardiomegaly & 0.890 & **0.894** \\ Nodule & 0.758 & **0.776** \\ Mass & 0.814 & **0.830** \\ Hernia & 0.914 & **0.936** \\ \hline Avg. & 0.812 & **0.821** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Evaluation Metrics

To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed tree parsing task, we have developed three metrics that leverage conventional tree similarity and distance measurement techniques.

* **Tree Kernels (TK)**: Tree Kernels (TK) evaluate tree similarity by leveraging shared substructures, assigning higher scores to trees with common subtrees or substructures. To enhance the match, we set the decaying factor for two adjacent tree layers to 0.5, where larger values lead to better matches. Let's define the subtree kernel mathematically:

\begin{table}

\end{table}

**Tree Kernel:** Given two trees, \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\), represented as rooted, labeled, and ordered trees, we define the subtree kernel as follows:

\[TK(T_{1},T_{2})=\sum_{T}\sum_{T^{\prime}}\theta(T,T^{\prime})\times\theta(T,T^{ \prime})\times\lambda^{\max(\text{depth}(r),\text{depth}(r^{\prime}))}\]

Let \(TK(T_{1},T_{2})\) denote the similarity between subtrees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) using the subtree kernel. Additionally, let \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})\) represent the count of shared common subtrees between trees \(T\) and \(T^{\prime}\). Furthermore, let \(r\) and \(r^{\prime}\) be the roots of \(T\) and \(T^{\prime}\) respectively. \(\lambda<1.0\) is the decaying factor that make sure the tree closer to the root hold greater significance.

The \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})\) is computed recursively as follows:

1. If both \(T\) and \(T^{\prime}\) are leaf nodes, then \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})=1\) if the labels of \(T\) and \(T^{\prime}\) are the same, and 0 otherwise.
2. If either \(T\) or \(T^{\prime}\) is a leaf node, then \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})=0\).
3. Otherwise, let \(\{T_{1},T_{2},\ldots,T_{n}\}\) be the child subtrees of \(T\), and \(\{T^{\prime}_{1},T^{\prime}_{2},\ldots,T^{\prime}_{n^{\prime}}\}\) be the child subtrees of \(T^{\prime}\). * If the labels of \(r\) and \(r^{\prime}\) are the same, then \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})\) is the sum of the products of \(\theta(T_{i},T^{\prime}_{j})\) for all combinations of \(i\) and \(j\), where \(i\) ranges from 1 to \(n\) and \(j\) ranges from 1 to \(n^{\prime}\). * If the labels of \(r\) and \(r^{\prime}\) are different, then \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})\) is 0. * Additionally, if \(T\) and \(T^{\prime}\) are isomorphic (have the same structure), then \(\theta(T,T^{\prime})\) is incremented by 1. In the paper, the Tree Kernel (TK) score is normalized to accommodate trees of different sizes. The normalized TK score is computed as: \(\frac{TK(T_{pred},T_{gt})\times 100}{\sqrt{TK(T_{pred},T_{pred})TK(T_{gt},T_{gt})}}\). The kernel value serves as a measure of similarity, where higher values indicate greater similarity.

* **Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS)[54; 33]**: The Maximum Common Subgraph (MCS) identifies the largest shared subgraph between two trees, measuring the similarity and overlap of their hierarchical structures. Here's the mathematical definition of the Maximum Common Subgraph:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c|c c c|c c c} \hline Model & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{TED\(\downarrow\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{MCS\(\uparrow\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Tree Kernel\(\uparrow\)} \\  & rand. & const. & LVX & rand. & const. & LVX & rand. & const. & LVX \\ \hline ResNet18 & 9.83 & 34.15 & 9.30 & 22.52 & 16.82 & 23.87 & 45.32 & 44.85 & 46.85 \\ ResNet34 & 9.75 & 33.78 & 9.17 & 23.74 & 17.71 & 25.09 & 47.66 & 47.16 & 49.24 \\ ResNet50 & 9.68 & 33.58 & 9.09 & 24.59 & 18.35 & 25.99 & 49.38 & 48.97 & 51.19 \\ ResNet101 & 9.64 & 33.48 & 9.04 & 24.94 & 18.66 & 26.51 & 50.25 & 49.77 & 51.99 \\ ViT-T16 & 10.42 & 35.44 & 9.99 & 15.07 & 11.25 & 15.91 & 30.30 & 29.92 & 31.24 \\ ViT-S16 & 9.69 & 33.61 & 9.10 & 24.16 & 18.01 & 25.73 & 48.53 & 48.05 & 50.34 \\ ViT-B16 & 9.62 & 33.37 & 8.99 & 25.20 & 18.79 & 27.01 & 50.64 & 50.22 & 52.76 \\ ViT-L16 & 9.45 & 32.84 & 8.79 & 27.27 & 20.35 & 29.29 & 54.83 & 54.36 & 57.14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 15: Explanation performance comparison on ImageNet.

**Maximum Common Subgraph:** Given two trees, \(T_{1}=(V_{1},E_{1})\) and \(T_{2}=(V_{2},E_{2})\), where \(V_{1}\) and \(V_{2}\) are the sets of vertices and \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are the sets of edges for each graph, respectively, we define the **Maximum Common Subgraph** as:

\[\begin{array}{ll}\text{MCS}(T_{1},T_{2})=(V_{\text{MCS}},E_{\text{MCS}})\\ \text{maximize}&|V_{\text{MCS}}|\\ \text{subject to}&V_{\text{MCS}}\subseteq V1\quad\text{and}\quad V_{\text{MCS}} \subseteq V2\\ &E_{\text{MCS}}\subseteq E1\quad\text{and}\quad E_{\text{MCS}}\subseteq E2\\ &\text{For any pair of vertices }u,v\text{ in }V_{\text{MCS}},\text{ if }(u,v)\text{ is an edge in }E_{\text{MCS}},\\ &\text{then }(u,v)\text{ is an edge in }T_{1}\text{ and }T_{2},\text{ and vice versa.}\\ \end{array}\]

In our paper, we report the normalized MCS score as our measurement of tree similarity \(\frac{|\text{MCS}(T_{pred},T_{gt}|)|\times 100}{\sqrt{|T_{pred}||T_{gt}|}}\), where a higher score indicates greater similarity between the graphs. Here, \(|\cdot|\) represents the number of nodes in a tree. We employ this normalization to address the scenario where one tree is significantly larger and encompasses all other trees as subtrees. By dividing the MCS score by the square root of the product of the numbers of nodes in the predicted tree (\(T_{\text{pred}}\)) and the ground truth tree (\(T_{\text{gt}}\)), we ensure a fair comparison across trees of varying sizes.

* **Tree Edit Distance (TED)**[6]: The Tree Edit Distance (TED) quantifies the minimum number of editing operations required to transform one hierarchical tree into another. It measures the structural dissimilarity between trees by considering node and edge modifications, insertions, and deletions. With smaller TED, the two graphs are more similar. Let's define the Tree Edit Distance formally:

**Tree Edit Distance:** Given two trees \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\), represented as rooted, labeled, and ordered trees, we define the Tree Edit Distance between them as \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\).

The \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\) is computed recursively as follows:

* If both \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\) are empty trees, i.e., they do not have any nodes, then \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})=0\).
* If either \(T_{1}\) or \(T_{2}\) is an empty tree, i.e., it does not have any nodes, then \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\) is the number of nodes in the non-empty tree.
* Otherwise, let \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) be the roots of \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\), respectively. Let \(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}}\) and \(T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}}\) be the subtrees obtained by removing the roots \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) from \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}\), respectively.
* If \(r_{1}=r_{2}\), then \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\) is the minimum among the following values:
* \(TED(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}})\) \(+\) \(TED(\text{children of }r_{1},\text{children of }r_{2})\), where \(TED(\text{children of }r_{1},\text{children of }r_{2})\) is the TED computed recursively between the children of \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\).
* \(1+TED(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}})\), which represents the cost of deleting the root \(r_{1}\) and recursively computing TED between \(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}}\) and \(T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}}\).
* \(1+TED(T1,T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}})\), which represents the cost of inserting the root \(r_{2}\) into \(T_{1}\) and recursively computing TED between \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}}\).
* \(1+TED(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},T_{2})\), which represents the cost of deleting the root \(r_{1}\) and inserting the root \(r_{2}\) into \(T_{2}\), and recursively computing TED between \(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}}\) and \(T_{2}\).
* If \(r_{1}\neq r_{2}\), then \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\) is the minimum among the following values:
* \(TED(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}})\) \(+\) \(TED(\text{children of }r_{1},\text{children of }r_{2})\), where \(TED(\text{children of }r_{1},\text{children of }r_{2})\) is the TED computed recursively between the children of \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\).
* \(1+TED(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}},T_{2})\), which represents the cost of deleting the root \(r_{1}\) and recursively computing TED between \(T_{1}^{{}^{\prime}}\) and \(T_{2}\).
* \(1+TED(T_{1},T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}})\), which represents the cost of inserting the root \(r_{2}\) into \(T_{1}\) and recursively computing TED between \(T_{1}\) and \(T_{2}^{{}^{\prime}}\).

The \(TED(T_{1},T_{2})\) is the final result obtained after applying the above recursive computation.

### Model Checkpoints

For our experiments, we utilize publicly available pre-trained models. Specifically, we employ CIFAR10 models from https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10, CIFAR100 models from https://github.com/chenyaofo/pytorch-cifar-models, and ImageNet models from torchvision package and timm package. The self-supervised models are downloaded from their respective official repositories.

### Explanation Baselines

To explain visual models using tree-structured language without annotations, we devised four basic baselines, Random, Constant, Subtree and TrDec, for comparison with our LVX method.

**Random Baseline.** The Random baseline generates random explanations by predicting an image's category and randomly sampling 5 nodes from its category-specific tree. The connected nodes form a tree-structured explanation, providing a performance baseline for random guessing.

**Constant Baseline.** The Constant baseline Produces a fixed tree-structured clue for images of the same class, using an initial explanatory tree \(T_{i}^{(0)}\) as a template. This baseline assesses LVX against a non-adaptive, static approach.

**Subtree Baseline.** This method involves selecting the most common subtree from the test set for explanations, testing the efficacy of using frequent dataset patterns for generic explanations.

**TreDec Baseline.** Based on [79], the TrDec strategy implements a tree-topology RNN decoder over an image encoder. In the absence of hierarchical annotations, this baseline uses the CLIP model to verify nodes in the template trees, which act as pseudo-labels for training. This method focuses on the effectiveness of a structured decoding process in explanation generation.

This comparison demonstrates the effectiveness of LVX in creating explanations tailored to individual image content, clearly outperforming methods based on random guessing, static templates, and basic learning-based approaches.

## Appendix K Limitations

Our system, LVX, depends on an external Large Language Model (LLM) to provide textual explanations. While this integration adds significant functionality, it also introduces the risk of inaccuracies. The LLM may not always deliver correct information, leading to potential misinformation or erroneous explanations.

Additionally, our approach involves generating explanations based on the last embedding layer of the neural network. This method overlooks the comprehensive, multi-level hierarchical structure of deep features, potentially simplifying or omitting important contextual data that could enhance the understanding of the network's decisions.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

The checklist is designed to encourage best practices for responsible machine learning research, addressing issues of reproducibility, transparency, research ethics, and societal impact. Do not remove the checklist: **The papers not including the checklist will be desk rejected.** The checklist should follow the references and precede the (optional) supplemental material. The checklist does NOT count towards the page limit.

Please read the checklist guidelines carefully for information on how to answer these questions. For each question in the checklist:

* You should answer [Yes], [No], or [NA].
* [NA] means either that the question is Not Applicable for that particular paper or the relevant information is Not Available.
* Please provide a short (1-2 sentence) justification right after your answer (even for NA).

**The checklist answers are an integral part of your paper submission.** They are visible to the reviewers, area chairs, senior area chairs, and ethics reviewers. You will be asked to also include it (after eventual revisions) with the final version of your paper, and its final version will be published with the paper.

The reviewers of your paper will be asked to use the checklist as one of the factors in their evaluation. While "[Yes] " is generally preferable to "[No] ", it is perfectly acceptable to answer "[No] " provided a proper justification is given (e.g., "error bars are not reported because it would be too computationally expensive" or "we were unable to find the license for the dataset we used"). In general, answering "[No] " or "[NA] " is not grounds for rejection. While the questions are phrased in a binary way, we acknowledge that the true answer is often more nuanced, so please just use your best judgment and write a justification to elaborate. All supporting evidence can appear either in the main paper or the supplemental material, provided in appendix. If you answer [Yes] to a question, in the justification please point to the section(s) where related material for the question can be found.

IMPORTANT, please:

* **Delete this instruction block, but keep the section heading "NeurIPS paper checklist"**,
* **Keep the checklist subsection headings, questions/answers and guidelines below.**
* **Do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your answers**.

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: we present LVX to explain vision model with LLM's help. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the limitation section.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper.
* The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper.
* The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be.
* The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated.
* The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon.
* The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size.
* If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.
* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [No] Justification: No proof made. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Details and code provided. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.

* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code has been uploaded as supplementary material. Data will be available. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). ** Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All details mentioned. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Errorbar presented. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All discussed in the main paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.

* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Error bar included. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide new annotation for an existing dataset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.

* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Yes, all properly credited. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code and data are well documented. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [No] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [No] Justification: Not applicable Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
