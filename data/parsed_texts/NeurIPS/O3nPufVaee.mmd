###### Abstract

Real-world image denoising remains a challenge task. This paper studies self-supervised image denoising, requiring only noisy images captured in a single shot. We revamping the blind-spot technique by leveraging the transformer's capability for long-range pixel interactions, which is crucial for effectively removing noise dependence in relating pixel-a requirement for achieving great performance for the blind-spot technique. The proposed method integrates these elements with two key innovations: a directional self-attention (DSA) module using a half-plane grid for self-attention, creating a sophisticated blind-spot structure, and a Siamese architecture with mutual learning to mitigate the performance impacts from the restricted attention grid in DSA. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing self-supervised and clean-image-free methods. This combination of blind-spot and transformer techniques provides a natural synergy for tackling real-world image denoising challenges.

## 1 Introduction

Images taken with digital cameras inevitably acquire noise from various sources. Image denoising aims to recover a clean (noise-free) image from its noisy counterpart, serving as an important technique in many low-level vision tasks. Recently, deep learning has prominently driven advancements in image denoising; see _e.g._, [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11]. Early works typically take a supervised learning approach to train a neural network (NN) on a dataset with paired noisy and clean images, where noisy images are synthesized by corrupting clean images with Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN). As observed in [6; 12], a denoising NN trained on AWGN fails to generalize well on real-world noisy images due to the statistical distribution gap between AWGN and real-world noise.

To address this issue in supervised learning, several studies have concentrated on constructing datasets with paired real-world noisy and clean images, such as the Smartphone Image Denoising Dataset (SIDD) [13] and the Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) [14]. However, creating these datasets is labor-intensive, involving multiple acquisitions of images of the same scene, requiring rigorous image alignment, and is inapplicable to dynamic scenes. Additionally, the statistical properties of real noise vary for different camera systems and settings. These limitations restrict the wider application of supervised-learning-based solutions in real-world image denoising.

To address the difficulties of creating paired noisy-clean image datasets that capture the noise characteristics of the targeted testing data, some approaches train denoising NNs using unpaired noisy and clean images [15; 16; 17; 8]. Other studies [18; 19; 20] use multiple noisy images of the same scene as training data. While these methods relax data collection requirements, limitations remain. The former still requires clean images, which is challenging to collect, especially in scientific/medical imaging. The latter involves rigorous image alignment, making it unsuitable for dynamic scenes.

Self-supervised denoising methods:In recent years, there has been increasing interest in self-supervised denoising methods, where network training requires only a set of _noisy images captured in a single shot_. Among these methods, Blind-Spot Networks (BSNs) and their variations are particularly popular; see, _e.g._[21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27; 28; 29; 30]. The concept of BSNs has played a significant role in self-supervised learning for various denoising-related tasks. In principle, through specific architectural design, a BSN estimates each output pixel from the surrounding noisy pixels, excluding the corresponding one. This design prevents the network from converging to an identity mapping when trained to minimize the distance between the output of the NN and the input noisy image, as no clean image is available. Note that pixel-wise noise independence is critical for BSN to work effectively.

Recently, transformers, NNs utilizing self-attention (SA) for sequence modeling, have shown great performance in many applications, including image denoising; see, for example, [31; 32; 33; 34; 35]. Compared to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), which use multiple convolution layers to extend the receptive field and connect distant pixels, transformers directly model interactions between distant pixels via attention, capturing long-range dependencies more effectively.

The effectiveness of transformers or SA in connecting distant pixels is particularly attractive for self-supervised denoising, especially for Blind-Spot Networks (BSNs). The ability of transformers to exploit long-range dependencies aligns well with the need for pixel-wise noise independence in BSNs to achieve optimal performance, as noise on distant pixels is more likely to be independent than on neighboring pixels. While the integration of transformers with BSNs is very promising, it has not been well studied in self-supervised denoising.

Currently, there are few studies [28; 29; 36] integrate SA and BSN for self-supervised denoising, LG-BSN [28] used channel SA [34] with dilated convolutions for blind-spot learning but did not utilize spatial SA. SS-BSN [29] integrated a lightweight spatial SA module into a BSN with dilated convolutions but lacked rigorous justification of blind-spot constraints. SwinIA [36] applied masking to the Swin Transformer [31] attention matrix, targeting only AWGN. As a result, these transformer-based methods do not outperform recent CNN-based approaches [30] in denoising real-world images. It remains an open question how to fully leverage the effectiveness of long-range dependence in transformers for better performance in self-supervised real-world denoising.

Main idea of our approach:The direct combination of SA and BSD, as done in [29], may compromise the blind-spot property [28]. Another approach is to mask out input pixels, as in [21; 22]. However, pixel masking can reduce the integrity and the accuracy of long-range feature interactions within transformer blocks. It also limits the number of available pixels for loss calculation, thereby leads to sub-optimal performance. We address these issues with SelfFormer, a self-supervised transformer model featuring a built-in blind-spot structure that avoids input pixel masking.

Our SelfFormer is built on a directional self-attention (DSA) mechanism, inspired by directional convolution [23]. Unlike plain self-attention, where the attention window spreads out in all directions (see Figure1(a)), DSA's attention window is constrained to a half-plane excluding the token itself (see Figure 1(b)). This unidirectional flow ensures that information broadcasted by a token does not return to it, even after multiple DSA applications, thus creating a blind-spot mechanism.

SelfFormer has four branches, each using DSA in one direction: left, right, up, and down. Combining outputs from all branches allows attention to extend arbitrarily far in every direction without including the center pixel. To improve computational efficiency, we use a gridding scheme on the directional attention window. In addition, we introduce a channel attention (CA) mechanism with blind-spot properties to capture channel interdependence, complementing the spatial similarity captured by SA.

Figure 1: Illustration of basic idea of our approach.

To further enhance the effectiveness of DSA caused by its restricted attention locations, we introduce a pseudo-Siamese architecture for SelfFormer. One sub-NN, _SelfFormer-D_, employs DSA with four branches, while the other, _SelfFormer-F_, uses full-grid SA with only one branch. SelfFormer-D's four branches share weights and process four rotated inputs, allowing identical learnable weights for DSA and full-grid SA in the pseudo-Siamese learning. Despite different structures, this setup ensures both sub-networks have consistent weights. SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F, with their different inductive biases, provide mutual regularization through joint learning. Due to its better capability of exploiting long-range dependencies with unconstrained attention windows, SelfFormer-F is used for inference.

**Contributions:** The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

* SelfFormer, an efficient self-supervised transformer, is introduced for real-world image denoising, integrating the blind-spot mechanism with transformers.
* DSA, a specific type of SA, is developed to embed the blind-spot mechanism in transformers.
* A pseudo-Siamese architecture is introduced to address the potential negative performance impact of the restricted attention locations caused by the blind-spot mechanism.

The proposed SelfFormer for denoising real-world images is evaluated on two popular datasets, SIDD and DND, and compared with many existing image denoisers. The results showed that SelfFormer outperforms existing self-supervised denoisers and other methods that not using clean images.

## 2 Related Work

**Supervised denoising:** The study of supervised denoisers focus on designed network architecture. Most existing methods are based on CNNs; see _e.g._[1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 37; 11]. Recently, transformers have become a primary choice due to their performance advantage [31; 32; 33; 34; 35]. Training data is another concern. Instead of using AWGN for data synthesis, CBDNet [12] synthesized heteroscedastic Gaussian noise and processed it through a Image Signal Processor. Zhou _et al._[38] trained a noise estimator and a denoiser with mixed AWGN and random-valued impulse noise and then utilized pixel-shuffle down-sampling to adapt the trained model to real noises. For better generalization and evaluation, two widely-used real-world noisy datasets were constructed in [13; 14], respectively. However, large-scale paired data collection remains a challenge.

**Weakly-supervised denoising:** The related approaches can be categorized into learning on unpaired image data, and learning on paired noisy image data. The former leverages unpaired noisy and clean images, using either generative adversarial networks [15; 16] or flow-based methods [17; 20]. The latter use multiple noisy images of the same scene to train a denoiser [18; 19; 20]. Note that such multi-capture of noisy images still requires image alignment and is not applicable to dynamic scenes.

**Self-supervised denoising:** Self-supervised denoisers are trained using only a set of noisy images captured in a single shot. BSN is one popular self-supervised denoiser. Masking-based BSNs (e.g., Noise2Void [21] and Noise2Self [22]) address overfitting caused by the absence of clean images in the loss function by masking a portion of input pixels and predicting them using the remaining pixels. Noise2Same [24] introduces an additional self-reconstruction loss to utilize center pixels' information. Blind2Unblind [25] trains a masker to better preserve valuable pixels in the masked input. SASL [39] gives separate treatment to flat and textured regions in masking-based self-supervision.

A large percentage of input pixels are not used in the loss function when they are masked out, leading to sub-optimal performance [23]. To address this, some works design specific network architectures to ensure the receptive-field center is not seen by the corresponding pixel during prediction. Laine19 _et al._[23] occludes half of the receptive fields of a CNN in four different directions. D-BSN [26] applies a center-masked convolution, followed by a series of dilated convolutions with specific step sizes. MM-BSN [40] uses multiple convolutional kernels masked in different shapes.

The less correlated the noise of related pixels is, the better the denoiser performs. However, in real images, neighboring pixels' noise is highly correlated. One solution is to relate distant pixels. AP-BSN [27] uses pixel-shuffle downsampling with high strides in training, and low strides in testing. PUCA [30] leverages patch-unshuffle/shuffle to expand receptive fields for relating distant pixels. LG-BPN [28] uses channel SA with dilated convolution for relating distant pixels and densely-sampled patch-masked convolution to recover local structures. SS-BSN [29] combines grid SA [41]with a simplified D-BSN [26]. SwinIA [36] masks the diagonal of the attention matrix in a Swin Transformer [31].

Besides BSNs, there are also other approaches which are architecture-independent. SURE-based methods (_e.g._[42]), introduce Stein's unbiased estimator [43] to regularize the training. Recorruption-based methods, _e.g._, Noisier2Noise [44], R2R [45], IDR [46], and Zheng _et al._[47], define the loss using pairs derived from the input noisy image to simulate a supervised loss. Sampling-based methods (_e.g._ Neighbor2Neighbor [48]) form training pairs using a random neighbor sampler on the noisy image. Score-based methods, _e.g._, Noise2Score [49], NDASSID [50], and Xie _et al._[51], perform self-supervised training via score matching [52]. Disentanglement-based methods, _e.g._, CVF-SID [53] use a cyclic loss function to decompose the noisy image into clean and noisy components.

**Zero-shot denoising:** This approach performs per-sample self-supervised training. The sparse-coding-based denoisers learn a dictionary [54; 55; 56; 57] from the noisy image, and the denoising output is defined as a sparse approximation to the input based on the learned dictionary. The NN-based denoiser, such as DIP [58], Self2Self[59], NoisyAsClean[60], Noise2Fast [61] and ScoreDVI [62], also follow this paradigm. However, this approach is computationally costly when applied to a large number of images.

## 3 Methodology

In this section, we give a detailed description of our proposed SelfFormer, which effectively integrates the blind-spot mechanism with transformers for self-supervised real-world image denoising.

### Grid Self-Attention and Directional Self-Attention

For a set of tokens stored as \(\bm{Z}=[\bm{z}_{1};\cdots;\bm{z}_{L}]\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times D}\), SA seeks to derive new token representations by assessing interdependence among every pair of input tokens. Consider SA in a multi-head setting [63]. For the \(h\)-th of \(H\) attention head, all tokens undergo a linear transform resulting in \(\bm{Q}_{h},\bm{K}_{h},\bm{V}_{h}\in\mathbb{R}^{L\times D}\), which represent queries, keys and values respectively:

\[(\bm{Q}_{h},\bm{K}_{h},\bm{V}_{h})=(\bm{Z}\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{Q}},\bm{Z}\bm{W}_{ h}^{\text{K}},\bm{Z}\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{V}}),\] (1)

where \(\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{Q}},\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{K}},\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{V}}\) are learnable matrices. Subsequently, attention weights are derived, determining the extent to which each token interacts with its counterparts. This is achieved through the calculation of similarity scores between queries and keys, leading to:

\[\text{Head}_{h}=\text{softmax}(\bm{Q}_{h}\bm{K}_{h}^{T}/\sqrt{D})\bm{V}_{h}.\] (2)

To consolidate results from all attention heads, the output is given by

\[\text{SA}(\bm{Z})=\text{concat}([\text{Head}_{1},\text{Head}_{2},\cdots,\text {Head}_{H}])\bm{W}^{O},\] (3)

where \(\bm{W}^{O}\) is a learnable matrix dedicated to fusing the results of the different attention heads.

SA involves pairwise comparison of tokens, which is costly when directly working on all spatial tokens from a feature tensor. As an acceleration scheme, grid SA [41] grids the tensor of shape \((H,W,C)\) into the shape (\(G^{2}\), \(\frac{HW}{G^{2}}\), C) using a fixed \(G\times G\) uniform grid, resulting in windows with adaptive size \(\frac{H}{G}\times\frac{W}{G}\). Then SA is performed on the decomposed grid axis (_i.e._, \(G\times G\)), corresponding to dilated, global spatial mixing of tokens. See Figure 2 (a) for an illustration. Note that grid SA does not satisfy the blind-spot property.

Our DSA also uses the gridding trick for acceleration; see Figure 2(b) for the illustration. Instead of using a half-plane attention window (Figure1(b)), DSA employs a half-plane grid to reduce the number of compared tokens for \(\bm{p}\). Only a subset of equally spaced grids on the half-plane is involved, which lowers computational cost. To enhance diversity, adjacent tokens have different attention grids. For example, tokens of different colors correspond to different grids (Figure2 (b)). Each attention head shifts the grid differently, ensuring each token visits all grids in one pass.

Our DSA can effectively simulate different attention grids by rotating and shifting the input. Despite different definition of attention grid,, DSA and grid SA in our approach share the same parameters \(\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{Q}},\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{K}},\bm{W}_{h}^{\text{V}},\bm{W}_{h}{}_ {h}\), allowing the introduction of the Siamese structure into our SelfFormer.

### Architecture of SelfFormer

As illustrated in Figure 3, the proposed SelfFormer has a pseudo Siamese architecture consisting of two sub-NNs: SelfFormer-D (D for Directional) and SelfFormer-F (F for Full), both aiming at mapping an input noisy image to its clean counterpart. The SelfFormer-D consists of four branches, each performing DSA with one specific direction. The SelfFormer-F has only one branch which has the same structure as the branches in SelfFormer-D, except that its performs grid SA instead of DSA.

Each branch consists of six attention blocks (ABs) for performing DSA or grid SA, with two \(1\times 1\) convolutions at the beginning and end. The ABs are arranged in a U shape, with downsampling in the first half and upsampling in the second half. All branches in SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F share weights, except for the last \(1\times 1\) convolution. The last \(1\times 1\) convolution in SelfFormer-D integrates outputs from its four branches, resulting in a different input channel dimension from SelfFormer-F. Consequently, SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F have different structures but share identical learnable weights, except for the last layer, forming a pseudo-Siamese pair.

The pseudo-Siamese architecture benefits both training and testing. While SelfFormer-D's blind-spot mechanism aids self-supervised training to avoid overfitting, its restricted attention grid may weaken the utilization effectiveness of long-range dependency. In contrast, SelfFormer-F uses a full attention grid, avoiding this issue though losing the function of a BSN. Mutual learning between these sub-networks mitigates SelfFormer-D's structural bias, enhancing effectiveness. Additionally, SelfFormer-F utilizes a single path, as opposed to the four-path structure of SelfFormer-D, resulting in significantly faster performance. Due to these advantages, SelfFormer-F is employed for inference.

**Downsampling and upsampling:** The pairs of downsampling and upsampling used in SelfFormer can extend the receptive field in all directions. To maintain a blind-spot structure, we implement the same idea in [23] which attaches offsets to the downsampling layers. For a \(2\times 2\) average downsampling layer, we restrict the receptive field to extend upwards only by padding the input tensor with one row of zeros at top and cropping out the bottom row before operating downsampling.

**Attention blocks:** Each AB sequentially comprises a CA, a Feed-Forward Network (FFN), a DSA module, and another FFN. ABs involve multiple \(1\times 1\) convolutions and summation operations, which do not need specific treatment for blind-spot mechanism, as they neither change the receptive field nor spread information spatially. The CA is implemented as the NAFBlock [11] in SelfFormer-F, and we construct its blind-spot counterpart (called BSCA) for SelfFormer-D.

**Channel attention w/ and w/o blind-spot:** Channel attention re-calibrates global feature responses for primitive inputs by explicitly modeling inter-dependencies of channels, complementing the function of SA. We use NAFBlock [11] for channel attention, consisting of SimpleGate and Simplified Channel Attention (SCA). See Figure 3 for details. Given \(2\) feature tensors, \(\bm{X}_{1}\) and \(\bm{X}_{2}\), generated by two \(3\times 3\) convolutions on an input feature, SimpleGate outputs \(\bm{X}=\bm{X}_{1}\odot\bm{X}_{2}\), where \(\odot\) denotes element-wise multiplication, maintaining the receptive field. The \(3\times 3\) convolutions in SelfFormer-D are directional convolution [23] to own the blind-spot property. Then, SCA re-calibrates channels by multiplying each channel of \(\bm{X}\) with a weight scalar, calculated using a channel-wise Global Average Pooling (GAP) and a \(1\times 1\) convolution. As GAP squeezes all spatial values into a scalar and scale-multiplication do not spread spatial information, the SCA preserves the blind-spot property.

Figure 2: Illustration of grid SA and grid-based DSA. In grid SA, attention grids are scattered in all directions, with attention among tokens on same-colored grids. In DSA, attention grids are constrained to a half-plane, varying by token and attention head.

### Loss Function

The overall loss function consists of a self-reconstruction loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{self}}\) and a mutual learning loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{mutual}}\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{total}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{self}}+\lambda\mathcal{L}_{\text{ mutual}},\] (4)

where \(\lambda\) is set to \(1\). Let \(\bm{x}\) denote a noisy image. Let \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{D}},\mathcal{M}_{\text{F}}\) denote the models of SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F, respectively. The self-reconstruction loss is then defined by

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{self}}=\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}}||\mathcal{M}_{\text{D}}(\bm{x})- \bm{x}||_{1}.\] (5)

Due to the blind-sport structure of SelfFormer-D, \(\mathcal{M}_{\text{D}}\) trained with this loss will not converge to the trivial identity mapping, but rather an effective denoiser. The mutual loss is defined by

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{mutual}}=\mathbb{E}_{\bm{x}}||\mathcal{M}_{\text{D}}(\bm{x })-\mathcal{M}_{\text{F}}(\bm{x})||_{1}.\] (6)

This loss enables the regularization effect of the two sub-networks to each other, leading to better generalization performance.

## 4 Experiments

### Experimental setting

**Datasets:** Three widely-used real-world datasets are used for evaluation: SIDD [13], DND [14], and NIND [64]. SIDD is created by photographing a scene many times and using its mean as the GT clean image. The images of SIDD are captured by five different smartphone, and they are divided into non-overlapping subsets for training, validation, and test, respectively. As most works do, these samples are cropped into 24542 pairs of patches. the SIDD-Medium subset is chosen as training data, consisting of 320 noisy/clean image pairs. The validation subset, denoted by SIDD-Validation, consists of 1280 paired samples for hyper-parameter tuning and ablation study. The subset for test is denoted by SIDD-Benchmark, consisting of 1280 noisy samples. DND consists of 50 noisy-clean pairs, formed by shooting the same scene twice with different ISO values. The high-ISO images serve as noisy inputs and the corresponding low-ISO images serve as GT images. DND is used only for testing for performance evaluation. NIND is a real-world dataset consisting of clean-noisy image pairs captured at ISO levels of 3200, 4000, 5000, and 6400, with 22, 14, 13, and 79 pairs, respectively. For evaluation, we select ISO 3200 and ISO 5000, following the provided training/test split. Note

Figure 3: Architecture of the proposed SelfFormer.

that as the GTs of SIDD-Benchmark and DND are not accessible to users. All denoising results are uploaded to the official websites of these two datasets for calculating the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and the structural similarity (SSIM) index,

**Implementation details:** Our work is implemented on PyTorch1.10 and CUDA 11.8, which will be released upon paper acceptance. All experiments are conducted on an NVIDIA A6000 GPU. The grid size of SelfFormer-D is set to image size divided by \(8\), and it doubles for SelfFormer-F. To better address noise correlation, we mask out the \(4\times 4\) half-plane neighboring locations around the center pixel within the attention window of the DSA of SelfFormer-D during training. This ensures that the pixels used in the attention window are at a distance from the central pixel, thereby reducing the noise correlation as the distance between the pixels increases. SelfFormer-D is optimized using Adam with a learning rate of \(0.0001\), and that of SelfFormer-F is doubled. Other parameters of Adam are set to default. The entire model is trained for 30 epochs for full convergence.

### Performance Evaluation on Real-world Denoising

We include an extensive list of image denoisers for comparison: _(a) Two representative non-learning-based methods_: BM3D [65] and WNNM [66]; _(b) Three classic supervised denoisers trained on synthetic noisy data_: DnCNN [1], CBDNet [12] and Zhou _et al.[38]_; _(c) Five supervised denoisers trained on real-world noisy images of SIDD-Medium_: DnCNN [1], VDN [7], AINDNet(R) [9], DANet [8] and NAFNet [11]; _(d) Three unpaired learning methods_ GCBD [15], C2N+DIDN [16] and D-BSN+MWCNN [26]; _(e) Four zero-shot denoisers_: Self2Self [59], NoisyAsClean [60], ScoreDVI [62] and MASH [67]; and _(f) Twelve Self-supervised denoisers_: Noise2Void [21], Noise2Self [22], Laine _et al._[23], Recrorupted2Recrorupted (R2R) [45], CVF-SID [53], AP-BSN [27], LG-BPN [28], MM-BSN [40], SASL [39], SS-BSN [29], C-BSN [68], and PUCA [30].

Table 1 compares the quantitative results of different methods, where we mark in bold the best results among all methods that do not call any clean images for training, including the non-learning-based, zero-shot and self-supervised methods. It can be seen from Table 1 that our SelfFormer achieved the best results on all the benchmark datasets, in terms of both PSNR and SSIM.

R2R and input-masking-based BSNs, including Noise2Void, Noise2Self, and Laine _et al._'s, rely heavily on the spatial independence of noise, resulting in poor performance on real-world images with locally-correlated noise. In contrast, SelfFormer leverages interactions of distant pixels via its transformer architecture during training, leading to significant performance gains. Compared to AP-BSN, MM-BSN, SASL, and PUCA, SelfFormer's superior performance comes from utilizing the transformer's long-range perception capability for relating distant pixels.

Regarding SA-based BSNs, including LG-BSN and SS-BSN, our SelfFormer performs noticeably better than LG-BSN. Although SS-BSN matches SelfFormer in SSIM on SIDD, its PSNR performance on DND is noticeably worse. These results confirm the higher effectiveness of our SSA module compared to the dilated SA in LG-BSN and the plain grid SA in SS-BSN.

**Visual comparison:** Refer to Figure 4 for a visualization of denoising results from top BSN-based methods. We selecte the images with richly textured regions from SIDD-benchmark and DND for comparison. Laine _et al._failed to break spatial noise correlation, resulting in undesirable denoising. While achieving adequate global denoising, AP-BSN and LG-BPN generate artifacts, and PUCA smooths out some details. We successfully recovers the detailed texture of the clean image by proposed DSA. Unlike SIDD-Benchmark and DND, the SIDD-Validation provides GT images and we choose some images of it for evaluation. See Figure 5 for a visual comparison of these images relies on global information. Both AP-BSN and LG-BPN fail to separate spatial noise from image details, leading to deficient denoising. In contrast, SelfFormer-F effectively eliminate spatial correlation noise while preventing the creation of erroneous flat regions.

**Computational complexity:** Table 2 compares the computational complexity of transformer-based self-supervised denoisers and top CNN-based denoiser, in terms of model size (number of parameters) and inference time for a \(256\times 256\) image. SelfFormer has a smaller size than the second-best performer, PUCA, and is much faster than transformer-based methods: LG-BPN and SS-BSN.

### Ablation Studies

Following existing works, we conduct the ablation study on SIDD-Validation. We consider four baselines, summarized in Table 3. (a) DSA\(\rightarrow\)Grid SA: The effectiveness of DSA is tested by replacing it with grid SA in SelfFormer-D and reducing the branch number to one, resulting in a true Siamese pair structure similar to SelfFormer-S. Despite some performance gain from mutual learning, this baseline performs significantly worse than the original model. This is due to the arbitrary feature flow, which loses the blind-spot property. (b) w/o CA: We replace all BSCA (CA) modules with DSA (Grid SA) modules. (c) Only SelfFormer-D: We train SelfFormer-D without \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{mutual}}\) and test with it. Without the Siamese structure and mutual learning, the performance noticeably decreases due to the limitations of the constrained attention grids in SelfFormer and the loss of regularization from mutual learning. (d) Only SelfFormer-F: We train SelfFormer-F only using \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{self}}\) and test with it. Lacking any blind-spot mechanism and regularization from mutual learning, this network performs very poorly, indicating overfitting to noisy image. (e) w/o DSA: All DSA (Grid SA) modules are replaced with the BSCA (CA) modules. Since the blind spot property is preserved, the performance remains better than "Only SelfFormer-F", which lacks this property. (f) w/o WeightShare: In this case, the SelfFormer-D and SelfFormer-F do not share weight, leading to a performance loss. This suggests that the weight sharing not only reduces the the number of parameters but also provides a regularization effect.

Table 4 shows the experimental results on SIDD-Validation, with varying grid sizes and loss function weight \(\lambda\). The results indicate that increasing the grid size can improve performance, as more pixels are utilized in DSA and grid SA. However, setting the loss weight \(\lambda\) too small or too large results in a noticeable decrease in performance.

## 5 Conclusion

We presented a transformer-based self-supervised framework for real-world image denoising, optimizing its performance by exploiting distant pixel interactions in transformer to reduce noise correlation. Our key innovation is a DSA module using a half-plane grid for SA, creating a blind-spot structure. A Siamese architecture with mutual learning addressed the performance impact caused by the restricted attention grid in DSA. Experiments on benchmark datasets show our method outperforms existing self-supervised and clean-image-free methods.

While SelfFormer outperforms all related self-supervised denoisers, transformer-based models generally incur higher computational costs compared to CNN-based models. Additionally, there remains a significant performance gap between SelfFormer and supervised denoisers. In the future, we aim to improve both the performance and efficiency of transformer-based denoiser.

Appendix

### Broader Impacts

The proposed self-supervised learning method for denoising images has the potential to impact a wide range of applications, including surveillance security, scientific research, and digital media restoration. By improving the signal-to-noise ratio of images, our research can facilitate deeper insights and more effective interventions in these fields. In surveillance, higher clarity images can enhance public safety by providing more detailed visual information. However, this also raises concerns about privacy and the potential for mass surveillance. In scientific research, improved image quality can lead to better data and more significant discoveries, though there is a risk that overly processed images could misrepresent the original data. In digital media restoration, while the technique helps preserve cultural heritage, it also poses the risk of altering historical records. Despite these possible concerns, our goal is to contribute to enhancing image clarity in critical areas such as public safety, scientific research, and cultural preservation. We emphasize the responsible application and continuous improvement of this technology to mitigate potential risks and maximize its positive impact.

### Additional Results

For further analysis, we conducted an additional quantitative comparison on the SIDD-Validation dataset, as shown in Table A1. Moreover, we provide a detailed complexity comparison in Table A2, demonstrating that our method's memory usage during inference is lower than that of the other two related transformer-based methods, particularly when compared to LG-BPN. However, due to the inclusion of SelfFormer-D, which incorporates multiple paths for DSA, the memory usage of our method during training remains relatively high. This confirms one of our key motivations for introducing the pseudo-Siamese architecture, namely to significantly reduce memory consumption from the training phase to inference. For additional visual comparisons on DND, SIDD Validation and SIDD-Benchmark, please refer to Fig A1, A2, and A3.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The claims are consistent with the contributions and scope as detailed in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitations are discussed in the section 5. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA]Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We describe the proposed architecture clearly in section 3. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [No]  Justification: Our code will be released upon paper's acceptance. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Detailed experimental settings are provided in section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: When we wanted to conduct experiments on statistical significance, the evaluation server has been down up to now. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Information on compute resources is provided in the section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Both positive and negative societal impacts are discussed in the section A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release high-risk data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the original papers in section 4 and respect their CC-BY-SA Licenses. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: No new assets are introduced in the paper. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing or research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
