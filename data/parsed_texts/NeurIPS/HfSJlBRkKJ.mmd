###### Abstract

Image Restoration (IR) methods based on a pre-trained diffusion model have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, they have two fundamental limitations: 1) they often assume that the degradation operator is completely known and 2) they alter the diffusion sampling process, which may result in restored images that do not lie onto the data manifold. To address these issues, we propose Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion (BIRD) a blind IR method that jointly optimizes for the degradation model parameters and the restored image. To ensure that the restored images lie onto the data manifold, we propose a novel sampling technique on a pre-trained diffusion model. A key idea in our method is not to modify the reverse sampling, _i.e._, not to alter all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. This is ultimately equivalent to casting the IR task as an optimization problem in the space of the input noise. Moreover, to mitigate the computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using large time steps. We experimentally validate BIRD on several image restoration tasks and show that it achieves state of the art performance. Project page: https://hamadichihaoui.github.io/BIRD.

## 1 Introduction

Recent advances in generative learning due to the development of diffusion models [7; 18] have led to models capable of generating detailed and realistic high-resolution images. In addition to their data generation capabilities, these models also provide an implicit representation of the distribution of the data they train on, which can be used for other applications, such as image restoration (IR). Indeed, several approaches have emerged to solve inverse problems using pre-trained diffusion models [8; 11; 21]. Those approaches start from a random noise vector as the diffusion input and introduce a projection after each diffusion reverse step to enforce the consistency with the corrupted image. As shown by Chung [3] this procedure alters the original diffusion sampling process, and may cause the generated image to leave the data manifold during the iterative denoising process, which ultimately results in unrealistic image samples. Moreover, most of these methods are non-blind as they assume to have full knowledge of the degradation model, which is not practical in real-world applications.

To overcome all these challenges, we propose a novel blind image restoration method that jointly optimizes the degradation model parameters and the restored image only at test time (and thus separately for each new image). We call this method BIRD, which stands for Blind Image Restoration via fast Diffusion inversion. Since BIRD does not need to pre-train a model for the degradation operator, it can be used immediately on a wide range of IR tasks such as Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution and denoising (see Figure 2). In this work, we show that having a strong image prior and ensuring that the restored image never leaves the data manifold during the reconstruction process are fundamental properties to generalize to a wide range of image degradation problems. As shown in Figure 1, BIRD (see (f) to (i)) reconstructs realistic images at each iteration, while BlindDPS (see (b) to (e)) may initially reconstruct non realistic images. We observe that eventhough we have a more primitive blur reconstruction procedure (we directly regress the motion blur kernel), the reconstructed image is still more similar to the ground truth one (see column (1)) than the final image estimate from BlindDPS (see (e) top), which uses a quite accurate blur kernel estimate (see (e) bottom). This speaks of the importance of defining a strong image prior first and foremost.

To define the image prior, BIRD uses a pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) [17] and exploits the existing deterministic correspondence between noise and images in DDIMs by casting the inverse restoration problem as a latent estimation problem, _i.e_., where the latent variable is the input noise to the diffusion model. In contrast to prior work, we do not alter the reverse sampling, _i.e_., all the intermediate latents, once an initial noise is sampled. To then apply our image prior, we cast the IR task as an alternating optimization between the unknown restored image and the unknown parameters of the degradation model. However, a direct implementation of the optimization procedure in the case of a diffusion model used as a black box would be computationally demanding and ultimately impractical. To mitigate the substantial computational cost associated with inverting a fully unrolled diffusion model, we leverage, for the first time in IR tasks, the inherent capability of these models to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process using arbitrarily large time steps. We show that our method is able to achieve state of the art performance across a wide range of blind image restoration tasks. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows

1. BIRD is the first to cast an IR task as a latent optimization problem (where only the initial noise is optimized) in the context of diffusion models; our optimization procedure aims at generating images that lie on the data manifold at every iteration;
2. BIRD is computationally efficient; we propose a fast diffusion model inversion in the context of image restoration, without fine-tuning nor retraining;
3. We achieve state of the art results on CelebA and ImageNet for different blind IR tasks, such as Gaussian and motion deblurring, super-resolution, and denoising.

## 2 Related Work

Blind and non-blind image restoration methods.An image restoration task is often cast as an inverse problem, where the degradation model is explicitly known. For example, in image deblurring the degradation model can be described by a convolution with a blur kernel. Methods that explicitly assume the exact knowledge of the blur kernel are called _non-blind_ methods. More general methods that assume only knowledge of the type of degradation (_e.g_., blurring), but not the values of its parameters, are instead called _blind_. Some recent examples of non-blind methods are [3] and DPS [2]. [3] points out that relying on an iterative procedure consisting of reverse diffusion steps and a projection-based consistency step runs the risk of stepping outside of the data manifold, a risk they mitigate using an additional correction term. DPS [2] proposes a more general framework to handle both the non-linear and noisy cases. DDNM [21] proposes a zero-shot framework for

From (b) to (e): The top row shows the predictions of BlindDPS [1] as the iterations increase; the bottom row shows the corresponding estimated blur kernel. From (f) to (i): Same estimates as in (b) to (e), but obtained from BIRD, our proposed method. (j) is the ground truth sharp image (top) and ground truth blur kernel (bottom). Notice that BlindDPS [1] trains a score-based model for the kernel estimation, while BIRD does not use any training and can adapt to any new kernel directly at test time. BIRD yields always natural images at every iteration of the reconstruction procedure. Finally, notice that despite recovering a suboptimal blur kernel, the image reconstructed with BIRD is more similar to the ground truth image than with BlindDPS thanks to the robustness of our image generation procedure.

IR tasks based on the range-null space decomposition. The method works by refining only the null-space contents during the reverse diffusion process, to satisfy both data consistency and realness. Some recent examples of blind methods are GDP [6] and BlindDPS [1]. GDP leverages DDPM and solve inverse problems via hierarchical guidance and a patch-based method. BlindDPS proposes an extension of [2] to the case of blind deblurring. They train a score-based diffusion model for the blur operator. At test-time, they jointly optimize for both the sharp image and blur operator by running the reverse diffusion process. However, training a model for each new degradation operator can be time-consuming. Fast Diffusion EM [9] proposes a method for blind image deblurring. It applies the Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm after each reverse diffusion step to jointly update the image latent and blur kernel. Gibbsdrm [13] extends DDRM [8] to the blind case by adopting a Gibbs sampler to enable efficient sampling from the posterior distribution. In contrast to these works, in BIRD we introduce a blind image restoration method based on a novel diffusion inversion for DDIM. Our method is computationally efficient, as it requires only a few reverse diffusion steps, and generates realistic samples by only estimating the initial noise.

**Methods based on GAN inversion.** Since our proposed method is based on inverting a diffusion process, we also briefly review related work in the literature and discuss how it differs from our approach. Because Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were among the best image generation models, a number of methods [14, 15, 22, 23] inverts pre-trained GANs to solve image restoration problems. DGPGAN [14] performs the GAN inversion on a single new corrupted image. The authors shows that the inversion is not easily obtainable just with the direct optimization of the latent input to the frozen GANs model. Thus, they propose to also fine-tune the (unfrozen) GAN, while optimizing for the latent vector. [23] instead train an encoder to invert a pre-trained GANs on a

Figure 2: We demonstrate BIRD on several **blind** image restoration problems (_i.e._, when the values of the degradation model are unknown): Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, superresolution (SR) (it includes additional Gaussian blur) and denoising with an unknown noise distribution. BIRD is applicable to a single degraded image and does not require re-training or fine-tuning of the prior model (we use a diffusion model). Although some of the generated degraded images use Gaussian blur, BIRD recovers a generic blur kernel (without making any Gaussianity assumption).

dataset of corrupted images (through masking). At test time they directly apply the trained encoder and the GANs on a new corrupted image without further training. BIRD shares the aim of inverting a generative model with the above prior work. However, as demonstrated in the literature for inverting GANs models, the inversion of generative models is far from a straightforward task. Moreover, the inversion of GANs and diffusion models are fundamentally different in nature. For example, while GANs generate samples in "one forward pass" diffusion models require multiple (denoising) steps. Also, all IR methods based on GAN inversion either optimize the intermediate layers of the generator [4], train an auxiliary network (_e.g._, an encoder), or fine-tune the pre-trained GAN network. In our method, the diffusion model is not fine-tuned/trained.

## 3 Image Restoration via BIRD

In this section, we introduce the classic Bayesian formulation of inverse problems applied to a single degraded image. An important component in this formulation is the characterization of the image prior, which we do via DDIM diffusion models.

### Problem Formulation

Image restoration (IR) can be cast as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) optimization problem [24]

\[\hat{x}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x}\log p(y|x)+\log p(x),\] (1)

where \(\hat{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_{x}}\) is the restored image of size \(N_{x}\times M_{x}\) pixels, \(y\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{y}\times M_{y}}\) is the degraded image of size \(N_{y}\times M_{y}\) pixels, where \(p(y|x)\) is the so-called _likelihood_ and \(p(x)\) the _prior_ distribution. Inverse problems describe IR tasks with a degradation operator \(H_{\eta}:\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_{x}}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{N_{y}\times M_ {y}}\) and a noise image \(n\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{y}\times M_{y}}\), such that the observed degraded image \(y\) can be written as

\[y=H_{\eta}(x)+n.\] (2)

\(\eta\) is a vector with all the parameters that define the operator \(H_{\eta}\). IR tasks such as image denoising, deblurring and super-resolution can all be described using specific choices of \(H_{\eta}\). For instance, in the case of image deblurring, the \(H_{\eta}\) operator can be described as a convolution with a blur kernel \(k\) such that \(H_{\eta}(x)\doteq k*x\), where \(*\) denotes the convolution operation. In the blind deblurring problem, one assumes that \(H_{\eta}\) takes the form of a convolution, but without knowing its parameters \(\eta\), which, in this case, are the values of the true blur kernel \(k\). Thus, we also need to estimate the parameters \(\eta\) as part of the optimization procedure. Only in the special case of image denoising we do use \(H_{\eta}\) as the identity function. By assuming that the noise \(n\) is zero mean Gaussian in the MAP formulation, one can rewrite eq. (1) as

\[\hat{x},\hat{\eta}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_ {x}},\eta}\|y-H_{\eta}(x)\|^{2}+\lambda\mathcal{R}(x),\] (3)

where \(\mathcal{R}(x)\) is also called a _regularization_ term, and \(\lambda>0\) is a coefficient that regulates the interplay between the likelihood and the prior. We define \(\Omega_{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_{x}}\) as the (compact) set of degradation-free (realistic) images and we propose employing a formulation that implicitly assumes a uniform

Figure 3: Illustration of our proposed accelerated image sampling of the pre-trained DDIM. (a) initial noise \(x_{T}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\) (\(T=1000\)). (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) are samples \(x_{0}\) generated using \(\text{DDIMReverse}(x_{T},\delta t)\) with \(\delta t=100,50,20,1\) respectively. Notice how the generated images are all realistic regardless of the choice of the step size \(\delta t\).

prior \(p(x)\doteq p_{U}(x)\) on \(\Omega_{x}\). That is, \(\mathcal{R}(x)=-\log(p_{U}(x))=-\log(\mathsf{c}\cdot\mathds{1}_{\Omega_{x}}(x))\), where \(c\) is a normalizing constant and \(\mathds{1}_{\Omega_{x}}(x)\) is 1 if \(x\) is in the support of \(\Omega_{x}\) and 0 otherwise.

This results in the following simplified formulation

\[\hat{x},\hat{\eta}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{x\in\Omega_{x},\eta}\|y-H_{\eta}( x)\|^{2}.\] (4)

To ensure that \(x\in\Omega_{x}\), we parameterize \(x\) via the initial noise \(z\) of a pre-trained diffusion model \(g:\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_{x}}\to\mathbb{R}^{N_{x}\times M_{x}}\) trained by mapping noise samples from the high-density region of the standard Normal distribution (that we denote \(\Omega_{z}\)) to the domain of degradation-free (realistic) images \(\Omega_{x}\). In other words, we assume that \(\Omega_{x}=\{g(z)\}\big{|}_{z\in\Omega_{z}}\). The optimization objective eq. (4) becomes then

\[\hat{z},\hat{\eta}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{z\in\Omega_{z},\eta}\|y-H_{\eta} (g(z))\|^{2},\] (5)

with \(\hat{x}=g(\hat{z})\). In high dimensions, \(\frac{1}{N_{x}M_{x}}\|z\|^{2}\approx\mathbb{E}[zz^{\top}]=\text{variance}(z)=1\) as \(N_{x}M_{x}\mapsto\infty\). In fact, most of the density of a high-dimensional Normal random variable is around \(\|z\|^{2}=N_{x}M_{x}\)[12; 20]. Therefore, we propose to approximate the original problem (3) with

\[\hat{z},\hat{\eta}=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{z:\|z\|^{2}=N_{x}M_{x},\eta}\|y- H_{\eta}(g(z))\|^{2}.\] (6)

### An Efficient Diffusion Inversion

In problem (6), we implement the function \(g\) by adopting a pre-trained diffusion model. We choose the Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) [17] and set it as a fully deterministic diffusion process. To solve problem (6), we propose an optimization-based iterative procedure. We jointly estimate a realistic image \(x\) (_i.e._, with a high \(p(x)\)) and the forward degradation model \(H_{y}\) such that \(H_{\eta}(x)\approx y\). In order to find \(x\), we explicitly exploit the correspondence between image samples \(x\) and their associated initial latent image \(z\) in DDIMs, in contrast to the mappings used in prior work [8; 11; 21]. Thus, we aim to find the initial noise sample \(z\) that can generate the image \(x\) when applied to DDIM. To keep the notation consistent with the DDIM formalism, we denote images \(x\) with \(x_{0}\) and the samples \(z\) with \(x_{T}\), where \(T\) is the number of iterations in the diffusion model. To make our presentation self-contained, we briefly revise the notation and notions of diffusion models.

#### 3.2.1 Background: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic and Implicit Models

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) [7] leverage diffusion processes in order to generate high quality image samples. The aim is to reverse the forward diffusion process that maps images to noise, either by relying on a stochastic iterative denoising process or by learning the explicit dynamics of the reverse process, _e.g._, through an ODE [17]. More precisely the forward diffusion process maps an image \(x_{0}\sim p(x)\) to a zero-mean Gaussian \(x_{T}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\) by generating intermediate images \(x_{t}\) for \(t\in[1,T]\) which are progressively noisier versions of \(x_{0}\). DDPM [7] adopts a Markovian diffusion process, where \(x_{t}\) only depends on \(x_{t-1}\). Given a non-increasing sequence \(\alpha_{1:T}\in(0,1]\), the joint and marginal distributions of the forward diffusion process are described by

\[q(x_{1:T}|x_{0})=\prod_{t=1}^{T}q(x_{t}|x_{t-1}),\text{ where }q(x_{t}|x_{t-1})= \mathcal{N}\Bigg{(}\sqrt{\alpha_{t}}x_{t-1},\Big{(}1-\alpha_{t}\Big{)}\mathbf{ I}\Bigg{)},\] (7)

which implies that we can sample \(x_{t}\) simply by conditioning on \(x_{0}\) with \(\bar{\alpha}_{t}=\prod_{s\leq t}\alpha_{s}\) via

\[q(x_{t}|x_{0})=\mathcal{N}\Big{(}\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}x_{0},(1-\bar{\alpha} _{t})\mathbf{I}\Big{)}.\] (8)

To invert the forward process, one can train a model \(\epsilon_{\theta}\), with parameters \(\theta\), to minimize the objective

\[\min_{\theta}\ \ \mathbb{E}_{t\sim\mathcal{U}(0,1);x_{0}\sim q(x); \epsilon\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})}\Big{[}\|\epsilon-\epsilon_{\theta}( \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}x_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}\epsilon,t)\|^{2}\Big{]}.\] (9)

Given the initial noise \(x_{T}\), image samples \(x_{0}\) are obtained by iterating for \(t\in[1,T]\) the denoising update

\[x_{t-1}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\alpha_{t}}}\bigg{(}x_{t}-\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t) \times\frac{(1-\alpha_{t})}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}}\bigg{)}+\sigma_{t}z,\] (10)

with \(z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\), and \(\sigma_{t}^{2}=\frac{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}(1-\alpha_{t})\).

The authors of [17] point out that the quality of generated images improves as the total number of denoising steps \(T\) increases. Thus, the inference loop using eq. (10) becomes computationally expensive. To reduce the computational cost, they propose to use instead

\[q(x_{1:T}|x_{0})\ =\ q(x_{T}|x_{0})\prod_{t=2}^{T}q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0}),\] (11)

a Denoising Diffusion Implicit Model (DDIM) [17], which foregoes the Markovian assumption in favor of a diffusion process where \(q(x_{T}|x_{0})=\mathcal{N}\Big{(}\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{T}}x_{0},(1-\bar{\alpha}_ {T})\mathbf{I}\Big{)}\) and

\[q(x_{t-1}|x_{t},x_{0})=\mathcal{N}\Bigg{(}\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}x_{0}+ \sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}-\sigma_{t}^{2}}.\frac{(x_{t}-\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t} }x_{0})}{\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}},\sigma_{t}^{2}\mathbf{I}\Bigg{)}.\] (12)

Figure 4: Reconstruction results using BIRD on samples from CelebA and ImageNet validation datasets. The PSNR mean and standard deviation are computed over 10 runs.

When \(\sigma_{t}=0\) for all \(t\), the diffusion process is **fully deterministic**. This means that when we start from the same noise sample \(x_{T}\) we obtain the same generated image sample. Given \(x_{t}\), one can first predict the denoised observation \(\hat{x}_{0}\), which is a prediction of \(x_{0}\) given \(x_{t}\)

\[\hat{x}_{0}=\frac{(x_{t}-\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t))}{ \sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}}.\] (13)

Then, we can predict \(x_{t-1}\) from \(x_{t}\) and \(\hat{x}_{0}\) using eq. (12) by setting \(\sigma_{t}=0\)

\[x_{t-1}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}\hat{x}_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t-1}}\hat{\omega}\] (14)

with \(\hat{\omega}=\frac{x_{t}-\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}\hat{x}_{0}}{\sqrt{1-\bar{ \alpha}_{t}}}\) a direction pointing to \(x_{t}\). [17] shows that this formulation allows DDIM to use fewer time steps at inference by directly predicting \(x_{t-\tau}\) with \(\tau>1\), which results in a more computationally efficient process using

\[x_{t-\tau}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-\tau}}\hat{x}_{0}+\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t- \tau}}\hat{\omega}.\] (15)

#### 3.2.2 Accelerated DDIM Sampling

As previously mentioned, we adopt DDIMs as our pre-trained generative process. Here, we explore the advantage of DDIMs of allowing fewer steps than in other diffusion models during the sampling process, as discussed in section 3.2.1. We start from \(x_{T}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\). Instead of denoising \(x_{T}\) iteratively for all the steps used in the pre-training, we make larger steps by using intermediate estimates of \(\hat{x}_{0|t}\) from \(x_{t}\) using the pre-trained DDIM model \(\epsilon_{\theta}\) via

\[\hat{x}_{0|t}=\frac{x_{t}-\sqrt{1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}}\epsilon_{\theta}(x_{t},t)} {\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}}.\] (16)

We define the hyper-parameter \(\delta t\) that controls the number of denoising steps, and we can directly jump to estimate \(x_{t-\delta t}\) from \(\hat{x}_{0|t}\) and \(x_{t}\) using

\[x_{t-\delta t}=\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t-\delta t}}\hat{x}_{0|t}+\sqrt{1-\bar{ \alpha}_{t-\delta t}}.\frac{x_{t}-\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_{t}}\hat{x}_{0|t}}{\sqrt{1 -\bar{\alpha}_{t}}}.\] (17)

A larger step size \(\delta t\) allows us to favor speed, while a lower one favors precision or fidelity. This iterative procedure, which we summarize in Algorithm 2, results in an estimate of \(x_{0}\) that is differentiable in \(x_{T}\). We denote by \(\text{DDIMReverse}(.,\delta t)\) the mapping function between \(x_{T}\) and \(x_{0}\) that is parameterized with the step size \(\delta t\) (this is essentially our choice of \(g\) in problem (6)). Figure 3 shows sampled images \(x_{0}\) using different \(\delta t\) starting from the same initial noise \(x_{T}\) through \(\text{DDIMReverse}(.,\delta t)\).

Figure 5: Qualitative comparisons of \(4\times\) SR on ImageNet. Each column shows two examples. From left to right: input low-resolution images, GDP [6], BlindDPS [1], BIRD (our method), and the ground truth (GT) high-resolution and noise-free image.

#### 3.2.3 BIRD: Blind Image Restoration via Fast Diffusion Inversion

BIRD performs an iterative minimization of problem (6) with a running index \(k\), which we append as a superscript to the estimated unknowns. It starts from an initial noise instance \(x_{T}^{0}\sim\mathcal{N}(0,\mathbf{I})\) and a parametric degradation model \(H_{\eta^{0}}\), where \(\eta^{0}\) is randomly initialized. At each iteration \(k\), we first compute our estimate of the clean image \(x_{0}^{k}\) by mapping \(x_{T}^{k}\) through \(\text{DDIMReverse}(.,\delta t)\)

\[x_{0}^{k}=\text{DDIMReverse}(x_{T}^{k},\delta t).\] (18)

We then compute the restoration loss

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{IR}}(x_{0}^{k},H_{\eta})=\|y-H_{\eta}(x_{0}^{k})\|^{2}.\] (19)

Given an initial noise \(x_{T}^{k}\) and \(H_{\eta^{k}}\), the optimization iteration is simply derived through gradient descent with a learning rate \(\alpha\)

\[x_{T}^{k+1}=x_{T}^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{x_{T}}\mathcal{L}_{\text{IR}}(x_{0}^{k},H_ {\eta^{k}})\quad\text{and}\quad\eta^{k+1}=\eta^{k}-\alpha\nabla_{\eta} \mathcal{L}_{\text{IR}}(x_{0}^{k},H_{\eta^{k}}).\] (20)

To impose the normalization constraint on \(x_{T}\) we set its Euclidean norm to \(\|x_{T}\|=\sqrt{N_{x}M_{x}}\) via

\[x_{T}^{k+1}=\frac{x_{T}^{k+1}}{\|x_{T}^{k+1}\|}\sqrt{N_{x}M_{x}}.\] (21)

After \(N\) iterations, or when \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{IR}}(x_{0}^{N},H_{\eta^{N}})\) becomes small enough, we deem that BIRD has converged. The restored image \(\hat{x}_{0}\) is then generated by \(\hat{x}_{0}=\text{DDIMReverse}(x_{T}^{N},\delta t)\), which always ensures that \(\hat{x}_{0}\) is within the manifold of realistic images, as already shown in Figure 3. Moreover, in Figure 4 we show two examples of the reconstruction with \(H_{\eta}(x)=x\) and with \(y\) un-corrupted noise-free images from the validation dataset of ImageNet [5] and CelebA [10]. We summarize this iterative procedure in Algorithm 1.

## 4 Experiments

### Image Restoration Tasks

We showcase BIRD on four different image restoration tasks: Gaussian and motion deblurring, denoising, and image super-resolution (SR). For Gaussian deblurring, we use an anisotropic Gaussian

Figure 7: Qualitative comparisons of image denoising on CelebA. From left to right: input noisy image, GDP [6], BlindDPS [1], BIRD and the original image (GT).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

shows how BIRD results in a significantly faster execution. Despite being an iterative method, BIRD has a reasonable runtime making it a practical IR method. The reported speed uses \(\delta t=100\).

### Limitations and Broader Impacts

We have evaluated our method on degradation operators with a given explicit parametrized form (albeit with unknown parameters). It would be interesting to further investigate the use of BIRD on problems where an explicit form of the degradation operator is difficult to have, such as in image deraining and dehazing. In terms of broader impacts, BIRD leverages pre-trained denoising diffusion models with both their advantages and pitfalls. It takes advantage of their strong prior, but may also be affected by their data-induced biases.

## 5 Conclusion

We have introduced BIRD, a novel robust, accurate and fast framework for solving general blind image restoration tasks by using pre-trained diffusion generative models as learned priors. Our method exploits the deterministic correspondence between noise and images in DDIM by casting the inverse restoration problem as a latent estimation problem. Our framework does not require training networks on specific task, but can instead be directly applied to new images and new degradation models. We leverage the capability of DDIM to skip ahead in the forward diffusion process and provide an efficient diffusion inversion in the context of image restoration. We demonstrate that BIRD achieves state of the art performance on blind image restoration tasks including Gaussian deblurring, motion deblurring, super-resolution and denoising.

### Application of BIRD to non-blind cases

Naturally, BIRD can also be applied to non-blind cases, _i.e._, when the degradation operator is completely known. In Figure 8, we show the application of BIRD to some non-blind image restoration tasks such as image inpainting and sparse-view CT image reconstruction.

### Robustness of BIRD to severe degradation

BIRD is also robust to severe degradation. In Figure 9, we show that BIRD is more robust in the case of face hallucination (\(\times 16\) super-resolution). BIRD outperforms the other methods in terms of visual quality as well as faithfulness.

### Robustness of BIRD to errors in the degradation operator estimate

Non-blind methods generally rely on off-the-shelf methods to estimate the degradation operator. These off-the-shelf methods are not 100% accurate. We simulate a small error in the degradation operator and we use the simulated kernel (plus this error) to generate the restored image for the non-blind DPS [2] and BIRD. As shown in Figure 10, BIRD produces better quality outputs compared to the non-blind method DPS when using the kernel with a slightly simulated error.

Figure 8: BIRD can also be applied to non-blind tasks. In particular, notice the special case of sparse-view CT image reconstruction (rightmost two columns), where the measurements are not in the image domain (on the top row we show the reprojections of the measurements). First row: Measurements. Second row: BIRD reconstructions. Third row: Ground-truth data.

Figure 10: Robustness to errors in the degradation operator estimate. First column: ground-truth kernel (std=8.5) and a kernel with a slightly simulated error (std=8). Second column: blurry images using the kernel with a slightly simulated error. Third and fourth columns: Output of DPS and BIRD. Fifth column: Ground-truth.

Figure 9: Robustness to severe degradation (Face hallucination, \(\times 16\) superresolution). BIRD is more robust to severe degradations than competing methods, both in terms of visual image quality and faithfulness.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We claim that defining an image prior such that restored images during the iterative process are realistic is fundamental to have a robust and accurate IR method. Our experiments on several IR tasks support this claim. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See at the end of the Experiments section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA]  Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the training details and we provide the code in the Supplementary. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide the code in the Supplementary. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include the training details at the beginning of the Experiments section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We follow the similar recent papers in the IR field that don't include statistical significance of the experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We include such information in table 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and we respect it. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See at the end of the Experiments section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We don't release any data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
