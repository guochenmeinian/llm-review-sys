###### Abstract

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they are susceptible to jailbreak attacks and can be manipulated to produce harmful outputs. Recently, a growing body of research has categorized jailbreak attacks into token-level and prompt-level attacks. However, previous work primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. To address these issues, we introduced **JailTrickBench** to evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework. Specifically, we evaluate the eight key factors of implementing jailbreak attacks on LLMs from both target-level and attack-level perspectives. We further conduct seven representative jailbreak attacks on six defense methods across two widely used datasets, encompassing approximately 354 experiments with about 55,000 GPU hours on A800-80G. Our experimental results highlight the need for standardized benchmarking to evaluate these attacks on defense-enhanced LLMs. Our code is available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/JailTrickBench.

## 1 Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in executing complex tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. These attacks manipulate

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:2]

level attacks [3; 4; 9; 10; 40; 41; 42; 43; 44; 45] leverage semantic manipulation and automated prompt-generation methods to craft adversarial prompts that exploit the model's vulnerabilities. For example, PAIR [3] constructs the attacker and target model through the iterative refinement of the original prompt by getting the feedback from the target model to iterative refine the adversarial prompt.

**Defenses Against Jailbreak Attacks.** To counteract jailbreak attacks, a variety of defense mechanisms [46; 15; 47; 48; 49; 27; 28; 50; 51] have been introduced recently. These defenses can be broadly categorized into system-level and model-level strategies. System-level defenses [15; 24; 47; 48; 52; 53; 54] implement external safety measures for both input and output. For example, SmoothLLM [48] generates multiple outputs from varied jailbreaking prompts and uses majority voting to select the safest response. For the model-level defense [26; 27; 28; 55; 56; 57; 58; 59; 60], the defense strategies involve directly modifying the LLM to reduce its susceptibility to malicious inputs. For example, safety training [61; 55; 62] involves incorporating safety-specific datasets during the tuning phases to strengthen the model against harmful instructions.

**Benchmark of Jailbreak Attack on LLMs.** Jailbreak attacks on LLMs exploit vulnerabilities to generate harmful, unethical, or unwanted content. Recent studies and benchmarks [18; 19; 20; 63; 64; 65; 66] have systematically evaluated the robustness of LLMs against these attacks, contributing significantly to the field. For instance, JailbreakBench [19] is a centralized benchmark designed to standardize jailbreak attack evaluations. It includes a repository of adversarial prompts, a standardized evaluation framework, and a performance leaderboard. Additionally, JailBreakV-28K [63] extends the evaluation to multimodal large language models [67; 68] (MLLMs) using a dataset of 28,000 test cases that combine text and image-based attacks, highlighting vulnerabilities in MLLMs [69]. Although comprehensive benchmarks and diverse attack methodologies are crucial for understanding and mitigating jailbreak attack risks on LLMs, previous work [18; 19; 20; 63; 70] primarily overlooks the diverse key factors of jailbreak attacks, with most studies concentrating on LLM vulnerabilities and lacking exploration of defense-enhanced LLMs. In this work, we evaluate the impact of various attack settings on LLM performance and provide a baseline benchmark for jailbreak attacks, encouraging the adoption of a standardized evaluation framework.

## 3 Preliminaries

### Large Language Model

The LLMs [61; 71] are in a self-auto-regressive manner to predict sequences based on previously provided tokens. Assume \(\mathbf{x}_{1:n}\) is the tokens sequence, where each token \(x_{i}\) belongs to the vocabulary set \(\{1,\cdots,V\}\), with \(|V|\) being the vocabulary size. The goal of LLM is to predict the next token in the sequence, which can be represented as:

\[P_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{y}|\mathbf{x}_{1:n})=P_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}_{n+ i}|\mathbf{x}_{1:n+i-1}),\] (1)

where \(P_{\pi_{\theta}}(\mathbf{x}_{n+i}|\mathbf{x}_{1:n+i-1})\) is the probability of the next token \(\mathbf{x}_{n+i}\) given the preceding tokens \(\mathbf{x}_{1:n+i-1}\). The model \(\pi_{\theta}\) is parameterized by \(\theta\), and \(\mathbf{y}\) represents the output sequence.

### Threat Model

**Objective of Jailbreak Attack.** The primary goal of a jailbreak attack is to craft adversarial prompts that trick the LLM into producing harmful output. The attack objective can be formulated as follows,

\[\mathcal{L}_{adv}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{1:n},\hat{\mathbf{y}})=-\log P_{\pi_{ \theta}}(\hat{\mathbf{y}}|\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{1:n}),\] (2)

where \(\mathcal{L}_{adv}(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{1:n},\hat{\mathbf{y}})\) represents the adversarial loss. \(\hat{\mathbf{x}}_{1:n}\) is the adversarial prompt (_e.g._, How to make a bomb? ), and \(\hat{\mathbf{y}}\) is the target sequence (_e.g._, Sure, here are the steps to make the bomb!).

**Capability of Jailbreak Attack.** The capabilities of a jailbreak attack can be categorized based on the attacker's level of access to the model, including white-box [1; 7; 8; 72] and black-box attacks [3; 4; 9]. _White-Box Attack:_ In a white-box attack, the attacker has full access to the model's parameters and architecture. This allows the attacker to utilize gradient information to optimize adversarial prompts effectively. By leveraging this detailed knowledge, the attacker can iteratively adjust the promptsto maximize the adversarial loss, thereby increasing the likelihood of the model generating harmful output. _Black-Box Attack:_ In a black-box attack, the attacker cannot access the model's internal parameters or gradients. Instead, the attacker interacts with the model through queries and observes the responses. The attacker refines the adversarial prompts based on these responses to achieve the desired outcome. This process often involves crafting and modifying prompts iteratively to deceive the model into producing harmful output without direct knowledge of its internal model information.

### Jailbreak Defense

**Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks.** The goal of jailbreak defense is to prevent jailbreak attacks and ensure that the LLM generates safe responses (_e.g._, "Sorry, as a response AI, I must reject your request."). The jailbreak defense can be formulated as follows,

\[\mathcal{L}_{safe}(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{1:n},\mathbf{\hat{y}})=-\log P_{\pi_{ \theta}}(A(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{1:n}),C(\mathbf{\hat{y}})),\] (3)

where \(\mathcal{L}_{safe}(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{1:n},\mathbf{\hat{y}})\) represents the safe loss function to improve the defense ability of the LLM itself. \(A(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{1:n})\) and \(C(\mathbf{\hat{y}})\) are the input and output processing functions, respectively.

**System-level Defense.** At the system level, additional security measures are implemented to safeguard the model. This involves preprocessing inputs and filtering outputs to detect and block potential adversarial attempts [15; 47; 48; 25; 73; 74; 75]. For example, \(A(\mathbf{\hat{x}}_{1:n})\) is a random perturbation function that randomly inserts perturbations to mitigate malicious requests, and \(C(\mathbf{\hat{y}})\) is a filtering function that transforms malicious prompts into safe responses.

**Model-level Defense.** At the model level, the defense strategy is to enhance the robustness of the model itself to withstand adversarial attacks [26; 28; 76; 77; 78; 79]. This involves optimizing the model parameters \(\theta\) to naturally improve its defensive capabilities.

## 4 Benchmarking of Jailbreak Attacks on LLMs

In this section, we first examine how often overlooked implementation details influence the performance of jailbreak attacks from the perspectives of the target model (model size, fine-tuning alignment, safety system prompt, and template) and the attack level (attacker ability, adversarial suffix length, attack budget, and attack intention). Subsequently, we evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks against various defense methods. An overview of benchmarking jailbreak attacks on LLMs is presented in Figure 1.

### Experiment Setup

**Datasets and Target Models.**_Datasets:_ To evaluate the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks, we use two widely recognized datasets: _AdvBench_[1] and _MaliciousInstruct_[30]. _AdvBench_ contains 520 examples of harmful or toxic behaviors, including profanity, threatening behavior, misinformation, discrimination, and other illegal activities. _MaliciousInstruct_ includes ten different malicious intentions, covering a broader spectrum of harmful instructions. _Target Models:_ Following the in previous studies [1; 2; 3], we use Llama2-7B [61] and Vicuna-13B [71] as the base target models. To evaluate the impact of LLMs, we further evaluate more models including (Llama-2-13B and Llama-2-70B) and (Llama-3-8B Llama-3-70B). We provide more details of datasets and target models in Appendix A.1.

Figure 1: An overview of benchmarking jailbreak attacks on LLMs.

**Metrics.** Following the [1, 2, 8], we use the Attack Success Rate (ASR) to measure the vulnerability. The ASR is the percentage of instructions that are not rejected and are responded to appropriately. We calculate ASR using both prefix-based and GPT agent-based methods, denoted as ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\) and ASR\({}_{\text{Agent}}\), respectively. The prefix-based method [1, 2] matches substrings against a set of rejection phrases, such as "Sorry, I cannot." If these phrases are absent, the attack is considered successful. The GPT agent-based method [3, 9] uses a GPT-4 model to determine whether the LLM is jailbroken based on the input malicious instruction and the model's response. More details of these metrics can be found in Appendix A.2.

**Jailbreak Attack and Defense Methods.**_Attack Methods:_ To assess the vulnerability of LLMs, we employ the most widely used jailbreak attacks, including both token-level attacks (GCG [1], AutoDAN [2], AmpleGCG [7], and AdvPrompter [8]) and prompt-level attacks (PAIR [3], TAP [9], and GPTFuzz [10]). _Defense Methods:_ To enhance the defense capabilities of LLMs, we implement both system-level defense methods (Self-Reminder [15], RPO [47], and SmoothLLM [48]) and model-level defense methods (Adversarial Training [26, 80], Unlearning [27, 60], and Safety Training [61, 55]). Details of the implementation settings for both jailbreak attacks and defenses are provided in Appendix A.3.

### Bag of Tricks: Key Factors of Implementation Details of Jailbreak Attack

#### 4.2.1 Target Model Level

**Model Size.** Different model sizes exhibit varying capabilities in handling complex tasks. Mazeika et al.[18] provide a comprehensive study on various models defending against jailbreak attacks, revealing that some models have superior resilience. For example, Llama-7B offers better defense against jailbreaks than Llama-70B under the AutoDAN attack. In Figure 2, we evaluate the impact of model size on Llama, keeping other settings as default. As shown, the robustness of the models against jailbreak attacks appears to be independent of their size, as both smaller and larger models exhibit varying degrees of adversarial robustness under both token-level and prompt-level jailbreak attacks. The effect of model size is minimal.

**Fine-tuning Alignment.** Fine-tuning LLMs with a few adversarial examples can compromise their safety alignment [81]. Given this, we further investigate the broader implications of fine-tuning, such as domain-specific fine-tuning and open-chat data fine-tuning, on the safety alignment of LLMs. We evaluate the model's robustness before and after fine-tuning under jailbreak attacks. As shown in Figure 3, fine-tuning significantly impacts the robustness of LLMs. For instance, the Vicuna-13B model, fine-tuned from LLaMA on user-shared conversations, exhibits a significant increase in ASR post fine-tuning, indicating reduced robustness. The impact of fine-tuning on the model's robustness is substantial.

**Safety System Prompt.** Xie et al [15] reveals that LLM safety can be enhanced by using system prompts with safety reminders [57] (_e.g._, "Your answers should not include any harmful, unethical, racist, sexist, toxic, dangerous, or illegal content") that effectively sharpen the LLM's focus on secure responses. In Figure 4, we evaluate whether safety prompts affect jailbreak attack performance, and the results show that safety prompts significantly impact jailbreak performance.

**Template Type.** Cui et al [82] shows that switching between models and making small changes in prompt templates can lead to vastly different results. We further test whether using different templates affects jailbreak attack performance. As shown in Figure 5, we find that different templates significantly affect attack performance. The original form system significantly improves the robustness of LLMs. It is evident that the choice of template plays a crucial role in the model's vulnerability to adversarial attacks.

#### 4.2.2 Attacker Level

**Attacker Ability.** Chao et al. [3] propose that prompt-level jailbreaks utilize LLMs to iteratively refine adversarial prompts. However, different LLMs exhibit varying capabilities. For example, closed-source models (_e.g._, GPT-4, GPT-3.5 _etc._) often demonstrate strong abilities. GPTFuzzer uses GPT-3.5 to refine adversarial prompts, while PAIR uses Vicuna-13B as the attacker. In Figure 5(a),we employ GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Vicuna-13B, and Llama-2-7B to test how different attacker abilities affect jailbreak attack performance. we evaluate the performance of using Vicuna-13B, Llama-2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 as attackers to iteratively refine adversarial prompts. The attacker's ability significantly impacts the attack performance, with stronger LLMs achieving better attack outcomes.

**Adversarial Suffix Length.** In the token-level jailbreak attack, GCG utilizes greedy updated optimization methods to optimize the adversarial suffix and append it to the original prompts. However, the adversarial suffix is initialized with the same length. In Figure 5(b), we vary the adversarial suffix length to verify its impact on making LLMs generate jailbroken responses. As the adversarial suffix length increases, the ASR significantly increases and then flattens out. This indicates that longer adversarial suffixes enhance the likelihood of generating jailbroken responses up to a certain point, beyond which the effect plateaus.

**Attack Budget.** When crafting the adversarial prompt in the iterative refinement process, token-level jailbreaks utilize hundreds of queries (_e.g._, GCG uses about 500 iterations to optimize the adversarial prompts), while prompt-level jailbreak attacks require only a few queries (_e.g._, PAIR uses about twenty queries). In Figure 7, we experiment with different attack budgets to verify whether this influences attack performance. As seen, for the token-level jailbreak, the ASR significantly increases with the attack budget. In contrast, for the prompt-level jailbreak attack, the effect of the attack budget is marginal.

**Attack Intention.** We collected 11 attack intentions, including Illegal Activity, Child Abuse Content, Hate/Harass/Violence, Malware, Physical Harm, Economic Harm, Fraud/Deception, Adult Content, Political Campaigning, Privacy Violation Activity, and Tailored Financial Advice from HEx-PHI [81]. To test whether the attacker's intention leads to variations in outcomes, as demonstrated in Figure 8,

Figure 3: Effect of finetuning alignment on the robustness of LLMs. We assess the robustness of LLMs before and after fine-tuning by subjecting them to two distinct types of jailbreak attacks—AutoDAN and PAIR—across various configurations. Tulu, Vicuna, and WizardLM models represent the post-fine-tuning versions of Llama2 series. Additionally, we investigate the impact of fine-tuning alignment on Mistral-7B and Qwen1.5-14B, which are fine-tuned using the Tulu v2 SFT dataset, consisting of 326,154 samples. It was observed that fine-tuning significantly compromised the models’ safety alignment.

Figure 2: Effect of model size on jailbreak attack performance. We assess two types of jailbreak attacks: token-level (AutoDAN) and prompt-level (PAIR), across the Llama2, Llama3, and Qwen1.5 families with various model sizes. Our analysis indicates that attack robustness does not depend on model size.

### Benchmark of Jailbreak Attack on Defense Methods

**Overview of Analysis.** Beyond above critical techniques, we further examine the effectiveness of jailbreak attacks on different defense methods. Table 3 and Table 4 present the overall experimental results based on the metric ASR\({}_{\text{Agent}}\), while the results in Table 6 and Table 7 are based on ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\) and are provided in Appendix A.2. The experiments assessed the effectiveness of various defense methods against jailbreak attacks using two datasets: AdvBench and MaliciousInstruct.

Figure 6: (a) Effect of attacker ability on the performance of jailbreak attacks. We utilize different models with various abilities (Vicuna-13B, Llama-2-13B, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) as attackers to generate adversarial prompts. It can be observed that the stronger the LLM, the better its attack performance. (b) Effect of adversarial suffix length on the performance of jailbreak attacks. We vary the initialized adversarial suffix length, observing that as the adversarial suffix length increases, the ASR significantly increases and then flattens out. This indicates that longer adversarial suffixes enhance the likelihood of generating jailbroken responses up to a certain point, beyond which the effect plateaus.

Figure 7: Effect of attack budget on jailbreak attack performance. We vary the attacker’s queries to evaluate whether this would affect the jailbreak attack performance. As seen, for the token-level jailbreak, the ASR significantly increases with the attack budget. In contrast, for the prompt-level jailbreak attack, the effect of the attack budget is marginal.

The effectiveness of defense methods varied significantly across both datasets and models, with AppleCCG and AdvPrompter consistently showing strong defensive capabilities against jailbreak attacks. Conversely, the attack methods exhibited consistent effectiveness across both datasets and models, with AdvPrompter maintaining high attack success rates (ASRPrefix and ASRAgnt), indicating robust jailbreak capabilities against multiple defense strategies. Additionally, the susceptibility to jailbreak attacks differed between the models, with Vicuna-13B generally showing greater resilience compared to LLaMA-2-7B, as evidenced by the higher ASRPrefix and ASRAgnt values observed in LLaMA-2-7B, indicating its higher vulnerability to attacks.

## 5 Conclusion

In this work, we provide a comprehensive benchmarking of jailbreak attacks on LLMs, leading to several key insights and implications for the LLMs. Our empirical studies show that the performance of jailbreak attacks is significantly sensitive to key factors such as model size, fine-tuning, and the use of safety prompts. Additionally, the choice of template and the attacker's skill level also play critical roles in the success of these attacks. Thus, continuous benchmarking and standardized evaluation frameworks are essential for understanding and mitigating the risks of jailbreak attacks, thereby ensuring the reliability of LLMs.

Figure 8: Jailbreak attack performance w.r.t attack intention. We gathered data on eleven distinct attack intentions. We observed that variations in these intentions correspond to discernible disparities in the ASR. Our findings suggest that the specific nature of the attack intention exerts a substantial influence on the effectiveness of adversarial attacks.

Experiments Setup

### Datasets and Target Models

#### a.1.1 Datasets

Three datasets are utilized in our experiments: _AdvBench_, _MaliciousInstruct_, and _HEx-PHI_. Detailed descriptions of each dataset are provided below:

**AdvBench**[1] is a benchmark dataset designed for adversarial attacks, comprising 520 samples. Each sample includes a harmful goal and its corresponding target response. Due to the presence of duplicates within AdvBench, we adhere to the methodology of previous work [2] to select a representative subset of 50 samples for our experiments.

**MaliciousInstruct**[30] consists of 100 harmful instructions across ten different categories of harmful goals. We employ GPT-4 to generate target responses for each instruction, ensuring compatibility with all attack baseline requirements.

**HEx-PHI**[81] features 330 harmful examples spanning 11 prohibited categories as defined by the restrictions of OpenAI and Meta, with 30 examples per category. Target responses for these examples are also generated using GPT-4.

In Section 4.2, we assess the effectiveness of various techniques using _AdvBench_. The impact of attack intentions is explored using _HEx-PHI_ in both token-level and prompt-level jailbreak attacks in Section 4.2.2. Finally, in Section 4.3, we evaluate the performance of seven attack baselines across different defense methods using both _AdvBench_ and _MaliciousInstruct_.

#### a.1.2 Target Models

In main experiments, we employ Llama-2-7B-chat [61] and Vicuna-13B-v1.5 [71] as target model. In tricks experiments, we primarily employ models from the Llama-2-chat [61], Vicuna-v1.5 [71], and Llama-3-Instr [83] series. Specifically, in Section 4.2, we analyze the effects of varying target model sizes by comparing the efficacy of token-level and prompt-level attacks across models ranging from Llama-2-chat (7B to 70B), Llama3-8B-Instruct, to Llama3-70B-Instruct. Additionally, we investigate the impact of fine-tuning alignment by contrasting the attack outcomes between the Llama-2 and Vicuna series--the latter being fine-tuned from Llama2 using user-generated conversations from platforms such as ShareGPT. All the target models used in our experiments can be found in Table 5.

### Metric

In our experiments, we adopt the evaluation metrics commonly used in previous studies [2, 7, 8, 30, 81, 16], specifically utilizing two methods to attack success rate (ASR) metrics to assess the performance across various attack baselines.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \hline \hline Model Name & Link \\ \hline Vicuna-7B-v1.5 & https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5 \\ Vicuna-13B-v1.5 & https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-v1.5 \\ Llama-2-7B-chat-hf & https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf \\ Llama-2-13B-chat-hf & https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-13b-chat-hf \\ Llama-2-70B-chat-hf & https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-70b-chat-hf \\ Llama-3-8B-Instruct & https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct \\ Llama-3-70B-Instruct & https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: The link of target models in our experiments.

#### a.2.1 Prefix-based ASR

The definition of ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\) is as follow:

\[\text{ASR}_{\text{Prefix}}=\frac{N_{jailbroken}}{N_{total}}\times 100\%,\] (4)

where:

\[N_{jailbroken}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{total}}{(1-\text{prefix\_match}(O_{i}))},\] (5)

\[\text{prefix\_match}(O_{i})=\begin{cases}1&\text{if $O_{i}$ contains any prefix from the secure prefix list}\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases},\] (6)

\(O_{i}\) represents each individual output from the language model. \(N_{total}\) is the total number of outputs evaluated. \(\text{prefix\_match}(O_{i})\) is a function that checks for the presence of secure prefixes in the output \(O_{i}\), returning \(1\) if present and \(0\) if not.

Due to the manual construction of the secure prefix list, it is prone to errors, including false positives and false negatives. To enhance the accuracy of the ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\) results, we compile prefix lists from previous studies [1, 2, 7, 8], update and refine them by calculating their intersection. The final results are depicted in Figure 10. The overall experimental results based on the metric ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\) are shown in Table 6 and Table 7.

#### a.2.2 Agent-based ASR

To further enhance our evaluation results, following previous work [3, 9, 84, 85], we utilize GPT-4 to construct a Judge Agent to determine whether responses from large language models represent jailbroken from intended constraints, replacing the prefix_match function in ASR\({}_{\text{Prefix}}\). We employ the agent to score responses from the large models on a scale of 1 to 10. Scores below \(\alpha\) are classified as non-jailbroken, while scores of \(\alpha\) or above are considered jailbroken. The system prompt of GPT-4 based agent is shown in Figure 11. The definition of ASR\({}_{\text{Agent}}\) is as follow:

\[\text{ASR}_{\text{Agent}}=\frac{N_{jailbroken}}{N_{total}}\times 100\%,\] (7)

where:

\[N_{jailbroken}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{total}}\text{Agent}(O_{i}),\] (8)

Figure 10: **Secure string keywords in secure prefix list.**\[\text{Agent}(O_{i})=\begin{cases}1&\text{if Score}(O_{i})\geq\alpha\\ 0&\text{otherwise}\end{cases},\] (9)

where \(\text{Agent}(O_{i})\) is a function where \(O_{i}\) is scored by a GPT-4 agent. In our experiments, the threshold \(\alpha\) is set to 5, which means the function returns \(1\) if the score is 5 or higher, indicating a jailbroken output, and \(0\) if the score is below 5, indicating a non-jailbroken output.

### Implementation Details of Jailbreak Attack and Defense

In this section, we present the implementation details of jailbreak methods and defense methods employed in our main experiments.

#### a.3.1 Details of Jailbreak Attack Methods

* **GCG**[1]: GCG automates the generation of adversarial suffixes that, when appended to a wide range of queries, prompt the language model to produce objectionable content. Its core idea is to find a suffix that maximizes the likelihood of the model providing an affirmative response instead of declining to answer malicious prompts. GCG employs a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques to automatically generate these adversarial suffixes. In our main experiments, we adhere to most of the original settings proposed by the authors, including a maximum of 500 optimization steps, a top-k of 256, the initial adversarial suffix, and 20 optimizable tokens. To prevent out-of-memory issues, we reduce the batch size to 64. Furthermore, since the original method uses a prefix-based approach to detect jailbreaks and prematurely terminate optimization, we substitute the original prefix

* **AutoDAN**[2]: AutoDAN employs a hierarchical genetic algorithm that can automatically generate stealthy jailbreak prompts. This method initiates with jailbreak prompts manually crafted by humans as the initial population, and subsequently optimizes these prompts through selection, crossover, and mutation operations within the genetic algorithm. AutoDAN capitalizes on the generative capabilities of LLMs during the population initialization to preserve the logical flow and meaning of the original sentences while introducing diversity. We adhere to the official settings for AutoDAN, maintaining all hyperparameters as specified in the original paper. Similar to GCG, AutoDAN uses a prefix-based method to detect jailbreaks; thus, we have also replaced the original prefix list with our secure prefix list.
* **AmpleGCG**[7]: AmpleGCG augments the original GCG by incorporating overgeneration and trains a generative model designed to learn the distribution of adversarial suffixes given a harmful query. AmpleGCG is trained using successful suffixes identified during the GCG optimization process as training data. Unlike methods that solely rely on selecting the suffix with the lowest loss, AmpleGCG gathers all candidate suffixes generated during the

Figure 11: **System prompt of GPT-4 based agent.**

GCG optimization to attack the target LLMs. This approach facilitates the rapid generation of a diverse set of adversarial suffixes, accommodating various harmful queries. In our experiments, we utilize the corresponding AmpleGCG model released by the authors for two target models, Vicuna and Llama. We adhere to the same hyperparameters as the original paper, including the maximum new tokens for suffixes and the diversity penalty. We set the number of group beam searches to 200, as such a value can already achieve near 100% ASR.
* **AdvPrompter**[8]: AdvPrompter is another fast adaptive adversarial prompt generation method that trains an LLM to generate adversarial suffixes targeted at a specific Target LLM. Compared to AmpleGCG, these suffixes are designed to induce the Target LLM to produce inappropriate or harmful responses while remaining readable and coherent to human readers. The authors initially generate high-quality adversarial suffixes using an efficient optimization algorithm, and then fine-tune AdvPrompter with these suffixes through a low-rank adaptation. We utilize the released code to train the LoRA adapter for each target model based on Llama-2-7b, and subsequently obtain the suffix generator model after integrating the adapter with the initial LLM. The maximum generation iteration is set to 100.
* **PAIR**[3]: PAIR represents one of the prompt-level attacks that automatically generates semantic jailbreak prompts with only black-box access. PAIR employs an attacker LLM to autonomously craft jailbreaks for a targeted LLM. The process is fully automated, involving iterative queries to the target LLM to refine candidate jailbreak prompts. Through interactions with the target model, PAIR utilizes the conversation history to generate texts that enhance the model's reasoning and iterative refinement process. In our main experiments, we use Vicuna-13B-v1.5 as the attack model and GPT-4 as the judge model, maintaining most hyper-parameters except for total iterations. As the results of the attack budget depicted in Figure 7b indicate, the attack success rate is not relevant to the total iterations due to the limited conversation history and the long-context capability; therefore, we set the maximum iterations to 25 to reduce API costs. We maintain consistent system prompts for both attacker and judge models.
* **TAP**[9]: TAP is another automated black-box jailbreaking attack method, evolved from PAIR, that iteratively generates and refines attack prompts through tree-of-thought reasoning and pruning mechanisms. Compared to PAIR, the core advancements of TAP include the incorporation of tree-of-thought for a more systematic exploration of the prompt space, and a pruning strategy that eliminates irrelevant prompts during generation while retaining the most promising ones for subsequent evaluation. However, this method significantly increases the attack budget, as in each iteration, the attack LLM is required to generate multiple prompts for each branch as well as responses from the target model. Such a process is time-consuming and cost-intensive. In our main experiment, we employ the same models as the original paper, Vicuna-13B-v1.5 and GPT-4, respectively. Due to significant time overhead and API costs, we reduce the maximum depth and width from 10 to 5.
* **GPTFuzz**[10]: GPTFuzz also introduces an automated black-box jailbreak fuzzing framework. The core methodology comprises three key components: a seed selection strategy, mutation operators, and a judgment model. The process begins with human-written jailbreak prompts as seeds, which the framework then mutates to generate new templates. The seed selection strategy optimizes for both efficiency and variability, mutation operators generate semantically equivalent or similar sentences, and the judgment model evaluates the success of each jailbreak attempt. Through an iterative process, GPTFuzz selects seeds, applies mutation operators to produce new jailbreak templates, combines them with target queries, and assesses the responses from the target LLM to determine the success of the jailbreak. The judgment model is a fine-tuned RoBERTa [86] model trained on a dataset comprising responses generated by the LLM from various jailbreak templates, which are manually labeled as either jailbroken or not. In our experiments, we use the judge model released by the authors and adhere to the original hyperparameter settings, including setting the temperature of GPT to 1.0 to optimize the mutation policy for maximal jailbreak performance.

#### a.4.2 Template Type

As demonstrated in previous studies [82], different prompt templates can also impact the robustness of LLMs. Consequently, as shown in Figure 15 and 16, we investigate whether using templates specific to the Llama-2 model versus general templates, such as zero-shot templates, would impact attack performance. To control for variables, all system prompts are set to null in this experiment.

## Appendix B Potential Impacts and Limitations

### Potential Impacts

Our research conducts a detailed analysis of various key factors in jailbreak attacks, offering insights that enable security researchers to optimize existing methods. By systematically evaluating the effectiveness of different attack techniques, we enhance our understanding of which strategies are most effective. This knowledge guides the design of future attack patterns and defensive measures.

Benchmarking the performance of large language models under various attack techniques not only exposes these models' vulnerabilities but also generates valuable data for model improvement. This contributes to the development of more robust language models, which are better equipped to withstand future security threats.

### Limitations

Due to the substantial demand for computational resources and API costs associated with large language model jailbreak research, our experiments are conducted using approximately 60 A800-80G GPUs and incur about $10,000 in API expenses. This constraint prevented us from expanding our benchmarks to include more target models and larger datasets in the main experiments. This limitation underscores the need for research into innovative, cost-effective attack methods that do not rely on closed-source LLMs, thereby better identifying the shortcomings of existing models' safety alignments.

Figure 13: **System prompt of Llama-2 series.**

Figure 15: **General zero-shot prompt template.**Furthermore, the experimental setup in our study may not fully replicate real-world application scenarios. Therefore, while our findings offer valuable insights into attack techniques, the actual effectiveness may vary across different environments.

Further Discussion

### The Impact of Different Defense Methods on Model Output

In this section, we discuss the impact of different defense methods on model output through case studies. To control variables, we fix the attack method to AdvPrompter, using the same adversarial prompt as input, and compare the defense effectiveness of system-level (Self-Reminder [15], RPO [47], SmoothLLM [48]) and model-level (Adversarial Training [26], Unlearning [27], Safety Training [55]) defenses against this attack. The target model is Vicuna-13B-v1.5. As shown in Figure 17, the Unlearning [27] defense is unsuccessful compared to No Defense. Although the other five defense methods prevent the model from producing harmful responses, the outputs vary significantly. Self-Reminder [15] and SmoothLLM [48] produce outputs with some semantic coherence but suffer in readability; RPO [47] outputs include repetitive, meaningless numbers and characters; models using Adversarial Training [26] and Safety Training [55] produce only meaningless punctuation.

This demonstrates that the utility of the model is negatively affected by defense methods, both system-level and model-level, to varying degrees. It underscores the necessity of designing jailbreak defense methods that have minimal impact on model performance.

### Examples of Different Jailbreaks

Below, we provide the jailbreak attack results for each jailbreak attack on LLMs with no defense. Given that the maximum token generation limit for target LLMs is set to 150, some responses may be truncated.
