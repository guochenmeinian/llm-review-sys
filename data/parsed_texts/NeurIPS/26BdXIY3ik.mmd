###### Abstract

Semi-supervised graph domain adaptation, as a branch of graph transfer learning, aims to annotate unlabeled target graph nodes by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from a label-scarce source graph. However, most existing studies primarily concentrate on aligning feature distributions directly to extract domain-invariant features, while ignoring the utilization of the intrinsic structure information in graphs. Inspired by the significance of data structure information in enhancing models' generalization performance, this paper aims to investigate how to leverage the structure information to assist graph transfer learning. To this end, we propose an innovative framework called TFGDA. Specially, TFGDA employs a structure alignment strategy named STSA to encode graphs' topological structure information into the latent space, greatly facilitating the learning of transferable features. To achieve a stable alignment of feature distributions, we also introduce a SDA strategy to mitigate domain discrepancy on the sphere. Moreover, to address the overfitting issue caused by label scarcity, a simple but effective RNC strategy is devised to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes. Experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of TFGDA over SOTA methods.

## 1 Introduction

With the rise of deep learning, node classification techniques have made significant progress in diverse fields. However, due to the distribution shift issue, well-trained models often suffer severe performance degradation when applied directly to a new domain. Graph transfer learning (GTL) [1] has been proposed to tackle this issue by transferring domain-invariant features from a labeled source graph to an unlabeled target graph, effectively boosting the model's performance on the target graph.

Although current studies on GTL have made significant strides, they often rely on the assumption that all nodes in the source graph are labeled. However, this ideal assumption does not hold true in many scenarios, as annotating the entire source graph is time-consuming, especially for large-scale networks. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on a more realistic application scenario known as semi-supervised graph domain adaptation (SGDA) [2], where the source graph only has a few labeled nodes. Utilizing the transferable knowledge acquired from the label-scarce source graph to enhance the model's adaptation performance on the target graph is the most crucial challenge for SGDA.

However, most existing studies [3; 4; 1] tend to focus on directly aligning feature distributions across domains to extract domain-invariant node features, while overlooking the utilization of the intrinsic structure information in graphs. Notably, the recent advancements in unsupervised learning [5; 6; 7; 8; 9] have showcased the significance of data structure information in enhancing models' generalization. Considering the complex topological structure information presented in the graph, this paper seek to leverage these critical structure information to assist the transfer of shared node knowledge. To this end, we propose an innovative SGDA framework named **TFGDA** that employs a Subgraph Topological Structure Alignment (**STSA**) strategy to encode structure information into latent space. Specially, STSA utilizes persistent homology (PH) [10] to extract the topological structure information of the input and latent spaces, and then align the topological structures of two space, significantly improving the model's transfer performance. Furthermore, current works [2; 11; 4] primarily utilize adversarial training to reduce domain discrepancy. However, adversarial training is an unstable process that may destroy the discriminative details hidden in features [12], thereby affecting the transfer of shared knowledge. To remedy this issue, we propose a Sphere-guided Domain Alignment (**SDA**) strategy, aiming to achieve more stable domain alignment. Concretely, SDA initially maps node features to the spherical space. Then, geodesic projection [13] is utilized to project spherical features onto multiple great circles, where the spherical sliced-Wasserstein (SSW) distance [14] is employed to quantify the feature distributions discrepancy across domains.

More importantly, in the SGDA scenarios, due to the label scarcity of source graph, well-trained model on only a few labeled source nodes is likely to encounter overfitting. Consequently, it may make ambiguous or even incorrect predictions for certain target graph nodes located near the decision boundaries or far from their corresponding class centers. To address this overfitting issue, we devise a Robustness-guided Node Clustering (**RNC**) strategy to effectively enhance the model's robustness. RNC aims to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes by maximizing the mutual information between the soft cluster assignment of the original node and its perturbed version, significantly improving the model's generalization performance on the target graph.

In summary, the main contributions are listed as follows:

**(1)** To the best of our knowledge, this is first attempt to utilize the intrinsic topological structure information hidden in graphs to assist GTL. A novel STSA strategy is proposed to preserve the topological structure information in latent space.

**(2)** A strategy named SDA is introduced to stably align the node feature distributions across domains.

**(3)** To address the overfitting issue, a simple but effective RNC strategy is devised to guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes.

**(4)** Experimental results show that our TFGDA outperforms SOTA methods on various benchmarks.

## 2 Related Works

**Graph Transfer Learning.** GTL [15; 16] has gained widespread attention for relieving the burden of collecting labeled data for new tasks. Early studies usually use source nodes to pre-train expressive models for related tasks in target domain [17; 18; 19; 20; 21]. To enhance model's generalization, recent studies have shifted their emphasis to domain adaptation [11; 22; 23]. There are two main ways to extract domain-invariant node features: (1) Using adversarial training to enforce domain confusion [16; 4; 2; 24]; (2) Minimizing the statistical distance between two domains [25; 26; 27; 28; 29]. However, existing works tend to focus on domain alignment while overlooking the utilization of structure information in graphs.

**Semi-supervised Learning on Graphs.** Semi-supervised learning on graphs addresses node classification with a small fraction of labeled nodes. Previous works [30; 31; 32] commonly adopt the message passing paradigm to extract discriminative features. Recent studies have explored various techniques, including adversarial training [33; 34], data augmentation [35; 36], continuous graph [37], contrastive learning [27] and meta learning [38; 39] to further enhance model's generalization.

**Persistent Homology (PH).** PH is an essential method in topology for extracting structure information from point clouds [40; 41]. Recently, PH has shown significant advantages in various areas, including signal processing[42], shape matching[43], and design of network [44]. Some studies have investigated its differentiability [45; 46]. Recent works have also explored its potential in image segmentation [47; 48], action/image recognition [49; 50; 51; 52; 53], and evaluation of GANs [54].

Preliminaries: Persistent Homology (PH)

PH is a method used to capture the topological structure of complex point clouds as a scale parameter \(\rho\) is varied. In this section, we briefly introduce some key concepts. Further details on PH can be found in [10; 40].

**Notation.**\(\mathcal{X}:=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{m}\) denotes a point cloud and \(\omega\) is a distance metric over \(\mathcal{X}\).

**Vietoris-Rips (VR) Complex.** The VR complex [55] is a unique simplicial complex constructed from a set of points, providing an approximation of the underlying space's topology. The VR complex of \(\mathcal{X}\) at scale \(\rho\), denoted as \(\mathcal{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{X})\), contains all simplices of \(\mathcal{X}\). Each component of \(\mathcal{X}\) satisfies the distance constraint: \(\omega(x_{i},x_{j})\leq\rho\) for any \(i,j\). Additionally, the VR complex exhibits a nesting property: \(\mathcal{V}_{\rho_{i}}\subseteq\mathcal{V}_{\rho_{j}}\) for any \(\rho_{i}\leq\rho_{j}\), which enables us to track the evolution progress of simplical complex as \(\rho\) increases.

**Persistence Diagram (PD).** The PD \(dgm\) is a multi-set of points \((g_{1},g_{2})\) in the Cartesian plane \(\mathbb{R}^{2}\), encoding lifespan information of topological features. Concretely, it summarizes the birth time \(g_{1}\) and death time \(g_{2}\) information of each topological feature with a homology group. The birth time \(g_{1}\) indicates the scale of feature creation and death time \(g_{2}\) refers to the scale of feature destruction.

## 4 Methodology

### Problem Definition

**Source Domain Graph**: The source graph is defined as \(\mathcal{G}^{s}=(\mathcal{V}^{s,l},\mathcal{V}^{s,u},Y^{s,l},A^{s},X^{s})\), where \(\mathcal{V}^{s,l}\) is the labeled node set, and \(\mathcal{V}^{s,u}\) is the remaining unlabeled node set in \(\mathcal{G}_{s}\). \(Y^{s,l}\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}^{s,l}|\times K}\) denotes the label matrix of \(\mathcal{V}^{s,l}\), where \(K\) is the number of node classes. If a node \(n^{s}_{i}\in\mathcal{V}^{s,l}\) belongs to the \(k\)-th class, \(y^{s}_{i,k}=1\); otherwise, \(y^{s}_{i,k}=0\). \(A^{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{s}\times N^{s}}\) is an adjacency matrix, where \(N^{s}=|\mathcal{V}^{s,l}|+|\mathcal{V}^{s,u}|\) is the number of nodes in \(\mathcal{G}^{s}\). If there is an edge between nodes \(n_{i}\) and \(n_{j}\), the value of \(A^{s}_{ij}\) is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. \(X^{s}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{s}\times e}\) indicates an attribute matrix, where \(e\) is the dimension of node attributes. Notably, \(|\mathcal{V}^{s,l}|\) is much smaller than \(|\mathcal{V}^{s,u}|\) in the SGDA setting.

**Target Domain Graph**: Similarly, the target graph is represented as \(\mathcal{G}^{t}=(\mathcal{V}^{t},A^{t},X^{t})\), which is a completely unlabeled graph with an unlabeled node set \(\mathcal{V}^{t}\). \(A^{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{t}\times N^{t}}\) is an adjacency matrix, and \(X^{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{N^{t}\times e}\) is a node attribute matrix, where \(N^{t}=|\mathcal{V}^{t}|\) denotes the number of nodes in \(\mathcal{G}_{t}\).

**Semi-Supervised Graph Domain Adaptation (SGDA)**: Given a partially labeled source graph \(\mathcal{G}^{s}\) and an unlabeled target graph \(\mathcal{G}^{t}\), the goal of SGDA is to precisely annotate target graph nodes by utilizing transferable knowledge learned from the limited labeled source nodes [2; 16].

### Network Architecture

The architecture of our TFGDA model is depicted in Figure 1. It consists of two components: a graph convolutional network (GCN)-based feature extractor \(\mathcal{F}\) and a node classifier \(\mathcal{C}\). Mathematically, given an input graph \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},A,X)\), the node features extracted by \(\mathcal{F}\) is denoted as \(H=\mathcal{F}(\mathcal{G})\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|\times d}\), and it is further normalized to map onto a spherical space \(\mathbb{S}^{d-1}_{r}\) to obtain spherical features \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|\times d}\), where \(d\) is the feature dimension, \(r\) is the radius and \(|\mathcal{V}|\) denotes the number of nodes in \(\mathcal{G}\). The classification probability predicted by \(\mathcal{C}\) is denoted as \(\Psi=\mathcal{C}(Z)\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|\times K}\).

To capture more precise adjacency relationships of graph \(\mathcal{G}\), we compute the positive point-wise mutual information (PPIM) between nodes following [2]. Specially, for a given graph \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},A,X)\), we utilize random walk to sample a collection of paths on \(A\) and generate a frequency matrix \(R\). Based on \(R\), we can compute the PPIM matrix \(\mathbb{P}\) as follows:

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{P}_{ij}=\frac{R_{ij}}{\sum_{i,j}R_{ij}},\; \mathbb{P}_{i,*}=\frac{\sum_{j}R_{ij}}{\sum_{i,j}R_{ij}},\;\mathbb{P}_{*,j}= \frac{\sum_{i}R_{ij}}{\sum_{i,j}R_{ij}},\\ P_{ij}=\max\{\log(\frac{\mathbb{P}_{ij}}{\mathbb{P}_{i,*}\times \mathbb{P}_{*,j}}),0\},\end{split}\] (1)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

\(\mathcal{V}_{\rho}(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})\) and \(\mathcal{V}_{\rho}(\hat{Z}_{i})\) for point clouds \(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i}\) and \(\hat{Z}_{i}\), employ PH to extract their topological structures, and obtain their corresponding PDs \(dgm(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})\) and \(dgm(\hat{Z}_{i})\) respectively. To align the topological structures of the input and latent spherical spaces, we adopt the 1-Wasserstein distance \(\mathcal{W}_{1}\) to measure the discrepancy between two PDs (i.e., \(dgm(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})\) for input space and \(dgm(\hat{Z}_{i})\) for spherical space), which aims to seek the optimal transport plan \(\gamma^{*}\) between two PDs:

\[\begin{split}\gamma^{*}&=\operatorname*{arg\, min}_{\gamma}\mathcal{W}_{1}(dgm(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i}),dgm(\hat{Z}_{i}))\\ &=\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\gamma}\sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in \gamma}\left\|\alpha-\beta\right\|_{\infty}\end{split}\] (4)

where \(\alpha\in dgm(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})\), \(\beta\in dgm(\hat{Z}_{i})\), and \(\left\|\cdot\right\|_{\infty}\) is the \(l_{\infty}\) distance. After obtaining \(\gamma^{*}\), the local structure discrepancy \(\mathcal{L}_{str}^{sub}(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})\) between two spaces of \(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i}\) can be calculated as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{str}^{sub}(\mathcal{\hat{G}}_{i})=\sum_{(\alpha,\beta)\in\gamma^ {*}}\left\|\alpha-\beta\right\|_{2}^{2}.\] (5)

Hence, we can estimate the global structure discrepancy between the input and spherical spaces of graph \(\mathcal{G}\) by aggregating the local structure discrepancy of all subgraphs:

\[\mathcal{L}_{str}(\mathcal{G})=\sum_{i}\mathcal{L}_{str}^{sub}(\mathcal{\hat{ G}}_{i})\] (6)

In the SGDA scenario, the STSA strategy will be applied to both the \(\mathcal{G}^{s}\) and \(\mathcal{G}^{t}\), and its loss function is defined as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{stsa}=\mathcal{L}_{str}(\mathcal{G}^{s})+\mathcal{L}_{str}( \mathcal{G}^{t}).\] (7)

Notably, preserving topological structure information has the potential to guide unlabeled nodes towards achieving discriminative clustering, thereby promoting the learning of transferable node features, as verified in Section 5.3.

Although many GCNs-based methods have already been proposed to exploit graph structure information to promote the learning of features, these methods are not effective in addressing the SGDA task. Specifically, these GCNs-based methods [59; 60; 61; 62] typically mine the graph structure information in the deep feature space by designing well-crafted GCN architectures or introducing some complex modules. However, recent studies [27; 63; 64; 16] have pointed out that GCNs are insufficient in capturing the sophisticated structure information in graph, which means that the graph structure information may be lost or destroyed after passing through the GCNs-based feature extractors. Thus, directly mining graph structure information from the deep feature space is a suboptimal way, which affects the learning of transferable node features in our SGDA setting.

The proposed STSA strategy aims to extract the graph structure information directly from the input space and encode these powerful information into the latent spherical space by aligning the topological structures of the two spaces. This method does not lose or destroy the graph structure information during training. Furthermore, our STSA strategy does not introduce any changes to the network architecture, effectively avoiding an increase in model's complexity and ensuring its adaptability to integration with other methods.

### Sphere-guided Domain Alignment

As mentioned in Section 1, adversarial training has been widely adopted by existing GTL models to reduce domain discrepancy. However, it is an unstable process that may destroy the discriminative information hidden in node features, thereby impacting the learning of shared features.

To tackle this issue, we propose a Sphere-guided Domain Alignment (SDA) strategy that achieves stable alignment of cross-domain node features distributions in the spherical space. Our SDA strategy mainly comprises three steps: **(1)** Map node features onto the sphere space \(\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}\). **(2)** Use geodesic projection [13] to project node features from \(\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}\) to multiple great circles. **(3)** Compute the feature distributions discrepancy on great circles and minimize it during training.

**Step (1):** Motivated by the effectiveness of spherical features in improving model's transfer performance [65], we first normalize node features \(H\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|\times d}\) extracted by \(\mathcal{F}\) with \(z_{i}=r\frac{h_{i}}{\left\|h_{i}\right\|}\) to obtain the spherical features \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|\times d}\) in the sphere space \(\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}=\left\{z_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}:\left\|z_{i}\right\|_{2}=r\right\}\), where \(h_{i}\) and \(z_{i}\) is the \(i\)-th row of \(H\) and \(Z\), respectively. Notably, Ref. [66] has proved that a proper radius \(r\) is lower bounded by parameters \(\tau\) and \(K\):

\[r\geq\frac{K-1}{K}\ln\frac{(K-1)\tau}{1-\tau}\] (8)

where \(\tau\) denotes the expected minimal classification probability of class center and \(K\) is the number of classes. In this work, \(\tau\) is set to 0.999, and radius \(r\) is set to the lower bound.

**Step (2):** Previous studies [67; 68; 69; 70] have shown the superiority of optimal transport in aligning feature distributions. Let \(\Omega\) be a probability space and \(\mu\), \(\nu\) be two probability measures in \(\mathcal{P}(\Omega)\). For any \(q\geq 1\), the \(q\)-Wasserstein distance between \(\mu\) and \(\nu\) is defined as:

\[\mathcal{W}_{q}^{q}(\mu,\nu)=\inf_{\gamma\in\Pi(\mu,\nu)}\int_{\Omega\times \Omega}\mathcal{M}^{q}(z,g)d\gamma(z,g)\] (9)

where \(\Pi(\mu,\nu)=\{\gamma\in\mathcal{P}(\Omega\times\Omega)|\pi_{1\#}\gamma=\mu, \pi_{2\#}\gamma=\nu\}\) is the set of couplings, \(\pi_{1}\) and \(\pi_{2}\) denote the two marginal projections of \(\Omega\times\Omega\) to \(\Omega\), \(\#\) denotes the push-forward operator, and \(\mathcal{M}:\Omega\times\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{+}\) is a geodesic metric. However, we find that directly using the classical Wasserstein distance to compute features distributions discrepancy on the sphere \(\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}\) is computationally expensive, due to numerous nodes in the graph.

For more efficient calculations, we utilize geodesic projection \(I^{U}\) to project node features lying on \(\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}\) to \(b\) great circles \(\{\mathbb{C}_{1},\mathbb{C}_{2},\cdots,\mathbb{C}_{b}\}\). On the hypersphere, great circles [71] are circles whose diameter is equal to that of the sphere, and they correspond to the geodesics. Specially, the geodesic projection \(I^{U}\) is determined by \(U\):

\[I^{U}(z)=U^{\top}\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{g\in\operatorname{span}(\operatorname {UU}^{\top})\cap\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}}\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}}(z,g)= \operatorname*{arg\,min}_{\varrho\in\mathbb{S}_{r}^{1}}\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{ S}_{r}^{d-1}}(z,U\varrho),\forall U\in\mathbb{V}_{d,2},\forall z\in \mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}.\] (10)

where \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{S}_{r}^{d-1}}(z,g)=\arccos(\langle z,g\rangle)\), and \(\mathbb{V}_{d,2}=\left\{U\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d},U^{\top}U=I_{2}\right\}\) is the Stiefel manifold [72].

**Step (3):** Next, we utilize the spherical sliced-Wasserstein (SSW) distance [14] to measure the feature distributions discrepancy of two domain on multiple great circles, which can be formulated as:

\[SSW_{q}^{q}(u,v)=\int_{\mathbb{V}_{d,2}}\mathcal{W}_{q}^{q}(I_{\#}^{U}\mu,I_{ \#}^{U}\nu)\mathrm{d}\sigma(\mathrm{U}),\] (11)

where \(\sigma\) is the uniform distribution over \(\mathbb{V}_{d,2}\). In SSW, the geodesic metric \(\mathcal{M}^{q}(z,g)\) in Wasserstein distance \(\mathcal{W}_{q}^{q}(\mu,\nu)\) is defined as the geodesic distance [71]\(\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{S}_{r}^{1}}(z,g)=\min(|z-g|,r-|z-g|)\).

In practice, it's common to approximate the source and target feature distributions using samples \((z_{i}^{s})_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\) and \((z_{j}^{t})_{j=1}^{N^{t}}\) (i.e., through the empirical approximations \(\tilde{\mu}=\frac{1}{N^{s}}\sum_{i=1}^{N^{s}}\delta_{z_{i}^{s}}\) and \(\tilde{\nu}=\frac{1}{N^{t}}\sum_{j=1}^{N^{t}}\delta_{z_{j}^{s}}\)), where \(\delta\) is the Dirac function. As a result, the node features distributions discrepancy between two domains can be measured as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{sda}=SSW_{p}^{p}(\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})\approx\frac{1}{b}\sum_{ m=1}^{b}\mathcal{W}_{q}^{q}(\tilde{\mu},\tilde{\nu})\] (12)

where \(b\) is the number of projections. As training progresses, SDA strategy gradually reduces domain discrepancy, making the learning of domain-invariant features easier.

### Robustness-guided Node Clustering

Due to the label scarcity in \(\mathcal{G}^{s}\), the model is prone to overfitting when solely relying on \(\mathcal{L}_{cls}\) for optimization, severely degrading the model's generalization performance on \(\mathcal{G}^{t}\). To alleviate this overfitting issue, we devise a novel Robustness-guided Node Clustering (**RNC**) strategy to enhance the model's robustness by guiding the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes. Specially, RNC first introduces trainable shift parameters \(\xi_{s}=\left\{\xi_{s}^{(1)},\xi_{s}^{(2)},\cdots,\xi_{s}^{(L)}\right\}\) and \(\xi_{t}=\left\{\xi_{t}^{(1)},\xi_{t}^{(2)},\cdots,\xi_{t}^{(L)}\right\}\) to perturbs the source and target node features respectively, at each layer of \(\mathcal{F}\):

\[H^{s/t,\xi_{s/t},(l)}=\begin{cases}Conv^{(l)}(P^{s/t},X^{s/t})+\xi_{s/t}^{(l)},&l= 1\\ Conv^{(l)}(P^{s/t},H^{s/t,(l-1)})+\xi_{s/t}^{(l)},&1<l\leq L\end{cases}\] (13)where \(H^{s,\xi_{s},(l)}\) and \(H^{t,\xi_{t},(l)}\) denotes the perturbed source and target node features encoded by \(Conv^{(l)}\) respectively, and each \(\xi_{s/t}^{(i)}\) is specific to the output of \(Conv^{(l)}\). The shift parameters \(\xi_{s}\) and \(\xi_{t}\) are defined as randomly initialized multi-layer parameter matrices. After perturbation, based on \(H^{s,\xi_{s},(L)}\) and \(H^{t,\xi_{t},(L)}\), we can obtain the perturbed source node spherical features \(Z^{s,\xi_{s}}\) and the perturbed target node spherical features \(Z^{t,\xi_{t}}\) respectively.

For brevity, we will omit domain-specific notations in the following text. Ideally, regardless of how the node feature is perturbed, the model's prediction for it should remain unchanged because its class label has not changed. To achieve this goal, RNC aims to maximize the mutual information between the soft cluster assignment (i.e., classification prediction of classifier \(\mathcal{C}\)) of the spherical features \(Z\) and its perturbed version \(Z^{\xi}\), capturing their intrinsic invariant information between \(Z\) and \(Z^{\xi}\).

Concretely, given a node spherical feature \(z_{i}\), the classification probability predicted by \(\mathcal{C}\) is denoted as \(\Psi(z_{i})\in\mathbb{R}^{K}\), that can be viewed as the distribution of a discrete random variable \(\phi\) over \(K\) classes: \(\Gamma(\phi=k|z)=\Psi_{k}(z_{i})\). Let \(\phi\) and \(\phi^{\xi}\) denote the cluster assignment variables of \(z_{i}\) and \(z_{i}^{\xi}\), respectively. Then, their conditional joint distribution is defined as: \(\Gamma(\phi=k,\phi^{\xi}=k^{\xi}|z_{i},z_{i}^{\xi})=\Psi_{k}(z_{i})\cdot\Psi_{ k^{\xi}(z_{i}^{\xi})}\). After marginalization, the joint probability distribution can be formulated as a matrix \(\mathbb{Q}\in\mathbb{R}^{K\times K}\):

\[\mathbb{Q}=\frac{1}{|\mathcal{V}|}\sum_{i=1}^{|\mathcal{V}|}\Psi(z_{i})\cdot \Psi(z_{i}^{\xi})^{\top},\] (14)

where \(\mathbb{Q}_{kk^{\xi}}=\Gamma(\phi=k,\phi^{\xi}=k^{\xi})\), \(\mathbb{Q}_{k}=\Gamma(\phi=k)\), and \(\mathbb{Q}_{k^{\xi}}=\Gamma(\phi^{\xi}=k^{\xi})\). To preserve the equivalence between pairs \((z_{i},z_{i}^{\xi})\) and \((z_{i}^{\xi},z_{i})\), matrix \(\mathbb{Q}\) is typically symmetrized using \((\mathbb{Q}+\mathbb{Q}^{\top})/2\). In this way, the mutual information [73; 74] between the soft cluster assignment of \(Z\) and \(Z^{\xi}\) can be computed as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{mi}(\mathbb{Q})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}\sum_{k^{\xi}=1}^{K}\mathbb{Q}_{kk ^{\xi}}\cdot\ln\frac{\mathbb{Q}_{kk^{\xi}}}{\mathbb{Q}_{k}\cdot\mathbb{Q}_{k^ {\xi}}},s.t.,||\xi^{(l)}||_{F}\leq\varpi,\forall\xi^{(l)}\in\xi.\] (15)

where \(\varpi\) is a coefficient that controls the scale of feature perturbation.

In the SGDA scenario, all target domain nodes \(\mathcal{V}_{t}\) and source domain nodes \(\mathcal{V}^{s,l}\cup\mathcal{V}^{s,n}\) are used to calculate matrices \(\mathbb{Q}^{t}\) and \(\mathbb{Q}^{s}\), respectively. Therefore, the objective function \(\mathcal{L}_{rnc}\) of RNC can be expressed as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{rnc}=\mathcal{L}_{mi}(\mathbb{Q}^{s})+\mathcal{L}_{mi}(\mathbb{Q }^{t}),\] (16)

Notably, we leverage source labeled nodes \(\mathcal{V}^{s,l}\) in RNC as they can significantly guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes in the right direction. With the help of RNC, more and more intrinsic invariant features of nodes are extracted, which greatly promotes the learning of transferable features. Moreover, unlike previous studies that employ pseudo-labels strategy [2] or conditional entropy term [75] to guide the learning of unlabeled nodes, our RNC strategy does not involve any pseudo-labels and naturally avoids degenerate clustering solutions (see Figure 3 for further analysis).

### Model Optimization

In summary, the total objective of TFGDA can be expressed as follows:

\[\begin{gathered}\min_{\mathcal{F},\mathcal{C},\xi^{s},\xi^{t}} \mathcal{L}_{cls}+\eta\mathcal{L}_{sda}+\varepsilon\mathcal{L}_{stsa}-\lambda \mathcal{L}_{rnc}\\ s.t.,||\xi^{s,(l)}||_{F}\leq\varpi,\forall\xi^{s,(l)}\in\xi^{s},|| \xi^{t,(l)}||_{F}\leq\varpi,\forall\xi^{t,(l)}\in\xi^{t}.\end{gathered}\] (17)

where hyper-parameters \(\eta\), \(\varepsilon\) and \(\lambda\) are used to balance the contributions of the corresponding term.

### Theoretical Analysis

The theoretical analysis of our method is based on the theory of domain adaptation (DA) [76; 77].

Formally, let \(\mathcal{H}\) be the hypothesis space. Given two domains \(\mathcal{S}\) and \(\mathcal{T}\), the probabilistic bound of error of hypothesis \(h\) on the target domain is defined as: \(\psi_{\mathcal{T}}(h)\leq\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h)+\frac{1}{2}d_{h\Delta\mathcal{H }}(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})+\mu^{*}\), where the expected error on the target domain \(\psi_{\mathcal{T}}(h)\) are bounded by three terms: **(1)** the expectederror on source domain \(\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h)\); **(2)** the \(\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}\)-divergence between the source and target domains \(d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})\); **(3)** the combined error of ideal joint hypothesis \(\mu^{*}=\min_{h^{\prime}\in\mathcal{H}}\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h^{\prime})+\psi_{ \mathcal{T}}(h^{\prime})\).

The goal of DA is to lower the upper bound of the expected target domain error \(\psi_{\mathcal{T}}(h)\). Note that in unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA), minimizing \(\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h)\) can be easily achieved with source label information, as source domain samples are completely annotated. However, in our SGDA setting, due to the label scarcity of source domain, the model is prone to overfitting when solely relying on the source domain classification loss \(\mathcal{L}_{cls}\) for optimization. Therefore, we introduce the **RNC** strategy (\(\mathcal{L}_{rnc}\)) to address the overfitting issue, with the aim of guiding \(\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h)\) towards further minimization.

Most DA methods mainly focus on reducing the domain discrepancy \(d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})\), such as utilizing techniques like adversarial learning, MMD, optimal transport [78; 79; 80; 81], and CORAL. In comparison to these methods, our **SDA** strategy (\(\mathcal{L}_{sda}\)) effectively eliminates the feature norm discrepancy in spherical space \(\mathbb{S}_{s}^{d-1}\) and guide a more stable alignment of feature distributions. Furthermore, considering that graph data contains rich structure information that encodes complex relationships among nodes and edges, and existing GTL methods usually adopt GCNs-based feature extractors to learn domain-invariant node features. However, recent studies [27; 63; 64; 16] have pointed out that GCNs are insufficient in capturing the sophisticated structure information in graph, which seriously affects the transfer of domain-invariant knowledge and consequently limits the model's generalization ability. To solve this problem, we thus propose the **STSA** strategy (\(\mathcal{L}_{ssta}\)) to align the topological structures of the input space and the spherical space, in order to facilitate the GCNs-based feature extractors to capture more domain-invariant node features. Consequently, the combination of **SDA** (\(\mathcal{L}_{sda}\)) and **STSA** (\(\mathcal{L}_{ssta}\)) strategies further promotes the minimization of the domain discrepancy \(d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})\).

Notably, \(\mu^{*}\) is expected to be extremely small, and therefore it is often neglected by previous methods. However, it is possible that \(\mu^{*}\) tends to be large when the cross-domain category distributions are not well aligned [82; 83]. In this paper, we leverage the **RNC** strategy (\(\mathcal{L}_{rnc}\)) to guide both labeled nodes and unlabeled nodes toward achieving robust clustering, effectively promoting the fine-grained alignment of category distributions and ensuring that \(\mu^{*}\) remains at a relatively small value.

In summary, our proposed method not only minimizes the source expected error \(\psi_{\mathcal{S}}(h)\) and domain discrepancy \(d_{\mathcal{H}\Delta\mathcal{H}}(\mathcal{S},\mathcal{T})\), but also keeps \(\mu^{*}\) at a small value, thereby ensuring a low upper bound.

## 5 Experiments

### Setup

**Datasets.** Our experiments involve three real-world graphs: _ACMv9_ (**A**), _Citationv1_ (**C**), and _DBLpv7_ (**D**), obtained from ArnetMiner [84]. Since these graphs have varying sets of node attributes, we union their attribute sets and adjust the attribute dimension to 6775 following [2]. Each node is assigned a five-class label, determined by its relevant research areas. Six typical transfer tasks are considered in our experiments: **A\(\rightarrow\)C**, **A\(\rightarrow\)D**, **C\(\rightarrow\)A**, **C\(\rightarrow\)D**, **D\(\rightarrow\)A** and **D\(\rightarrow\)C**. Due to the page size limitation, more settings and implementation details are placed on **Appendix**.

**Compared Methods.** We compare TFGDA with several SOTA **(1)** graph semi-supervised learning methods and **(2)** graph domain adaptation methods as Ref.[2]: **(1) GCN**[30], **GSAGE**[31], **GAT[32]**, **GIN**[85], **(2) DANN**[86], **CDAN**[12], **UDA-GCN**[75], **AdaGCN**[1], **CoCo**[27], **StruRW**[22] and **SGDA**[2]. DANN\({}_{GCN}\) and CDAN\({}_{GCN}\) are two variants that adopt GCN-based feature extractor.

### Results and Discussion

Following [2], to showcase the superiority of our TFGDA, we report its performance on the challenging scenario, where only **5%** of the nodes in the source graph are labeled. **Micro-F1** and **Macro-F1** are employed as evaluation metrics, and the classification results on the target graph are gathered in Table 1. For all transfer tasks, we run each experiment 5 times and record the average accuracy with standard deviation. And we sample different label sets each time to mitigate the randomness. As can be seen, our model obtains the overall best results on all transfer tasks. Specially, TFGDA greatly surpasses the SOTA method SGDA [2] by \(+7.3\%\) and \(+10.0\%\) on "Micro-F1" and "Macro-F1" respectively for the **C\(\rightarrow\)A** task, implying the superiority in extracting domain-invariant features. Notably, TFGDA enhances performance substantially on two hard transfer tasks, **C\(\rightarrow\)A** and **D\(\rightarrow\)A**,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

variant TFGDA-TR exhibits better intra-class compactness and inter-class separability in feature space, implying that the incorporation of topological structure information helps guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes, thereby promoting the learning of domain-invariant nodes features.

**4) Effect of RNC:** To show the effectiveness of our RNC strategy, we compare it with existing node clustering strategies, including conditional entropy minimization strategy (**CEM**) [75] and the recently proposed re-weighted pseudo-labeling strategy (**RPL**) [2]. We investigate the trend of Micro-F1 score during training on tasks **A\(\rightarrow\)C** and **A\(\rightarrow\)D**. The curves in Figure 3 reflect the following observations: **(1)** TFGDA-R converges more smoothly and quickly, achieving higher transfer performance, which suggests that RNC strategy can effectively accelerate the learning of domain-invariant features. **(2)** Compared to TFGDA-S (baseline), TFGDA-S + CEM suffers from severe performance degradation, as CEM may enforce over-confident probability on some misclassified unlabeled nodes. **(3)** RPL strategy fails to achieve satisfactory performance as it's sensitive to pseudo-label noise.

**5) Effect of Label Rate:** To verify the model's robustness under different label scarcity settings, we evaluate the performance of different methods on tasks **A\(\rightarrow\)C** and **A\(\rightarrow\)D**, using the following label rates for the source graph: 1%, 5%, 7%, 9%, and 10% respectively, as shown in Figure 4. It can be observed that our TFGDA significantly outperforms other competitors, even in the most challenging environment of 1% label rate, indicating the superiority of TFGDA in capturing transferable features.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we develop a novel model named TFGDA for SGDA. Specially, we propose a STSA strategy to encode critical structure information into latent space, significantly improving model's transfer performance. Moreover, to stably reduce domain discrepancy, the SDA strategy is introduced to align features distributions on sphere. We also devise the RNC strategy to guide the clustering of unlabeled nodes to address the overfitting issue, greatly enhancing the model's robustness. Comprehensive experiments and analysis verify the superiority of our TFGDA.

We run experiments on three real-world graphs: _ACMv9_ (**A**), _Citationv1_ (**C**), and _DBLpv7_ (**D**). In these graphs, every node refers to a paper, and the attribute of each paper is represented as a sparse bag-of-words vector derived from its title. The edges in these graphs depict citation relationships among the papers. Each node is assigned a five-class label, determined by its relevant research areas, including _Artificial Intelligence_, _Computer Vision_, _Database_, _Information Security_, and _Networking_.

Table 3 displays various statistical information of three graphs, including graph scale, attributes, average degree, and label proportion. We can observe substantial intrinsic discrepancy among these graphs. In this paper, we adopt an alternating approach where we select one of these graphs as the source domain, while considering the remaining two as the target domains.

### Implementation Details

Our experiments are implemented using Pytorch library. Following previous work [2], we choose a two-layer GCN as the feature extractor \(\mathcal{F}\) of TFGDA model. We randomly initialize the shift parameter \(\xi^{s}\) and \(\xi^{t}\) using uniform distributions \(\mathcal{U}_{s}(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\) and \(\mathcal{U}_{t}(-\epsilon,\epsilon)\), respectively. In all experiments, we set the value of \(\epsilon\) to 0.5. For all transfer tasks, we perform each random experiment 5 times and record the average accuracy with standard deviation. And we sample different label sets for each experiment to mitigate the randomness.

To optimize the network, we employ Adam optimizer with a weight decay of 0.001 for better convergence. The base learning rate is set to 0.002 for all tasks. In terms of the balanced coefficients \(\varepsilon\) and \(\eta\), we choose \(\varepsilon=0.3\) and \(\eta=1\) for all transfer tasks. Furthermore, instead of fixing the trade-off parameter \(\lambda\) of RNC strategy, we adopt a progressive schedule as [2] to dynamically adjust \(\lambda\) from 0 to 1 by multiplying by \(\frac{\theta}{\Theta}\) to more stably guide the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes, where \(\theta\) is the current epoch and \(\Theta\) is the maximum epoch. Parameter \(\tau\) in Eq.(8) is set to 0.999, and the spherical radius \(r\) is set to the lower bound.

In our STSA strategy, we choose to retain 0-dimensional topological information in PDs. This is because some preliminary experiments have shown that using higher-dimension topological information does not lead to clear accuracy improvements but noticeably increases the model's training time. For the subgraph sampling operation, we set the number of subgraphs to 10 and the number of nodes in each subgraph to 800 to strike a balance between model performance and training efficiency. During the inference process, we disable the shift parameters branch in our RNC strategy. Notably, for all methods (including the compared methods), the dimension of node features is set to 512.

### More Experiments and Analysis

#### a.3.1 More Ablation Study

**6) Effectiveness of SDA:** To demonstrate the effectiveness of SDA strategy, we compare it with existing domain alignment strategies, including adversarial training alignment strategy (**AT**) [1], sliced Wasserstein distance-based alignment strategy (**SWD**)[87], class-conditional MMD strategy (**CMMD**) [3], and the recently proposed shifting-guided adversarial training alignment strategy (**SAT**) [2]. We employ variant TFGDA-S as the baseline and evaluate the performance gains brought by these strategies on two typical transfer tasks: **A\(\rightarrow\)C** and **A\(\rightarrow\)D**.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} \hline Graph & \#Nodes & \#Edges & \#Attr. & Avg. Degree & Label Proportion (\%) \\ \hline \hline _ACMv9_ (**A**) & 9,360 & 15,602 & 5,571 & 1.667 & 20.5/29.6/22.5/8.6/18.8 \\ _Citationv1_ (**C**) & 8,935 & 15,113 & 5,379 & 1.691 & 25.3/26.0/22.5/7.7/18.5 \\ _DBLpv7_ (**D**) & 5,484 & 8,130 & 4,412 & 1.482 & 21.7/33.0/23.8/6.0/15.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The statistics of three real-world graphs. Note that ‘#’ means ‘the number of’. ‘Attr.’ refer to ‘Attributes’. ‘Avg.’ represents ‘Average’.

The results shown in Figure 5 reflect the following observations: **(1)** Compared to adversarial training-based strategies such as AT and SAT, our SDA strategy can bring greater performance improvements to the model, especially in the hard transfer task **A\(\rightarrow\)D**. This is because SDA implements a more stable distributions alignment process, which promotes the model to capture more transferable features. **(2)** The proposed SDA strategy works better than the SWD strategy, as SDA takes into account the manifold structure of the data in the spherical space, while SWD primarily focuses on the distribution discrepancy in the Euclidean space. **(3)** TFGDA-D significantly outperforms all compared strategies, which indicates the superiority of our SDA strategy in mitigating domain discrepancy and extracting domain-invariant features.

#### a.3.2 Parameter Sensitivity

The key parameters and notations in our TFGDA model are summarized in Table 4.

**7) Effect of Subgraphs:** As depicted in Figure 6, we investigate the effect of different numbers of sampled subgraphs \(a\) and different subgraph sizes \(|\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{i}|\) on the model's transfer performance, respectively.

We can obtain the following observations: **(1)** As the number of sampled subgraphs \(a\) increases, the model's transfer performance gradually improves until it converges. However, a large number of subgraphs can lead to slow model training. Therefore, in our model, we set the number of subgraphs to 10 to balance model's accuracy and training efficiency; **(2)** Similarly, as the size of the subgraphs \(|\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{i}|\) increases, the model's accuracy gradually improves until it converges. However, excessively large subgraphs also significantly increase training time. Hence, to strike a balance between performance and training efficiency, we set the number of nodes in each subgraph to 800. **(3)** When the number \(a\) or size \(|\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{i}|\) of the subgraphs is set too small, the model's performance becomes less robust, exhibiting a higher standard deviation. This is because, in such cases, the subgraphs struggle to capture the structure information present in the original graph sufficiently.

**8) Effect of Feature Perturbation Scale:** The constraint coefficient \(\varpi\) of shift parameters \(\xi_{s}\) and \(\xi_{t}\) is responsible for controlling the scale of node feature perturbation. To investigate the effect of coefficient \(\varpi\) in our framework, we train our TFGDA models with different \(\varpi\) and evaluate their performance on two tasks: **A\(\rightarrow\)C** and **A\(\rightarrow\)D**.

The results are illustrated in Figure 7 As \(\varpi\) increase, the model's accuracy first rises and then falls, which implies that properly perturbing the node feature can effectively enhance the model's robustness.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline Notation & Description \\ \hline \hline \(a\) & number of sampled subgraphs \(\left\{\hat{\mathcal{G}}_{1},\hat{\mathcal{G}}_{2},\cdots,\hat{\mathcal{G}}_ {a}\right\}\) \\ \(b\) & number of great circles projections \\ \(\varpi\) & a coefficient for controling the scale of feature perturbation \\ \(\eta\), \(\varepsilon\), \(\lambda\) & balance parameters of loss terms \(\mathcal{L}_{sda},\mathcal{L}_{stsa}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{rnc}\) \\ \(|\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{i}|\) & number of nodes in each subgraph \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

samples are assigned to the same cluster. In such case, maximizing MI naturally achieves a balance between reinforcing predictions and equalizing the cluster masses, thereby avoiding the occurrence of degenerate clustering solutions. The t-SNE node features visualization results in the main text also validate this viewpoint.

#### a.3.4 Limitation

Our model might has the following two limitations:

**(i)** As depicted in Figure 6 of the Appendix, the effectiveness of our STSA strategy depends on the quality of the subgraphs (_i.e._, subgraph size \(|\hat{\mathcal{V}}_{i}|\) and the number of subgraphs \(a\)). As a result, the model's transfer performance may decrease if the subgraph size is small or the number of subgraphs is small, as these local subgraphs are difficult to sufficiently capture the properties of the original graph.

**(ii)** As depicted in Figure 7 of the Appendix, the transfer ability of the model is affected by the feature perturbation scale \(\varpi\) in the RNC strategy. Specially, when the feature perturbation scale \(\varpi\) is set to a large value, it is difficult for the RNC strategy to accurately capture the intrinsic invariant features of nodes, which affects the discriminative clustering of unlabeled nodes and leads to a decline in model's generalization performance.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction section include the main claims made in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed the limitations of this work. Please refer to the Section A.3.4 in the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA] Justification: This work does not involve any novel theoretical findings. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided detailed implementation details in Section A.2 of the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [No] Justification: We have provided publicly available dataset information in Section A.1 of the Appendix. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided detailed implementation details and training settings in Section A.2 of the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our experimental results already include error bars. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have provided detailed experiment settings in Section A.2 of the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research conducted in the paper fully adheres to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: All the datasets involved in this paper are publicly available. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The data and code used in this paper have obtained legal permissions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
