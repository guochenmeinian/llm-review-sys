###### Abstract

Currently, researchers think that the inherent robustness of spiking neural networks (SNNs) stems from their biologically plausible spiking neurons, and are dedicated to developing more bio-inspired models to defend attacks. However, most work relies solely on experimental analysis and lacks theoretical support, and the direct-encoding method and fixed membrane potential leak factor they used in spiking neurons are simplified simulations of those in the biological nervous system, which makes it difficult to ensure generalizability across all datasets and networks. Contrarily, the biological nervous system can stay reliable even in a highly complex noise environment, one of the reasons is selective visual attention and non-fixed membrane potential leaks in biological neurons. This biological finding has inspired us to design a highly robust SNN model that closely mimics the biological nervous system. In our study, we first present a unified theoretical framework for SNN robustness constraint, which suggests that improving the encoding method and evolution of the membrane potential leak factor in spiking neurons can improve SNN robustness. Subsequently, we propose a robust SNN (FEEL-SNN) with Frequency Encoding (FE) and Evolutionary Leak factor (EL) to defend against different noises, mimicking the selective visual attention mechanism and non-fixed leak observed in biological systems. Experimental results confirm the efficacy of both our FE, EL, and FEEL methods, either in isolation or in conjunction with established robust enhancement algorithms, for enhancing the robustness of SNNs.

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) [21] have been increasingly prominent. Unlike traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs), which process a single image using floating-point values, spiking neural networks encode spatial-pixel image into temporal spike train. Information is transmitted by the occurrence of spikes (using \(0\) to signify no spike and \(1\) to denote a spike) whenever the membrane potential of a spiking neuron exceeds its threshold, thereby emulating biological neurons [30; 37; 14]. The distinctive spatio-temporal characteristics, discrete representation, and event-driven properties of SNNs enable them to operate efficiently on neuromorphic hardware [26; 4; 20; 46]. This makes them increasingly applicable to a variety of tasks [42; 19; 48], such as spatio-temporal pattern recognition [41] and high-speed detection [15]. As SNNs attract increasing attention from academia and industry, the issue of security [35] becomes more important. When SNNs are applied to safety-critical systems, their reliability should be a major concern [10]. While SNNs have demonstrated better robustness compared to ANNs [11; 32; 31], recent studies have shown that they are still vulnerable to noise [17; 8]. Among all types of perturbations, adversarial noise [35], whichrefers to visually imperceptible alterations that can mislead a well-trained network, is particularly concerning. Therefore, improving the robustness of SNNs is crucial for their real-life deployment.

At present, researchers believe that the inherent robustness of SNN is brought by its more biologically plausible spiking neurons, and they are dedicated to developing more bio-inspired models to cope with noise attacks. Among them, some work focuses on SNN robustness analysis. [11] investigates the SNNs robustness to adversarial attacks with different values of the neuron's firing voltage thresholds and time window boundaries. [9] suggests that the utility of spike timing in SNNs could improve the robustness against attacks. [39; 32; 3] analyze the adversarial accuracy of SNNs trained with leak factor in LIF spiking neurons. However, these analyses rely solely on experimental analysis and lack sufficient theoretical support to ensure generalizability across all datasets and networks. Other work aims to improve the robustness of SNN from biological aspects. [10] further introduces stochasticity in biological neurons as a stochastic gating mechanism for spiking neurons to enhance model robustness. However, this may result in the loss of the original information. The noise environment encountered by the biological nervous system is highly complex, with various types of noise spanning different frequency ranges [43]. Adversarial noises also exhibit different frequencies across datasets, rather than being fixed [23; 1]. Despite this complexity, the biological nervous system maintains robustness. This inspired us to design a highly robust SNN model that more closely mimics the biological nervous system, allowing it to adapt to and overcome the challenges posed by diverse and dynamic noise environments.

For the biological brain, as shown in Fig. (1a), there exists the selective visual attention mechanism that selectively focuses on stimuli of different frequencies over time and can filter out unwanted information [7; 45]. This aids the biological nervous system in avoiding the instability caused by noise [44]. Additionally, as shown in Fig. (1b), the changes in membrane potential in biological neurons are determined by ion concentration inside and outside the cell membrane. Different environments and types of nerve axon fibers can affect the degree of leak of the membrane potential [38; 13], which contributes to the biological nervous system's processing of complex noise [33]. Motivated by these biological insights, we undertake a theoretical examination of the robustness of SNNs. We present a unified framework for SNN robustness constraint, which indicates that refining the encoding technique and evolution of the membrane potential leak factor can enhance SNN robustness. Subsequently, we propose a robust SNN with Frequency Encoding and Evolutionary Leak factor (FEEL-SNN) to defend against different noises. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

* Through analysis of the model's adversarial loss, we theoretically present a unified framework for SNN robustness. Our findings suggest that enhancing the encoding method and evolution of the membrane potential leak factor can improve SNN robustness.
* We propose a frequency encoding (FE) method for SNNs. FE captures information of varying frequencies at different time steps, mimicking the selective visual attention mechanism observed in biological systems. FE can preserve the original information while suppressing different frequency range noises, effectively filtering out image noise.
* Based on FE, we propose an evolutionary membrane potential leak factor (EL). EL ensures that different neurons in the network learn the optimal robustness leak factor at different time steps, which is aimed at learning the correlation between frequencies at different time steps. It simulates the membrane potential leak in biological neurons and ensures an enhancement in model robustness.

* Experimental results validate that both our FE and EL methods can effectively improve the robustness of SNN to different noises, and can be used in conjunction with other methods to improve the robustness further.

## 2 Related Work

[24; 31] demonstrate that compared to ANNs, SNNs exhibit inherent robustness. Currently, researchers consider that this superior robustness of SNNs stems from their more biologically plausible spiking neurons, and they are dedicated to developing more bio-inspired models to cope with noise attacks. [11] investigate the security of SNNs from the impact of structural parameters on the robustness of SNNs to adversarial attacks, and demonstrate that the inherent robustness of SNNs is highly conditioned by the choice of (time window; firing voltage thresholds) combination. [9] systematically demonstrates that precise spike timing is conducive to improving the robustness of neural networks, providing opportunities for understanding the robustness of the brain. [32] confirms that the leak factor in LIF neurons offers an extra knob to control the adversarial perturbation. [3] also investigates the role played by leak factor and concludes from frequency domain analysis that leak factor can filter high-frequency components thus improving model robustness. However, the spiking neurons used in these works only offer a simplified representation of the intricate dynamics of the biological system [10], and the robustness verification of the above works is mainly carried out experimentally, lacking a theoretical explanation. It's doubtful that their conclusion can adapt to other datasets and varying noises. Then, StoG [10] is proposed to further introduce stochasticity which is observed in biological neurons into the spiking neurons. The more biologically plausible StoG method can improve the robustness efficiently, however, it sacrifices a little original accuracy. In contrast to the aforementioned work, we conducted a theoretical analysis of the robustness of SNNs, showing that it is constrained by the encoding method and the membrane potential leak factor. We then designed a frequency encoding and evolutionary leak factor model that closely mimics the biological nervous system to enhance the robustness of SNNs.

Another method improves the robustness of SNNs by incorporating additional training strategies. [17] continuously adds newly generated adversarial examples during the training process to improve the robustness of SNN. [8] proposes a regularized adversarial training scheme by performing the Lipschitz analysis on model weights. However, these methods are rooted in the concept of adversarial training [22] in ANNs, and their defense performance can be influenced by downstream tasks. Furthermore, they all rely on a simplified direct encoding approach (i.e., repeating the original image \(T\) times) as input, which deviates from the visual attention mechanism observed in biological brains. Developing more biologically plausible models is essential for improving robustness and advancing SNN applications. In this work, we leverage the selective visual attention mechanism found in biological brains and introduce a frequency encoding method. This method effectively filters noise in images, enhancing the robustness of SNNs.

## 3 Preliminaries

### Spiking Neurons

The most commonly used spiking neuron of SNNs today is the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) spiking neuron [36; 6]. LIF neurons simplify and computationally simulate the three main processes involved in information transmission in biological neurons: synaptic integration, membrane potential accumulation and decay, and neuronal firing. The dynamics of LIF spiking neurons in layer \(l\) can be described as follows:

\[Synaptic\quad integration:\quad\bm{m}_{l}^{t}=\begin{cases}\bm{W}_{l-1,l} \bm{O}_{l-1}^{t},&l>1\\ \bm{x}^{t}.&l=1\end{cases}\] (1)

\[Membrane\quad potential\quad accumulation:\quad\bm{u}_{l}^{t}=\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t} \bm{u}_{l}^{t-1}\odot(1-\bm{O}_{l}^{t-1})+\bm{m}_{l}^{t}.\] (2)

\[Neuronal\quad firing:\quad\bm{O}_{l}^{t}=\mathcal{H}(\bm{u}_{l}^{t}-V_{th}).\] (3)

In the first layer, the injected electrical signal \(\bm{m}_{1}^{t}\) accumulates from the input signal \(\bm{x}^{t}\). For subsequent layers \(l>1\), the electrical signal \(\bm{m}_{l}^{t}\) is the sum of spike signals \(\bm{O}_{l-1}^{t}\) from the preceding layer scaled by weights \(\bm{W}_{l-1,l}\). The operator \(\odot\) represents element-wise product. The membrane potential \(\bm{u}_{l}^{t}\) at time step \(t\) is the accumulation of the leaked membrane potential \(\bm{u}_{l}^{t-1}\) from the previous time step and the newly injected signal \(\bm{m}_{l}^{t}\). If the membrane potential \(\bm{u}_{l}^{t}\) exceeds the threshold \(V_{th}\), a spike \(\bm{O}_{l}^{t}\) is generated by a Heaviside function \(\mathcal{H}(\cdot)\). After spikes are produced, the membrane potential of the corresponding neurons is reset to 0. Typically, \(\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t}\) is treated as a constant value \(\lambda\in(0,1]\) in previous work.

### Adversarial Attacks

Given a classification model \(f\) with dataset \((\bm{x},y_{true})\), where \(\bm{x}\) is the clean image and \(y_{true}\) is the corresponding label. The adversarial attack aims to generate an adversarial example \(\hat{\bm{x}}\) that satisfies:

\[f(\hat{\bm{x}})\neq f(\bm{x})\quad s.t.\quad||\hat{\bm{x}}-\bm{x}||_{p}\leq\epsilon,\] (4)

where\(||\cdot||_{p}\) is the \(L_{p}\)-norm, we use \(L_{\infty}\)-norm on our work, and \(\epsilon\) limits the strength of the perturbation to a level that is indistinguishable to the human eye. Here we consider four classic adversarial attack algorithms: Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) [12], Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) [22], Basic iterative Method (BIM) [18] and CW [2] attacks. The detailed formulations of these attacks can be found in the Appendix A.1. The introduction of surrogate functions [25; 47; 41] addresses the limitation of backpropagating gradients through LIF neurons. This advancement enables effective adversarial attacks on SNNs using the aforementioned methods.

## 4 FEEL-SNN: Robust SNNs with Frequency Encoding and Evolutionary Leak Factor

### The robustness analysis of SNNs

The robustness of the model is quantified as \(\mathcal{L}(\bm{x}+\epsilon)-\mathcal{L}(\bm{x})\), the difference in loss value before and after perturbation. Improving robustness entails reducing this perturbation-induced loss difference. [27] utilizes the local linearity technique to theoretically address this difference, expressed as:

\[\mathcal{L}(\bm{x}+\epsilon)-\mathcal{L}(\bm{x})\leq|\epsilon\odot\nabla_{ \bm{x}}\mathcal{L}(x)|_{1}+g(\epsilon,\bm{x}),\] (5)

where \(g(\epsilon,\bm{x})\) is the residual term, \(|\cdot|_{1}\) is \(l_{1}\) norm for vector. This theoretical framework motivates research into regularization that minimize \(|\epsilon\odot\nabla_{\bm{x}}\mathcal{L}(x)|_{1}\) in ANNs to enhance robustness [18; 29].

The situation for SNNs differs slightly from that for ANNs [10]. In SNNs, the perturbed input \(\hat{\bm{x}}=\bm{x}+\epsilon\) is encoded into temporal trains over \(T\) time steps. Consequently, the robustness constraint for SNNs should aim to minimize the term \(\sum_{t}|\epsilon(t)\odot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t}}|_{1}\) according to Eq. (5), where \(\bm{x}^{t}\) is the input encoding image at time step \(t\), and \(\epsilon(t)\) represents the perturbation of the encoding image \(\bm{x}^{t}\) at time step \(t\). By applying the BPTT rule [41], we can derive the constraint for the term \(\sum_{t}|\epsilon(t)\odot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t}}|_{1}\) in SNNs, as presented in Theorem 1 (The detailed proof is in the Appendix A.2).

**Theorem 1**: _Given an L-layered SNN intended to inference \(T\) time-steps with \(\bm{\lambda}\) as the leak factor, suppose that there are \(N_{l}\) neurons in layer \(l\) for \(l=1,2,\ldots L\). \(\bm{\lambda}_{l}\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{l}\times T}\), \(\bm{W}_{l-1,l}\in\mathbb{R}^{N_{l}\times N_{l-1}}\), it satisfies:_

\[\min\sum_{t}|\epsilon(t)\odot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t}}|_{ 1}=\min\sum_{t}|\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}[(\underbrace{\prod_{k=t}^{T}\epsilon( t)\odot\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{k}}_{\text{1}})\cdot\underbrace{\prod_{q=2}^{l}\bm{W}_{q-1,q}}_{ \text{2}}\cdot\underbrace{\prod_{v=1}^{l}\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{v}^{t}}{ \partial\bm{u}_{v}^{t}}}_{\text{3}}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial \bm{O}_{l}^{T}}]|_{1},\] (6)

_where \(\epsilon\) is the perturbation, \(\mathcal{L}\) is the loss function._

According to Eq. (6), the robustness of SNNs is relative to the perturbation \(\epsilon\) and the leak factor \(\bm{\lambda}\) in the 1 term, the model weight \(\bm{W}\) in the 2 term, and the \(\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{v}^{t}}\) in the 3 term. Eq. (6) presents a unified framework for SNNs robustness constraint, which helps explain why weight regularization [8] (the 2 term) and surrogate gradient [40] (the 3 term ) can promote robustness. And the previous work [39; 32; 3] also analyzes the inherent robustness of SNNs from the leak factor in the 1 term. However, there is still a lack of work on removing input perturbation and improving leak factors in the 1 term to enhance the robustness of SNNs.

### Frequency encoding to simulate the selective visual attention in biological brain

According to the 1 term in Eq. (6), reducing input perturbations \(\epsilon(t)\) at every time step helps the model achieve reliable output. However, the encoding method that much of the current work relies on is the simplified direct encoding approach [11; 9; 10] (_i.e._, repeating \(T\) images), which repeats the noise \(T\) times and inevitably overlooks noise removal. In contrast, the biological nervous system can maintain stability even in complex noise environments, benefiting from the selective visual attention mechanism [7; 45] of the brain (as illustrated in Fig. (1a). The brain processes only a fraction of the information available on the retina at any given time and has the ability to filter out unwanted information. To simulate the selective visual attention of the biological nervous system while effectively removing noise at different frequencies, we propose the Frequency Encoding method (FE) for SNNs. Specifically, given an input image, FE transforms it into the frequency domain via Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) [34; 49]. Then, FE suppresses information of different frequencies at different time steps to decrease \(\epsilon(t)\) shown in the 1 term in Eq. (6). Specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 2, the information of the original image is concentrated in the low-frequency region (center area of the second column), while the noise information spans from low-frequency (center area) to high-frequency (edgearea) regions (third to fifth columns). Therefore, to remove as much frequency noise from the image as possible, the frequency suppression range gradually increases from high-frequency to low-frequency over time steps. This operator ensures that FE removes various noises present in the original image while retaining its essential information, as depicted in Fig. (3a).

Formally, denote \(\bm{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times N}\) as the input image and \(\bm{x}^{F}\in\mathbb{C}^{M\times N}\) as its frequency representation, then the DFT (\(\mathcal{F}\)) between \(\bm{x}\) and \(\bm{x}^{F}\) is formulated as follows:

\[\bm{x}^{F}_{m,n}=\mathcal{F}(\bm{x}_{m,n})=\sum_{a=0}^{M-1}\sum_{b=0}^{N-1}\bm {x}_{a,b}e^{-j2\pi(\frac{m}{M}a+\frac{N}{N}b)},\] (7)

Figure 3: Illustration of the proposed FEEL-SNN. (a) Frequency encoding to simulate the selective visual attention in biological brain and (b) Evolutionary leak factor to simulate the non-fixed membrane potential leak in biological nervous system.

Figure 2: Visualization frequency spectrums for data observation. The first column shows three cases of original CIFAR10 images. The second column shows the corresponding frequency spectrums of the images in the first column. The third column to the seventh column shows the frequency spectrums of corresponding added noises to the images in the first column, where added noise maps the difference between the noise image and the original one. The center of each frequency spectrum represents the low-frequency information, and the edge area is the high-frequency information.

and according to the DFT, the low-frequency parts of the image is in the center of the \(\bm{x}^{F}\). To suppress different frequency components at different time steps, for a given time step \(t\), we update \(\bm{x}^{F_{i}}\) as follows:

\[\bm{x}^{F_{i}}\leftarrow\mathcal{M}\odot\bm{x}^{F_{i}}\] (8)

where \(\odot\) is element-wise multiplication. The matrix \(\mathcal{M}\in\mathbb{R}^{M\times N}\) controls the scaling of different frequencies. Intuitively, \(\mathcal{M}\) should be close to 0 for high-frequency components and close to 1 for low-frequency ones. In this study, we set \(\mathcal{M}\) to a box window with radius \(r\), defined as:

\[\mathcal{M}_{m,n}=\begin{cases}1,&0\leq|m|,|n|\leq r\\ 0.&else\end{cases}\] (9)

The overall function of our Frequency Encoding (FE) module at time step \(t\) is then defined as:

\[\widetilde{\bm{x}}_{r_{i}}^{t}\leftarrow\mathcal{F}^{-1}(\mathcal{M}_{r_{i}} ^{t}\odot\mathcal{F}^{t}(\bm{x})),\quad i,t\in\{1,2,\dots,T\},\] (10)

and set

\[r_{i}>r_{j},\quad if\quad i<j.\] (11)

In summary, the proposed FE method, as described in Eq. (10), allows us to control the frequency mask radius \(r\) at each time step, enabling the suppression of different frequency ranges. This effectively removes noise at various frequencies, thereby enhancing the robustness of SNNs.

Evolutionary leak factor to simulate the non-fixed membrane potential leak in biological nervous system

Recalling the 1 term in Eq. (6), in addition to the proposed frequency encoding, the selection of the leak factor \(\bm{\lambda}\) is also crucial for improving the robustness of SNNs. However, most existing work overlooks this aspect [8; 17]. They often assume that all neurons in the SNN adopt the same fixed leak factor at all time steps, which contradicts the membrane potential leak mechanism of the biological nervous system. In the biological nervous system, neuron membrane potential exhibits varying degrees of leak due to different environmental conditions and axon fibers [38; 13], aiming to enhance the processing of useful information [33], as illustrated in Fig. (1b). Therefore, in this study, we draw inspiration from the biological membrane potential leak and propose a method for training SNNs with an evolutionary membrane potential leak factor (EL).

According to 1 term in Eq. (6), a smaller leak \(\bm{\lambda}\) can better constrain robustness. However, excessive leak can lead to a significant loss of effective information and a decrease in original accuracy. Thus, in our approach, we aim for EL to learn the correlation between frequencies at different time steps, building upon the foundation of FE to ensure effective information utilization. We propose a trainable leak factor training scheme instead of the leak factor regularization term in our work. Specifically, leveraging the frequency-encoded input, we assign trainable leak factors to different neurons within a layer across time steps to mitigate the propagation of noise information, as shown in Fig. (3b).

Formally, the neurons in the convolutional and fully-connected layers are defined by the LIF, as illustrated in Eq. (1)(2)(3), and finally the leak factor update is computed as:

\[\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t}=\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t}-\eta\triangle\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t},\] (12)

\[\triangle\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{\lambda} _{l}^{t}}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}\cdot\frac{ \partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t}}\cdot\frac{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^ {t}}{\partial\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{t}}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{O}_ {l}^{t}}\cdot\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t}}\cdot\bm{u}_ {l}^{t-1},\] (13)

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{CE}(x,y,\bm{W},\bm{\lambda}),\] (14)

where \(\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t}}\) is estimated by the surrogate gradient, \(\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t}}=\frac{1}{\gamma^{2}}\max (0,\gamma-|\bm{u}_{l}^{t}-V_{th}|)\). \(\gamma\) denotes the constraint factor that determines the sample range to activate the gradient. \(\mathcal{L}_{CE}\) is the commonly used Cross-Entroy loss.

To sum up, our FEEL-SNN focuses on the 1 term of Eq. (6). Here, FE serves to attenuate the impact of input noise \(\epsilon(t)\) during each time step, while EL facilitates the continual learning of information correlations across varying time steps. This concerted effort enables a more effective utilization of useful information, thereby enhancing the robustness of the model.

## 5 Experiments

### Experimental settings

The datasets we used are CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 [16], and Tiny-ImageNet [5]. The network architectures include VGG11, WideResNet16, and ResNet19. We set \(\gamma=1.0\) in surrogate gradient and threshold \(V_{th}=1.0\) in Eq. (3) following the general settings [6]. We adopted four training strategies to determine the effectiveness of the proposed FEEL method. The first is a vanilla training scheme (BPTT), directly using raw images for training [41]. The second is an adversarial training strategy, which uses examples from white-box (WB) PGD attacks (\(\epsilon=2/255\), iterative step \(k=2\)) for training [12] (abbreviated as AT). The third is to add a Lipschitz penalty proposed in [8] to the weights under the adversarial training setting (abbreviated as RAT). The fourth introduces the stochastic gating mechanisms to spike firing [10] (abbreviated as StoG). For all four strategies, we test their robustness with and without the proposed FE and FEEL methods. The attack methods include adversarial attacks (i.e., FGSM [12], PGD with random start [22], BIM [18], and CW [2], for both white-box and black-box attacks) and common noise attack (i.e., gaussian noise, GN). Since the DFT (\(\mathcal{F}\)), IDFT (\(\mathcal{F}^{-1}\)) (Eq. (7) and Eq. (10)) and frequency mask operation (\(\mathcal{M}\odot\mathbf{x}^{F_{t}}\), Eq. (8)) are differentiable, the FE module can be directly utilized to generate adversarial perturbations.

Figure 4: Performance of the proposed FE and FEEL under different **white-box attacks**. The attack perturbation \(\epsilon=4/255\) for all attacks, iterative step \(k=4\), and step size \(\alpha=0.01\) for PGD, BIM.

Figure 5: Performance of the proposed FE and FEEL under different **black-box attacks**. The attack perturbation \(\epsilon=4/255\) for all attacks, and iterative step \(k=4\) for PGD, BIM.

Therefore, the adversarial perturbations are applied to the image domain before FE. In our study, for CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset with \(T=4\), we set \(r=[16,14,12,10]\). For CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 dataset with \(T=8\), we set \(r=[16,14,12,10,8,6,4,2]\). For Tiny-ImageNet with \(T=4\), we set \(r=[32,30,28,26]\). The impact of the frequency masking radius \(r\) on robustness is detailed in Section 5.3. More detailed experimental settings can be found in Appendix A.3.

### Overall performance for various attack types

**White-box attack.** First, we integrate the proposed FE and FEEL methods into the standard training (vanilla) of SNNs. We present experimental results for our method on various datasets (_i.e._, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet) using different networks (_i.e._, VGG11, WideResNet16, and ResNet19) under white-box attacks, as summarized in Fig. 4. Our findings demonstrate that across all attacks, FE and FEEL can enhance model robustness and maintain the original accuracy. Specifically, on VGG11 with CIFAR-10, compared to the vanilla method (shown in blue bar), FEEL enhances model robustness by up to 15% and 6% against PGD and CW attacks, respectively, at time step 4. Similar trends are observed across other datasets and networks. Moreover, it is clear from the Fig. 4 that simple FE application can effectively improve the robustness of SNN, and EL can further effectively improve the robustness based on FE.

**Black-box attack.** We utilize a model trained with a different seed to generate perturbed images for black-box attacks. The efficacy of our FE and FEEL method under various attacks is illustrated in Fig. 5. Across all models and datasets, the same observation can be obtained as the white-box performance. FE and FEEL consistently outperform vanilla training. Notably, with \(T=8\), FEEL enhances robustness (attacked by CW) by up to 4.27% compared to the vanilla approach, when on WideResNet16 with CIFAR100.

**Comparison with state-of-the-art work on robustness of SNN.** To further evaluate the effectiveness of our FE and FEEL methods, we compare it with state-of-the-art (SOTA) robust SNN methods, namely AT [12], RAT [8], and StoG [10] in Tab. 1. From Tab. 1, we observe that FE and FEEL can enhance the original accuracy and robustness of these SOTA methods. For example, when under attack by PGD, SNN-RAT improves the robustness of the original model (Vanilla) from 0.16% to 8.87%, our FE (RAT+FE) enhances the robustness of RAT (RAT) to 9.70%. FEEL further enhances the robustness of RAT (RAT+FEEL) to 12.36%. These experimental results underscore the effectiveness of our FE and FEEL methods.

The improvement brought by our method is shown in parentheses.

### Ablation study

**Performance under different \(\epsilon\) and iterative step \(k\).** We plot the accuracy of the white-box and black-box scenarios under PGD attack with varying \(\epsilon\) and iterative step \(k\) in Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, respectively. The results indicate that the accuracy of our FEEL models decreases slowly compared to that of vanilla models.

**Rationality of FE method.** To further verify the effectiveness of FE which crops information from high-frequency to low-frequency over time steps, we compare it with an alternative strategy, Inverse-FE (IFE), which crops information from low-frequency to high-frequency over time steps. As shown in Tab. 2, IFE causes a significant drop in clean accuracy (64.81% vs. vanilla 92.64%). This demonstrates that a substantial amount of valid information is lost, verifying that valid information is concentrated in the low-frequency area. In contrast, FE not only effectively removes noise (21.56% vs. vanilla 15.59% when under PGD attack) but also minimizes the loss of valid information (92.26% vs. vanilla 92.64%).

**Effect of frequency masking radius \(r\) on robustness.** We investigate the frequency masking radius \(r\) on robustness to SNNs, defined in Eq. (9), which governs the degree of frequency suppression at each time step. We present three different strategies to illustrate the superiority of our method as shown in Tab. 3. The first strategy employs a direct encoding method, wherein the frequency information outside a fixed radius \(r\) is removed from each original image, followed by T-step image replication (using a different \(r\) for each image, akin to data augmentation), as depicted in the first row of Tab. 3. The second strategy utilizes FE but with a uniform radius \(r\) across all time steps, as shown in rows 2 to 5 of Tab. 3. The third strategy is the FE method proposed in this study, where a different \(r\) is applied to each time step to remove as many noise frequencies as possible, as depicted in the last row of Tab. 3. From Tab. 3, we observe that across various \(r\) selections, our method outperforms the first and second strategies in all attack scenarios.

**Rationality of EL method.** According to Eq. (2), the leak factor controls the residual membrane potential between time steps. A smaller leak factor may lead to a weakened temporal modeling capability of the SNN, leading to a decline in network performance [28]. Considering the leak factor's

dual role in original information transmission (Eq. (2)) and robustness enhancement (Eq. (6)), we propose EL. The EL dynamically learns the optimal robustness leak factor across different time steps and neurons, which also increases the expression capability of SNN, helping maintain clean accuracy and improving robustness. We further compare EL with two alternative strategies. The first strategy sets all leak factors to 0. The second strategy, termed Reg-EL (REL), adds L2 regularization to the EL to further constrain the leak factor. As shown in Tab. 6 in Appendix. A.4, a small leak factor significantly reduces clean accuracy (vanilla 92.64% vs. REL 88.52% vs. EL with \(\lambda=0.0\) at 81.76%), consistent with analysis above. Besides, a small leak factor does increase the robustness of SNN (\(e.g.\), under PGD attack, EL with \(\lambda=0.0\) is 63.80%, REL is 29.98%, compared to vanilla 15.59%). This also aligns with the proposed robustness framework (Eq. (6)) by demonstrating that controlling the leak factor improves robustness. And our EL method ensures improvements in both robustness and original accuracy (\(e.g.\), the PGD defense accuracy of EL is 30.27%, compared to 15.59% for vanilla, and the clean accuracy of EL is 92.73%, compared to 92.64% for vanilla). In Appendix. A.4, we further verify the proposed EL does not destroy the impact of other terms in Eq. (6) on the robustness of SNN.

All the above experimental results illustrate the rationality and effectiveness of our method.

## 6 Conclusions and Discussions

**Conclusion:** In this study, drawing inspiration from the selective visual attention and dynamic membrane potential leak observed in biological nervous systems, we introduce a robust SNN with Frequency Encoding and Evolutionary membrane potential Leak factor (FEEL-SNN). Specifically, our approach theoretically presents a unified framework for SNN robustness, demonstrating that refining the encoding technique and evolving the membrane potential leak factor can enhance SNN robustness. Then we propose a novel image encoding method for SNNs, termed frequency encoding (FE). FE captures information of varying frequencies at different time steps, which preserves the original information while suppressing different frequency range noises, effectively filtering out image noise. Building upon FE, we propose an evolutionary leak factor (EL). EL ensures that different neurons in the network learn the optimal robustness leak factor at different time steps. It facilitates the continual learning of information correlations across varying time steps, enabling more effective utilization of pertinent information and thereby enhancing SNN robustness. Experimental results validate that both our FE and EL methods can effectively improve the robustness of SNN to different noises, and can be used in conjunction with other methods to improve the robustness further.

**Limitation:** Our focus has been primarily on static datasets. In future work, how to propose a reliable and effective encoding method for the DVS datasets is a topic worthy of study.

**Broader Impact:** In neuroscience, the selective visual attention and non-fixed membrane potential leak are considered to contribute to the robustness of biological nervous systems. By using SNN as a research tool, computational modeling of biological nervous systems can be further facilitated. We can contribute valuable insights to ongoing discussions in neuroscience regarding robustness.

Appendix

### The attacks we used in this study

Given a classification model \(f\) with dataset \((\bm{x},y_{true})\), where \(\bm{x}\) is the clean image and \(y_{true}\) is the corresponding correct label. The formulations of the attacks we used in this study are described as follows:

**FGSM.** FGSM aims to perturb the original data \(\bm{x}\) along the sign direction of the gradient on loss function with one step to increase the perturbed linear output, thus fool the network, it can be formalized as follows:

\[\hat{\bm{x}}=\bm{x}+\epsilon\text{sign}(\nabla_{\bm{x}}\mathcal{L}(f(\bm{x}),y _{true})),\] (15)

where \(\text{sign}(\cdot)\) is an odd mathematical function that extracts the sign of a real number.

**PGD.** PGD attack is the iterative variant of FGSM. It first starts from a random perturbation in the \(L_{p}\)-norm constraint around the original sample \(\bm{x}\), then takes a gradient iteration step in the sign direction to achieve the greatest loss output, it can be formalized as follows:

\[\hat{\bm{x}}^{0}=\bm{x}+\text{U}(-\epsilon,+\epsilon),\] (16)

\[\hat{\bm{x}}^{k+1}=\text{Clip}_{\bm{x},\epsilon}\{\hat{\bm{x}}^{k}+\alpha \cdot\text{sign}(\nabla_{\hat{\bm{x}}^{k}}\mathcal{L}(f(\hat{\bm{x}}^{k}),y_{ true}))\},\] (17)

where \(k\) is the iterative step, \(\alpha\) is step size for each attack iteration, \(\epsilon\) controls the perturbation level. \(\text{U}(\cdot)\) is a uniform function, \(\text{Clip}_{\bm{x},\epsilon}\{\bm{x}\}\) is the function which performs per-pixel clipping of the image \(\hat{\bm{x}}\), so the result will be in \(L_{\infty}\)-norm \(\epsilon\)-neighbourhood of the original image \(\bm{x}\).

**BIM.** Both BIM and PGD attacks are iterative attacks. Different from PGD attacks, BIM updates the adversarial samples starting from the original image.

**CW.** CW attack is different from previous gradient-based attack methods. It is based on model optimization to generate adversarial samples. Its optimization function is as follows:

\[minimize|\frac{1}{2}(\tanh(\bm{W})+1)-\bm{x}||_{2}^{2}+c\cdot f(\tanh(\bm{W} )+1),\] (18)

where \(f\) defined as

\[f(\hat{\bm{x}})=\max(\max\{Z(\hat{\bm{x}})_{i}:i\neq j\}-Z(\hat{\bm{x}})_{j},- k),\] (19)

where \(c\) is a parameter to control the perturbation, \(Z(\cdot)_{i}\) represents the logits output on label \(y_{i}\).

### Proof for Theorem 1

Proof for Theorem 1 is given as follows:

_Proof._ By applying the spatial-temporal backpropagation (STBP) rule [41], we have

\[\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t}} =\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}[(\underbrace{\partial\mathcal{L}}_{ \partial\mathcal{D}_{l}^{T}}_{\partial}\frac{\partial\mathcal{D}_{l}^{T}}{ \partial\bm{u}_{l}^{T-1}}\cdots\underbrace{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t+1}}_{\partial \bm{u}_{l}^{t}})(\underbrace{\partial\bm{u}_{l}^{t}}_{\partial\bm{O}_{l-1}^{t }}\frac{\partial\mathcal{O}_{l-1}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l-1}^{t}}\cdots\frac{ \partial\bm{u}_{2}^{t}}{\partial\bm{O}_{1}^{t}}\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{1}^{t}}{ \partial\bm{u}_{1}^{t}})\cdot\frac{\partial\bm{u}_{1}^{t}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t} }],\] \[=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}[\prod_{k=t}^{T}\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{k} \cdot\prod_{q=2}^{l}\bm{W}_{q-1,q}\cdot(\underbrace{\partial\mathcal{L}}_{ \partial\mathcal{D}_{l}^{T}}\frac{\partial\mathcal{D}_{l}^{T}}{\partial\bm{u}_ {l}^{T}}\frac{\partial\mathcal{O}_{l-1}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{l-1}^{t}}\cdots \frac{\partial\bm{O}_{1}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{1}^{t}})]\] (20) \[=\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}[\prod_{k=t}^{T}\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{k} \cdot\prod_{q=2}^{l}\bm{W}_{q-1,q}\cdot\prod_{v=1}^{l}\frac{\partial\bm{O}_{v }^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{v}^{t}}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{O}_ {l}^{T}}]\]

Therefore,

\[\min\sum_{t}|\epsilon(t)\odot\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\bm{x}^{t}}|_{ 1}=\min\sum_{t}|\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^{L}[(\underbrace{\prod_{k=t}^{T} \epsilon(t)\odot\bm{\lambda}_{l}^{k}}_{\text{1}})\cdot\underbrace{\prod_{q=2} ^{l}\bm{W}_{q-1,q}}_{\text{2}}\cdot\underbrace{\prod_{v=1}^{l}\frac{\partial \bm{O}_{v}^{t}}{\partial\bm{u}_{v}^{t}}}_{\text{3}}\cdot\frac{\partial\mathcal{ L}}{\partial\bm{O}_{l}^{T}}]|_{1},\] (21)

### More experimental settings

In our work, the training process lasts for 300 epochs for all experiments. Batch normalization are used in the network to overcome the gradient vanishing or explosion. SGD optimizer is deployed, and the initial learning rate is set to 0.1. The learning rate uses a cosine annealing schedule with \(T_{max}\) equaling the max number of epochs. All the experiments are conducted on the PyTorch platform on NVIDIA RTX 3090.

### More experimental results

In Tab. 4, we integrate the proposed FE and FEEL methods into the standard training (vanilla) of SNNs. The same as the results in the main paper, we can see from Tab. 4 that in different datasets (_i.e._, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet), different networks (_i.e._, VGG11, WideResNet16, and ResNet19) and different time steps (\(T=4,8\)), both FE and FEEL can effectively and stably improve the robustness of the vanilla model to different attacks. This further verify the effectiveness of our method.

**Performance when using the EL method alone.** We have included the performance of our EL combined with the vanilla and SOTA robust methods in Tab. 5. Combined with Tab. 1. It is evident that both FE and EL effectively enhance the robustness of the original methods, with FEEL further improving robustness on this foundation. For instance, under a PGD attack, the original AT method achieves 8.63% accuracy, while our FE increases robustness to 9.70%, EL to 11.15%, and FEEL to 12.36%. This illustrates the effectiveness of each module of our method.

**EL does not destroy the impact of other terms in Eq. (6) on the robustness of SNN.** We would like to discuss how the leak factor affects other terms in Eq. (6) in two cases: 1) leak factor \(\lambda\) as a hyperparameter predefined before neural network training and 2) leak factor \(\lambda\) as a learnable parameter during neural network training (the proposed EL implementation).

1). In the first case, \(\lambda\) is a fixed number during neural network training (similar to \(\epsilon\) in 1 term). Hence, it will not affect other terms in Eq. (6)) at all. To validate the correctness of our theoretical framework (\(i.e.\), smaller 1 term results in less perturbation in the output), we conduct additional experiments, \(i.e.\), training different neural networks with different fixed \(\lambda\) (keep the remaining settings exactly the same as that reported in experimental settings in the main paper). As results shown in Tab. 6, a smaller \(\lambda\) results in a more robust model, indicating that smaller 1 term results in less perturbation in

the output in this case. As can also be observed from Tab. 6, a smaller \(\lambda\) could also bring performance degradation for clear inputs, \(i.e.\), from 92.26% at \(\lambda=1.0\) to 81.76% at \(\lambda=0.0\). To mitigate the performance degradation, we implement the leak factor as a learnable parameter.

2). In the second case, it is difficult to directly analyze the influence of \(\lambda\) on other terms in Eq. (6) due to their complex relationship. Therefore, we analyze the influence by validating whether 1 term for robustness improvement affects 2 term or 3 term's effectiveness for the same goal. To be specific, as analyzed in main paper, RAT (weights regularization) is essentially minimizing 2 term. And we now add a gradient constraint via the L2 norm (gradient penalty regularization (GP)) to minimize 3 term. We conduct additional comparisons with these two methods to two alternatives of our methods. These two alternatives are implemented by additionally optimizing \(\lambda\) for methods RAT and GP (keeping remaining parts unchanged), represented as RAT+EL and GP+EL, respectively. As shown in Tab. of the main paper and Tab. 5 and Tab. 6, RAT+EL and GP+EL significantly improve the robustness of RAT and GP, across different attack types and datasets, respectively. These results show that leveraging 1 term for robustness improvement does not interfere with 2 term or 3 term's effectiveness for the same goal, indicating that the leak factor does not affect other terms in Eq. (6).

In summary, results in both cases indicate that the rationality of the theoretical framework and the leak factor does not affect other terms in Eq. (6) on SNN robustness.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract effectively summarizes the key findings and insights presented in our paper, while the introduction further sets up the context and rationale for the study. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The "Limitation" section can be found in Section 6 of the main paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: The full proof of our Theorem 1 can be found in Appendix A.2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings can be found in Section 5.1 of the main paper and Appendix A.3 of the appendix. Our code is available in supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings can be found in Section 5.1 of the main paper and Appendix A.3 of the appendix. Our code is available in supplementary material.

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings can be found in Section 5.1 of the main paper and Appendix A.3 of the appendix. Our code is available in supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: A shared random seed is used for the reproducible purpose. Our code is available in supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The experimental settings can be found in Section 5.1 of the main paper and Appendix A.3 of the appendix. Our code is available in supplementary material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We make sure that the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The "Broader Impact" section can be found in Section 6 of the main paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We cited all the original paper that produced the code packages, models, and datasets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our code is available at an anonymized zip file in supplementary material. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
