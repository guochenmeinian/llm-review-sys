# Bridging or Breaking: Impact of Intergroup Interactions on Religious Polarization

Anonymous Author(s)

###### Abstract.

While exposure to diverse viewpoints may reduce polarization, it can also have a _backfire effect_ and exacerbate polarization when the discussion is adversarial. Here, we examine the question whether intergroup interactions around important events affect polarization between majority and minority groups in social networks. We compile data on the religious identity of nearly 700,000 Indian Twitter users engaging in COVID-19-related discourse during 2020. We introduce a new measure for an individual's group conformity based on contextualized embeddings of tweet text, which helps us assess polarization between religious groups. We then use a meta-learning framework to examine heterogeneous treatment effects of intergroup interactions on an individual's group conformity in the light of communal, political, and socio-economic events. We find that for political and social events, intergroup interactions reduce polarization. This decline is weaker for individuals at the extreme who already exhibit high conformity to their group. In contrast, during communal events, intergroup interactions can increase group conformity. Finally, we decompose the differential effects across religious groups in terms of emotions and topics of discussion. The results show that the dynamics of religious polarization are sensitive to the context and have important implications for understanding the role of intergroup interactions.

## 1. Introduction

Polarization between identity groups is an important driver of social unrest and may adversely affect a nation's economic growth and responses to crises (Gerner et al., 2012; Gersner et al., 2012). However, it is less clear how polarization evolves during crises. On the one hand, collective suffering may foster within-group solidarity (Gersner et al., 2012). On the other hand, it may lead to attribution of blame on the "outside" group or increase between-group competition for limited resources (Gerner et al., 2012). These behaviors might be accentuated among people who have a tendency to interact only within their groups, and hence might have a restricted information environment (Gerner et al., 2013). Polarization has also been widely studied in the social-media context. In particular, social media platforms such as Twitter have become more polarized over time (Gersner et al., 2013). Consistent with this, political polarization decreased for users who deactivated their Facebook accounts before the US elections (Bail et al., 2015). The depolarization however, depends on an individual's background and this pattern might reverse for individuals having homogeneous offline social networks (Bail et al., 2015). Interactions within social media platforms might have varying impacts on polarization. In an unfavourable environment, exposure to outgroup viewpoints may lead to stereotype formation and increase polarization. Bail et al. (Bail et al., 2015) conduct a field experiment and find that republicans (democrats) who were offered financial incentives to follow a liberal (conservative) twitter bot became more conservative (liberal).

In this paper, we examine the impact of intergroup interactions on polarization on Indian Twitter between religious majority and minority groups in the context of COVID-19 related events. We consider an individual to be engaging in intergroup interaction if they post a reply to an individual outside their own group. We introduce a new measure of an individual's conformity to their own group based on contextualized embeddings of tweet texts. We call this the **Group Conformity Score (GCS)** of a user which measures how similar a user's tweets are to their own group as opposed to the tweets by users of the other group. Polarization is the sum of GCS over all the users, weighted by the inverse of their group size. We then unveil the heterogeneous effects of intergroup interactions on a person's group conformity over different pandemic related events using a meta-learning framework. We examine the heterogeneities in the effect with respect to religion, topics, emotions, engagement, and ego-network features. Finally, we decompose the differences between the treatment effects for the two religious groups into the treatment effects on change in topics of discussion and on change in emotions.

Existing studies measure linguistic polarization between groups on social media based on certain dimensions of tweet text such as stance (Gerner et al., 2012) or contextualized embeddings of specific keywords (Gerner et al., 2012). Our approach is inspired by Gentzkow et al. (Gentzkow et al., 2013) who propose a bag-of-words (BOW)-based metric to measure partisanship in congressional speech using the entire content. This metric overcomes finite sample bias resulting from phrases that a group might simply mention by chance. This metric has further been used to examine polarization on twitter in the context of mass shooting incidents in the US (Gerner et al., 2012). One limitation to the bag-of-words representation is that it does not take the context or the synonymy in two phrases into account. Our new contextualized- embeddings-based measure (GCS) can address this by capturing different dimensions of linguistic polarization more meaningfully.

Our work is motivated by the contact hypothesis which states that intergroup contact can reduce prejudice towards the outgroup when groups engage in equal status contact in the pursuit of common goals and in the presence of intergroup cooperation under a favorable institutional environment (Bail et al., 2015). Thus, intergroup interaction can lead to a better understanding of outgroup perspectives and lead to cross-group friendships (Gerner et al., 2012; Gersner et al., 2012). At a broader level, this may facilitate national integration but may have the opposite effect in polarized settings (Bail et al., 2015). In the political arena, Levendusky and Stecula (Levendusky and Stecula, 2013) experimentally demonstrate that cross-party discussions decrease affective polarization (or dislike of outgroup individuals)between Republicans and Democrats in the US. This decrease is conditional on conversation topics not involving disagreements (Sutton et al., 2017). The effects of intergroup contact might vary for majority and minority groups with possibly weaker effects for minorities (Sutton et al., 2018). Interestingly, intergroup contact focusing on commonalities between majority and minority groups can lead the minority to perceive the majority group as fairer than they are (Sutton et al., 2019). In the Indian context, Lowe (Lou et al., 2017) randomly assign individuals from different caste groups to the same (collaborative contact) or opposing (adversarial contact) cricket teams. They find that collaborative contact increases cross-caste friendships while adversarial contact has the opposite effect--thus highlighting the importance of the setting. In the online context, intergroup conversations between Hindus and Muslims on Whatsapp are found to decrease prejudice against Muslims (Lou et al., 2017). We add to this evidence by going beyond prejudice and focus on group conformity in tweet text for both majority and minority groups, and examine the heterogeneous effects of intergroup contact.

In line with the above discussion, we hypothesize that in general intergroup interaction should decrease Group Conformity Score (GCS), and thus polarization. However, such interaction should be less likely to decrease GCS for individuals with already entrenched positions and who might be less receptive to outgroup perspectives. Further, when individuals in the minority group are disproportionately affected by an event, we expect intergroup interaction to amplify GCS for them. We expect the opposite effect for the unaffected majority group who might become sympathetic to minority issues due to interaction. Finally, for politically salient events, intergroup interaction should increase polarization for individuals having a high predisposition towards political discussions and who might have conflicting ideologies.

## 2. Data

### COVID-19 Tweets India

We use the "Global Reactions to COVID-19 on Twitter" data collected by Gupta et al. (2017). The core data comprise over 132 million english language tweets from more than 20 million unique users using 4 keywords--"corona", "wuhan", "nCov", and "COVID". The tweets were posted during January 28, 2020-January 1, 2021.1 We use the India sample of the data, i.e. tweets pertaining to or originating from India.2 Hydrodynamic application is used to obtain complete information on tweets from their IDs (collected on May 4, 2021). Out of a total of 6,166,152 tweet IDs, full data for 5,459,402 tweets could be collected representing an attrition rate of 11.46%. This is due to deletion of some of the tweets and accounts by the collection date. The tweets in the data are posted by 871,203 unique users. The tweets are cleaned by removing mentions, hyperlinks and extra whitespaces. The data contains information on user name, their account creation date, number of friends and followers, whether a tweet is a retweet or a reply. It also contains information on five psycho-linguistic attributes for each tweet indicating the intensity of valence, anger, fear, sadness, and joy extracted using CrystalFeel--a collection of machine learning-based emotion analysis algorithms for analyzing the emotional-level content from natural language.3

Footnote 1: The dataset of tweet IDs is publicly available at [https://doi.org/10.3886/E120321V6](https://doi.org/10.3886/E120321V6).

Footnote 2: This restriction is imposed by mapping the user location attribute on twitter to country using GeoSamesâ€™ citesites15000 geographic database available at [http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cites15000.zip](http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/cites15000.zip). The place field and the user location field are mapped to the India by matching them with a dictionary of cities and states in India. For places that could not be mapped to India using the previous step we use Nominatim-a search engine used for OpenStreetMap (OSM). This gives complete address of a place and allows us to remove tweets posted from outside India.

### Events

To select events for subsequent analysis, we scan the news reports for the important events that took place in 2020. We check which events became a topic of discussion within COVID-related discourse by scanning for event-related key-phrases in the tweets in our dataset. We present the details in Appendix A Table 3. We find that among all news headlines, the subsample in Table 1 were among the most popular COVID-related subjects on Twitter. And we focus our attention on these events in the rest of the paper.

## 3. Methodology

To study the treatment effect of Intergroup Interactions on the Group Conformity of an individual, we first augment our dataset to include all the variables of interest. We describe these in Sections 3.1-3.3 and then describe the steps for treatment effect estimation in Section 3.4.

### Inferring Religion

Since the data on religious identity is not available on Twitter, we use usernames as a proxy of their religious identities. In India, names are highly correlated to the group identities and we leverage character sequence-based machine learning models from Chaturvedi and Chaturvedi (2017) to obtain religion estimates.4 The religion of each user is classified as Muslim (also referred to as minority as Muslims are the largest minority group in India comprising 14% of total population of India according to Census 2011) or non-Muslim (alternatively referred to as Hindus or majority group comprising 80% of total population).

Footnote 4: We use the Single Name SVM model to obtain the multi-score as recommended.

Footnote 5: Available at [https://github.com/bindinfo:Info:Info:Class](https://github.com/bindinfo:Info:Info:Class).

Footnote 6: To check for the possibility that our results might be influenced by bots, we use the recent lists Twin-20 (Lou et al., 2017) and Twin20-2 (Lou et al., 2017). We find that less than 0.5% of users in our data are listed as bots and contribute to a 65% of the tweets.

We transitifect the names from indic languages Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, Malayalam, Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Marathi, Assamese, Konkani, Bodo, Nepali, and Urdu to English using Indic-trans tool (Beng et al., 2017).5 We drop verified users from this data to remove influential individuals/organizations from the data set. To further distinguish individuals from organizations and to weed out fake names, we construct a name part dictionary by using person names from a 3% random sample of eligible voters from Indian electoral rolls and Rural Economic & Demographic Survey (REDS) data collected by the National Council of Applied Economic Research. For every twitter user, only name parts that occur in the constructed name part dictionary are retained. We further manually scan the user names that either have more than 20,000 followers or those who tweeted more than 60 times or user names that contain any of the organization-related keywords provided in Appendix B Table 4 and drop the tweeters having non-personal names from this list.6The model from (Gentzkow et al., 2017) is trained on names obtained from official records, while the twitter names sometimes also include additional characters to reflect other personality attributes of the user. The name classification exercise also depends on the distribution of names in the specific domain the algorithm was trained on. Therefore, we expect a domain shift while applying the model on our data. To address the noisy classification issue, We experiment with two alternative decision boundary thresholds of the muslim-score returned by SVM model.7 In the first case, a threshold of zero is used. This means that all users with muslim-score above 0 are classified as muslims and non-muslim otherwise. In the second, we split all the names into equal-width bins after sorting them on the basis of the muslim-score. We used 20 bins of width 0.1 each (The first bin encapsulates names with score below -0.9, and the last with 0.9 and above. We then randomly sample 50 names from each bin and manually annotate them. Thereafter, we plot roc-auc curves and analyze the gmean and Youden statistics to choose a threshold of 0.3 as the decision boundary. That is, if the muslim-score is greater than 0.3, we classify a name as muslim, and non-muslim otherwise.8 We also find a very common non-muslim name Abhishek as being classified Muslim, we manually classify this as non-muslim.

Footnote 7: Both the thresholds lead to qualitatively similar end results.

Footnote 8: See Appendix C, Figure 5.

### Measuring Polarization

Using the estimates of religious identities of tweeters, we next measure the polarization in terms of conformity of each user to their religious group.

#### Polarization via Bag-of-Words

We first consider the leave-out estimator of phrase partisanship proposed by Gentzkow et al. (2017).9 We compute daily user-level polarization (13) or the bag-of-words-based Group Conformity Score (\(GCS_{i,d}^{BOW}\)) as follows:

Footnote 9: Before applying this estimate, we lower-case the tweets, remove stopwords (see Appendix D for the stopwords list) and punctuations, and often words using the IN-TKS Snowball Stemme. Removing stopwords leads to dropping 1,007 user-day observations comprised entirely of stopwords and punctuations.

\[GCS_{i,d}^{BOW}=\hat{q}_{i,d}\cdot\hat{\rho}_{-i,d}\]

Where \(\hat{q}_{i,d}\) is the vector of token (unigram and bigram) frequencies normalized by the sum of all token counts for user \(i\) on day \(d\) and \(\hat{\rho}_{-i,d}\) is the vector denoting the sum of normalized token frequencies across all users in \(i\)'s group \(g_{i}\in\{\mathit{Mushlim}(M),non-\mathit{Mushlim}(M)\}\) while leaving \(i\) out, relative to users in the other group \(\hat{g}_{i}\). For token \(t,\hat{\rho}_{-i,d}^{i}=\sum_{j\in g_{i}-(i)}\hat{q}_{j}^{t}/(\sum_{g_{i}-(i)} \hat{q}_{j}^{t}+\sum_{g_{i}}\hat{q}_{j}^{t})\).10 Intuitively, this captures similarity in phrase usage for user \(i\) with their group members relative to the similarity with the other group. The daily polarization is then estimated as the following average:

Footnote 10: We only consider tokens \(t\) which are used by at least two users.

\[\hat{\pi}_{d}^{LO,BOW}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{g\in\{M,\mathit{NM}\}}\frac{1}{|g|}\sum _{i\in g}GCS_{i,d}^{BOW}\]

#### Polarization via Contextualized Embeddings

The bag-of-words-based polarization estimator ignores the larger context of a tweet and can have several limitations. Firstly, distinct words (for example, greetings such as _salaam_ vs. _namste_) used by two groups conveying the same underlying message will contribute positively towards the polarization estimate. Secondly, if two users have different stance on a given issue while having broadly similar phrase usage (for example, _Coronil cures Covid vs. Coronil does not cure Covid_), the BOW estimator will consider them to be similar.

We address these by computing the contextualized-GCS score or simply \(GCS_{i,d}\) for user \(i\) on day \(d\). For this, we first map all

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|l} \hline
**Event** & **Date** & **Description** \\ \hline Janata Curfew & Mar 22 & A day long curfew announced by the government, for all citizens barring essential services to curb the pandemic (and possibly to prepare for future lockdown). \\ \hline Tablighi & Mar 31 & Tablighi Jamat is a congregation of Muslims where attendees share food, sit close together, and preach religious textching. Despite an ongoing ban on public gatherings, this assembly took place in Delhi and became a COVID-19 super-spreader event. Media reports about several participants (who were being quarantined post-gathering) spitting on attending doctors and healthcare personnel fueled Islamophobic sentiments across social media along with a viral hashtag \#Corona Jihad. Much later, the Supreme Court slammed media outlets for communizing the incident. \\ \hline Migrant Deaths & May 8 & An estimated 10 million workers were forced to undertake long advances hours back home on foot after losing jobs due to abrupt pandemic-related lockdown and suspension of train services. 16 them were killed by an empty goods train while they were sleeping on the tracks on this day. \\ Coronil Launch & Jun 22 & Indian multinational condemnate Patapali spearheaded by popular Indian yoga guru Ramdev launched an ayurvedeely claiming that it cures the COVID-19. This claim was not backed by any clinical data, yet the remedy was approved by Ministry of Ayush (for traditional medicine). The release received massive praise from some and harsh criticism from others on social media. Amidst controversy, the ministry ordered halt on the sale and advertising but later allowed it to be marketed as an immunity booster. However, it was completely banned by several state governments who considered it a fake medicine. \\ \hline Exam Satyagraha & Aug 23 & All India Studentsâ€™ Association called for one-day hunger strike and satyagraha against the governmentâ€™s decision to conduct national-level examinations in-person. The reasons to oppose were personal health risks owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and logistics related challenges faced by students owing to the lockdowns and suspension of public transportation. More than 4000 students participated and multitudes showed support via social media. \\ GDP Contraction & Aug 31 & Indian government announced the biggest economic slump in GDP that India had seen in 24 years. \\ BJP Bhar Manifesto & Oct 22 & The ruling political party (BJP) promised free vaccines for everyone in Bilhar in its Assembly election manifesto. People from both the religious groups over social media condemned this, reacting with the hashtag \#VaccineForVotes. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1. Description of COVID-Related Events Highly Discussed in COVID Tweets India subset in year 2020the tweets to a 768-dimensional vector space using a sentence-transformer--specifically, the pretrained _all-mpnet-base_-v2 model (Shi et al., 2017). This model is fine-tuned on over a billion sentence pairs from diverse domains and has shown state-of-the-art results on semantic search and sentence embedding tasks.11 We then average these embeddings at the user-day level \(u_{i,d}\). Next, we compute daily centroids for both the groups by taking the mean of \(u_{i,d}\) across all users in a group. Analogous to the leave-out estimator, we first adjust the group centroid by subtracting \(u_{i,d}\) from the group centroid before computing \(GCS_{i,d}\). Thereafter, we compute the distances between \(u_{i,d}\) and both the centroids. Finally, \(GCS_{i,d}\) is computed as the Euclidean distance from the other group's centroid relative to their own adjusted centroid. We use the following formula:

Footnote 11: For more information, see [https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2).

\[GCS_{i,d}=\frac{\|u_{i,d}-\frac{1}{\|g\|}\sum_{j\in g_{i}}u_{j,d}\|}{\|u_{i,d}- \frac{1}{|g_{i}-\{i\}|}\sum_{j\in g_{i}-\{i\}}u_{j,d}\|+\|u_{i,d}-\frac{1}{|g_{ i}|}\sum_{j\in g_{i}}u_{j,d}\|}\]

Higher values of \(GCS_{i,d}\) correspond to greater conformity of a user to their own group. The daily polarization \(\pi_{d}^{LQ}\) is computed by aggregating this measure across users in the two groups as before:

\[\bar{\pi}_{d}^{LQ}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{g\in\{M,NM\}}\frac{1}{|g|}\sum_{t\in g}GCS _{i,d}\]

### Discussion Topics During COVID-19

To gain a deeper understanding of major topics discussed around Covid-19 events and to include them as covariates for examining the effect of intergroup interaction on change in group conformity, we perform topic modeling over the tweets. We use the subset of tweets considered for treatment effect estimation across all the events. We leverage contextualized embeddings for this task as well. We first drop the duplicated tweets so that retweeting does not affect topic assignment. We then cluster the tweets' contextual embeddings obtained using sentence transformer model _all-mpnet-base-v2_ using the k-means clustering algorithm (Vaswani et al., 2017; Vaswani et al., 2017).12 For inferring representative topic labels, we preprocess the tweets by first lower-casing them. Since the entire dataset comprises COVID-specific tweets, we remove COVID and its synonyms for a more meaningful inference of topic labels. We also replace different vaccine names with the word vaccine, remove mentions, urls, numbers, special html entities such as &amp and &quot, punctuation, and extra spaces. We then transform each tweet by joining together commonly occurring multi-word phrases in that tweet using the Genish phrase model (Vaswani et al., 2017). We then concatenate all the tweets within a topic as a single document. Finally, we compute class-based TF-IDF defined as:

Footnote 12: We choose 7 as the optimal number of clusters based on manual scanning and the elbow method heuristic by plotting inertia against the number of topics over 3 to 10 topic clusters.

\[cTF\text{-}IDF_{i}=\frac{t_{i}}{w_{i}}\cdot log\frac{m}{\sum_{j=1}^{n}t_{j}}\]

Where, \(t_{i}\) is frequency of a word/phrase within the \(i^{th}\) topic and \(w_{i}\) the total number of phrases in the topic. The total number of tweets (or unjoined documents) is \(m\), and is normalized by the number of occurrences of the word/phrase across all \(n\) topic clusters.

We identify the following topics: General COVID response, COVID prevention, COVID News/statistics (general), COVID news/statistics (state-specific), Socio-Economic, Political-Religious, and China & Global. We do a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the topic clusters and find that the COVID-specific topics are very similar and merge them into a single topic COVID Response to get final four topics.13 We provide 50 most representative phrases associated with each of these topics and and a sample of tweets associated with each topic in Appendix F Tables 5 and 6 respectively.

Footnote 13: The qualitative analysis is based on most frequent words associated with each topic while quantitative analysis is based on cluster mean and mean of pairwise cosine distances across clusters. Our results for metelearners in Section 4.2 remain the same with and without merging topic clusters.

### Conditional Average Treatment Effect

In this section we describe our methodology to answer the question _do intergroup interactions change a user's conformity to their group?_. We first describe the treatment and outcome variables:

#### 3.4.1. Treatment: Intergroup Interaction

For each event, we look at all tweets before the event. We consider tweets that are replies, and check the religion of the user posting the reply and that of the user being replied to. Our treatment variable _interact_ is a binary indicator that equals 1 if a user replies to someone outside their group at least once, and 0 otherwise.14

Footnote 14: The users who never reply to anyone are dropped from further analysis

#### 3.4.2. Outcome

_Change in GCS._ For each event, we define an event window of n days before and after it. We compute the n-day mean of \(GCS_{i}\) for each user \(i\) over the pre-event and post-event windows.15 Finally, we take \(\Delta GCS_{i}=\overline{GCS}_{i,post}-\overline{GCS}_{i,pre}\) as the difference in the averages post and pre-event. We choose the window size to be large enough to balance the daily fluctuations and small enough to rule out other events influencing the outcome.

Footnote 15: Users who do not tweet during any window are dropped.

_Change in Topics and Emotions._ We also estimate the treatment effect of intergroup interaction on change in topics and emotions after each event. This helps in decomposing the differential effects of intergroup interaction on \(\Delta GCS_{i}\) in terms of differential effects on changes in topics and emotions across religions. We again take the mean difference in these variable during post and pre-event windows for each user.

#### 3.4.3. **Pre-treatment Covariates.**

We consider 30 days pre-event window and compute the following covariates for adjustment: 30-day averages of _GCS_, emotion intensities for valence, anger, fear, sadness, and joy; ego-network features such as friends and followers counts; engagement features such as tweet frequency, average number of times a user's tweets were retweeted and the fraction of replies among tweets; the number of days lapsed since account creation to event date; muslim-score as given by the religion classifier; and lastly the fraction of user tweets in the pre-treatment period assigned to each topic. We use inverse hyperbolic sine transformation (arcsinh) for friends and followers-counts, tweet frequency and average retweets, as these are right skewed. Arcsinh approximates logarithmic transformation while allowing us to retain zero-values. In We then normalize all the covariates and the outcome variable.

The descriptive statistics for the final event-level dataset are provided in Appendix H Table 9.

#### 3.4.4. **T-Learner**

Given the outcome \(Y\) (\(\Delta GCS\)) and specific values of pre-treatment covariates \(X=x\), Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE) is defined as:

\[\tau(x)=\mathbb{E}[Y(1)-Y(0)\mid X=x]=M_{1}(X)-M_{0}(X)\]

Where, \(Y(1)\) is the \(\Delta GCS\) observed for an individual in the Treatment group (\(T=1\)), i.e. if they interact outside their group and \(Y(0)\) is \(\Delta GCS\) for the same individual considering they belong to the control group (\(T=0\)). Here, we can only observe either \(Y(1)\) or \(Y(0)\) for any given individual. Since our treatment variable is discrete, we can leverage meta-learning algorithms--which help us estimate the response functions \(M_{1}(X)\) and \(M_{0}(X)\), and thus CATE. In particular, we use T-Learner (Lewis et al., 2017) which consists of the following two stages as depicted in Figure 1:

1. **Training Stage**: In the first stage, we learn approximations of response functions \(\hat{M}_{1}\) and \(\hat{M}_{0}\) using observations from the treatment and control groups respectively.
2. **Prediction Stage**: In the second stage, we estimate Individual Treatment Effect TE for \(i^{th}\) user using predictions from \(\hat{M}_{1}\) and \(\hat{M}_{0}\) over the complete set of observations in the test set as: \[\hat{\tau}(x_{i})=\hat{M}_{1}(x_{i})-\hat{M}_{0}(x_{i})\]

_Implementation Details._ For measuring the outcome, we use a window size of 7 days post and pre-event. We use nested Lasso regression with 10-fold cross validation (CV). We first split the event-specific subsets for each treatment group into 10 folds. For each iteration, we further split the training fold and run Lasso with L2 regularization, using 10-fold CV. We report the average MSE and R-squared along with the average treatment effect.16

Footnote 16: Base learners such as support vector regression (SVR), random forest, Ridge, or RANSAC regression with grid-search for hyperparameter tuning lead to lower performance metrics. We also experiment with window sizes of 5 or 10 days and find broadly similar trends. We get qualitatively similar results using \(X\)-learner (Lewis et al., 2017).

## 4. Results

Here, we first discuss a qualitative analysis based on our proposed metric \(GCS\) in Section 4.1 and then the results from treatment effect estimation in Section 4.2. Finally, we explain the differences in the treatment effect across the two religious groups in terms of the effect on changes in topics and emotions using a decomposition approach in Section 4.3.

### Qualitative Content Analysis based on GCS

To compare the BOW and contextualized-embeddings-based estimator, Figure 2 plots the seven-day exponential moving average of polarization trends using \(\hat{\mu}^{LO,BOW}\) and \(\hat{\mu}^{LO}\). We find similar trends using both the measures with the Pearson's correlation of 66.87%. However, the fluctuations in BOW polarization are more pronounced. The polarization increases during the Tabligh incidence on March 31, 2020, which was marked by increased lslam-phobic selimments. The highest peaks are during the Muslim festivals--the beginning of baby month of Ramadan and its culmination in Eid-ul-fit. There are also smaller peaks during the Muslim festivals of Eid-ul-zuha and Eid-e-Milad. We find that the Muslim tweets during these festivals are mostly greetings and well wishes while non-Muslim tweets discuss a variety of subjects. We do not find any peaks around non-Muslim festivals.

To understand whether GCS provides a more meaningful measure compared to \(GCS^{BOW}\) we examine tweets from users in both religious groups having high and low values of these measures up to seven days post each event.17 As expected, the tweets from users in one group having high group conformity are similar to tweets by users in the other group having low group conformity. This holds even without exactly matching but semantically similar tweets in case of _GCS_. The highest \(GCS^{BOW}\) tweets for the majority group often comprise a few common words. This is consistent with the results in Appendix E, Figure 6 in which we examine the relation of tweet length with \(GCS^{BOW}\) and \(GCS\). We find that the average tweet length is low at extreme values of \(GCS^{BOW}\) while this relation is weak in case of _GCS_.

Footnote 17: Appendix G, Tables 7 and 8 report samples of 5 tweets from high GCS and GCS\({}^{BOW}\) users in each group.

To qualitatively examine each group's tweeting patterns during each event, we focus on high \(GCS\) user tweets. Starting with the pre-lockdown **Janata Curfew**, we notice hostile attitudes against China and appreciation for frontline workers among non-Muslims, while Muslims predominantly share news related to Kashmir (a Muslim-majority state) and Muslim-majority countries. In context of the **Tabligh** incidence, non-Muslims promoted the Indian prime minister's plea to light candles in a show of unity in fight against COVID-19 at 9 p.m. for 9 minutes, whereas Muslim tweets express anger over Islamophobia spread by Indian media in the context of this event. A noteworthy example, in the aftermath of the Tabligh incident, is of a non-Muslim user supporting Muslims: _'The manner in which media showed propaganda against tabliqi jamat & corona jihad etc but didn't shown Bombay HC judgements which said tabligth's were made scapegoats, same way they will show propaganda against @Tweet2Rhe & @deepikapadukone but will not show u the judgments later'. GCS (0.497 or 9'th percentile) correctly identifies

Figure 1. T-Learner Framework. Source-Alves (Alves, 2018)

low group conformity for this user while \(GCS^{BOW}\) (0.84 or 99\({}^{th}\) percentile) fails to do so.

After **Migrant Deaths** there's little discussion on the plight of migrants among high \(GCS\) non-Muslims. When a discussion occurs, it captures two viewpoints--one is the suffering of migrants and the second is the increasing risk of COVID spread and economic issues resulting from migration. On the other hand, high \(GCS\) Muslims express anger against the government and media for not covering the issue. After **Coronil Launch**, non-Muslims express relief against COVID and pride in the Indian Ayurvedic medicine, though a few express skepticism as well. On the other hand, several high \(GCS\) Muslims label it a fake drug. In addition, Muslim discourse remains centered around Islamophohia and the bigotry of news media in coverage of Tablighi vs. government approval of Rath Yatra--a Hindu religious congestion.

Post the call for **Exam Satyagraha**, high \(GCS\) non-Muslim discourse is more varied with some concerns regarding increased COVID risk due to in-person examination while high \(GCS\) Muslims harshly criticize the decision of in-person exams. This is perhaps due to Muslims being the poorest religious group in India and might find it logistically harder to attend in-person exams. Similarly, during **GDP Contraction** high \(GCS\) non-Muslim discourse remained more varied while Muslim tweets express criticism towards the government over GDP decline. Finally, after the release of **Bihar Manifestob** by the ruling party BJP, high \(GCS\) non-Muslim discourse focuses on general COVID-related news with some criticizing the _vaccine for vote_ clause in the manifesto. This criticism appears to be unanimous among the high \(GCS\) Muslim tweeters.

### Effect of Interaction on Change in GCS

In this section, we examine the results from T-learner. Table 2 shows the average effect \(\hat{\tau}_{All}\) of intergroup interaction on change in overall \(GCS\) and also separately for Muslims \(\hat{\tau}_{Muslim}\) and non-Muslims \(\hat{\tau}_{non-Muslim}\) across all the events. Appendix I, Figure 7 shows corresponding distributions of individual treatment effects for Muslims and non-Muslims. We find that intergroup interaction decreases overall \(GCS\) (or \(\hat{\tau}_{All}<0\)) for all events except GDP Contraction for which there is an increase in \(GCS\) (\(\hat{\tau}_{All}=0.05\) standard deviations or s.d.). In other words, talking to people from the other group generally contributes to a decrease in polarization. The strongest negative effect among these is for the Tablighi incident (-0.16 s.d.). In contrast, while intergroup interaction decreases average \(GCS\) for Muslims after all the other events, the effect is positive for the Tablighi event (0.04 s.d.) which was a highly communal event followed by increasing islamophobia in India. This suggests that intergroup interaction amplifies the polarizing effect of such events for the affected minorities. Notably, the negative effect for Muslims after GDP Contraction is not statistically significant while all the other coefficients we discuss are statistically significant at the 1% level of significance. The strongest negative effect of intergroup interaction on \(GCS\) for Muslims is in case of Janata Curfew (-0.24 s.d.) and after the release of Bihar Manifesto (-0.18 s.d.).

We examine the heterogeneity in the treatment effect (TE) by regressing the treatment effect \(\hat{\tau}\) on standardized pre-treatment covariates for each event. The complete results are reported in Appendix I, Figure 8 but we highlight the most important findings here. We find a high positive correlation between pre-treatment \(GCS\) and \(\hat{\tau}\). In other words, the decline in \(GCS\) due to intergroup interaction is stronger for people with an already low \(GCS\). This is especially true in case of Bihar Manifesto which is a highly political event, and on which Hindus and Muslims might have divergent perspectives. However, this positive correlation breaks down in case of the Tablighi event. Among the topics, \(\hat{\tau}\) is more negative after launch of Coronil remedy for people who were initially more engaged in _COVID response_ discussion, and hence, might have shared concerns related to this. The other notable topic is Politics-Religion with which \(\hat{\tau}\) has a highly positive correlation in case of Exam Satyagraha and Bihar Manifesto both of which are political events. Specifically, Exam Satyagraha was called for by the left wing student organization AISA when the right wing ruling government

announced the decision to conduct exams. Among the emotions, we find a high positive correlation of \(t\) with Anger in case of the commonly charged Tablighi event indicating that the intergroup interaction increased _GCS_ for people who expressed more anger earlier.

### Decomposition Analysis

Given that the effects of interaction on change in _GCS_ exhibit substantial heterogeneity across the two religious groups, a natural question is--_what is the contribution of topics and emotions towards explaining these differences?_ Importantly, emotions and topics are also computed as properties of the tweet text, and changes in _GCS_ partially embody changes in these attributes.18 Therefore, we decompose the mean of \(\Delta\hat{\tau}=\hat{\tau}_{Mullin}-\hat{\tau}_{non-Mullin}\) into the effect on each topic and emotion. We use the Oaxaca-Blinder method (Oaxaca and Blinder, 1999; Oaxaca and Blinder, 1999) to decompose the differences at the _mean_ into _explained_ and _unexplained_ components and further into contributions of individual covariates to explained differences.

Footnote 18: Appendix Figures 9â€“17 show the distribution of treatment effects on these explanatory variables across Muslims and non-Muslims for each event.

Given \(\hat{\tau}_{g}=\sum_{X}\beta_{g}^{x}\hat{\tau}_{g}^{x},g\in(Muslim(M),non-Muslim(NM))\), where \(\beta_{g}^{x}\) are the regression coefficients and \(\hat{\tau}_{g}^{x}\) are mean values of covariates (the average treatment effects on \(x\in topics\lor emotions\)):

\[\Delta\hat{\tau} =\hat{\tau}_{M}-\hat{\tau}_{NM}\] \[=\sum_{x\in topics\lor emotions}\beta_{M}^{x}\hat{\tau}_{M}^{x}- \beta_{NM}^{x}\hat{\tau}_{NM}\] \[=\sum_{x\in topics\lor emotions}\beta_{NM}^{x}(\hat{\tau}_{M}^{x}- \hat{\tau}_{NM}^{x})\]

The explained component captures what part of the mean difference in treatment effect across Muslims and non-Muslims is due to a differential shift in topics and emotions due to intergroup interaction. The residual or unexplained component captures to what extent the marginal effect of each covariate on the outcome is different across the two groups, given that they have the same explanatory attributes.

Figure 3 shows the aggregate decomposition into the explained and unexplained components. We observe the largest negative \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) in case of Jantaia Curfew (-0.2 s.d), and Bihar Manifesto (-0.1 s.d). The explained component of these differences are estimated at 46.5% and 64.6% respectively. We also find a highly positive difference (0.2 s.d) in case of Tablighi incident and the explained component of this difference is 7.8%. The difference in case of GDP Contraction (778) is (-0.07 s.d.). However, the explained component of this difference is not significantly different from 0. We also observe small negative \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) for Coronil Launch (-0.04 s.d) and Exam Satyagraha (-0.03 s.d). For Coronil Launch, the covariates overexplain the difference with the explained component at 144%, while for Exam Satyagraha the explained difference is 94.9%.

Figure 4 further decomposes the explained component into the contributions of emotions and topics. We find that, for Jantaia Curfew, 81% of \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) is explained by valence. This is because, for this event, \(\beta_{NM}^{\mathit{endence}}\) is negative-i.e. an increase in valence due to intergroup interaction is associated with a decrease in _GCS_--and the difference \(\hat{\tau}_{M}^{\mathit{balance}}-\hat{\tau}_{NM}^{\mathit{balance}}\) is positive. Additionally, 30% of \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) is explained by the topic China & Global for this event. In contrast joy, sadness, and Politics-Religion topic have countervailing effects, i.e. they pull \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) towards zero. In case of Tablighi incident, valence (9%) and joy (14%) explain an important share of \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\) while anger has a countervailing contribution (-11%). For both the politically salient events--Exam Satyagraha and Bihar Manifesto--the differential effect of intergroup interaction on Politics-Religion and Socio-Economic topics explain \(\Delta\hat{\tau}\).

## 5. Conclusion

Our study explores the complex relationship between intergroup interactions and polarization between religious groups on social media in light of events during the COVID-19 pandemic in India. We investigate whether these interactions serve as bridges that mitigate polarization or barriers that exacerbate it. We use a novel measure of group conformity based on contextualized embeddings to uncover a compelling narrative. Consistent with our hypotheses, intergroup interactions reduce polarization in general though this effect is less pronounced for individuals with strong group conformity (high GCS). Further, intergroup interactions increase the group conformity for the minority Muslim group individuals during the communal Tablighi event. Finally, in the context of political events such as Exam Satyagraha and Bihar Manifesto, intergroup

Additionally, we leverage a well-known decomposition method to explain the differences in average treatment effects of interaction on group conformity across the two religious groups in terms of effects on emotions and topics of discussion.

Our work highlights the importance of context-aware metrics and nuanced approaches in studying polarization dynamics. In line with previous works that utilize tweet content for predicting group identity (Song et al., 2018), GCS score can also help improve existing name classification algorithms. Future studies could explore interventions and strategies to foster constructive intergroup interactions to encourage cross-group tolerance and peaceful coexistence in the face of societal challenges.
