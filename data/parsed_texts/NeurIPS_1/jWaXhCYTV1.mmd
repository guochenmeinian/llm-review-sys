###### Abstract

We consider the linear causal representation learning setting where we observe a linear mixing of \(d\) unknown latent factors, which follow a linear structural causal model. Recent work has shown that it is possible to recover the latent factors as well as the underlying structural causal model over them, up to permutation and scaling, provided that we have at least \(d\) environments, each of which corresponds to perfect interventions on a single latent node (factor). After this powerful result, a key open problem faced by the community has been to relax these conditions: allow for coarser than perfect single-node interventions, and allow for fewer than \(d\) of them, since the number of latent factors \(d\) could be very large. In this work, we consider precisely such a setting, where we allow a smaller than \(d\) number of environments, and also allow for very coarse interventions that can very coarsely _change the entire causal graph over the latent factors_. On the flip side, we relax what we wish to extract to simply the _list of nodes that have shifted between one or more environments_. We provide a surprising identifiability result that it is indeed possible, under some very mild standard assumptions, to identify the set of shifted nodes. Our identifiability proof moreover is a constructive one: we explicitly provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a node to be a shifted node, and show that we can check these conditions given observed data. Our algorithm lends itself very naturally to the sample setting where instead of just interventional distributions, we are provided datasets of samples from each of these distributions. We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments as well as an interesting psychometric dataset.

## 1 Introduction

The objective of learning disentangled representations is to separate the different factors that contribute to the variation in the observed data, resulting in a representation that is easier to understand and manipulate [3]. Traditional methods for disentanglement [e.g., 19, 20, 7, 9, 26] aim to make the latent variables independent of each other.

Consider the setting of linear independent component analysis (ICA) [19], that is, the observed variables \(X\in\mathbb{R}^{p}\) are generated through the process \(X=GZ\), where \(Z\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) are _latent_ factors, and \(G\in\mathbb{R}^{p\times d}\) is an _unknown_ "mixing" matrix. Under the key assumption that \(Z\) has statistically independent components, and under some additional mild assumptions, landmark results in linear ICA show that it is possible to recover the latent variables \(Z\) up to permutation and scaling [13, 19].

However, what if instead of independent sources \(Z\) we have a _structural causal model_ (SCM, [37; 38]) over them? For instance, if the latent factors correspond to biomarkers in a biology context, or root causes in a root cause analysis context, then we expect there to be rich associations between them. Indeed, this question is central in the burgeoning field of causal representation learning (CRL) [39; 51], where we are interested in extracting the latent factors and causal associations between them given raw data.

Let us look at the simplest CRL setting where the latent variables \(Z\) follow a _linear_ SCM, that is, \(Z=AZ+\Omega^{\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\epsilon\), where \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) encodes a directed acyclic graph (DAG), \(\Omega\) is a diagonal matrix that controls the scale of noise variances, and \(\epsilon\) is some noise vector with zero-mean and unit-variance independent components. In such a case, \(Z\) is a linear mixing of independent components \(\epsilon\), that is, \(Z=B^{-1}\epsilon\), where \(B=\Omega^{-\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}(I_{d}-A)\) succinctly encodes the SCM and \(I_{d}\) is the identity matrix of dimension \(\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\). We then have \(X=GB^{-1}\epsilon\) so that ICA can only recover \(BG^{\dagger}\) up to permutation and scaling, which does not suffice to recover the SCM \(B\) since the mixing function \(G\) is unknown.

Recently, Seigal et al. [40] showed that given the interventional distributions arising from _perfect interventions_ on _each_ latent variable in \(Z\), we can recover the SCM over \(Z\) up to permutation. But there are two caveats to this: (a) it is difficult to obtain perfect single-node interventions that only intervene on a single factor in \(Z\); and (b) it is difficult to obtain \(d\) number of such perfect interventional distributions or environments.

We are interested in the setting where we do not have perfect interventions: we allow for far more general interventions that can quite coarsely change the SCM, namely, _soft_ and _hard_ interventions, interventions targeting _single_ or _multiple_ nodes, as well as interventions capable of _adding_ or _removing_ parent nodes and _reversing_ edges. Moreover, we do not need as many as \(d\) of these.

Our goal, however, is not to recover the entire SCM over \(Z\) but simply to recover those nodes \(Z\) that have incurred shifts or changes between the different interventional distributions. This is closely related to root cause analysis [5; 6; 21; 33], which aims to identify the origins of the observed changes in a joint distribution. In addition, understanding the sources of distribution shifts--that is, localizing invariant/shifted conditional distributions--can benefit downstream tasks such as domain adaptation [30], and domain generalization [36; 55].

Contributions.Our work sits at the intersection of linear CRL [40; 23] and _direct estimation_ of causal mechanism shifts [52; 14]. The key contribution of this work is to show that it is possible to identify the _latent_ sources of distribution shifts in multiple datasets while _bypassing_ the estimation of the mixing function \(G\) and the SCM \(B\) over the latent variables, under very general types of interventions. More concretely, we make the following set of contributions:

1. **Identifiability:** We show that we can identify the shifted latent factors even under more general types of interventions. (Section 4.1).
2. **Algorithm:** We also provide an scalable algorithm that implements our identifiability result to infer such shifted latent factors even in the practical scenarios where we are not given the entire coarse interventional distributions but merely finite samples from each (Section 4.2).
3. **Experiments:** We corroborate our results on both synthetic experiments (Section 5.1) as well as an interesting psychometric dataset (Section 5.2).

## 2 Related Work

Causal representation learning.In contrast to our setting, which focuses on identifying shifted nodes in the latent representation, existing methods in CRL aim to recover _both_ the latent causal graph and the mixing function. Previous works have studied identifiability in various settings, such as latent linear SEMs with linear mixing [40], and with nonlinear mixing [4]; latent nonlinear SEMs with finite degree polynomial mixing [1], and with linear mixing [48]; and nonlinear SEMs with nonlinear mixing [50; 49; 23; 22]. Although these studies ensure the identifiability of causal graphs (up to permutation and scaling ambiguities), they generally rely on the assumption that _each latent variable_ is intervened upon in at least one environment, necessitating access to at least \(d\) interventional distributions. Moreover, the aforementioned works assume specific types of interventions, such as hard/soft interventions and single-node interventions, and restrict changes in interventional distributions, disallowing edge reversals or the addition of new edges. The most recent work [23] enables causal representation learning under general interventions in latent linear SEMs with linear mixing. However, this approach still requires the assumption that the number of environments \(K\) is at least equal to the number of latent nodes \(d\) and that there are at least \(\Theta(d^{2})\) interventions. If the objective is to detect variables with general mechanism changes across multiple environments--environments that may lack a consistent topological order and sufficient interventions or environments--using existing CRL methods to recover each latent graph becomes overly restrictive or even infeasible. In contrast, we present a more flexible approach, enabling the identification of shifted variables without assuming restrictive interventions per environment or a consistent topological order of the latent graphs.

Direct estimation of mechanism shifts.The problem of directly estimating causal mechanism changes _without_ estimating the causal graphs has also been explored in various settings in the regime in which the causal variables are observable. Wang et al. [52] and Ghoshal et al. [14] have focused on identifying structural differences, assuming linear SEMs as environments, and proposing methods that take advantage of variations in the precision matrices. More recently, Chen et al. [10] studied this problem for nonlinear additive noise models, assuming that the environments originate from soft/hard interventions and leverage recent work in causal discovery via score matching. Finally, the concept of detecting/localizing feature shifts between two distributions has also been discussed in [27], although from a non-causal perspective. To our knowledge, there is a gap in the literature regarding the study of these objectives when considering latent causal variables. We address this gap by proposing a novel approach for directly detecting mechanism shifts within the latent SCMs.

Independent component analysis.The application of independent component analysis (ICA) [12] in the realm of causal discovery has seen significant developments. Linear ICA [19] and its nonlinear counterpart [20] have been instrumental in causal discovery [35, 44, 53] and more recently in causal latent discovery [23]. Beyond these established applications, our work uncovers a novel use of ICA, namely, identifying shifted nodes within the latent linear SEMs.

Given the relevance of ICA for our approach, we briefly recap it next. ICA considers the following setting: \(X=W\epsilon\) where \(X\in\mathbb{R}^{p}\), \(\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\), \(p\geq d\). A key assumption in ICA is that each component of \(\epsilon\) is independent. Given only observations of \(X\), the goal of ICA is to estimate both \(W\) and \(\epsilon\). The objective function typically aims to maximize negentropy or non-Gaussianity, with further details given in [19]. The identifiability results of ICA can be summarized as follows.

**Theorem 1** (Theorems 3,4 in [13]).: _If every component of \(\epsilon\) is independent and at most one component is Gaussian distributed, with \(W\) being full column rank, then ICA can estimate \(W\) up to a permutation and scaling of each column, and \(\epsilon\) can be recovered for some permutation up to scaling for each component. Furthermore, as noted in [19], if \(\mathbb{E}[\epsilon_{i}^{2}]=1,\forall i\in[d]\), the estimated \(W\) and \(\epsilon\) will have ambiguities only in permutation and sign. Formally, this means_

\[X=W\epsilon=(WP^{T}D)(DP\epsilon),\]

_where \(P\) is a permutation matrix and \(D\) is a diagonal matrix with diagonal entries \(\pm 1\). Then, the best estimate given by ICA is \(WP^{T}D\) and \(DP\epsilon\)._

## 3 Problem Setting

Consider a random vector \(X\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{p}\) that is a linear mixing of \(d\) latent variables \(Z=(Z_{1},\ldots,Z_{d})\):

\[X=GZ.\]

Here the latent variables in \(Z\) follows a linear SCM [37, 38], that is,

\[Z=AZ+\Omega^{\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\epsilon\]

where \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) corresponds to a DAG \(\mathcal{G}\) such that \(A_{jk}\neq 0\) iff there exists an edge \(j\to k\) in the DAG \(\mathcal{G}\); \(\Omega\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) is a diagonal matrix with positive entries, and \(\epsilon\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) is a random vector with independent components with mean zero and variance one, i.e., that \(\mathrm{Cov}(\epsilon)=I_{d}\). Denoting \(B=\Omega^{-\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}(I_{d}-A)\), we have that:

\[Z=B^{-1}\epsilon.\]We assume that we observe \(K\geq 2\) generalized interventional distributions that keep the mixing map \(G\) fixed but allow for generalized interventions to \(Z\). That is, for environment \(k\in[K]\) we have,

\[X^{(k)}=GZ^{(k)},\]

where \(Z^{(k)}=A^{(k)}Z^{(k)}+(\Omega^{(k)})^{\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}\epsilon^{(k)}\). Similarly, we have \(Z^{(k)}=(B^{(k)})^{-1}\epsilon^{(k)}\), where \(B^{(k)}=(\Omega^{(k)})^{-\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}(I_{d}-A^{(k)})\).

Notably, we allow generalized interventions that allow for \(A^{(k)}\) to be arbitrary, which includes _soft_ and _hard_ interventions, interventions targeting _single_ or _multiple_ nodes, as well as interventions capable of _adding_ or _removing_ parent nodes and _reversing_ edges. This contrasts with the existing literature on CRL, where single-node soft/hard interventions are the standard assumption [50, 40, 4, 1]. See Figure 1, for a toy example of what we aim to estimate.

**Remark 1**.: _Since we allow for general types of interventions, we can take any of the given environments as the canonical "observational" distribution with respect to which we observe interventions, or simply that we observe \(k\) interventions of an unknown observational distribution. This is a clear distinction from the standard setting in CRL [1, 50, 48, 23] which requires to know which environment is a suitable observational distribution._

To develop our identifiability result and algorithm, we will make additional assumptions on the noise distributions of the linear SEMs.

**Assumption A** (Noise Assumptions).: _For any environment \(k\in[K]\), let \(\epsilon^{(k)}=(\epsilon^{(k)}_{1},\ldots,\epsilon^{(k)}_{d})\) be the vector of \(d\) independent noises with \(\operatorname{Cov}(\epsilon^{(k)})=I_{d}\). We have:_

1. _Identically distributed across environments:_ \(\mathbb{P}(\epsilon^{(k)})=\mathbb{P}(\epsilon^{(k^{\prime})})\)_, for all_ \(k^{\prime}\neq k\)_._
2. _Non-Gaussianity: At most one noise component_ \(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i}\) _is Gaussian distributed._
3. _Pairwise differences: For any_ \(i\neq j\)_, we have_ \(\mathbb{P}(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i})\neq\mathbb{P}(\epsilon^{(k)}_{j})\) _and_ \(\mathbb{P}(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i})\neq\mathbb{P}(-\epsilon^{(k)}_{j})\)_._

Assumption A.1 is usually assumed for learning causal models from multiple environments [31, 4]. Assumption A.2 is typically made in causal discovery methods, as detailed in seminal works such as [43, 42, 19, 45] and is considered a more realistic assumption [34]. Assumption A.3 is generally satisfied in a generic sense; that is, when probability distributions on the real line are randomly selected, they are pairwise different with probability one. This assumption is also adopted in [47, 23].

**Assumption B** (Test Function).: _We assume access to a test function \(\psi\) that maps each noise r.v. to \(\mathbb{R}\) s.t. \(\psi(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i})=\psi(-\epsilon^{(k)}_{i})\), and \(\psi(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i})\neq\psi(\epsilon^{(k)}_{j})\) if \(\epsilon^{(k)}_{i}\) and \(\epsilon^{(k)}_{j}\) are not identically distributed._

Figure 1: We have 5 _latent_ variables \(Z\) which in this case relate to personality concepts, and the observations \(X\) represent the scores of 50 questions from a psychometric personality test. The latent variables \(Z\) follow a linear SCM, while the _unknown_ shared linear mixing is a full-rank matrix \(G\in\mathbb{R}^{50\times 5}\). Then, for environment \(k=\{\mathrm{US},\mathrm{UK},\mathrm{AU}\}\), the observables are generated through \(X^{(k)}=GZ^{(k)}\). Here, \(\mathbb{P}^{(\mathrm{US})}\) is taken as the “observational” (reference) distribution, and the distribution shifts in \(\mathbb{P}^{(\mathrm{UK})}\) and \(\mathbb{P}^{(\mathrm{AU})}\) are due to changes in the causal mechanisms of \(\{Z_{1}\}\) and \(\{Z_{2},Z_{3},Z_{5}\}\), respectively. Finally, the types of interventions are general; for UK, the edge \(Z_{4}\to Z_{1}\) is removed and the dashed red lines indicate changes in the edge weights to \(Z_{1}\); for AU, \(Z_{2}\) was intervened by removing \(Z_{5}\to Z_{2}\) and _adding_\(Z_{3}\to Z_{2}\), while the edge \(Z_{5}\to Z_{3}\) was _reversed_, thus changing the mechanisms of \(Z_{3}\) and \(Z_{5}\). Thus, we aim to identify \(\{Z_{1}\}\) and \(\{Z_{2},Z_{3},Z_{5}\}\).

This assumption states that we can access a test function that can help differentiate the noise components. One coarse example is \(\psi(y)=\mathbb{P}(|y|\leq 1)\). This assumption is introduced to better understand our method workflow in Section 4, but it is not completely necessary. We discuss how to relax this assumption in Appendix C. Next, we formally define a mechanism shift.

**Definition 1** (Latent Mechanism Shifts).: _Let \(\operatorname{PA}(Z_{i}^{(k)})\) denote the set of parents of \(Z_{i}^{(k)}\). A latent variable \(Z_{i}\) is called a latent shifted node within environments \(k\) and \(k^{\prime}\), if and only if:_

\[\mathbb{P}(Z_{i}^{(k)}\mid\operatorname{PA}(Z_{i}^{(k)}))\neq\mathbb{P}(Z_{i}^ {(k^{\prime})}\mid\operatorname{PA}(Z_{i}^{(k^{\prime})})).\]

**Remark 2**.: _Following Definition 1, \(Z_{i}\) is a latent shifted node between environments \(k\) and \(k^{\prime}\) if: (1) The \(i\)-th rows of \(A^{(k)}\) and \(A^{(k^{\prime})}\) are different; (2) \(\Omega_{ii}^{(k)}\neq\Omega_{ii}^{(k^{\prime})}\); or (3) both._

Definition 1 aligns with those previously discussed in [52; 14; 10], with the key difference that we consider changes in the causal mechanisms of the latent causal variables. However, note that our results also contribute to the setting in which causal variables are observable considering that the mixing function is the identity matrix, that is, \(G=I_{d}\).

## 4 Identifying Shifts in Latent Causal Mechanisms

Following the setup outlined in the previous section, our focus now turns to developing an algorithm to identify latent shifted nodes, given data from multiple environments. First, note that we can write the overall model as a linear ICA problem, where, for any environment \(k\), the observation \(X^{(k)}\) is a linear combination of independent components \(\epsilon^{(k)}\). Specifically, we have

\[X^{(k)}=GZ^{(k)}=G(B^{(k)})^{-1}\epsilon^{(k)}\]

Under the mild conditions given in Assumption A, from classical ICA identifiability results stated in Theorem 1, we can identify \(G(B^{(k)})^{-1}\) up to permutation and sign flip. Let \(M^{(k)}=B^{(k)}H\) where \(H=G^{\dagger}\). Then, we can only identify \(M^{(k)}\) up to permutation and sign flip, which does not suffice to identify the latent SCM encoded in \(B^{(k)}\). In sum, what we can only obtain from ICA is

\[\overline{M}^{(k)}=P^{(k)}D^{(k)}B^{(k)}H\]

where \(P^{(k)}\) is a permutation matrix, and \(D^{(k)}\) is a diagonal matrix with \(-1\) or \(+1\) on its diagonal. As Seigal et al. [40] points out, it is not possible to identify \(B^{(k)}\) further given _generalized interventions_. Our first result is that our present mild assumptions suffice to infer shifted nodes.

**Theorem 2** (Identifiability).: _Given access to \(K\geq 2\) environments, assume that A and B hold for all environments. Then, all latent shifted nodes are identifiable._

An interesting facet of our identifiability result is that it is _constructive_. In the next subsection we will provide an explicit algorithm to infer the shifted nodes and prove the main theorem above.

### Constructive identifiability

Consider \(\epsilon^{(k)}=B^{(k)}HX^{(k)}\) and \(\mathfrak{\epsilon}^{(k)}=\overline{M}^{(k)}X^{(k)}=P^{(k)}D^{(k)}B^{(k)}HX^{ (k)}=P^{(k)}D^{(k)}\epsilon^{(k)}\), where \(\mathfrak{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) and \(\overline{M}^{(k)}\) are the output of ICA, which contain the permutation and sign flip ambiguities given by \(P^{(k)}D^{(k)}\).

Obtaining a consistent ordering of the noise components across all environments is equivalent to finding \(P^{(k)}\). Under Assumption B, and without loss of generality, we consider that \((\epsilon_{1}^{(k)},\ldots,\epsilon_{d}^{(k)})\) are in increasing order with respect to their \(\psi\) values. Since \(\psi\) is invariant to sign flip, we can calculate \(\psi(\mathfrak{\epsilon}_{i}^{(k)})\) for all \(i\in[d]\) and sort the calculated \(\psi\) values in increasing order. Let \(\overline{P}^{(k)}\) denote the sorting permutation with respect to \(\psi\), so that post-sorting, we get \(\overline{P}^{(k)}\mathfrak{\epsilon}^{(k)}\).

**Remark 3**.: _In Appendix C, we discuss how to relax the assumption on the test function \(\psi\)._

**Proposition 1**.: \(\overline{P}^{(k)}=\left(P^{(k)}\right)^{T}\)_, i.e., \(\overline{P}^{(k)}\) is the inverse permutation of the ICA scrambling._

From Proposition 1, we thus find that we can unscramble the permutation \(P^{(k)}\) by sorting with respect to \(\psi\). We get \(\overline{P}^{(k)}\mathfrak{\epsilon}^{(k)}=\overline{P}^{k}P^{(k)}D^{(k)} \epsilon^{(k)}=D^{(k)}\epsilon^{(k)}\) from the above proposition. In other words, we can extract \(\mathfrak{\epsilon}^{(k)}=D^{(k)}\epsilon^{(k)}\) via \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=\overline{P}^{(k)}\overline{M}^{(k)}=D^{(k)}B^{(k)}H=D^{(k )}M^{(k)}\) after ICA and sorting by \(\psi\).

**Proposition 2**.: _Given access to \(K\geq 2\) environments, assume that A holds. Then, \(Z_{i}\) is identified as a latent non-shifted node between environments \(k\) and \(k^{\prime}\) if and only if \(M_{i}^{(k)}=M_{i}^{(k^{\prime})}\), where \(M_{i}^{(k)}\) represents the \(i\)-th row of \(M^{(k)}\), and \(M^{(k)}=B^{(k)}H\)._

All formal proofs are given in Appendix E. Our next result shows the identifiability of shifted nodes in the unscrambled matrix \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}\).

**Theorem 3**.: \(Z_{i}\) _is identified as a non-shifted node if and only if \(\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}=\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^{\prime})}\) or \(\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}=-\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^{\prime})}\)._

We can summarize this in the following algorithm, which proves Theorem 2:

* Perform ICA to obtain \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}\) and \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) with input \(X^{(k)}\).
* Sort by \(\psi\) to get the permutation \(\overline{P}^{(k)}\) and compute \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=\overline{P}^{(k)}\overline{M}^{(k)}\) and \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}=\overline{P}^{(k)}\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\).
* Check the condition on \(\{\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}:k\in[K]\}\) to detect if \(Z_{i}\) is a shifted node, as prescribed by Theorem 3.

### Finite-sample algorithm

Thus far, we have considered the population setting where we are given the entire interventional distributions. In practice, we are given samples from each of these interventional distributions, so that we have \(K\) datasets, one for each of the interventional distributions. The overall algorithm is given next in Alg. 1 (see illustration in Appendix B) with detailed explanations following the algorithm.

```
0: Datasets \(\{\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) and threshold \(\alpha\) (e.g., 0.5)  Calculate covariance matrix \(\Sigma^{(k)}\) from \(\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\) for all k \(d=\max\limits_{k=1,\ldots,K}\text{rank}(\Sigma^{(k)})\) for\(k=1,\ldots,K\)do //Step 1: \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) is samples from \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) \(\overline{\mathbf{\epsilon}}^{(k)},\overline{M}^{(k)}\leftarrow\text{ICA}(\mathbf{X} ^{(k)},d)\)  Calculate \(\widehat{\psi}(\overline{\mathbf{\epsilon}}^{(k)})=[\widehat{\psi}(\overline{ \mathbf{\epsilon}}_{1}^{(k)}),\widehat{\psi}(\overline{\mathbf{\epsilon}}_{2}^{(k)}), \ldots,\widehat{\psi}(\overline{\mathbf{\epsilon}}_{d}^{(k)})]\) //Step 2  sorted_idx \(\leftarrow\) argsort(\(\widehat{\psi}(\overline{\mathbf{\epsilon}}^{(k)})\)) \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}\leftarrow\overline{M}^{(k)}[\text{sorted\_idx},:]\)  Initialize \(S^{(k,k^{\prime})}=\emptyset\), for all \(k\neq k^{\prime}\) for\(i=1,\ldots,d\)do for\(k\neq k^{\prime}\)do  Calculate \(L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}\) //Step 3 if\(L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}>\alpha\)then \(S^{(k,k^{\prime})}\gets S^{(k,k^{\prime})}\cup\{i\}\)
0: All latent shifted nodes \(S=(S^{(k,k^{\prime})})_{k,k^{\prime}}\)
```

**Algorithm 1**iLCS: Identifying Latent Causal Mechanisms **S**hifts

Step 1:We perform ICA with samples from \(X^{(k)}\) to extract \(\overline{M}^{(k)}\) and samples from \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\).

**Remark 4** (Estimation of \(d\).).: _One missing component in using ICA in practice is that, along with samples from \(X^{(k)}\), we need to input the number of latent nodes \(d\), which need to be estimated from samples. Define \(\Sigma^{(k)}=\mathbb{E}[X^{(k)}X^{(k)}T]=G(B^{(k)})^{-1}(B^{(k)})^{-T}G^{T}\). Since all matrices are full rank, it follows that \(d=\text{rank}(\Sigma^{(k)})\), where \(\Sigma^{(k)}\) can be estimated by the sample covariance matrix. Thus, \(d\) can also be estimated by the rank of the sample covariance matrix._

Step 2:We compute the empirical expectation of \(\psi\) on samples from \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\), which by law of large number arguments, converges to its population expectation, which is \(\psi(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)})\). We use the sorted order of the empirical expectations to sort the noise components, unscrambling the noise components as earlier, to get \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}\) and samples from \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\).

Step 3:Here, we explicitly construct a test statistic to check the condition on \(\{\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}:k\in[K]\}\) to detect if \(Z_{i}\) is a shifted node. Note that from our Theorem 3, there is a non-shift node \(Z_{i}\) between environments \(k\) and \(k^{\prime}\) if and only if \(\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}=\pm\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^{\prime})}\). Accordingly, we define a test statistic:

\[L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}=\frac{\min\{\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}\pm\widetilde{M}_{i}^ {(k^{\prime})}\|_{1}}}{\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}\|_{1}+\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{( k^{\prime})}\|_{1}}\]

It can be seen that \(L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}=0\) if and only if \(\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}=\pm\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^{\prime})}\), which implies node \(Z_{i}\) is not shifted between environments \(k\) and \(k^{\prime}\). Thus, in step three of the algorithm above, for each coordinate \(i\in[d]\), we check if there exists \(k\neq k^{\prime}\) such that \(L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}>\alpha\) for a given threshold \(\alpha\). If such a \(k\neq k^{\prime}\) exists, we include \(i\) in the list of shifted nodes.

Algorithm 1 is consistent with the ground truth set of shifted nodes as \(n\) approaches infinity. Empirical evidence supporting this claim is presented in Figure 2, which shows that with a sufficiently large sample size, all shifted nodes are correctly identified, and the F1 score reaches 1. Further theoretical discussion on the sample complexity of our method can be found in Appendix D.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we investigate the performance of our method in synthetic and real-world data.

### Synthetic Data

In our setup, each noise component \(\epsilon_{i}\) is sampled from a generalized normal distribution with the probability density function given by \(p(\epsilon_{i})\propto\exp\{-|\epsilon_{i}|^{i}\}\), where \(i=1,2,\ldots,d\). In this noise generation process, the noise vector \(\epsilon\) adheres to the condition \(\psi(\epsilon_{i})<\psi(\epsilon_{j})\) for all \(i<j\) if we choose \(\psi(y)=\mathbb{P}(|y|\leq 1)\). Following the methodology similar to that in [40], we start by sampling either an Erdos-Renyi (ER) or Scale-Free (SF) graph with \(d\) nodes and an expected edge count of \(md\), where \(m\in\{2,4,6\}\), denoted as \(ERm\) or \(SFm\). The observed space dimension \(p\) is set to \(2d\). For each graph, the weights are independently sampled from Unif \(\pm\)\([0.25,1]\) and the diagonal entries of \(\Omega\) from Unif\([2,4]\). In each environment \(k\), \(15\%\) of the nodes are randomly selected for shifting. The new weights \(A_{i}^{(k)}\) for the shifted node \(i\), and the new entries of \(\Omega^{(k)}\), specifically \(\Omega_{ii}^{(k)}\), are independently sampled from Unif\([6,8]\). The mixing function \(G\) is independently generated from Unif\([-0.25,0.25]\).

Empirically, we have observed that the following formulation of \(L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}\) leads to improved results:

\[L_{i}^{k,k^{\prime}}=\frac{\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}|-|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^ {\prime})}|\|_{1}}{\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k)}\|_{1}+\|\widetilde{M}_{i}^{(k^{ \prime})}\|_{1}},\]

Figure 2: Illustration of the efficacy of our method in accurately identifying latent shifted nodes as the sample size increases, for ER2 graphs. In the first subplot, for a latent graph with \(d=5\) nodes, we examine scenarios with observed dimensions \(p=10,20,40\) and plot their corresponding F1 scores against the number of samples \(n\). It is observed that the F1 score approaches 1 with a sufficiently large sample size. Detailed experimental procedures and results are discussed in Section 5.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

normalization of data to fit within the \([0,1]\) range, achieved by adjusting according to the maximum and minimum values observed. The research question we have formalized in this study is not derived from any data competition. It aligns with interests explored in existing psychological literature [25, 8, 46, 29], yet our investigation is distinguished by a unique analytical framework.

Labeling latent nodes.Prior to detecting shifted nodes, it is essential to assign semantics to each node. This process involves conducting interventions on each component of the noise vector to aid in labeling the latent nodes. Given that the noise components are distinct for each latent node, labeling the noise effectively equates to labeling the latent nodes.

Initially, we apply ICA to the data for males, followed by getting post-sorting \(\widetilde{M}^{male}\) and \(\widetilde{\mathbf{\epsilon}}^{male}\) as outlined in our methodology. Subsequently, we perform interventions on each noise component, setting each to \(0\) sequentially, and then re-mixing the intervened noise vector using \((\widetilde{M}^{male})^{\dagger}\). By examining the impact of these interventions on the observation space -- specifically, identifying which question scores undergo significant changes -- we can assign appropriate semantic labels to each latent node index. For instance, nullifying the first column of \(\widetilde{\mathbf{\epsilon}}\) and remixing the intervened noise with \((\widetilde{M}^{male})^{\dagger}\) alters the score distribution in a manner that reveals the semantic domain affected by the first noise component. An example of assigning the label _Agreeableness_ to a latent node is depicted in Figure 3. By applying the same process to all noise components, we are able to assign semantic labels _Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion_, and _Neuroticism_ to the remaining latent nodes. More detailed experiment results are shown in Section G.

Shifted nodes detection.To identify shifted personality dimensions across gender, we computed \(L_{i}^{male,female}\) for each latent node, obtaining values of \(\{0.074,0.0497,0.078,0.638,0.633\}\). Setting a tolerance threshold \(\alpha=0.5\) to accommodate real data estimation variances, we observed that the last two nodes exhibit significantly higher \(L_{i}^{male,female}\) scores, surpassing \(\alpha\), and thus are considered shifted. These nodes correspond to the labels _Neuroticism_ and _Extraversion_. Consistent with existing psychological literature, women have been found to score higher in _Neuroticism_ than men [25, 8, 46, 29], while men scored higher in the Activity subcomponent of _Extraversion_[8]. This discovery aligns with the findings in psychology literature. To further validate our method's effectiveness, a similar analysis was conducted across countries, comparing the UK and the US, which have the most observations in our dataset. The computed \(L_{i}^{US,UK}\) for each latent node was \(\{0.302,0.258,0.109,0.189,0.088\}\). All values fell below \(\alpha\), indicating no latent node shifts between

Figure 3: We apply an intervention to the first column of \(\mathbf{\epsilon}\) and then use \((\widetilde{M}^{male})^{\dagger}\) for remixing. The first row of the resulting histograms represents scores for 5 out of the 10 questions related to the Extraversion personality dimension. Subsequent rows display histograms for 5 questions from each of the other four personality dimensions, as indicated at the right end of each row. The red distribution represents the scores before the intervention on the noise, while the blue distribution corresponds to scores after the intervention. Overlapping areas are shown in purple. Notably, the intervention on the first column of \(\mathbf{\epsilon}\) alters the distribution in the observed space, specifically affecting the scores for questions related to the _Agreeableness_ personality dimension, whereas distributions for other dimensions remain unchanged. Consequently, we can label the first noise component as corresponding to _Agreeableness_.

these two countries. This finding is also in agreement with existing studies that personality exhibits stability across countries and cultures [25, 24, 11].

## 6 Concluding Remarks

In this study, we demonstrated that latent mechanism shifts are identifiable, up to a permutation, within the framework of linear latent causal structures and linear mixing functions. Furthermore, we introduced an algorithm, grounded in ICA, designed to detect these shifts. Our method offers a broader applicability to various types of interventions compared to CRL framework. Unlike shift detection methods where node variables are directly observable, our approach extends to scenarios where latent variables remain unobserved. A promising future direction consists of adapting our methodology to nonlinear transformations, which could address more complex, practical challenges, such as identifying latent mechanism shifts in real-world image data.

## Appendix A Limitations and Broader Impacts

Limitations of this work include the need to relax the noise assumption and to consider similar settings under nonlinear mixing functions. These are promising directions to explore in the CRL field. The broader impact of this work is that CRL methods can be used to identify mechanism shifts and determine root causes, which can be utilized in the biological field to find disease genes or biomarkers. Currently, the negative impacts of this method are not clear.

## Appendix B Illustration of our algorithm

## Appendix C Discussion on Test Function

In Assumption B, we assume that there exists a test function \(\psi\) and that we can access it. Here we discuss ways to relax it. Recall that in Section 4.1, \(\psi\) is utilized to sort the noise component \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) to ensure that the post-sorting noise vector \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) has a consistent order across all environments.

Figure 4: Overview of our method: For each context \(k\), given the data \(\mathbf{X}^{(k)}\), our method involves three main steps. First, we apply ICA to each dataset to estimate \(\mathbf{\epsilon}^{(k)}\) and \(M^{(k)}\). Second, we calculate \(\psi(\epsilon^{(k)})=\{\psi(\epsilon_{1}^{(k)}),\psi(\epsilon_{2}^{(k)}), \ldots,\psi(\epsilon_{d}^{(k)})\}\) for each noise component, sort these components in increasing order, and correspondingly arrange the rows of \(M^{(k)}\). Third, we compare the sorted rows of \(M^{(k)}\) to identify the shifted nodes.

Detailed Proofs

### Proof of Proposition 2

**Lemma 1**.: _Under problem setting, for any \(x,y\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times 1}\), the equation \(x^{T}H=y^{T}H\) holds if and only if \(x=y\)._

Proof.: Given that \(G\) possesses full column rank, it follows that \(H=G^{\dagger}\) has full row rank. Consequently, the null space of \(H^{T}\) is \(\{0\}\). Therefore, if \(x^{T}H=y^{T}H\), it implies \(H^{T}(x-y)=0\). This leads to the conclusion that \(x-y=0\), which in turn implies \(x=y\). 

Proof of Proposition 2.: Recall that \(B^{(k)}=(\Omega^{k})^{-\frac{1}{2}}(I_{d}-A^{(k)})\). Since \(A^{(k)}\) is a weighted adjacency matrix, its diagonal entries are zero. Thus,

\[B^{(k)}_{ij} =-\left(\Omega^{(k)}_{ii}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}A^{(k)}_{ij}\quad \text{if}\quad i\neq j,\] \[B^{(k)}_{ii} =\left(\Omega^{(k)}_{ii}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\quad\text{if} \quad i=j.\]

Under Definition 1, if node \(Z_{i}\) is shifted, it implies either 1) \(\Omega^{(k)}_{ii}\neq\Omega^{(k^{\prime})}_{ii}\), 2) \(A^{(k)}_{i}\neq A^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\), or 3) both conditions hold. In scenarios 1) and 3), \(B^{(k)}_{ii}\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{ii}\), resulting in \(B^{(k)}_{i}\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). In scenario 2), while \(\Omega^{(k)}_{ii}=\Omega^{(k^{\prime})}_{ii}\), there exists a \(j\in[d]\) such that \(A^{(k)}_{ij}\neq A^{(k^{\prime})}_{ij}\), leading to \(B^{(k)}_{i}\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). If node \(Z_{i}\) is not shifted, then \(A^{(k)}_{i}=A^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\) and \(\Omega^{(k)}_{ii}=\Omega^{(k^{\prime})}_{ii}\), implying \(B^{(k)}_{i}=B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). Therefore, \(Z_{i}\) is shifted if and only if \(B^{(k)}_{i}\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). According to Lemma 1, \(B^{(k)}_{i}\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\) if and only if \(B^{(k)}_{i}H\neq B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}H\), which is equivalent to \(M^{(k)}_{i}\neq M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\).

In conclusion, \(Z_{i}\) is shifted if and only if \(M^{(k)}_{i}\neq M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\).

### Proof of Theorem 3

**Lemma 2**.: _Under problem setting, it is not possible for an intervention on the latent node \(Z_{i}\) to result in \(M^{(k)}_{i}=-M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\)._

Proof.: We prove this by contradiction. Suppose that \(M^{(k)}_{i}=-M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). According to Lemma 1, this would imply \(B^{(k)}_{i}=-B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). However, we know \(B^{(k)}=(\Omega^{(k)})^{-1}(I_{d}-A^{(k)})\) where \(A^{(k)}\) is the weight matrix for a DAG. Since \(A^{(k)}_{ii}=0\), it follows that \(B^{(k)}_{ii}=(\Omega^{(k)})^{-1}_{ii}\). Therefore, both \(B^{(k)}_{ii}\) and \(B^{(k^{\prime})}_{ii}\) are positive. It is impossible for \(B^{(k)}_{i}\) to be equal to \(-B^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). Consequently, the scenario where \(M^{(k)}_{i}=-M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\) cannot occur. 

Proof of Theorem 3.: Recall from the data generation process that

\[M^{(k)}X^{(k)}=\epsilon^{(k)}.\]

When input \(X^{(k)}\) to ICA, we have \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=P^{(k)}D^{(k)}M^{(k)}\) and \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}=P^{(k)}D^{(k)}\epsilon^{(k)}\). Without loss of generality, we assume that \(\epsilon^{(k)}\) is ordered increasingly with respect to \(\psi\). Thus, post sorting with respect to \(\psi\), we eliminate the ambiguity of \(P^{(k)}\), and we get \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=D^{(k)}M^{(k)}\) and \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{(k)}=D^{(k)}\epsilon^{(k)}\).

We are now ready to prove that \(Z_{i}\) is not shifted if and only if \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=\pm\widetilde{M}^{(k^{\prime})}\). This immediately implies that if \(Z_{i}\) is not shifted, then \(M^{(k)}_{i}=M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\), thus satisfying \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=\pm\widetilde{M}^{(k^{\prime})}\).

If \(\widetilde{M}^{(k)}=\pm\widetilde{M}^{(k^{\prime})}\), there are two cases: \(M^{(k)}_{i}=M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\) or \(M^{(k)}_{i}=-M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\). We prove in Lemma 2 that the scenario \(M^{(k)}_{i}=-M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\) cannot exist. The only surviving situation is \(M^{(k)}_{i}=M^{(k^{\prime})}_{i}\), which indicates that \(Z_{i}\) is not shifted.

Experiments on Synthetic Data Compared with DCI

As described in Section 5.1, instead of generating the mixing function \(G\) from \(\text{Unif}[-0.25,0.25]\), we set \(G=I\), such that \(X=Z\) and \(Z\) can be directly observed. In this setup, finding general interventions in linear causal representations reduces to identifying general interventions in linear SEM, a setting for which the existing method DCI [52] is designed. Table 2 presents the performance comparison between our method and DCI under these conditions, demonstrating that our method outperforms DCI in most cases.

## Appendix G Additional Information on Real Data

This section provides detailed information on the procedures employed in analyzing the real dataset.

PreprocessingThe initial dataset comprised 19,719 observations, which can be downloaded from [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgreenwell/ocean-five-factor-personality-test-responses/data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lucasgreenwell/ocean-five-factor-personality-test-responses/data). In the preprocessing phase, any observation with a missing value in any column was excluded, leaving a total of 19,710 observations for further analysis. Subsequently, we applied max-min value normalization to the scores of each question, ensuring that all scores were normalized to fall within the range \([0,1]\). This normalization step is crucial for achieving uniformity in the data scale, thereby facilitating accurate analysis and comparison across the dataset.

Labeling the NoiseTo derive meaningful psychological insights, it is crucial to assign semantic labels to all latent nodes. Given that the noise components are pairwise distinct and unique to the latent node \(Z_{i}\), we consider intervening on each noise component, then remixing and observing the changes in the observational space. This approach enables us to assign semantic labels to both the noise components and their corresponding latent nodes. We utilize observations from the male dataset as the reference context, which comprises 7,603 observations. Following the initial step of our method, we obtain the sorted \(\widetilde{M}^{male}\) and \(\widehat{\epsilon}^{male}\). The mixing function \(G\) is derived from \((\widetilde{M}^{male})^{\dagger}\).

Table 2: Comparison of Precision, Recall, and F1 scores for different graph types, \(d\) values, and methods between our method and DCI.

To identify the semantic label for the first component of \(\widetilde{\epsilon}\), we set its corresponding noise vector component to \(0\), effectively nullifying the first component of \(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{male}\). This intervention yields an estimated noise matrix samples from \(\widehat{\epsilon}^{male}_{inv}\), denoted as \(\widehat{\epsilon}^{male}_{inv}\). The intervened reconstruction, \(\mathbf{X}^{male}_{inv}=G(\widetilde{\epsilon}^{male}_{inv})^{T}\), and the original score distribution, \(\mathbf{X}^{male}=G(\widetilde{\mathbf{\epsilon}}^{male})^{T}\), allow us to compare question scores pre- and post-intervention. Figure 7 plots these distributions, revealing significant shifts for questions pertaining to the _Agreeableness_ dimension, with minimal impact on other scores, thereby identifying the first noise component as _Agreeableness_. This process is replicated for the second through fifth columns of \(\mathbf{\epsilon}^{male}\), with results illustrated in Figures 9, 8, 5, and 6. Each plot demonstrates that interventions result in significant distribution changes for questions related to a single personality dimension, with negligible effects on others. Consequently, we label these noise components as _Openness_, _Conscientiousness_, _Extraversion_, and _Neuroticism_, respectively. These labels will be used for all the following analysis.

Shifted Nodes DetectionWe then applied our method to data from the male and female contexts. The calculated \(L^{male,female}_{i}\) values are \(\{0.074,0.0497,0.078,0.638,0.633\}\). Based on these results, we identify shifts in the last two personality dimensions, specifically labeled as _Extraversion_ and _Neuroticism_. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis of personality dimensions between the US and UK, which have 8,753 and 1,531 observations, respectively. The computed \(L^{US,UK}_{i}\) values are \(\{0.302,0.258,0.109,0.189,0.088\}\), indicating that no latent node is considered as having undergone shifts between these two countries.

Figure 6: Intervention on the fifth component of the noise vector and subsequent re-mixing generate a new observed space — a new score distribution. Notably, only _Neuroticism_ exhibits significant changes after intervention, leading us to label the fifth component of the noise vector (after sorting) as _Neuroticism_.

Figure 7: Intervention on the first component of the noise vector and subsequent re-mixing generate a new observed space — a new score distribution. Notably, only _Agreeableness_ exhibits significant changes after intervention, leading us to label the first component of the noise vector (after sorting) as _Agreeableness_.

Figure 8: Intervention on the third component of the noise vector and subsequent re-mixing generate a new observed space — a new score distribution. Notably, only _Conscientiousness_ exhibits significant changes after intervention, leading us to label the third component of the noise vector (after sorting) as _Conscientiousness_.

Figure 9: Intervention on the second component of the noise vector and subsequent re-mixing generate a new observed space — a new score distribution. Notably, only _Openness_ exhibits significant changes after intervention, leading us to label the second component of the noise vector (after sorting) as _Openness_.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: It has been discussed in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: Theorems and proposition has been completely proven in Appendix. 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? 1. Answer: [Yes] 2. Justification: The whole algorithm has been discussed in Algorithm 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? 1.

Answer: [Yes] Justification: The code is published in [https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS](https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS). Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The algorithm is detailed in Algorithm 1, and the implementation details are discussed in Section 5. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We do not report statistical significance of the experiments as it follows the traditions of CRL literature, such as [40] and [4]. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: We do not report the computer resources used as it is not the primary concern of this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: It is discussed in Section A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper has no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: One dataset is generated by simulation, and the source of the real data has been explicitly mentioned. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The primary new asset of the paper is the code, and the code is published in [https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS](https://github.com/TianyuCodings/iLCS). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review. *
