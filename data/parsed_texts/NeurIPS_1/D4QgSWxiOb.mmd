###### Abstract

We study whether transformers can learn to _implicitly_ reason over parametric knowledge, a skill that even the most capable language models struggle with. Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers _can_ learn implicit reasoning, but only through _grokking_, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning.2

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have been shown deficient in _implicit_ reasoning with their parametric memory of knowledge and rules. For example, a range of LLMs are found to be incapable of robustly composing internalized facts [48, 71], and even GPT-4 [42] cannot adequately compare entities' attributes despite knowing them [1].

Deficiency in implicit reasoning has profound implications. It implies the models' limitations in inducing structured and compressed representations of facts and rules, which lead to redundant knowledge storage and difficulty in propagating knowledge updates [76], and importantly, fundamentally impede the model from _systematic generalization_ over knowledge [25]. While explicit verbalizations of reasoning steps (e.g., chain-of-thought rationales) can improve task performance [67, 64, 73, 55, 31], they are not available during large-scale (pre-)training where the model's core capabilities are acquired [77, 29].

_Is implicit reasoning doomed given that even the most capable models struggle? Can it be resolved by further scaling data and compute, or are there fundamental limitations of the transformer [62] that prohibit robust acquisition of this skill?_In this paper, we rigorously study these questions by constructing synthetic training and evaluation datasets, training transformers from scratch, and examining their generalization. We conceptualize reasoning as the _induction and application of inference rules_, and expose the model to a mixture of "atomic facts" and "inferred facts" (which are deduced from the atomic facts via a set of latent rules), resembling "axioms" and "theorems" in a formal system. To evaluate how well the model learns the rules, we test its ability to make novel deductions (i.e., completing unseen inferred facts) in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios.3 This approach allows us to control the training data and perform clean evaluations, which would be challenging when studying existing LLMs trained on uncontrolled data.

Footnote 3: Definitions of ID/OOD are introduced in ยง2.

Our experiments reveal that transformers _can_ learn to perform implicit reasoning, but this skill is only robustly acquired through _extended training far beyond overfitting_ (Figure 1), a phenomenon known as _grokking_[47]. We find that the speed of improvement in generalization correlates with the _ratio_ between inferred and atomic facts in training, and depends little on the absolute _size_ of the training data (Figure 2). This suggests a correction of prior explanations of grokking based on _critical data size_[33, 61, 78, 21], in that it should instead be the _critical data distribution_ that decides the characteristics of grokking. Our findings extend prior observations of the grokking phenomenon primarily in algorithmic and linguistic tasks [47, 38] to the domain of knowledge-based reasoning, and deepen our understanding of the grokking phenomenon.

Moreover, we find that the transformer exhibits different levels of systematicity across reasoning types. While ID generalization is consistently observed, in the OOD setting, the model fails to systematically generalize for composition but succeeds in comparison (Figure 1). To understand why this happens, we conduct mechanistic analysis of the internal mechanisms of the model. The analysis uncovers the gradual formation of the _generalizing circuit_ throughout grokking and establishes the connection between systematicity and its configuration, specifically, the way atomic knowledge and rules are stored and applied within the circuit. Our findings imply that proper cross-layer memory-sharing mechanisms for transformers such as memory-augmentation [54, 17] and explicit recurrence [7, 22, 57] are needed to further unlock transformer's generalization.

Finally, to demonstrate the power and potential of parametric memory for complex reasoning, we show that for a reasoning task with a large search space, a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, while state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-4-Turbo [43] and Gemini-1.5-Pro [16] based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation.

Figure 1: We find that transformers can learn to reason implicitly, but this skill is only robustly acquired through _grokking_, i.e., an extended period of training far beyond overfitting. Moreover, the transformer fails to _systematically_ generalize for composition, yet succeeds for comparison. We conduct a mechanistic study into the model internals throughout grokking, which reveals distinct generalizing circuits across the two tasks (Figure 4, 5) that explains the variations in systematicity.

## 2 General Setup

**Training data & ID/OOD evaluation.** As stated in SS1, we are interested in whether transformers can induce and apply latent rules over knowledge implicitly in a generalizable way. We create a data-generating process consisting of 1) sampling a set of basic _atomic facts_, and 2) using the atomic facts and latent rules to deduce _inferred facts_. To better characterize the level of generalization acquired by the model, we evaluate the model's in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. We prepare two separate sets of atomic facts: atomicTD and atomicCOD. Our training set includes _all_ the atomic facts and a uniformly random portion of the inferred facts deduced from atomicTD, which we call train_inferredID. For evaluation, (1) ID generalization aims to evaluate whether the model learns the latent rules correctly, by testing its ability to complete unseen inferred facts also deduced from atomicTD, which we denote by test_inferredID. (2) OOD generalization aims to evaluate the _systematicity_[25] acquired by the model, namely, the ability to apply rules over knowledge regardless of its distribution. To do this, we test the model on the facts deduced from atomicCOD, denoted by test_inferredCOD.

**Model & optimization.** We use a standard decoder-only transformer model as in GPT-2 [50] with \(8\) layers, \(768\) hidden dimensions and \(12\) attention heads (we explore the impact of different model scales in Appendix B). Optimization is done by AdamW [34] with learning rate \(10^{-4}\), batch size \(512\), weight decay \(0.1\) and \(2000\) warm-up steps. Notably, models are trained for a large number of epochs/steps beyond the point where training performance saturates. More details are in Appendix A.

## 3 Composition--Delayed Generalization without Systematicity

We begin our investigation with _composition_, where a model needs to "chain" different pieces of facts, e.g., _"Barack's wife is Michelle"_ and _"Michelle is born in 1964"_, to successfully complete a compositional sentence, e.g., _"Barack's wife is born in [1964]"_. Prior work extensively studied whether transformer-based language models can perform implicit composition, and negative results are consistently reported [48; 1; 71]. Specifically, there exists a _"compositionality gap"_[48], i.e., the frequency at which the model knows all the underlying basic facts but fails to compose them, which is considerable across different LLMs and does not decrease as models scale. Are transformers doomed to fail on such kind of reasoning, and if so, why?

### Setup

We focus on two-hop composition in this work. For atomic facts, we generate a random knowledge graph \(\mathcal{G}\) consisting of \(|\mathcal{E}|\) entities and \(|\mathcal{R}|=200\) relations, where each entity (as the subject) has \(20\) random distinct relations that each connects to another random entity (as the object). The atomic facts are then the edges, i.e., _(subject, relation, object)_ triplets in \(\mathcal{G}\), which we partition disjointly into atomicTD and atomicCOD (95%: 5%). The rule of (two-hop) composition is

\[\forall h,b,t\in\mathcal{E},\forall r_{1},r_{2}\in\mathcal{R},(h,r_{1},b) \wedge(b,r_{2},t)\implies(h,r_{1},r_{2},t), \tag{1}\]

which is used to deduce the ID and OOD inferred facts from atomicTD and atomicCOD, respectively. For convenience, in the above rule, we will call \(h\) the _head_ entity, \(b\) the _bridge_ entity, and \(t\) the _tail_ entity. For both atomic and inferred facts, training/testing is done by having the model predict the final tail entity. We assign a unique token to each relation/entity by default, and also find that the results are robust to different tokenizations (details in Appendix C).

We study the influence of the following two aspects on the model's learned behaviors:

* **Ratio between inferred and atomic facts.** By varying the amount of inferred facts included in training, we study the effect of the ratio \(\phi=|\texttt{train\_inferredID}|/|\texttt{atomicID}|\) on the model.
* **Training data size.** We study the impact of the training data size by varying \(|\mathcal{E}|\), the total number of entities, while controlling the ratio \(\phi\). Note that the size of training data (both atomic/inferred facts) scales linearly with \(|\mathcal{E}|\).

### Results

**Grokking observed in ID generalization but not in OOD generalization.** Figure 1(left) shows the model's accuracy on the train and test facts throughout optimization, with \(|\mathcal{E}|=2000\) and \(\phi=7.2\)We find that the model _can_ generalize to ID test examples, but high performance is only achieved through extended training far beyond overfitting, a phenomenon called _grokking_[47]. Specifically, the training performance saturates (over \(99\)% accuracy on both atomic and inferred facts) at around 14K optimization steps, before which the highest ID generalization accuracy is merely \(9.2\)%. However, generalization keeps improving by simply training for longer, and approaches almost perfect accuracy after extended optimization lasting around \(50\) times the steps taken to fit the training data. On the other hand, OOD generalization is never observed. We extend the training to \(2\) million optimization steps, and there is still no sign of OOD generalization.

**Inferred/atomic ratio \(\phi\) correlates with generalization speed**. Figure 2(a) shows the ID test accuracy across different \(\phi\). We omit the other splits since for all settings, the training performance saturates quickly and the OOD test accuracy remains at zero as earlier.4 It could be seen that the ratio \(\phi\) strongly correlates with the _speed_ of generalization. A very large ratio can push generalization to improve at a similar pace as the model fits the training data, reducing the need for extended training.5

Footnote 4: The training performances of all settings saturate within \(25\)K steps, where larger \(\phi\) takes more steps.

Footnote 5: When \(\phi=18.0\), the model achieves \(96.7\%\) accuracy before training performance saturates.

**Training data _distribution_, instead of training data size, qualitatively influences generalization behavior.** When \(\phi\) increases and \(|\mathcal{E}|\) holds constant, the _size_ of training data also gets larger. Prior studies hypothesize that training data size plays a central role in order for grokking to happen. In particular, previous work connects grokking with the notion of _critical data size_ (CDS) [33, 61, 78, 21], where it is hypothesized that CDS marks the shift from memorization to generalization (via grokking), and the speed of generalization improves as the training data further scales. However, results from our controlled experiments seem to contradict such a hypothesis. Figure 2(b) shows the results of varying \(|\mathcal{E}|\) with a fixed \(\phi=9.0\), where we change the horizontal axis from optimization step to epoch for better visualization.6 When fixing the ratio \(\phi\), the training data size does _not_ qualitatively affect the model's generalization. Specifically, scaling the data affects neither the relative speed of ID generalization and training improvement (as seen by the rather constant "gap" between train_inferredID and test_inferredID curves), nor the systematicity level (OOD performance stays zero). We also run the experiments across different \(\phi\) and find the results to be consistent. This suggests that _critical data "distribution", not size, may be the actual deciding factor behind grokking and generalization_. In addition, we find that scaling up the model size also does not qualitatively change the generalization behaviors observed here (Appendix B), and the main pattern is that larger models converge in fewer optimization steps, which shares with prior findings [60, 28].

Footnote 6: The optimization steps for each epoch scale linearly with the training size since we use a fixed batch size.

**Summary.** We have shown that transformers are capable of acquiring the rule of composition through grokking, with controlled experiments suggesting the crucial factor of data distribution (e.g., the inferred/atomic ratio \(\phi\)) in characterizing the model's generalization. However, important questions

Figure 2: The speed of grokking on the in-distribution (ID) test performance (a) correlates with the _ratio_ between inferred and atomic facts, and (b) is not influenced by the _size_ of training data.

still remain: _what happens during grokking, why does it happen, and why do transformers struggle with OOD examples?_ Answering these questions requires a deeper understanding of (the changes in) the model's inner workings, which we investigate next.

### Analyzing the inner workings of the model throughout grokking

We analyze the internal mechanisms within the model via a combination of two prevalent approaches: logit lens and causal tracing. We apply our analysis to the setting with \(|\mathcal{E}|=2000,\phi=9.0\) on \(300\) random examples from train_inferredID.

**Logit lens**. We interpret individual hidden states via logit lens [40; 15; 71], where the activation is converted into a set of logits for each vocabulary token by multiplying with the output embedding matrix. We follow the recent practice [71] where the activation first goes through the transformer's final normalization layer before multiplying with the output embedding (Figure 3, top right).

**Causal tracing**. The transformer could be viewed as a causal graph [46] that propagates information from the input to the output through a grid of intermediate states, which allows for a variety of causal analyses on its internal computations [63; 35; 19; 65; 12]. For convenience, we will refer to a hidden state by \(S[i,a]\), where \(i\) is the layer index and \(a\) marks the role of the input token at the same position as the state (one of \(\{h,r_{1},r_{2}\}\)). We illustrate our method in Figure 3, where the hidden state of interest is \(S[4,r_{1}]\) and the target is the model's prediction state \(S[8,r_{2}]\). There are in total three steps:

1. The **normal run** records the model's hidden state activations on a regular input \((h,r_{1},r_{2})\). Note that since the model maintains perfect training performance throughout grokking, the final prediction is always the ground truth tail entity \(t\).7 Footnote 7: For convenience, when we refer to a state as a token, we mean the top token of the state via logit lens.
2. In the **perturbed run**, a slightly perturbed input is fed to the model which changes the prediction, where again the hidden state activations are recorded. For the perturbation, prior work has explored adding noise to the input [35] and replacing key tokens with semantically close ones [63; 12]. We adopt token replacement which avoids unnecessary distribution shifts [74]. Specifically, for the hidden state of interest, we replace the input token at the same position as the state to be a random alternative of the same type (e.g., \(r_{1}\to r^{\prime}_{1}\)) that leads to a different target prediction (e.g., \(t\to t^{\prime}\)).
3. **Intervention**. During the normal run, we intervene the state of interest by replacing its activation with its activation in the perturbed run. We then run the remaining computations and measure if the target state (top-\(1\) token through logit lens) is altered. The ratio of such alterations (between \(0\) and \(1\)) among the examples quantitatively characterizes the _causal strength_ between the state of interest and the target.

Figure 3: Illustration of our circuit analysis approach (on the composition task). We use logit lens to interpret individual states, and use causal tracing to measure the strength of connections between states. Details are in the main content.

**The generalizing circuit**. We run a set of causal tracing and logit lens experiments across different model checkpoints throughout training. The discovered generalizing circuit (i.e., the causal computational pathways after grokking) is illustrated in Figure 4. Specifically, we locate a highly interpretable causal graph consisting of states in layer \(0\), \(5\), and \(8\), where we have pruned away the weak nodes/connections (details in Appendix D). Layer \(5\) splits the circuit into lower and upper layers, where 1) the lower layers retrieve the first-hop fact \((h,r_{1},b)\) from the input \(h,r_{1}\), store the bridge entity \(b\) in \(S[5,r_{1}]\), and "delay" the processing of \(r_{2}\) to \(S[5,r_{2}]\); 2) the upper layers retrieve the second-hop fact \((b,r_{2},t)\) from \(S[5,r_{1}]\) and \(S[5,r_{2}]\), and store the tail \(t\) to the output state \(S[8,r_{2}]\).

**What happens during grokking?** To understand the underlying mechanism behind grokking, we track the strengths of causal connections and results from logit lens across different model checkpoints during grokking (the "start" of grokking is the point when training performance saturates). We observe two notable amplifications (within the identified graph) that happen during grokking. The first is the causal connection between \(S[5,r_{1}]\) and the final prediction \(t\), which is very weak before grokking (Appendix D) and grows significantly during grokking (Figure 4). The second is the \(r_{2}\) component of \(S[5,r_{2}]\) via logit lens, for which we plot its mean reciprocal rank (MRR) (Figure 4). Additionally, we find that the state \(S[5,r_{1}]\) has a large component of the bridge entity \(b\) throughout grokking (Figure 4). These observations strongly suggest that the model is _gradually forming the second hop in the upper layers (\(5\)-\(8\)) during grokking_. This also indicates that, before grokking, the model is very likely mostly memorizing the examples in train_inferred\({}_{\texttt{ID}}\) by _directly associating \((h,r_{1},r_{2})\) with \(t\)_, without going through the first hop.

**Why does grokking happen?** These observations suggest a natural explanation of why grokking happens through the lens of circuit efficiency [61]. Specifically, as illustrated above, there exist both a memorizing circuit \(C_{mem}\) and a generalizing circuit \(C_{gen}\) that can fit the training data. While \(C_{mem}\) is learned first (which causes training performance to saturate quickly), \(C_{gen}\) is relatively more _efficient_, in the sense that it could fit the data with a lower complexity. To see this, we can compare the amount of facts \(C_{mem}\) and \(C_{gen}\) need to store (denoted as \(N_{mem}\) and \(N_{gen}\)) as a proxy for their complexity.8\(C_{mem}\) stores both atomic facts and inferred facts in the weights. \(C_{gen}\) (Figure 4) stores the atomic facts in the lower layers, and another copy of the atomic facts that _appear as the second hop in the inferred facts_ in the upper layers. As the inferred/atomic ratio \(\phi\) increases, \(N_{mem}\) would increase rapidly while \(N_{gen}\) increases slowly and is always bounded by two times the total amount of atomic facts, and hence, the relative efficiency of \(C_{gen}\) increases. In the long run, the model will be incentivized to transition from \(C_{mem}\) to \(C_{gen}\) due to implicit bias of the optimization [53] and explicit regularization such as weight decay which prefers more efficient circuits, and the transition would happen faster as \(\phi\) increases. This also explains why the training data size does not affect the speed of grokking, since _solely increasing the size does not change the relative efficiency of \(C_{mem}\) and \(C_{gen}\)_. The explanation also implies that a larger regularization factor should accelerate grokking (and vice versa), which we confirm by varying the degree of weight decay (Appendix E.1).

Footnote 8: While the circuits also consist of other components, they pale in comparison as the number of facts scales.

(c) Mean reciprocal rank (via logit lens) of the bridge entity \(b\) at \(S[5,r_{1}]\) and second relation \(r_{2}\) at \(S[5,r_{2}]\).

**Explaining and mitigating the deficiency in OOD generalization.** The configuration of \(C_{gen}\) also has another important implication: while the model does acquire compositionality through grokking, it _does not have any incentive to store atomic facts in the upper layers that do not appear as the second hop during training._ This explains why the model fails in the OOD setting where facts are only observed in the atomic form, not in the compositional form--the OOD atomic facts are simply not stored in the upper layers when queried during the second hop.9 Such issue originates from the non-recurrent design of the transformer architecture which forbids memory sharing across different layers. Our study provides a mechanistic understanding of existing findings that transformers seem to reduce compositional reasoning to linearized pattern matching [10], and also provides a potential explanation for the observations in recent findings that LLMs only show substantial positive evidence in performing the first hop reasoning but not the second [71]. Our findings imply that proper cross-layer memory-sharing mechanisms for transformers such as memory-augmentation [54; 17] and explicit recurrence [7; 22; 57] are needed to improve their generalization. We also show that a variant of the parameter-sharing scheme in Univeral Transformer [7] can improve OOD generalization in composition (Appendix E.2).

Footnote 9: We verified that in the OOD setting, \(S[5,r_{1}]\) and \(S[5,r_{2}]\) encode \(b\) and \(r_{2}\) respectively as in the ID case.

## 4 Comparison--Systematic Generalization via Parallel Circuit

We have just shown that the vanilla transformer fails to achieve OOD generalization for composition, _but is the vanilla transformer generally incapable of acquiring systematic implicit reasoning skills?_ We show that for _comparison_, a task where SoTA LLMs such as GPT-4 also struggle [1], the vanilla transformer _does_ have the capability to acquire systematic generalization, again through grokking. On the surface, it seems that the comparison task is no different than the composition task--both require retrieving and reasoning over two pieces of facts. However, as it turns out through our analysis, _the comparison task emits a "parallel circuit" that is learned by the transformer during grokking, which allows atomic facts to be stored and retrieved in the same region and enables systematicity to happen._

**Setup.** The comparison task involves comparing the attribute values of entities. We assume there are \(|\mathcal{E}|=1000\) entities, \(|\mathcal{A}|=20\) attributes and \(|\mathcal{V}|=20\) ordinal values for the attributes. Each attribute \(a\in\mathcal{A}\) has a label space \(\{a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\}\), a set of relations specifying its comparative form. For example, an attribute _age_ would have \(a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\) to be _younger, contemporary, older_, respectively.

The atomic facts are _(entity, attribute, value)_ triplets, where we assign a random value \(v\in\mathcal{V}\) for each \((e,a)\in\mathcal{E}\times\mathcal{A}\). Again, we randomly partition the atomic facts into atomicID and atomicOOD (90%: 10%). The rules of comparison are:

\[\begin{split}&\forall e_{1},e_{2}\in\mathcal{E},\forall a\in \mathcal{A},\forall v_{1},v_{2}\in\mathcal{V},(e_{1},a,v_{1})\wedge(e_{2},a,v_{ 2})\wedge v_{1}<v_{2}\implies(a,e_{1},e_{2},a_{<}),\\ &\forall e_{1},e_{2}\in\mathcal{E},\forall a\in\mathcal{A}, \forall v_{1},v_{2}\in\mathcal{V},(e_{1},a,v_{1})\wedge(e_{2},a,v_{2})\wedge v _{1}=v_{2}\implies(a,e_{1},e_{2},a_{=}),\\ &\forall e_{1},e_{2}\in\mathcal{E},\forall a\in\mathcal{A}, \forall v_{1},v_{2}\in\mathcal{V},(e_{1},a,v_{1})\wedge(e_{2},a,v_{2})\wedge v _{1}>v_{2}\implies(a,e_{1},e_{2},a_{>}).\end{split} \tag{2}\]

Take the attribute _age_ as an example, the first rule means if the _age_ of \(e_{1}\) is _smaller than_ the _age_ of \(e_{2}\), then we can infer "In terms of _age_, the relation between \(e_{1}\) and \(e_{2}\) is _younger_". Each entity/attribute/value/label is assigned a unique token, and training/testing is done by having the model predict the last token (attribute value for atomic facts; comparative relation for inferred facts).

**Results & analysis**. Figure 1(right) shows the results for \(\phi=7.2\), and we include more results in Appendix E.3. It can be seen that 1) the model again acquires robust generalization only through grokking; 2) surprisingly, the model also achieves systematicity in generalization, different from the case of composition.

Analyzing the model's internals similarly as in SS3.3 (details in Appendix D), we find the generalizing circuit for comparison illustrated in Figure 5(a). On a separate stream, the model prepares the label space \(\{a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\}\) from \(a\) and stores it in \(S[7,a]\). In the lower layers (\(0\)-\(5\)), the model retrieves the two atomic facts and stores the attribute values \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) at \(S[5,e_{1}]\) and \(S[5,e_{2}]\). Then, the upper layers (\(5\)-\(8\)) compare \(v_{1},v_{2}\) and fetch the label from \(S[7,a]\) based on the comparison result. Importantly, there is a major difference compared with the circuit for composition: the two atomic facts are retrieved _in parallel_, which suggests that the atomic facts are stored solely in the lower layers, without having separate copies across different regions as in the circuit for composition. This explains why systematicity could happen: OOD facts are now stored and accessed in the same way as IDfacts. Tracking the changes in the model throughout grokking, we observe significantly strengthened causal connections from \(S[7,a]\) and \(S[5,e_{1}]\) to the final prediction (Figure 5(b)). We also find that throughout grokking, \(S[7,a]\) always encodes the label space and \(S[5,e_{1}],S[5,e_{2}]\) gradually encode the two attribute values (Figure 5(c)). This confirms that a similar transition from \(C_{mem}\) to \(C_{gen}\) happens during grokking.

The findings here showcase transformer's ability to learn parallel solutions to seemingly sequential problems, akin to the findings in Liu et al. [30] where it is shown that transformers can learn "shortcuts" to automata. The difference in the acquired generalization across the two tasks that we study also emphasizes the need for _controlled and mechanistic_ study on understanding the transformer's reasoning before making general claims on its limitations.

## 5 The Power of Parametric Memory for Complex Reasoning

At the high level, our study so far paves the way towards better understanding and improving transformer's reasoning with _parametric_ representation of knowledge and rules. But why is parametric memory practically important? Can we not simply enhance LLMs with non-parametric memory, e.g., by using their long-context modes and/or doing explicit retrieval, to solve the tasks at hand?

We believe parametric memory has its unique capability to perform _deep compression and integration of information_ for complex reasoning. To showcase the potential of parametric memory for complex reasoning, we create a difficult reasoning task with a _large search space_, and show that 1) it is far out of reach even for current SoTA models (e.g., GPT-4-Turbo [43] and Gemini-Pro-1.5 [16]) based on non-parametric memory; 2) a fully grokked transformer can solve the task with near-perfect accuracy.

Our task is a variation of the comparison task above where we use a simple way to massively expand the search space, based on an additional set of rules that are already contained within the task itself, namely, the _(anti-)symmetry_ and _transitivity_ of comparison:

\[\begin{split}&\forall e_{1},e_{2}\in\mathcal{E},\forall a\in \mathcal{A},(a,e_{1},e_{2},a_{<}/a_{=}/a_{>})\implies(a,e_{2},e_{1},a_{>}/a_{ =}/a_{<}),\\ &\forall e_{1},e_{2},e_{3}\in\mathcal{E},\forall a\in\mathcal{A},\forall y\in\{a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\},(a,e_{1},e_{2},y)\wedge(a,e_{2},e_{3},y) \implies(a,e_{1},e_{3},y).\end{split} \tag{3}\]

In the original setting (SS4) the task, for the OOD test set, one can simply retrieve the two OOD facts and compare the attribute values, which requires no further search. We change the task setting via the following. For each attribute, 1) we do _not_ add the OOD atomic facts into training, and 2) we add a random portion of the comparisons between ID entities and OOD entities into training. We test the models on queries consisting of _derivable_ (from all training facts) comparisons between OOD entities where any possible proof would involve rules from _both_ Eqs.(2) and Eqs.(3). Consequently, answering a test query would require the model to successfully _locate two ID bridge entities_ which can connect the two query entities into a proof (Figure 6). We select a balanced (by \(a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\)) subset from these queries for evaluation. More details are included in Appendix F.

The difficulty of such a task is two-fold. First, the search space is large. For example, on average, each query entity connects with more than \(50\) facts, and each bridge entity in the ground truth proof

Figure 5: The (evolution of) generalizing circuit for comparison. (a) The generalizing circuit. (b) The _change_ in causal strengths during grokking, where the target is the prediction state. (c) Mean reciprocal rank (via logit lens) of the two attribute values (\(v_{1},v_{2}\)) at \(S[5,e_{1}]\) and \(S[5,e_{2}]\).

connects with more than \(900\) facts. Second, there are _no surface form clues_ to exploit and bias the search towards the ground truth proof, unlike most conventional QA benchmarks where the proof steps are transparent from the query.

To test LLMs based on non-parametric memory, we translate the facts into natural language by simple templates (Appendix F). Facts/queries for each attribute are grouped/tested separately.10 We test both the vanilla setup where all facts (\(28.2\)K on average) are loaded into the LLM context, and the retrieval-augmented setup (\(5.4\)K facts retrieved on average) where the two-hop neighborhoods of the two query entities are retrieved, which includes enough facts to deduce the answer. We also try both standard prompting where the model answers directly, and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting where the model is prompted to verbalize the reasoning. We test GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-Pro-1.5, where for GPT-4-Turbo we only test the retrieval-augmented setup due to context length limit.

Footnote 10: This could also be thought of as performing a retrieval step into the memory based on the attribute.

**Results**. As shown in Table 1, all models based on non-parametric memory fail badly, where the only setting that surpasses random guess (\(33.3\)%) is the retrieval-augmented setting with Gemini-Pro-1.5 and direct answer prediction. Intriguingly, LLMs perform worse (especially Gemini) when prompted to reason verbally. Through closer examinations, we find that with CoT, \(70.7\)% of Gemini's responses conclude that the answer cannot be decided (which we treat as wrong since the answer can be decided) after a series of search steps.11 More shockingly, _most of the CoT rationales that achieve the correct final answer are actually wrong due to either hallucinating undesirable facts or logical errors_. This illustrates the current models' inability to reason deeply with non-parametric memory. On the other hand, a grokked transformer, which is trained extensively on the given facts to compress and integrate the information to the extreme, could achieve near-perfect accuracy. By examining the model, we find that it acquires the same generalizing circuit as in Figure 5(a), and remarkably, even though not explicitly encouraged/trained to do this, the model successfully infers most of the OOD entities' attribute values by integrating the observed training facts (Appendix F).

Footnote 11: The ratio drops a bit to \(58.7\)% when augmenting with retrieval.

## 6 Related Work

**Knowledge and reasoning in language models**. Numerous work finds that transformer language models, even SoTA ones such as GPT-4, struggle in implicit reasoning over their parametric knowledge [56, 23, 52, 51, 48, 1, 71], suggesting their limitations in inducing structured and compressed representations of facts and rules during training. A series of efforts try to understand transformer's knowledge and reasoning through controlled experiments [24, 49, 10, 66], which is also our focus. We

find that transformers can learn implicit reasoning over knowledge through grokking, and characterize the connection between the acquired systematicity level and the inductive bias of transformer.

**"Chain-of-Thought" and verbalized reasoning**. A series of studies prompt/fine-tune language models to verbalize (i.e., generate) the intermediate knowledge and reasoning steps [67, 64, 73, 55, 31, 72] during inference, which has been shown to improve performance especially for large models with strong generation capabilities. There are also theoretical results showing the benefits of such verbalizations [11, 27]. Our focus here on implicit reasoning is orthogonal, and it is an interesting open problem to have principled understandings of the role of such verbalizations in reasoning problems, and also develop methods that can decide the appropriate balance between implicit and explicit reasoning to handle challenging problems with large intrinsic complexity. Relatedly, recent work also finds that explicit verbalizations could be a useful medium for teaching models to reason implicitly via distillation or curriculum [9, 8].

**Grokking** is first discovered by Power et al. [47] on a set of small algorithmic reasoning tasks. The intriguing phenomenon inspired follow-up works proposing different explanations and expanding the set of tasks where grokking is observed [59, 32, 6, 41, 39, 61, 36, 38, 33, 78, 21]. To our knowledge, we are the first work to observe grokking in the domain of knowledge-based reasoning, and our controlled experiments suggest potential corrections of prior hypotheses based on critical data size. Our formulation of rule induction from atomic and inferred facts is general, which we hope could inspire future work on understanding grokking and generalization in deep learning.

**Analyzing the inner workings of neural models**. Recent work tries to open up the "black box" of neural models through a wide range of techniques; see survey in Ferrando et al. [13]. We apply causal tracing [63, 35, 19, 65, 12] and logit lens [40, 15, 71] to discover interpretable circuits in the model to understand the grokking process and how/why generalization happens.

**Parametric and non-parametric memory**. Our focus in this work is on parametric memory in language models, and an orthogonal direction is to enhance models with non-parametric memory, such as extending the effective context length [70, 43, 14, 16] and augmenting with retrieval [18, 26, 3, 58, 75, 37]. The two types of memory are largely complementary to each other--parametric memory has its unique ability to compress and integrate information but is also inevitably lossy and subject to hallucination, while non-parametric memory is lossless and could also provide attribution. Similarly for humans--a human acquires expertise in a domain by acquiring and structuring knowledge in the brain (parametric), but he/she also wouldn't memorize all pieces of details and could refer to the source when necessary (non-parametric). How to decide the tradeoff between parametric and non-parametric memory (or, how to define the objective for such a tradeoff) is another interesting open problem for future work.

## 7 Conclusion

We find that transformers are capable of learning to implicitly reason over parametric knowledge, however, such a skill is only robustly acquired through extended training far beyond the point of overfitting, or _grokking_. Mechanistic analysis into the model's internals reveals the configuration and gradual formation of the generalizing circuit, and also explains the different levels of systematicity the model acquires across tasks. These findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning, and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture to further unlock its generalization. We conclude by showcasing the unique power of parametric memory on a challenging reasoning task with a large search space.

## Limitations

**Scope of our task formulation**. As mentioned in SS1, we formulate the implicit reasoning problem as induction and application of inference rules from a mixture of atomic and inferred facts. This may not apply to the full spectrum of reasoning which has a range of different types and meanings [20]. Still, our formulation could capture the nature of a wide range of reasoning problems, and crucially, we believe that it is a good conceptualization of certain aspects of language model (pre-)training, where the model needs to both memorize the "atomic" world knowledge and also induce generalizable rules from the massive amount of records of human activities, which allow the model to connect and reason over knowledge, and ultimately help with humans.

**Abstract nature and connection with practice**. Our study has an abstract nature, which is required for the complete solidity and rigor of our experiments and evaluation. We also strive to make sure that the results are robust to different setups closer to practice through additional experiments (Appendix B,C,E). Still, there are certain distances from our settings to those in practice. However, we believe that it is far more important to build solid understandings, even having distances with practice, than to draw conclusions or make claims that are closer to practice but questionable due to insufficient control over data and evaluations.

Training Details

All implementations were done with PyTorch [45] and Huggingface Transformers [68]. All model training runs are done on NVIDIA A6000 and A100 GPUs and last \(96\) hours at maximum.

## Appendix B Effect of Model Scale

We run the experiments on composition with larger model scales with \(|\mathcal{E}|=2000\) and \(\phi\in\{5.4,9.0,18.0\}\). The results are shown in Figure 7. Overall, it could be seen that scaling up the model won't qualitatively change the model's generalization behaviors, and the main pattern is that larger models converge in fewer optimization steps, which shares with prior findings [60, 28].

## Appendix C Effect of Tokenizations

In the experiments in our main content, tokenization is done by having a unique token for each entity.12 This is different from how real-world entities are typically tokenized--in practice, entities are usually multi-token, and different entities could share tokens at different positions. We investigate

the effect of tokenizations on the composition task by having two tokens for each entity (resembling the first name and last name of a person) in the setting with \(|\mathcal{E}|=2000\) and \(\phi=12.6\). We generate a set of unique first names and a set of unique last names with equal size from which the two tokens for each entity are randomly chosen (we make sure each entity gets a unique ordered pair of tokens). We define _token multiplicity_ to be the number of entities that share the same first/last name. For example, when the size of the set of first/last names is \(50\), the token multiplicity would be \(2000/50=40\).

Figure 8(a) shows the ID test results, where the training and OOD results are the same from earlier (training performance saturates quickly, OOD result remains zero). It can be seen that a larger token multiplicity would delay the generalization, which is expected to a certain degree since the scale of the model is effectively smaller due to having fewer tokens in the vocabulary. Nevertheless, ID generalization always happens. We also run linear probing on \(S[5,r_{1}]\) throughout training to predict the second token of the bridge entity \(b\) in the setting with token multiplicity \(40\),13, where the results are shown in Figure 8(b). It can be seen that the second token of \(b\) can be perfectly decoded from \(S[5,r_{1}]\) after grokking, and the decodability improves throughout grokking. This suggests that for the multi-token case, the model is additionally storing the second token of \(b\) into \(S[5,r_{1}]\) throughout grokking, which may be another factor that further delays the speed of grokking. These results also share with recent findings that in many cases, tokens beyond the immediate next token are linearly encoded in the hidden states [69, 44, 2, 4].

Footnote 13: Recall that \(S[5,r_{1}]\) is the state that encodes the bridge entity in the generalizing circuit (Figure 4(a))

In summary, different tokenizations affect the results in rather expected ways, and do not influence our main findings and conclusions.

## Appendix D More Details on Circuit Analysis

### Composition

We run causal tracing on hidden states in layer \(1\)-\(7\) and every position, where the target is the final prediction state \(S[8,r_{2}]\). The changes in the strengths are monotone and smooth, and we show in Figure 9 the strengths for the model checkpoint at the start and end of grokking, and also their difference (same as Figure 4(b)). We also find that after grokking, the state \(S[5,r_{2}]\) (which encodes \(r_{2}\)) is not affected by perturbing the input \(h\) or \(r_{1}\).

**Deriving the generalizing circuit**. Starting from the \(9\) states in layers \(0,5,8\) we can directly eliminate \(S[8,h]\) and \(S[8,r_{1}]\) since they have no computational paths connecting to \(S[8,r_{2}]\). \(S[5,h]\) can be eliminated as could be seen by Figure 9(c). The connections from \(S[0,h]\) and \(S[0,r_{1}]\) to \(S[5,r_{2}]\) could be eliminated as mentioned earlier.

Figure 8: (a) ID generalization across different token multiplicity. (b) Probing accuracy on the second token of \(b\) at \(S[5,r_{1}]\).

### Comparison

Figure 10 includes the causal tracing results where the target is the prediction state \(S[8,e_{2}]\), and Figure 11 includes the results with the target state \(S[5,e_{2}]\). It can be seen that after grokking, \(S[5,e_{2}]\) does not depend on \(e_{1}\), which gives the generalization circuit in Figure 5(a).

Figure 12 shows the rank (via logit lens) of the three relations \(\{a_{<},a_{=},a_{>}\}\) in the label space at state \(S[7,a]\), where we use Recall@3 as the measure. It can be seen that \(S[7,a]\) encodes the label space throughout grokking.

## Appendix E Additional Results

### Weight decay

Figure 13 shows the ID generalization performance when varying the degree of weight decay (\(|\mathcal{E}|=2000\) and \(\phi=9.0\)). It can be seen that a larger weight decay can improve the speed of grokking, and vice versa.

Figure 9: Causal strengths on composition task, with the final prediction \(S[8,r_{2}]\) as the target. (a) Start of grokking. (b) Change during grokking. (c) End of grokking.

### Transformer with parameter sharing

We share the parameters of the first \(4\) layers and the last \(4\) layers, similar as in Universal Transformer [7]. This would allow the model to share the knowledge in the upper and lower layers. The results on the setting with \(|\mathcal{E}|=2000\) and \(\phi=12.6\) are shown in Figure 14. It could be seen that the parameter-sharing scheme can unlock OOD generalization, even though it is gained much more slowly than ID generalization during grokking.

### Comparison task across different inferred/atomic ratio

Figure 15 includes the result for \(\phi\in\{3.6,7.2,9.0,12.6\}\) for the comparison task. It can be seen that a higher ratio \(\phi\) would give a higher generalization speed, consistent with the results in the composition task.

## Appendix F Complex Reasoning Task

For the complex reasoning task, for each attribute, we include \(3\)% random facts from the comparisons between ID and OOD entities and the comparisons between ID and ID entities. In total, the training set contains \(18\)K ID atomic facts, \(437\)K (ID, ID) comparisons, and \(108\)K (ID, OOD) comparisons, altogether \(563\)K facts (\(28\)K on average for each attribute). For translating the facts into natural

language for testing LLMs with non-parametric memory, we always use the attribute _age14_ (we find that the choice of attribute does not exhibit notable impact) and the templates "The age of {entity} is {attribute value}." and "{entity 1} is { younger than/older than/in the same age as} {entity 2}." for atomic facts and comparisons. The entities are mapped to distinct random names generated by a random generator.15 We also try different mappings (e.g., unique IDs) and templates, and find the results to be consistent. All (retrieved) facts are randomly permuted and concatenated before being loaded into the LLM context.

Footnote 14: Recall that we test each attribute separately by grouping the facts/queries.

Footnote 15: [https://pypi.org/project/names/](https://pypi.org/project/names/)

The train/test accuracy, and also the accuracy of inferring the attribute values of the query entities (which we test using the same format as the atomic facts in training) are included in Figure 16. It could be seen that, during grokking, the model gradually locates the ground truth attribute values of the query entities (note that the model is not explicitly encouraged or trained to do this), allowing the model to solve the problem efficiently with near-perfect accuracy.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the findings and claims that we make are based on evidence from a set of controlled experiments, as presented in the different main sections SS3,4,5. We also strive to make sure that the results are robust to alternative setups through additional experiments included in Appendix B,C,E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings.

Figure 15: Results for the comparison task across different ratio \(\phi\).

* It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have discussed the potential limitations of our work in Appendix 7. We do not include it in the main content for the submission due to space limits, and will add it to the main content in the final version (if the paper is accepted). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not include theoretical results in this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility**Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide full details on our data, model and training configurations, and evaluation setup in SS2,3,4,5 and the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general, releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have released the data and code with sufficient documentations alongside the release. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). ** The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide full details on our data, model and training configurations, and evaluation setup in SS2,3,4,5 and the Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: All of our experimental results are obtained with specified random seeds for reproducibility. We do not perform extensive additional re-runs of the experiments, however, we find preliminarily that the results are very robust to randomness in the setup. In addition, our results exhibit strong patterns from controlled variations in the parameter settings, which we believe is a side-proof that the results are statistically significant. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).

* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide details on computing resources in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: We believe our research conforms with the Code of Ethics in every respect. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [No] Justification: Our research is at the foundational level which is not tied to particular applications or deployments, and hence we believe there are no negative societal impacts. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.

* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We believe our work poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have credited the original creators of assets such as the code framework in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes]Justification: We have documented our assets alongside the release. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work is not involved with such subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work is not involved with such subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
