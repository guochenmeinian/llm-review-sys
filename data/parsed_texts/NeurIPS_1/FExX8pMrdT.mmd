###### Abstract

This paper introduces AutoSurvey, a speedy and well-organized methodology for automating the creation of comprehensive literature surveys in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence. Traditional survey paper creation faces challenges due to the vast volume and complexity of information, prompting the need for efficient survey methods. While large language models (LLMs) offer promise in automating this process, challenges such as context window limitations, parametric knowledge constraints, and the lack of evaluation benchmarks remain. AutoSurvey addresses these challenges through a systematic approach that involves initial retrieval and outline generation, subsection drafting by specialized LLMs, integration and refinement, and rigorous evaluation and iteration. Our contributions include a comprehensive solution to the survey problem, a reliable evaluation method, and experimental validation demonstrating AutoSurvey's effectiveness.

## 1 Introduction

Survey papers provide essential academic resources, offering comprehensive overviews of recent research developments, highlighting ongoing trends, and identifying future directions [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, crafting these surveys is increasingly challenging, especially in the fast-paced domain of Artificial Intelligence including large language models(LLMs) [5, 6, 7, 8]. Figure 0(a) illustrates a significant trend: in just the first four months of 2024 alone, over 4,000 papers containing the phrase "Large Language Model" in their titles or abstracts were submitted to arXiv. This surge highlights a critical academic issue: the rapid accumulation of new information often outpaces the capacity for comprehensive scholarly review and synthesis, emphasizing the growing need for more efficient methods to synthesize the expanding literature. Moreover, as depicted in Figure 0(b), while the number of survey papers has rapidly increased, the growing difficulty of producing traditional human-authored survey papers--due to the sheer volume and complexity of data--remains a significant challenge. This challenge is evidenced by the lack of comprehensive surveys in many fields (Figure 0(c)), which hinders knowledge transfer and makes it difficult for new researchers to efficiently navigate the vast amount of available information.

The advent of LLMs [7, 9] presents a promising avenue for addressing these challenges. These models, trained on extensive text corpora, demonstrate remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human-like text, even in long-context scenarios [10, 11, 12]. Despite these advancements, the practical application of LLMs to survey generation is fraught with challenges. Firstly, **contextwindow limitations**: LLMs encounter inherent restrictions in output length due to limited processing windows [13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. While several advanced large models, including GPT-4 and Claude 3, support inputs exceeding 100k tokens, their output is still limited to fewer than 8k tokens (the output length of GPT-4 is 8k, and the output length of Claude 3 is 4k). Writing a comprehensive survey typically requires reading hundreds of papers, resulting in input sizes far beyond the capacity of even the most advanced models. Moreover, a well-written survey itself spans tens of thousands of tokens, making it highly challenging to generate such extensive content directly with large models. Secondly, **parametric knowledge constraints**: Sole reliance on an LLM's internal knowledge is insufficient for producing surveys that require comprehensive and accurate references [18, 19, 20]. LLMs may generate content based on inaccuracies or even non-existent "hallucinated" references. Moreover, these models cannot incorporate the latest studies not included in their training data, which limits the breadth and depth of the surveys they generate. Thirdly, **the lack of evaluation benchmark:** after production, reliable metrics to evaluate the quality of outputs from LLMs are lacking. Relying on human review for quality assessment is not only resource-intensive but also lacks scalability [21, 22, 23]. This presents a significant obstacle to the widespread adoption of LLMs for academic synthesis, where rigorous standards of accuracy and reliability are paramount.

In response to these challenges, we introduce AutoSurvey: a speedy and well-organized methodology for conducting comprehensive literature surveys. Specifically, AutoSurvey's primary innovations include: **logical parallel generation**: AutoSurvey employs a two-stage generation approach to parallelly generate survey content efficiently. Initially, multiple LLMs work concurrently to create detailed outlines. A final, comprehensive outline is then synthesized from these individual outlines, setting a clear framework for content development. Subsequently, each subsection of the survey is generated in parallel and guided by the outline, which significantly accelerates the process. To overcome potential transition and consistency issues due to segmented generation phases, AutoSurvey integrates a systematic revision phase. After the initial parallel generation, each section undergoes thorough revision and polishing, ensuring smooth transitions and enhanced overall document consistency. The sections are then seamlessly merged to produce a cohesive and well-organized final document. **Real-time knowledge update**: AutoSurvey incorporates a Real-time Knowledge Update mechanism using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach [24, 25, 26]. This feature ensures that every aspect of the survey reflects the most current studies. When a survey topic is input by the user,

Figure 1: Depicting growth trends from 2019 to 2024 in the number of LLMs-related papers (a) and surveys (b) on arXiv, accompanied by a T-SNE visualization. The data for 2024 is up to April, with a red bar representing the forecasted numbers for the entire year. While the number of surveys is increasing rapidly, the visualization reveals areas where comprehensive surveys are still lacking, despite the overall growth in survey numbers. The research topics of the clusters in the T-SNE plot are generated using GPT-4 to describe their primary focus areas. **These clusters of research voids can be addressed using AutoSurvey at a cost of $1.2 (cost analysis in Appendix D) and 3 minutes per survey. An example survey focused on Emotion Recognition using LLMs is in Appendix F.**

AutoSurvey leverages the RAG system to retrieve the latest relevant papers, forming the basis for generating a structured and informed outline. During subsection writing, the system dynamically pulls in new research articles relevant to the specific content under development. This approach ensures that citations are current and the survey content is aligned with the latest developments in the field, significantly enhancing the accuracy and depth of the literature review. **Multi-LLM-as-judge evaluation**: AutoSurvey employs the Multi-LLM-as-Judge strategy, leveraging the LLM-as-Judge method for text evaluation [22; 21; 23]. This approach generates initial evaluation metrics using multiple large language models, which process a substantial corpus of high-quality surveys. These metrics are refined by human experts to ensure precision and adherence to academic standards. The Multi-LLM-as-Judge method assesses generated content across two main dimensions: (1) Citation Quality, verifying the accuracy and reliability of the information presented, with sub-indicators for Recall and Precision. (2) Content Quality, consisting of Coverage (assessing the extent of topic encapsulation), Structure (evaluating logical organization and coherence), and Relevance (ensuring alignment with the main topic). By utilizing multiple LLMs, this strategy minimizes bias and ensures a balanced and comprehensive assessment, upholding rigorous academic standards.

Extensive experimental results across different survey lengths (8k, 16k, 32k, and 64k tokens) demonstrate that AutoSurvey consistently achieves high citation and content quality scores. At 64k tokens, AutoSurvey achieves 82.25% recall and 77.41% precision in citation quality, outperforming naive RAG-based LLMs (68.79% recall and 61.97% precision) and approaching human performance (86.33% recall and 77.78% precision). In content quality at 64k tokens, AutoSurvey scores 4.73 in coverage, 4.33 in structure, and 4.86 in relevance, closely aligning with human performance (5.00, 4.66, and 5.00 respectively). At shorter lengths (8k, 16k, and 32k tokens), AutoSurvey also maintains strong performance across all metrics. Furthermore, the Spearman's rho values indicate a moderate positive correlation between the rankings provided by the LLMs and those given by human experts. The mixture of models achieves the highest correlation at 0.5429, indicating a strong alignment with human preferences. These results reinforce the effectiveness of our multi-LLM scoring mechanism, providing a reliable proxy for human judgment across varying survey lengths.

In conclusion, to the best of our knowledge, AutoSurvey is the first system to explore the potential of large model agents in writing extensive academic surveys. It proposes evaluation criteria for surveys that align with human preferences, providing a valuable reference for future related research.

## 2 Methodology

In this section, we describe the methodology employed by AutoSurvey to automate the creation of comprehensive literature surveys. Our approach systematically progresses through four distinct phases--Initial Retrieval and Outline Generation, Subsection Drafting, Integration and Refinement,

Figure 2: The AutoSurvey Pipeline for Generating Comprehensive Surveys.

and Rigorous Evaluation and Iteration. Each phase is meticulously designed to address specific challenges associated with survey creation, thereby enhancing the efficiency and quality of the resulting survey document. The pseudo code of AutoSurvey can be found at Algorithm 1.

```

**Algorithm 1** AutoSurvey: Automated Survey Creation Using LLMs.

Initial Retrieval and Outline GenerationThe process begins with the Initial Retrieval and Outline Generation phase. Utilizing an embedding-based retrieval technique, AutoSurvey scans a database of publications to identify papers most pertinent to the specified survey topic \(T\). This phase is crucial for ensuring that the survey is grounded in the most relevant and recent research. The retrieved publications \(P_{\text{init}}\) are then used to generate a structured outline \(O\), which ensures comprehensive coverage of the topic and logical structuring of the survey. To provide more detailed guidance for writing subsections, the outline generation includes not only titles for each subsection but also brief descriptions. These descriptions convey the main idea of each subsection, aiding in the overall clarity and direction of the survey. Given the extensive amount of relevant papers extracted during this stage, the total length of \(P_{\text{init}}\) often exceeds the context window size of the LLM. To address this, papers are randomly divided according to the LLM's context window size, resulting in the creation of multiple outlines. The model then consolidates these outlines to form the final comprehensive outline. Finally, the outline \(O\) of the entire survey is represented as \(O=\text{Outline}(T,P_{\text{init}})\).

Subsection DraftingWith the structured outline in place, the Subsection Drafting phase commences. During this phase, specialized LLMs draft each section of the outline in parallel. This method not only accelerates the drafting process but also ensures detailed and focused content generation for each survey section, adhering to the thematic boundaries established by the outline. When writing the content of each subsection, the sub-outline \(O_{i}\) of that subsection will be used to retrieve the necessary relevant reference papers \(P_{\text{sec}}\) to provide information that aligns more closely with the main idea of the subsection. During the writing process, the model is required to cite the provided reference papers to support the generated content. The references in the generated content will be extracted and mapped to the corresponding arXiv papers (see Appendix B for details). The \(i_{th}\) subsection \(S_{i}\) can be expressed as: \(S_{i}=\text{Draft}(O_{i},P_{\text{sec}})\).

Integration and RefinementFollowing the drafting phase, each section \(S_{i}\) is individually refined to enhance readability, eliminate redundancies, and ensure a seamless narrative. The refined sections \(R_{i}\) are then merged into a cohesive document \(F\), which is essential for maintaining a logical flow and coherence throughout the survey. During the refinement process, the model needs to polish each subsection based on the local context (considering the previous and following subsections) to improve readability, eliminate redundancies, and enhance coherency. Additionally, the model is required to check the correctness of the cited references in the content and correct any errors in the citations. This procedure can be represented by: \(F=\text{Merge}(R_{1},R_{2},\ldots,R_{n}),\) where \(R_{i}=\text{Refine}(S_{i})\).

Rigorous Evaluation and IterationThe final phase involves a rigorous evaluation and iteration process, where the survey document is assessed through a Multi-LLM-as-Judge strategy. This evaluation critically examines the survey in several aspects. The insights gained from this evaluation are used to guide further refinements, ensuring the survey meets the highest academic standards. The best survey is chosen from \(N\) candidates. The final output of AutoSurvey is \(F_{\text{best}}=\text{Evaluate}(\{F_{1},F_{2},\ldots,F_{N}\})\).

The methodology outlined here--from initial data retrieval to sophisticated multi-faceted evaluation--ensures that AutoSurvey effectively addresses the complexities of survey creation in evolving research fields using advanced LLM technologies.

## 3 Experiments

SetupWe conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance of AutoSurvey, comparing it against traditional methods for generating survey papers. For the drafting phase of AutoSurvey, we utilize Claude-3-Haiku, known for its speed and cost-effectiveness, capable of handling 200K tokens. For evaluations, we employ a combination of GPT-4, Claude-3-Haiku, and Gemini-1.5-Pro3. The evaluation covers the following key performance metrics:

Footnote 3: Specifically, we use gpt-4-0125-preview, Claude-3-haiku-20240307 and Gemini-1.5-pro-preview.

* **Survey Creation Speed**: To estimate the time it takes for humans to write a document, we use a mathematical model with the following parameters: \(L\) (the length of the document), \(E\) (the number of experts), \(M\) (the writing speed of each expert), \(T_{r}\) (the preparation time for research and data collection), \(T_{w}\) (the actual writing time, \(T_{w}=\frac{L}{E\times M}\)), and \(T_{e}\) (the editing and revision time, \(T_{e}=\frac{1}{2}T_{w}\)). Assuming an ideal situation where \(E=10\), \(M=2000\) tokens/hour, \(T_{r}=5\) hours, and \(T_{e}=\frac{1}{2}T_{w}\), the total time \(Time\) is calculated as: \[Time=T_{r}+T_{w}+T_{e}=T_{r}+\frac{L}{E\times M}+\frac{1}{2}\times\frac{L}{E \times M}.\] (1) For Naive RAG and AutoSurvey, we count all the time of API calls. The speed is calculated as \(Speed=\frac{1}{Time(\text{bours})}\).
* **Citation Quality**: Adopted from [27], this metric assesses the accuracy and relevance of citations in the survey. Assuming a set of claims \(C=\{c_{1},c_{2},\ldots\}\) extracted from the survey, the metric utilizes an NLI model \(h\) to decide whether a claim \(c_{i}\) is supported by its references \(\text{Ref}_{i}=\{r_{i_{1}},r_{i_{2}},\ldots\}\), where each \(r_{i_{k}}\) represents one paper cited. \(h(c_{i},\text{Ref}_{i})=1\) means that the references can support the claim, and \(h(c_{i},\text{Ref}_{i})=0\) otherwise. Refer to Appendix C for more details. Citation quality encompasses two sub-metrics:
* **Citation Recall**: Measures whether all statements in the generated text are fully supported by the cited passages, which is calculated as \[\text{Recall}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C|}h(c_{i},\text{Ref}_{i})}{|C|}.\] (2)
* **Citation Precision**: Identifies irrelevant citations, ensuring that the provided citations are pertinent and directly support the statements. Before listing the formula for precision, a function \(g\) is defined as \(g(c_{i},r_{i_{k}})=(h(c_{i},\{r_{i_{k}}\})=1)\cup(h(c_{i},\text{Ref}_{i}\setminus \{r_{i_{k}}\})=0)\), which measures whether the paper \(r_{i_{k}}\) is related to the claim \(c_{i}\). The precision is \[\text{Precision}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{|C|}\sum_{k=1}^{|\text{Ref}_{i}|}h(c_{i}, \text{Ref}_{i})\cap g(c_{i},r_{i_{k}})}{\sum_{i=1}^{|C|}|\text{Ref}_{i}|}.\] (3)
* **Content Quality**: An overarching metric evaluating the excellence of the written survey, encompassing three sub-indicators. Each sub-indicator is judged by LLMs according to a 5-point rubric, calibrated by human experts to meet academic standards. Note that the detailed scoring criteria are provided in Table 1.
* **Coverage**: Assesses the extent to which the survey encapsulates all aspects of the topic.
* **Structure**: Evaluates the logical organization and coherence of each section.
* **Relevance**: Measures how well the content aligns with the research topic.
BaselinesWe compare AutoSurvey with surveys authored by human experts (collected from Arxiv) and naive RAG across 20 different computer science topics across 20 different topics in the field of LLMs (see Table 7). For the naive RAG, we begin with a title and a survey length requirement, then iteratively prompt the model to write the content until completion. Note that we also provide the model with the same number of reference papers with AutoSurvey. To make a more comprehensive comparison, we additionally introduced two baselines: RAG+Reflection, which involves reflecting the generated survey content from RAG, and RAG+Query Rewriting, where the LLM reformulates the retrieval query based on the topic.

For AutoSurvey, we utilize a corpus of 530,000 computer science papers from arXiv as the retrieval database. During the initial drafting stage, we retrieve 1200 papers relevant to the given topic and split them into several chunks with a window size of 30,000 tokens. The model generates an outline for each chunk and merges these outlines into a final comprehensive outline, using only the abstracts of the papers at this stage. The outline predetermines the number of sections as 8. For subsection drafting, the models generate specific sections using the outline and 60 papers retrieved based on the subsection descriptions, focusing on the main body of each paper (up to the first 1,500 tokens). During the reflection and polishing stage, the same reference papers are provided to the model to ensure consistency and accuracy. The iteration number N is set to 2. Note that human writing surveys used for evaluation are excluded during the retrieval process. For more details of implementations, see Appendix B, and the prompts are presented in Appendix F.

Table 2: Results of Naive RAG, Human writing and AutoSurvey. Both of AutoSurvey and Naive RAG use Claude-haiku as the writer. **Note that human writing surveys used for evaluation are excluded during the retrieval process.**Main ResultsThe results of our experiments comparing human writing, Naive RAG, and AutoSurvey for generating academic surveys are summarized in Table 2. The key findings are:

* _AutoSurvey significantly outperforms both human writing and Naive RAG in terms of speed._ For instance, AutoSurvey achieves a speed of 73.59 surveys per hour for a 64k-token survey, compared to 0.07 for human writing and 12.56 for Naive RAG, highlighting the larger gap in speed for longer context generation.
* _AutoSurvey demonstrates superior citation quality compared to other baselines, with performance close to human writing._ For an 8k-token survey, AutoSurvey achieves citation recall and precision scores of 82.48 and 77.42, respectively, surpassing Naive RAG (78.14 recall, 71.92 precision). While human writing achieves the best performance, ours is close to human's across different lengths. We also observe a significant decline in citation quality for other baselines as the survey length increased, whereas AutoSurvey maintains stable performance. We investigate this phenomenon in our ablation study.
* _AutoSurvey excels in content quality, scoring 4.60 on average for a 16k-token survey._ It achieves 4.66 for coverage, 4.33 for structure, and 4.86 for relevance, matching human writing and surpassing Naive RAG.

The experiments indicate that AutoSurvey provides a balanced trade-off between quality and efficiency. It achieves near-human levels of coverage, relevance, and citation quality while maintaining a significantly lower time cost. While human writing still leads in structure and overall quality, the efficiency and performance of AutoSurvey make it a compelling alternative for generating academic surveys. Naive RAG-based LLM, though effective, falls short in several key areas compared to both human writing and AutoSurvey, making it the least preferred method among the three for generating high-quality academic surveys, particularly in terms of structure, due to the lack of outline.

Meta EvaluationTo verify the consistency between our evaluation method and human evaluation, we conduct a meta-evaluation involving human experts and our automated evaluation system. Human experts judge pairs of generated surveys to determine which one is superior. This process, referred to as a "which one is better" game, serves as the golden standard for evaluation. We compare the judgments made by our evaluation method against those made by human experts. Specifically, we provide the experts with the same scoring criteria used in our evaluation for reference. The experts rank the generated 20 surveys, and we compare these rankings with those generated by LLM using Spearman's rank correlation coefficient to measure consistency between human and LLM evaluations.

The results of this meta-evaluation are presented in Figure 3. The table shows the Spearman's rho values, indicating the degree of correlation between the rankings given by each LLM and the human experts. The Spearman's rho values indicate a moderate positive correlation between the rankings provided by the LLMs and those given by the human experts, with the mixture of models achieving the highest correlation at 0.5429. These results suggest that our evaluation method aligns well with human preferences, providing a reliable proxy for human judgment.

Ablation studyTo assess the impact of various components on the performance of AutoSurvey, we conduct an ablation study by systematically removing key components: the retrieval mechanism, the reflection phase, and iterations. Additionally, we evaluate the influence of using different base LLMs to demonstrate that even with a less optimal LLM like Claude-haiku, AutoSurvey's performance remains comparable to human-generated surveys.

Table 3 demonstrates that removing the retrieval mechanism significantly degrades citation quality, highlighting its critical role in ensuring accurate and relevant references. The absence of the reflection phase slightly impacts the overall content quality, particularly in structure and coherence.

Figure 3: Spearman’s rho values indicating the degree of correlation between rankings given by LLMs and human experts. _Note that A value over 0.3 indicates a positive correlation and over 0.5 indicates a strong positive correlation._

Table 6 shows the performance of AutoSurvey when using different LLMs as the base writer. The results indicate that all three LLMs (GPT-4, Claude-haiku, and Gemini-1.5-Pro) perform well, with GPT-4 slightly outperforming the others in terms of overall content quality. Importantly, even with the less optimal Claude-haiku, AutoSurvey's performance remains competitive with human standards.

Figure 4 presents the effect of different iteration counts on the performance of AutoSurvey. The results show that increasing the number of iterations from 1 to 5 leads to a slight improvement in overall content quality, with diminishing returns after the second iteration.

To assess whether the generated survey can provide useful information to enrich the knowledge, we created 50 multiple-choice questions about 5 topics. These questions primarily involve knowledge related to literature, such as identifying which paper proposed a particular method. We compared the accuracy of the Claude model under the following conditions: (1) directly chooses the answer without providing any reference materials, (2) has access to a 32k survey generated by naive RAG-based LLMs, (3) has access to a 32k survey generated by AutoSurvey, and (4) can refer to 20 papers (30k tokens in total) retrieved using the options provided (Upper-bound, directly retrieving the answers).

The results are shown in Table 5 and we find providing topic-related materials can effectively improve the accuracy of answers. Providing option-related papers can be considered an upper bound for performance (73.60%). AutoSurvey improves accuracy by 9.2% compared to directly answering and is 2.4% higher than using naive RAG-based LLM-generated surveys. This demonstrates that our method can effectively provide topic knowledge.

As mentioned in the main results, the naive RAG-based generation method demonstrates a notable decline in citation quality as the survey length increases. In contrast, AutoSurvey maintains stable citation quality across varying survey lengths. Such phenomena may be attributed to the streaming generation process, where each step must reference previous content, leading to the accumulation of errors [28]. To validate this, we segment the extracted claims into 20% intervals and calculate the citation recall for each segment. The results in Table 6 indicate that the recall of Naive RAG gradually decreases as the generated text length increases, while AutoSurvey maintains stable performance.

Figure 4: Impact of Iteration on AutoSurvey Performance.

In summary, the ablation study underscores the critical role of the retrieval mechanism and reflection phase in AutoSurvey. Furthermore, the performance is influenced by using different LLMs as the base writer and varying the iteration count. Nevertheless, AutoSurvey consistently performs well across various configurations, showcasing its robustness and efficiency.

User studyTo evaluate the real-world performance of AutoSurvey, we launch a free trial and distribute an anonymous survey to 141 users. The survey primarily assesses user perceptions of generation quality and whether the generated surveys contribute to their practical work. Users are asked to rate the relevance, structure, and usefulness to their actual work of the generated survey on a scale from 1 (poor) to 5 (excellent). A total of 93 valid responses are collected. Results reveal that users generally perceive AutoSurvey as relevant to topic, well structured, and useful, with most ratings skewed towards 4 and 5. Compared to other aspects, the proportion of scores below 5 in the "Structure" is higher, indicating that there remains room for improvement in further refining the structure. We are pleased to observe that the majority of users think the generated surveys beneficial to their practical work, indicating the utility and practical value of AutoSurvey.

## 4 Related Work

Long-form Text GenerationThe ability to effectively process and generate long-form text is a critical challenge for large language models (LLMs) due to the need to maintain coherence and logical flow over extended passages of text [29; 30; 31; 32]. Several works try to address the challenge by directly extending the context window with different Positional Encoding Techniques[33; 34]. However, modifying position encoding strategies requires retraining the model, which is costly. Another solution is using memory-augmented techniques. RecurrentGPT [35] enables the generation of arbitrarily long texts by simulating the recurrence mechanism of RNNs using natural language prompts to store previous contextual information. Temp-Lora [36] enables long text generation by embedding context information into a temporary Lora module updated progressively during generation rather than relying on an extensive context window. These methods effectively establish relationships among tokens and maintain contextual understanding, but still face the issue of long generation times. To further accelerate the generation process, Hierarchical Modeling Techniques have been explored extensively to capture the inherent hierarchical nature of long-form text [37; 38]. Despite such efficiency, it ignores the long dependency of text and may degrade the content quality [39]. To tackle the drawbacks, AutoSurvey, similarly using a Hierarchical generation paradigm, creates a well-organized outline for guidance and refines the generated content to improve the quality.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline Method & 20\% & 40\% & 60\% & 80\% & 100\% \\ \hline Naive RAG & 76.79 & 73.17 & 71.52 & 64.08 & 49.85 \\ AutoSurvey & 82.86 & 84.89 & 79.04 & 82.27 & 82.29 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Automatic WritingDue to the high costs associated with manual writing, automated writing has attracted substantial research interest in recent years. Compared to traditional methods, which primarily focus on training models to generate linguistically coherent text [40; 41], the emergency of large language models (LLMs) has opened up new possibilities for automated writing, drawing more attention to broader aspects like faithfulness, logical structure, style, and ethics [42; 43; 44; 45]. For example, Retrieval-Augmented Generation techniques are useful for generating claims with citations [27; 46]. IRP framework [47] generates expository text by iteratively performing content planning, fact retrieval, and paraphrasing to ensure factuality and stylistic consistency. Several works focus on the outline creation to improve the structure of generated content. PaperRobot [48] incrementally writes key elements to generate a paper abstract. STORM [20] designs a refined outline based on multiple rounds of wiki-page-related Q&A to facilitate wiki-like article generations. These methods have only been explored in shorter texts (<4k). In contrast, Autosurvey shows its effectiveness in generating long content (64k), with a focus on academic reviews.

## 5 Limitation

In addition to directly using recall and precision to evaluate citations, we also perform a manual analysis, providing a more comprehensive view of the citation quality. We examine 100 unsupported claims and their corresponding references and find that the errors mainly fall into three categories: (1) Misalignment, (2) Misinterpretation, and (3) Overgeneralization. Misalignment occurs when the connection between them is incorrectly made, such as an irrelevant citation. Misinterpretation happens when the claim and source are related, but the claim incorrectly represents the information from the source. Overgeneralization occurs when a claim extends the conclusions of the source material to a broader context than is supported. Among the three types of errors, overgeneralization accounts for the largest proportion (51%), indicating that LLMs still rely heavily on their parametric knowledge for writing. Misinterpretation has a small proportion (10%), suggesting that LLMs are capable of understanding the content of the references in most cases, avoiding the creation of claims that significantly deviate from the references.

**Misalignment (39%)**: An example is citing the "General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)" in a context where the referenced paper does not propose GDPR but merely mentions it in the content.

**Misinterpretation (10%)**: An example is claiming that "In-context learning allows LLMs to adapt to new tasks by simply conditioning on a few demonstration examples, without the need for any parameter updates or fine-tuning," based on a paper that focuses on meta-out-of-context learning and mentions the limitations of in-context learning.

**Overgeneralization (51%)**: An example is that "in-context learning can also benefit from advancements in other learning paradigms, such as multi-task learning," based on a paper that discusses multi-task few-shot learning but does not explicitly address its influence on in-context learning.

Among the three types of errors, overgeneralization accounts for the largest proportion (51%), indicating that LLMs still rely heavily on their parametric knowledge for writing. Misinterpretation has a small proportion (10%), suggesting that LLMs are capable of understanding the content of the references in most cases, avoiding the creation of claims that significantly deviate from the references. Additional potential societal impact and ethical considerations are discussed in Appendix E.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce AutoSurvey, a novel methodology leveraging large language models to automate the creation of comprehensive literature surveys. AutoSurvey addresses key challenges such as context window limitations and parametric knowledge constraints through a systematic approach involving initial retrieval, outline generation, parallel subsection drafting, integration, and rigorous evaluation. Our experiments show that AutoSurvey significantly outperforms Naive RAG and matches human performance in content and citation quality, while also being highly efficient. This advancement offers a scalable and effective solution for synthesizing research literature, providing a valuable tool for researchers in rapidly evolving fields like artificial intelligence.

## Appendix A Detail of Topics and Human-writing Surveys

We select 20 surveys from different topics within the LLM field. During the selection process, we prioritize both the breadth of the topics and the citation count (from google scholar) of the surveys. The basic information of surveys are listed in Table 7.

## Appendix B Details of Implementations

We adopt nomic-embed-text-v1.5 [49], a widely used embedding model in RAG applications. To build our database, we store the embeddings of the title and abstract for each paper. Since the context window length is 8k, which is longer than any individual abstract, we embed the raw text directly without chunkings. During generation, related papers are retrieved by the abstract and ranked by their similarity to the query. When generating subsection content, the model needs to write the corresponding paper titles where citations are required. After generation, each title will be embedded as a query and be mapped to the closest paper title in our database. This approach allows the LLMs to use their own parameter knowledge to generate citations without references while ensuring the existence of the generated citations. When calling API, we set temperature = 1 and other parameters as default. Even with the same parameters, the final length of the generated surveys can vary. Therefore, papers with lengths from 8k to 16k are classified into the 8k category, those from 16k to 32k into the 16k category, and so on.

## Appendix C Details of Evaluation

For citation quality, we define a sentence with at least one citation as a claim and extract all the claims from the generated survey. For human evaluations, we invite three PhD students and all of them have experience in writing LLMs-related surveys. We provide them with the same scoring criteria, along with explanations of the specific metrics. They are asked to score based on these criteria, and the final rankings of the generated surveys are determined by the total scores.

Table 7: Survey TableCost Analysis

We present the average number of tokens to generate a 32k-tokens survey, along with the cost of using different LLMs in Table 8.

## Appendix E Societal Impact and Ethical Considerations

By integrating various specialized databases, our approach can generate academic surveys across different fields, potentially filling the gaps in existing reviews. However, as our method relies on the performance of large models, it inevitably contains citation errors. Therefore, the generated survey content is intended for reference only. All personnel involved in the evaluation process participated voluntarily and received ample compensation. All data used in our experiment is sourced from arXiv and is allowed for non-commercial use.

# Comprehensive Survey on Emotion Recognition using Large Language Models
Introduction to Emotion Recognition and Large Language Models  Emotion recognition has been a crucial and active research area in the field of affective computing, which aims to enable machines to understand, interpret, and respond to human emotions [1].  Emotions play a fundamental role in human cognition, decision-  making, and social interaction [2], and the ability to automatically recognize and interpret emotions has a wide range of applications, including healthcare, education, entertainment, and  human-computer interaction [3]. The importance of emotion recognition is evident in various real-world applications. In healthcare, emotion recognition can be used to monitor patient  mental health, provide personalized therapy, and improve doctor-  patient communication [4]. In education, emotion recognition can help identify student engagement and frustration levels, enabling adaptive learning environments that cater to individual needs [5].  In the entertainment industry, emotion recognition can be used to  analyze viewer responses and tailor content to evoke desired  emotional responses [6]. Despite the significant benefits of  emotion recognition, the field faces several challenges that have  hindered its widespread adoption and implementation [7]. One of  the primary challenges is the inherent complexity and subjectivity  of emotions, which can vary across individuals, cultures, and  contexts [8]. Emotions are often expressed through multiple  modalities, including facial expressions, vocal cues, body  language, and physiological signals, and integrating these diverse  sources of information is a significant challenge [9].  Additionally, the availability of high-quality, diverse, and  annotated emotion datasets is a persistent challenge in the field  [10]. Many existing datasets are limited in size, lack diversity,  or have inconsistent or subjective emotion labeling, which can  lead to biases and poor generalization of emotion recognition  models [11]. ...

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] See limitation section Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] No theory in this paperJustification: [NA] Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] All details provided Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] See experiment section Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.

* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We just use apis of LLMs, and their owners have safeguards. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: [NA]

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: [NA] Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our research are not research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
