###### Abstract

Multimodal image fusion and object detection are crucial for autonomous driving. While current methods have advanced the fusion of texture details and semantic information, their complex training processes hinder broader applications. Addressing this challenge, we introduce E2E-MFD, a novel end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection. E2E-MFD streamlines the process, achieving high performance with a single training phase. It employs synchronous joint optimization across components to avoid suboptimal solutions associated to individual tasks. Furthermore, it implements a comprehensive optimization strategy in the gradient matrix for shared parameters, ensuring convergence to an optimal fusion detection configuration. Our extensive testing on multiple public datasets reveals E2E-MFD's superior capabilities, showcasing not only visually appealing image fusion but also impressive detection outcomes, such as a 3.9% and 2.0% mAP\({}_{50}\) increase on horizontal object detection dataset M3FD and oriented object detection dataset DroneVehicle, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

## 1 Introduction

Precise and reliable object parsing is critical in fields such as autonomous driving [1] and remote sensing monitoring [2]. Relying solely on visible sensors can lead to inaccuracies in object recognition in challenging environments, like increment weather conditions. Visible-infrared image fusion [3; 4; 5; 6] as a typical common multimodal fusion (MF) task addresses these challenges by leveraging complementary information from different modalities, leading to the rapid development of various multimodal image fusion techniques [7; 8; 9; 10; 11]. Techniques like CDDFuse [12] and DIDFuse [13] employ a two-step process where a MF network is trained initially, followed by training an object detection (OD) network with the results from the MF network to assess fusion effectiveness separately. Although deep neural networks have significantly enhanced the ability to learn representations across modalities, resulting in promising multimodal fusion outcomes, the focus has predominantly been on producing visually appealing images. This emphasis often overlooks the improvement of downstream high-level visual tasks, such as enhanced object parsing, which remains a substantial hurdle.

Recent studies have devoted into designing joint learning methods that integrate fusion networks with high-level tasks such as object detection [14] and segmentation [15; 16]. The synergy between MF and OD in Multimodal Fusion Detection (MFD) methods has emerged as a vibrant area of research. This partnership allows MF to produce richer, more informative images, enhancing OD performance, while OD contributes valuable object semantic insights to MF, aiming to accurately locate and identify objects in a scene. Typically, MFD networks adopt a cascaded design where jointoptimization techniques [17] use the OD network to guide the MF network toward creating images that facilitate easier object detection. Notably, Zhao _et. al_[18] introduced a joint learning method for multimodal fusion detection, incorporating meta-feature embedding from OD to improve fusion by generating semantic object features through meta-learning simulation. Despite these advancements, as highlighted in Figure 1, significant challenges persist: 1) Current optimization approaches rely on a multi-step, progressively joint method, compromising efficiency; 2) These methods overly focus on leveraging OD information for fusion enhancement, leading to difficulty in parameter balancing and susceptibility to local optima of individual tasks. Therefore, the quest for a unified feature set that simultaneously caters to each task remains formidable.

In this paper, we introduce E2E-MFD, an end-to-end algorithm for multimodal fusion detection, designed to seamlessly blend detailed image fusion and object detection from coarse to fine levels. E2E-MFD facilitates the interaction of intrinsic features from both domains through synchronous joint optimization, allowing for a streamlined, one-stage process. To reconcile fine-grained details with semantic information, we propose the novel concept of an Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree (ORPPT) coupled with a coarse-to-fine diffusion processing (CFDP) mechanism. This approach is inspired by the natural process of visual perception, tailored to meet the specific needs of MF and OD. Furthermore, we introduce a Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment (GMTA) technique to fine-tune the optimization of shared components, thereby minimizing the adverse impacts traditionally associated with inherent optimization challenges. This ensures an efficient convergence towards an optimal set of fusion detection weights, enhancing both the accuracy and efficacy of multimodal fusion detection.

Our contributions in this paper are highlighted as follows: (1) We present E2E-MFD, a pioneering approach to efficient synchronous joint learning, innovatively integrating image fusion and object detection into a single-stage, end-to-end framework. This methodology significantly enhances the outcomes of both tasks. (2) We introduce a novel GMTA technique, designed to evaluate and quantify the impacts of the image fusion and object detection tasks. This aids in optimizing the training process's stability and ensures convergence to an optimal configuration of fusion detection weights. (3) Through comprehensive experimentation on image fusion and object detection, we demonstrate the efficacy and robustness of our proposed method.

### Multimodal Fusion Object Detection

Due to the powerful nonlinear fitting capabilities of deep neural networks, deep learning has made significant progress in low-level vision tasks, particularly in image fusion tasks [19; 20; 7; 21; 22; 23; 24]. Early efforts [9; 25; 13; 26; 27; 28] tended to achieve excellent fusion results by adjusting network structures or loss functions, overlooking the fact that image fusion should aim to improve the performance of downstream application tasks. Fusion images with good quality metrics may be suitable for human visual perception but may not be conducive to practical application tasks [16; 29]. Some research has acknowledged this issue, Yuan _et al_. [30] utilized various aligned modalities for improved oriented object detection [31; 32; 33; 34] to address the challenge of cross-modal weakly misalignment in aerial visible-infrared images. Liu _et al_. [17] proposing a joint learning method,

Figure 1: Comparison of (d) E2E-MFD with existing MF-OD task paradigms (a) Two-Stage (Separate Cascaded), (b) Two-stage (Joint Cascaded) and (c) Multi-stage (Joint Cascaded).

pioneered the exploration of the MF and OD combination methods. Then the optimization of the loss function for segmentation [16] and detection [14] has been validated to be effective in guiding the generation of fused images. They consider the downstream task network as an additional constraint to assist the MF network in generating fusion results with clearer objects. Zhao _et al._[18] leveraged semantic information from OD features to aid MF and perform meta-feature embedding to generate meta-features from OD features, which are then used to guide the MF network in learning pixel-level semantic information. Liu _et al._[15] proposed multi-interactive feature learning architecture for image fusion and segmentation by enhancing fine-grained mapping of all the vital information between two tasks, so that the modality or semantic features can be fully mutual-interactive. However, OD considers the semantic understanding of objects, while MF and segmentation primarily focus on the pixel-level relationship between image pairs. The optimization coupling of detection and fusion tasks becomes more challenging to investigate these complementary differences, from which both fusion and detection can benefit. It is worth mentioning that these visible-infrared multimodal fusion detection methods are usually designed in a cascaded structure with tedious training steps. Researchers lack the adoption of end-to-end architectures, which would enable one-step network inference to generate credible fused images and detection results through a set of network parameters.

### Multi-task Learning

Multi-task learning (MTL) [35; 36] involves the simultaneous learning of multiple tasks through parameter sharing. Prior approaches involve manually crafting the architecture, wherein the bottom layers of a model are shared across tasks [37; 38]. Some approaches tailor the architecture based on task affinity [39], while others utilize techniques such as Neural Architecture Search [40; 37; 41] or routing networks [42] to autonomously discern sharing patterns and determine the architecture. An alternative method typically combines task-specific objectives into a weighted sum [43; 44; 45]. In addition, most approaches (e.g. [46; 47; 48; 49; 50]) aim to mitigate the effects of conflicting or dominating gradients. The approach of explicit gradient modulation [48; 49; 50; 51], has demonstrated superior performance in resolving conflicts between task gradients by substituting conflicting gradients with modified, non-conflicting gradients. Inspired by the above multimodal learning methods, we introduce a Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment method to align the orthogonal components contained in image fusion and object detection tasks thereby effectively eliminating the inherent optimization barrier that exists between two tasks.

## 3 The Proposed Method

### Problem Formulation

MF-OD task concentrates on generating an image that benefits emphasizing objects with superior visual perception capability. The goal of OD is to find the location and identify the class of each object in an image which can naturally provide rich semantic information along with object location information. Therefore, the motivation of OD-aware MF is to construct a novel infrared and visible image fusion framework that can benefit from the semantic information and object location information contained in OD. For this purpose, we suppose a pair of visible image \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W\times C_{x}}\) and infrared image \(\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{H\times W\times C_{y}}\). The optimization model is formulated as:

\[\min_{\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm t}}\mathcal{L}\left(\mathbf{t},\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{ y};\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm t}\right)\right), \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathbf{t}\) represents the output of the different task network \(\mathcal{N}\) with the learnable parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm t}\). \(\mathcal{L}(\cdot)\) is a constraint term to optimize the network. Previous approaches solely design image fusion or object detection networks in a cascaded way, which can only achieve outstanding results for one task. To produce visually appealing fused images alongside accurate object detection results, we jointly integrate the two tasks into a unified goal synchronously which can be rewritten as:

\[\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm u},\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm d}=\arg\min\omega\mathcal{L}^{\rm u} \left(\mathbf{u},\Phi\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm u}\right)\right)+\left( 1-\omega\right)\mathcal{L}^{\rm d}\left(\mathbf{d},\Psi\left(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y};\mathbf{ \theta}_{\rm d}\right)\right)+\mathcal{S}\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{\star}\right), \tag{2}\]

where \(\mathbf{\theta}^{\star}=\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm u}^{s}=\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm d}^{s}\), defined as the shared parameters for MF and OD networks. \(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{d}\) denote the fused image and detection result, which are produced by the MF network \(\Phi(\cdot)\) and OD network \(\Psi(\cdot)\) with the learnable parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm u}\) and \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\rm d}\). \(w\) is a predefined weighting factor to balance the task training. \(\mathcal{S}(\cdot)\) is a constrained term to jointly optimize the two tasks. In this paper, we regard the \(\mathcal{S}(\cdot)\) as a feature learning constrained manner and achieve this goal by designing a Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment training scheme.

### Architecture

Our proposed E2E-MFD is designed with parallel principle, composited by image fusion and object detection sub-network. Details of the whole architecture are shown in Figure 2. A fusion network (ORPPT) and object detection network (CFDP) can sufficiently realize the granularity-aware detail information and semantic information extraction.

**Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree.** The important fact of that humans pay more attention to different regions from coarse to fine for object detection in object scale and image fusion in pixel scale. Inspired by a phylogenetic tree, to simulate humans to study the interactions of hierarchies under different granularity views, we construct an Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree (ORPPT) as \(\Phi(\cdot)\) to extract different features in multiple region scales. Given an image pair \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{W\times H\times C_{\mathbf{x}}}\), \(\mathbf{y}\in\mathbb{R}^{W\times H\times C_{\mathbf{y}}}\), we firstly extract image features \(f(\mathbf{x})\) and \(f(\mathbf{y})\) by shared parallel backbone to save memory and computing resources. Then these features are added in channel dimension to obtain the final \(L\) multimodal image features \(\mathbf{o_{1}},...,\mathbf{o_{l}},...,\mathbf{o_{L}}\in\mathbb{R}^{W_{1}\times H_{1}\times C _{1}}\). The parameters in \(f(\cdot)\) are shared with the OD network.

Although \(f(\mathbf{x})\) and \(f(\mathbf{y})\) can describe the characteristics of visible and infrared modalities, they lack insights into the multi-granularity perspective. Therefore, we utilize the branches including the one pixel feature mining module (PFMM) and \(L\) region feature refine module (RFRM) to mine the multiple granularities from coarse to fine. The PFMM \(B_{0}\) is set the same with feature fusion block in the MetaFusion [18] with the input pair \(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\). We set \(1,2,\ldots,l,\ldots L\) to denote each region branch. For branch \(l\), a CNN \(\varphi_{l}(\cdot)\) is firstly utilized to extract the granularity-wise feature \(\varphi_{l}(\mathbf{o_{l}})\in\mathbb{R}^{W_{2}\times H_{2}\times C_{2}}\) at the region level. A set of learnable region prompts \(\mathbf{R}_{l}=\left\{\mathbf{r}_{l,m}\in\mathbb{R}^{C_{2}}\right\}_{m=1}^{M_{l}}\) are introduced to define the \(M_{l}\) different regions of granularity-wise feature, where \(r_{l,m}\) denotes the \(m^{\rm th}\) region prompt at branch \(l\). Then the feature vector is mapped into the region mask \(\mathbf{A}_{l}=\left\{\mathbf{a}_{l,m}\in\mathbb{R}^{W_{2}\times H_{2}}\right\}_{m=1}^ {M_{l}}\) by conducting the dot product between the feature vector and region prompt followed by batch normalization and a ReLU activation:

\[\mathbf{A}_{l}={\rm ReLU}({\rm BN}(\mathbf{R}_{l}\cdot\varphi_{l}(\mathbf{o_{l}})). \tag{3}\]

Finally, the vector of the object-level feature is weighted by the region mask and further aggregated to form region representation:

\[b_{l,m}^{i,j}(\mathbf{o_{l}})=\mathbf{a}_{l,m}^{i,j}\varphi_{l}^{i,j}(\mathbf{o_{l}}), \tag{4}\]

where \(b_{l,m}(\mathbf{o_{l}})\) denotes the \(m^{\rm th}\) region representation and \((i,j)\) denotes the spatial location. These region-level representations are further concatenated to form the observation \(B_{l}(\mathbf{o_{l}})=[b_{l,1}(\mathbf{o_{l}}),b_{l,2}(\mathbf{o_{l}}),\ldots,b_{l,M_{l}}( \mathbf{o_{l}})]\) of branch \(l\). These multi-grained attentions concentrate operation on the spatial location information and the extent of the regions which are similar to the task requirements. The \(B_{1}\), \(B_{2}\),..., \(B_{L}\) are up-sampled to keep the consistent spatial size with the

pixel-level fusion features \(B_{0}\). Then, the region-level fusion features \(B_{1},B_{2},...,B_{L}\) are assembled by addition operation followed by a Convolution with \(1\times 1\) kernel + ReLU to reduce the channel numbers. Highlighted region-level features are extracted by a Convolution with \(1\times 1\) kernel + Sigmoid and then injected into pixel-level features by multiplication and addition. Finally, five Convolutions with \(3\times 3\) kernel + ReLU layers are constructed to reconstruct the fusion result \(u\).

**Coarse-to-Fine Diffusion Process.** Diffusion models, inspired by nonequilibrium thermodynamics, are a class of likelihood-based models. DiffusionDet [52] is the first neural network model to utilize the diffusion model for object detection, introducing a novel paradigm that achieves promising results compared to traditional object detection models. Combining diffusion simulation with the diffusion and recovery process of the object box, the Coarse-to-Fine Diffusion Process (CFDP) introduces it as an efficient detection head to assist fusion networks to focus more on object areas. CFDP model defines a Markovian chain of diffusion forward process by gradually adding noise to a set of bounding boxes. The forward noise process is defined as:

\[q\left(\mathbf{z}_{t}\mid\mathbf{z}_{0}\right)=\mathcal{N}\left(\mathbf{z}_{t}\mid\sqrt{ \bar{\alpha}_{t}}\mathbf{z}_{0},\left(1-\bar{\alpha}_{t}\right)\mathbf{I}\right), \tag{5}\]

which transforms bounding boxes \(z_{0}\in\mathbb{R}^{N\times 4}\) to a latent noisy bounding boxes \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\) for \(t\in\{0,1,\ldots,T\}\) by adding noise to \(\mathbf{z}_{0}\). \(\bar{\alpha}_{t}:=\prod_{s=0}^{t}\alpha_{s}=\prod_{s=0}^{t}\left(1-\beta_{s}\right)\) and \(\beta_{s}\) represents the noise variance schedule. During training stage, a neural network \(\Psi_{\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{d}}}\left(z_{t},t\right)\) is trained to predict \(z_{0}\) from \(z_{t}\) by minimizing the training objective with \(\ell_{2}\) loss:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{d}}=\frac{1}{2}\left\|\Psi_{\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{d}}}\left( \mathbf{z}_{t},t\right)-\mathbf{z}_{0}\right\|^{2}. \tag{6}\]

At inference stage, bounding boxes \(z_{0}\) is reconstructed from noise \(z_{T}\) with the model \(\Psi_{\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{d}}}\) and updating rule in an iterative way, i.e., \(\mathbf{z}_{T}\rightarrow\mathbf{z}_{T-\Delta}\rightarrow\ldots\rightarrow\mathbf{z}_{0}\). In this work, we aim to solve the object detection task via the diffusion model. A neural network \(\Psi_{\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{d}}}\left(\mathbf{z}_{t},t,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\right)\) is trained to predict \(z_{0}\) from noisy boxes \(\mathbf{z}_{t}\), conditioned on the corresponding image pair \(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}\).

### Loss Function

The total loss is combined with an image fusion loss function \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{f}}\) and object detection loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{d}}\). \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{f}}\) consists of three types of losses, i.e., structure loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSIM}}\), pixel loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}}\) and gradient loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{grad}}\). For one fused image, it should preserve overall structures and maintain a similar intensity distribution from source images. To this end, the structural similarity index (SSIM) is introduced in function:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSIM}}=\left(1-\mathrm{SSIM}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{x})\right)/2+\left( 1-\mathrm{SSIM}(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{y})\right)/2, \tag{7}\]

where \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{SSIM}}\) denotes structure similarity loss. In the fused image, we expect the object regions to have a more significant contrast compared to the background region. Therefore, the object regions need to preserve the maximum pixel intensity and the background region needs to be slightly below the maximum pixel intensity to bring out the contrast between the object and background. The ground-truth bounding boxes of the objects in images are denoted as \((x_{c},y_{c},w,h)\) for horizontal boxes and \((x_{c},y_{c},w,h,\theta)\) for rotated boxes, where \((x_{c},y_{c})\) is the center location, \(w\) and \(h\) are the width and height, \(\theta=angle*pi/180\), respectively. Based on these ground-truth bounding boxes, we construct the object mask \(I_{m}\), and the background mask is denoted as \(1-I_{m}\). The object regions pixel loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}}^{\text{o}}\) and the background region pixel loss \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}}^{\text{b}}\) are formulated as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}}^{\text{o}}=\left\|I_{m}\circ\left(\mathbf{u}-max(\mathbf{ x},\mathbf{y})\right)\right\|_{1},\mathcal{L}_{\text{pixel}}^{\text{b}}=\left\| \left(1-I_{m}\right)\circ\left(\mathbf{u}-mean(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\right)\right\|_{1}, \tag{8}\]

### Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment

The MF and OD tasks have distinct optimization objectives. MF primarily emphasizes capturing the pixel-level relationship between image pairs, while OD incorporates object semantics within the broader context of diverse scenes. An inherent optimization barrier exists between these two tasks. We observe that the prevailing challenges in multi-task learning are arguably task dominance and conflicting gradients. We introduce a Gradient Matrix Task-Alignment (GMTA) by presenting the condition number to mitigate the undesired effects of the optimization barrier in task-shared parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}^{*}\) which are supposed to be balanced between the MF and OD tasks. The individual task gradients of MF and OD task are calculated by \(\mathbf{g}_{u}=\nabla_{\theta^{*}}\mathcal{L}_{u}\) and \(\mathbf{g}_{d}=\nabla_{\theta^{*}}\mathcal{L}_{d}\) in the training optimization process. The gradient matrix can be defined as \(\mathbf{G}=\{\mathbf{g}_{u},\mathbf{g}_{d}\}\). In multi-task optimization, a cumulative gradient \(\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{G}\mathbf{w}\) is a linear combination of task gradients and the stability of a linear system is measured by the condition number of its matrix in numerical analysis. Hence the stability of the gradient matrix is equal to the ratio of the maximum and minimum singular values (non-negative) of the corresponding matrix: \(\kappa(\mathbf{G})=\frac{\sigma_{\text{max}}}{\sigma_{\text{min}}}\). Learning from the Aligned-MTL [51], the condition number is optimal (\(\kappa(\mathbf{G})=1\)) if and only if the gradients are orthogonal and equal in magnitude which means that the system of gradients has no dominance or conflicts:

\[\kappa(\mathbf{G})=1\iff<\mathbf{g}_{u},\mathbf{g}_{d}>=1. \tag{11}\]

The final linear system of gradients defined by \(\hat{\mathbf{G}}\) satisfies the optimal condition in terms of a condition number. Thereby, we consider the feature learning constraint \(\mathcal{S}(\mathbf{\theta}^{*})\) can be defined as the following optimization to eliminate instability in the training process:

\[\min_{\hat{\mathbf{G}}}\|\mathbf{G}-\hat{\mathbf{G}}\|_{F}^{2}\quad\text{ s.t. }\kappa(\hat{\mathbf{G}})=1 \iff\min_{\hat{\mathbf{G}}}\|\mathbf{G}-\hat{\mathbf{G}}\|_{F}^{2}\quad\text{ s.t. }\hat{\mathbf{G}}^{\top}\hat{\mathbf{G}}=\mathbf{I}. \tag{12}\]

The problem can be treated as a Procrustes problem and can be solved by performing a singular value decomposition (SVD) to \(\mathbf{G}\) (\(\mathbf{G}=\mathbf{U}\mathbf{\Sigma}\mathbf{V}^{T}\)) and rescaling singular values corresponding to principal components so that they are equal to the smallest singular value:

\[\hat{\mathbf{G}}=\sigma\mathbf{U}\mathbf{V}^{\top}=\sigma\mathbf{G}\mathbf{V}\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}\mathbf{V }^{T}, \tag{13}\]

where,

\[(\mathbf{V},\mathbf{\lambda})=eigh(\mathbf{G}^{\top}\mathbf{G}), \tag{14}\]

\[\mathbf{\Sigma}^{-1}=diag(\sqrt{1/\lambda_{max}},\sqrt{1/\lambda_{min}}), \tag{15}\]

\(eigh\) represents a function for finding eigenvectors \(\mathbf{V}\) and eigenvalues \(\mathbf{\lambda}\) and \(diag\) stands for diagonal matrix. \(\lambda_{max}\) and \(\lambda_{min}\) are maximum eigenvalues and minimum eigenvalues from \(\mathbf{\lambda}\).The stability criterion, a condition number, defines a linear system to an arbitrary position scale. To alleviate this ambiguity, we choose the largest scale that guarantees convergence to the optimum: this is a minimal singular value of an initial gradient matrix:

\[\sigma=\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{G})=\sqrt{\lambda_{min}}. \tag{16}\]

## 4 Experiments and Analysis

### Dataset and Implementation Details

We conduct experiments on four widely-used visible-infrared image datasets: **TNO**[53], **RoadScene**[26], **M3FD**[17] and **DroneVehicle**[3]. TNO and RoadScene are just used to evaluate MF performance. M3FD is adopted to evaluate both MF and OD performance. RoadScene with 37 image pairs, TNO with 42 image pairs and M3FD with 300 pairs are only used for the MF task in the testing stage, and the MF network is trained by the M3FD dataset which is divided into a training set (2,940 image pairs) and a testing set (1,260 image pairs). Besides, DroneVehicle consists of 28,439 image pairs is utilized to train and test MF and OD for oriented objects. We conduct all the experiments with one GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, and the code of M3FD is based on Detectron2 [54], while the code of DroneVehicle is based on MMDetection 2.26.0 [55] and MMRotate 0.3.4 [56]. On the M3FD dataset, the pretrained DiffusionDet is used for the initialization of the OD network. In the training phase, E2E-MFD is optimized by AdamW with a batch size of 1. We set the learning rate to \(2.5e-5\) and the weight decay as \(1e-4\). The default training iteration is only 15,000. On the DroneVehicle dataset, the pretrained LSKNet [57] is used for the initialization of the object detection network, and we fine-tune it for 12 epochs with a batch size of 4. The E2E-MFD is optimized by AdamW and the learning rate and the weight decay is set to \(1e-4\) and 0.05.

### Main Results

**Results on Multimodal Image Fusion.** Qualitative results of different fusion methods are depicted in Figure 3. All the fusion methods can fuse the main features of the infrared and visible images to some extent and we can observe two remarkable advantages of our method. First, the significant characteristics of infrared images can be effectively highlighted by our method. Our M3FD fusion image captures the person riding a motorcycle. In comparison with other methods, our method demonstrates high contrast and recognition of the objects. Second, our method preserves rich details from the visible images, including color and texture. Our advantages are evident in the fusion images across the M3FD dataset, such as the clear outline of the white car's rear and a man on a motorcycle. While retaining a substantial amount of detail, our method maintains a high resolution without introducing blurriness. In contrast, other methods fail to achieve these two advantages simultaneously. Sequentially, we provide quantitative results of different fusion methods in Table 1. Our E2E-MFD generally achieves the best metric values. Specifically, the largest average value on MI proves that our method transfers more considerable information from both source images. Values of EN reveal that our results contain edged details and the highest contrast between objects and the background. The large VIF shows our fusion results have high-quality visual effects and small distortion compared with the source images. Moreover, our method achieves the fastest training time to finish the joint learning at one stage which means that faster iterative updates can be done on new datasets. The test time to generate a fused image ranked third.

**Results on Multimodal Object Detection.** To more effectively evaluate the fusion images and observe their impact on downstream detection tasks, we conduct tests using the baseline detector YOLOv5s on all SOTA methods on the M3FD dataset. We follow the same parameter settings, and the visualization results are shown in Figure 4. The detection results are poor when using only single-modal image inputs, with instances of missed detection, such as the motorcycle and rider next to the car and people on the far right in the image. Almost all fusion methods reduce

missed detection and improve confidence by fusing information from both modalities. Through the design of an end-to-end fusion detection synchronous optimization strategy, we obtain fusion images that are visually and detection-friendly, especially for occluded and overlapping objects, as seen in the blue ellipse with the motorcycle and the overlapping people on the far right in the image. To further assess the quality of fusion images, we conduct a fair comparison between our method and the SOTA methods on YOLOv5s. As shown in Table 2, the MF methods demonstrate a performance improvement compared to single-modal detection, indicating that well-fused images can effectively assist downstream tasks. In contrast, the fusion image we generate has achieved the best performance on YOLOv5s. Additionally, the detection performance of fusion images on DiffusionDet is also impressive, albeit slightly lower than when optimizing fusion and detection tasks

the network determines task optimization directions.

However, excessively large \(n\) leads to significant deviations in task paths, making alignment more challenging and negatively impacting performance.

**Study of Branches in the Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree.** We investigate the combination of the pixel feature mining module (0) and the region feature refinement module (1,2,3,4). The results are shown in Table 7. It can be observed that with the increase in the number of branches, the fusion network achieves higher image fusion quality and object detection performance. Region features provide the fusion network with multi-level semantic features of objects. However, when higher-level semantic object information is added, the performance of the fusion network declines. This is because the detailed information contained in the deeper layers of the backbone structure shared with the detection network decreases abruptly, which may affect the fusion network's absorption of these features, thereby influencing pixel-level fusion tasks.

We have implemented the Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree (ORPPT) to explore the hierarchical interactions under different granularity views and extract various features across multiple region scales, as introduced in Section 3.2. As shown in Figure 6, the detailed information will decrease as the backbone structure shared by the detection network deepens, resulting in a decrease in detailed information. This may affect the absorption of these features by the fusion network of the shared backbone network, thereby affecting pixel-level fusion tasks. This provides evidence for our analysis of the reasons for Section 4.3 ablation experiment for Object-Region-Pixel Phylogenetic Tree. This illustrates the importance of balancing the semantic information provided between the OD and MF network with pixel-level information.

## 5 Conclusion

Within this paper, an end-to-end optimization is proposed to formulate fusion and detection in a harmonious one-stage training process. We introduce a object-region-pixel phylogenetic tree structure and coarse-to-fine diffusion process to simulate these two tasks in different visual perceptions needed for diverse task requirements. In addition, we align the orthogonal components of the fusion detection linear system of the gradients by gradient matrix task-alignment. By unrolling the model to a well-designed fusion network and diffusion-based detection network, we can generate a visual-friendly result for fusion and object detection in an efficient way without tedious training steps and inherent optimization barriers.

Appendix

### Metric

Three metrics are used for MF evaluation: entropy (EN) [67], mutual information (MI) [68] and visual information fidelity (VIF) [69]. EN evaluates the information richness in an image, and the higher EN means more information. MI evaluates the information similarity between the input images and fused images. The higher MI illustrates more information of the input images is fused. VIF measures the ability to extract visible information from the input image, and a larger VIF represents less visible distortion in the fused result. Here, we use the V channel in the HSV space of the fusion results to calculate these metrics. Moreover, we use mAP\({}_{50:95}\)[70] to comprehensively evaluate OD performance, where the average of mAPs sampling every 5 from AP\({}_{50}\) to AP\({}_{95}\) is calculated. A higher mAP\({}_{50:95}\) means a better OD effect.

### Experiment setting on YOLOv5s

To more effectively evaluate the fusion images and observe their impact on downstream detection tasks, we conduct tests using the baseline detector YOLOv5s on all SOTA methods on the M3FD dataset. All images are resized to 1024\(\times\)1024 and trained from scratch for 300 epochs with a batch size of 64. In addition, the experiments for DroneVehicle dataset are conducted on YOLOv5s-OBB using the generated fusion images, all images are resized to 640\(\times\)640 and trained from scratch for 50 epochs with a batch size of 64.

### Experiments on DroneVehicle

DroneVehicle comprises aerial RGB-IR images captured by drones, encompassing various scenes from an aerial perspective. It contains five categories of target objects. The dataset consists of 28,439 pairs of images, divided into training, validation, and test sets. We train the MF network on the training set and perform inference directly on the test set. Finally, fusion images are generated for both the training and test sets. All detection accuracies are obtained on the test set. The visualization results of the fusion and detection of DroneVehicle are shown in Figure 7 and 8. In the process of generating fusion images, we first obtain RGB images, then convert them to HSV format, and only take the V channel as the final fusion image. It preserves the brightness information of the objects while containing rich details from visible images. As shown in Figure 7, the first row and the second row are images extracted from the training set and the test set, respectively. Although the style of the fusion images resembles that of the infrared images, by combining visible image information, the fusion images can differentiate different parts of each object, reflecting varying degrees of brightness information. This is advantageous for fine-grained classification. Additionally, as shown in Figure 8, the visually friendly fusion images also assist in the object detection task, allowing for sufficient detection even in cases of small and dense objects.

### Experiments on Coase-to-Fine Diffusion Process

We conducted ablation experiments on CFDP in Table 8, investigating its inclusion and the number of proposed boxes. In the setting without CFDP, we maintained the backbone network while substituting

Figure 7: Qualitative results of image fusion on DroneVehicle.

CFDP with RPN (Region Proposal Network), standard components in two-stage object detectors. Results indicate that CFDP enhances detailed information capture and precise box guidance, thereby enhancing fusion image quality and detection performance. For optimal balance between performance and efficiency, we selected 500 proposal boxes.

### More Fusion Visualization Results

More comparisons of infrared-visible image fusion visualization results are depicted in Figure 9, 10 and 11. These fusion results demonstrate the advantages of synchronously optimizing fusion and detection tasks. With minimal training costs, we obtain fusion images that are visually and detection-friendly. Specifically, the fusion images retain significant object information extracted from infrared images, while also preserving detailed information such as texture, color, and background from visible images. Our method effectively combines the strengths of both modalities to enhance the overall performance of the detection.

### More Detection Visualization Results

The visualization of infrared-visible object detection is demonstrated in Figure 12. Our fusion images are noticeably superior due to the effective combination of object information from infrared images and texture details from visible images. This integration enables the object detection network to distinguish between the background and the object clearly. Additionally, for small and occluded objects, the clear edge details assist the network in achieving improved detection results.

### Limitations and Broader Impacts

**Limitations.** Our E2E-MFD approach is effective for the joint learning of the multimodal fusion and object detection task and has been validated on various datasets. However, the validations of the current model rely on the visible and infrared modalities. Constrained by the scarcity of relevant datasets within the community, the paper lacks validation with additional datasets containing new modalities. Future research will focus on addressing this gap by exploring, constructing, and incorporating more diverse multimodal datasets serving multimodal fusion detection.

**Broader Impacts.** Our paper aims to broaden the applicability of joint learning of multimodal data and object detection to various research domains. However, this broader scope may present challenges when using the model in domains that include harmful content. These challenges arise from the data itself, rather than from the model. Therefore, it is crucial to have adequate data regularization to effectively address these concerns.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction accurately state the contributions of the E2E-MFD model, including its novel design of synchronous joint learning of the multimodal fusion and object detection. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitation of the the work is detailed discussed in the Appendix A.7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [NA]  Justification: NA. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All the necessary information needed to reproduce the main experimental results are fully stated in the Section 4 and Appendix A. This information ensures the understanding the results which support the main claims and conclusions of the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provide the open access to the data and code with sufficient instructions for reproducing the main experimental results in the supplementary material. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The training and test details including data splits, hyperparameters and type of optimizer are illustrated in Section 4.1 and Appendix A.3 to ensure the results of the paper can be fully understand and reproduced. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments are carefully reported in Section 4 ensuring that the findings are presented with an appropriate level of precision and confidence. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.

* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provide the sufficient information on the computation computer resources including the type of compute works (GeForce RTX 3090 GPU), memory, and time of execution in the Section 4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics which ensuring all aspects of our study, including data collection, analysis, and reporting. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Broader Impacts are discussed in paper. We highlight the benefits of our research, such as advancing the field of multimodal fusion detection learning, which can lead to improvements in various applications, including autonomous vehicles and remote sensing. At the same time, the limitations of the method are analysed in Appendix A.7.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: NA. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The creators or original owners of assets are properly credited and the license and terms of use are explicitly mentioned and properly respected. Guidelines:

* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.

* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We will open the code totally if the paper is accepted with the new assets documented and documentation is provided alongside the assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
