###### Abstract

Signed graphs can model friendly or antagonistic relations where edges are annotated with a positive or negative sign. Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) have been widely used for signed graph representation learning. While significant progress has been made in SGNNs research, two issues (i.e., graph sparsity and unbalanced triangles) persist in the current SGNN models. We aim to alleviate these issues through data augmentation (_DA_) techniques which have demonstrated effectiveness in improving the performance of graph neural networks. However, most graph augmentation methods are primarily aimed at graph-level and node-level tasks (e.g., graph classification and node classification) and cannot be directly applied to signed graphs due to the lack of side information (e.g., node features and label information) in available real-world signed graph datasets. Random _DropEdge_ is one of the few _DA_ methods that can be directly used for signed graph data augmentation, but its effectiveness is still unknown. In this paper, we are the first to provide the generalization error bound for the SGNN model and demonstrate from both experimental and theoretical perspectives that the random _DropEdge_ cannot improve the performance of link sign prediction. Therefore, we propose a novel Signed Graph Augmentation framework (**SGA**) tailored for SGNNs. Specifically, SGA first integrates a structure augmentation module to detect candidate edges solely based on network information. Furthermore, SGA incorporates a novel strategy to select beneficial candidates. Finally, SGA introduces a novel data augmentation perspective to enhance the training process of SGNNs. Experiment results on six real-world datasets demonstrate that SGA effectively boosts the performance of diverse SGNN models, achieving improvements of up to 26.2% in F1-micro for SGCN on the Slashdot dataset in the link sign prediction task. Code and data are available at [https://github.com/Alex-Zeyu/SGA](https://github.com/Alex-Zeyu/SGA).

## 1 Introduction

As social networks continue to gain widespread popularity, they foster a multitude of interactions among individuals, which are later documented within social graphs [1, 2]. While many of these social interactions denote positive connections, such as liking, trust, and friendship, there are alsoinstances of negative interactions, encompassing feelings of hatred, distrust, and more. For example, Slashdot [3], a tech-related news website, allows users to tag other users as either 'friends' or 'foes'. Graphs that incorporate positive and negative interactions or links are commonly termed _signed graphs_[4, 5]. In recent years, there has been a growing interest among researchers in exploring network representation within the context of signed graphs [6, 7, 8]. Most of these methods are combined with Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) [9, 10], and are therefore collectively referred to as _Signed Graph Neural Networks_ (SGNNs) [11, 7, 12, 13]. This endeavor focuses on acquiring low-dimensional representations of nodes, with the ultimate goal of facilitating subsequent network analysis tasks, especially _link sign prediction_.

Despite increasing interest in SGNNs in recent years, two issues remain unresolved. First, real-world signed graph datasets are exceptionally sparse (see Table 5 from Appendix H). The sparsity of signed graphs makes downstream tasks challenging. As shown in **Issue 1** (from Figure 1), without additional structure information or side information, predicting the edge sign between nodes \(v_{j}\) and \(v_{k}\) in the test set is difficult. However, this changes with the introduction of extra edges (\(e_{il}\)) through data augmentation. Second, according to the analysis in [14], SGNNs cannot learn proper representations for nodes from unbalanced triangles. The intuitive understanding is as follows: as shown in **Issue 2**(c) (from Figure 1), there is a negative relationship between node \(v_{i}\) and node \(v_{j}\) in a one-hop path, while through a two-hop path via node \(v_{k}\), it becomes a positive relationship. In other words, the relationship between node \(v_{i}\) and node \(v_{j}\) is uncertain, which complicates the task of SGNNs in learning representations for these three nodes. Furthermore, we notice that the proportion of unbalanced triangles is considerable (see Table 3).

One promising approach to alleviate the aforementioned issues in SGNNs is data augmentation (_DA_) which has been well studied in computer vision [15, 16, 17, 18] and natural language processing [19, 20, 21]. Recently, significant advances have been made in graph augmentation [22, 23, 24], including node perturbation [25, 26], edge perturbation [27], and subgraph sampling [28]. However, current graph augmentation methods cannot be directly applied to signed graphs for the following reasons: 1) Some methods [22, 23] require side information (e.g., node features and labels), which are often absent in real-world signed graph datasets that contain only structural information. 2) Random structural perturbation-based enhancement methods [27, 8, 29] cannot improve SGNN performance. As shown in Figure 2, random _EdgeDrop_ cannot stably improve SGCN performance. For more experimental results on data augmentation methods based on random structural perturbations, please refer to the Appendix A. In addition, we take a first step in developing a deeper theoretical understanding of SGNN models and deriving the generalization error bound of the SGCN. Based on this analysis, we further demonstrate that randomly deleting edges increases the generalization error bound of SGNN, and therefore it is not an effective enhancement method for SGNN (see Section 4). In summary, it is necessary to design a new _DA_ method specifically for SGNNs.

Overall, the designed signed graph augmentation method should address the two common obstacles encountered by popular SGNN models:

1. Exploring new structural information using only network information.
2. Alleviate the negative impact of unbalanced triangles on SGNNs.

Figure 1: Green and red lines represent positive and negative edges, resp. Solid lines represent edges in the training set, while dashed lines represent edges in the test set.

Figure 2: Effectiveness of random EdgeDrop (SGCN [11] as backbone model) on link sign prediction performance with six real-world signed graph datasets.

To address the aforementioned obstacles, we propose a novel Signed Graph Augmentation framework, **SGA**. For the **first** obstacle, we use a classic SGNN model, such as SGCN [11] to discover candidate samples. The nodes of a signed graph are first projected into the embedding space. In the embedding space, following the principles of the extended structural balance theory [30], we interpret the relationships between closely proximate nodes as potential positive edges, whereas the relationships between more distant nodes are considered as potential negative edges. The newly added edges are treated as candidate samples (i.e., edges). To overcome the **second** obstacle, we approach it from two perspectives. _Foremost_, we attempt to reduce the number of existing unbalanced triangles. The candidate samples yield two outcomes: creating new edges or modifying the sign of existing edges. These operations do not reduce the number of training samples, which is consistent with the results of the theoretical analysis (see Sect. 4). Instead of directly incorporating the candidate samples into the training set, we analyze them beforehand. Only candidate samples that do not introduce new unbalanced triangles are retained. _Next,_, we aim to reduce the training weight of edges that belong to unbalanced triangles. To achieve this, we introduce a new perspective on data augmentation, namely edge difficulty scores (see Def. 3.3). Based on this, we design a curriculum learning training strategy tailored for SGNNs, aiming to decrease the training weight of edges with high difficulty scores and increase the training weight of edges with low difficulty scores.

To evaluate the effectiveness of SGA, we perform extensive experiments on six real-world datasets, i.e. Bitcoin-alpha, Bitcoin-otc, Epinions, Slashdot, Wiki-elec, and Wiki-RfA. We verify that our proposed SGA framework can improve the performance of the baseline models. The results of the experiment show that SGA improves the accuracy of the prediction of link signs of five base models, including two unsigned GNN models (GCN [9] and GAT [31]) and three signed GNN models (SGCN [11], SiGAT [32] and GS-GNN [13]) (see Table 1 and Table 6). SGA boosts up to 14.8% in terms of AUC for SGCN on Wiki-RfA, 26.2% in terms of F1-binary, 32.3% in terms of F1-micro, and 24.7% in terms of F1-macro for SGCN on Slashdot in link sign prediction, at best. These experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of SGA.

**Limitations**. Our data augmentation method utilizes the conclusions from SGNN representation limitation based on balance theory [14]. However, it is well known that balance theory cannot model all signed graph formation patterns, as discussed in the paper [13]. Therefore, for real-world datasets that do not strongly conform to balance theory, our data augmentation may be less effective. Additionally, we have only validated our method on the primary downstream task of link sign prediction in signed graphs. Some works [33; 34] consider the clustering task for signed graphs, but these primarily use synthetic datasets and there are no real-world datasets available yet, which is why we have not conducted tests on them.

Overall, our contributions are summarized as follows:

* We are the first to provide the generalization error bound for the SGNN model. Based on this, we theoretically demonstrate the random _DropEdge_ method, which is suitable for node classification and graph classification, is not applicable to edge-level task (i.e., link sign prediction).
* We propose a novel signed graph augmentation framework that alleviates the two issues (i.e., sparsity and unbalanced triangles) widely existing in SGNNs.
* Extensive experiments on six real-world datasets with five backbone models demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.

## 2 Problem Statement

A _signed graph_ is defined as \(\mathcal{G}=(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{E}^{+},\mathcal{E}^{-})\), where \(\mathcal{V}=\{v_{1},\ldots,v_{|\mathcal{V}|}\}\) represents the set of nodes, and \(\mathcal{E}^{+}\) and \(\mathcal{E}^{-}\) denote the positive and negative edges, respectively. Each edge \(e_{ij}\in\mathcal{E}^{+}\cup\mathcal{E}^{-}\) connecting two nodes \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\) can be either positive or negative, but not both, meaning that \(\mathcal{E}^{+}\cap\mathcal{E}^{-}=\varnothing\). We use \(\sigma(e_{ij})\in\{+,-\}\) to denote the _sign_ of \(e_{ij}\). The structure of \(\mathcal{G}\) is represented by the adjacency matrix \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{V}|\times|\mathcal{V}|}\), where each entry \(A_{ij}\in\{1,-1,0\}\) signifies the sign of the edge \(e_{ij}\). It's important to note that, unlike unsigned graph datasets, signed graphs typically do not provide node features, meaning there is no feature vector \(x_{i}\) associated with each node \(v_{i}\).

_Positive_ and _negative neighbors_ of \(v_{i}\) are denoted as \(\mathcal{N}^{+}_{i}=\{v_{j}\mid A_{ij}>0\}\) and \(\mathcal{N}^{-}_{i}=\{v_{j}\mid A_{ij}<0\}\), respectively. Let \(\mathcal{N}_{i}=\mathcal{N}^{+}_{i}\cup\mathcal{N}^{-}_{i}\) be the set of neighbors of node \(v_{i}\). \(\mathcal{O}_{3}\) represents the set of _triangles_ in the signed graph, i.e., \(\mathcal{O}_{3}=\{\{v_{i},v_{j},v_{k}\}\mid A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ik}\neq 0\}\). A triangle \(\{v_{i},v_{j},v_{k}\}\) is called _balanced_ if \(A_{ij}A_{jk}A_{ik}>0\), and is called _unbalanced_ otherwise.

**Problem Definition**: \(D_{\text{train}}\) refers to the set of train samples (edges) and \(D_{\text{test}}\) refers to the set of test samples. When only given \(D_{\text{train}}\), our purpose is to design a graph augmentation strategy \(\psi:(D_{\text{train}})\rightarrow(D^{\prime}_{\text{train}},\mathcal{F})\), where \(D^{\prime}_{\text{train}}\) refers to augmented train edge set and \(\mathcal{F}\) refers to the newly generated edge features (i.e., edge difficulty score).

## 3 Proposed Method

The overall framework of SGA is shown in Figure 3, which aims to augment training samples (i.e., edges) from a structure perspective (edge manipulation) to side information (edge feature). SGA mainly encompasses three key elements: 1) generating new training candidate samples, 2) selecting beneficial candidate samples, and 3) introducing a new feature (i.e., edge difficulty score) for training samples. For the specific procedural details of each part, please refer to Appendix C.

### Generating Candidate Training Samples

Real-world signed graph datasets are extremely sparse (see Table 2) with many uncovered edges. In this part, we attempt to uncover the potential relationships between nodes. We first use a SGNN model, e.g., SGCN [11], as the encoder to project nodes from topological space to embedding space. Here, the node representations are updated by aggregating information from different types of neighbors as follows:

For the first aggregation layer \(\ell=1\):

\[\begin{split}& H^{pos(1)}=\sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{pos(1)}\left[A^ {+}H^{(0)},H^{(0)}\right]\right)\\ & H^{neg(1)}=\sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{neg(1)}\left[A^{-}H^{(0)},H^ {(0)}\right]\right)\end{split} \tag{1}\]

For the aggregation layer \(\ell>1\):

\[\begin{split}& H^{pos(\ell)}=\sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{pos(\ell)} \left[A^{+}H^{pos(\ell-1)},A^{-}H^{neg(\ell-1)},H^{pos(\ell-1)}\right]\right)\\ & H^{neg(\ell)}=\sigma\left(\mathbf{W}^{neg(\ell)}\left[A^{+}H^{ neg(\ell-1)},A^{-}H^{pos(\ell-1)},H^{neg(\ell-1)}\right]\right),\end{split} \tag{2}\]

where \(H^{pos(\ell)}(H^{neg(\ell)})\) represents the positive (negative) segment of representation matrix at the \(\ell\)th layer. \(A^{+}(A^{-})\) represents the row normalized matrix of the positive (negative) part of the adjacency matrix \(A\). \(\mathbf{W}^{pos(\ell)}(\mathbf{W}^{neg(\ell)})\) denotes learnable parameters of the positive (negative) part, and \(\sigma(\cdot)\) is the activation function ReLU. \([.]\) is the concatenation operation. After conducting message-passing for \(L\) layers, the final node representation matrix is \(Z=H^{(L)}=\left[H^{pos(L)},H^{neg(L)}\right]\). For node \(v_{i}\), the node embedding is \(Z_{i}\). As we wish to classify whether a pair of nodes has a positive, negative, or no edge between them. We train a multinomial logistic regression classifier (MLG) (as in [11]). The training loss is as follows:

Figure 3: The overall process of SGA. Green lines represent positive edges and red lines represent negative edges.

\(\theta^{\text{MLG}}\) refers to the parameter of the MLG classifier. Using this classifier, for any two nodes \(v_{i}\), \(v_{j}\), we can calculate the probability of forming a positive or negative edge between any two nodes, denoted as \(Pr_{e_{ij}}^{pos}\) and \(Pr_{e_{ij}}^{neg}\). We set up four probability threshold hyper-parameters, namely the probability threshold for adding positive edges (\(\epsilon_{add}^{+}\)), the probability threshold for adding negative edges (\(\epsilon_{add}^{-}\)), the probability threshold for deleting positive edges (\(\epsilon_{del}^{+}\)) and the probability threshold for deleting negative edges (\(\epsilon_{del}^{-}\)). Subsequently, we employ the following strategy to generate candidate training samples:

* \(\forall v_{i},v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}\), if \(Pr_{e_{ij}}^{pos}>\epsilon_{add}^{+}\lor Pr_{e_{ij}}^{neg}>\epsilon_{add}^{-}\), then \(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\cup\{(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\}\);
* \(\forall v_{i},v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}\), if \((v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\in D_{\text{train}}\), \(A_{ij}>0\), \(Pr_{e_{ij}}^{pos}<\epsilon_{del}^{+}\), then \(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\cup\{(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\}\);
* \(\forall v_{i},v_{j}\in\mathcal{V}\), if \((v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\in D_{\text{train}}\), \(A_{ij}<0\), \(Pr_{e_{ij}}^{neg}<\epsilon_{del}^{-}\), then \(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\cup\{(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\}\).

\(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\) and \(D_{\text{train\_del}}^{\text{card}}\) refer to the candidate training set for adding edges and the candidate training set for deleting edges.

### Selecting Beneficial Candidate Training Samples

After obtaining candidates, we do not merge them into the training set directly. Instead, we select the beneficial portions based on some rules. According to [14], it proves SGNNs cannot learn proper representations from unbalanced triangles (see Figure 1). The intuitive insight from this conclusion for signed graph augmentation is that beneficial candidates should not lead to new unbalanced triangles. Therefore, after generating candidate training set \(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\) and \(D_{\text{train\_del}}^{\text{card}}\), we need to discern which operations are beneficial or not. Considering that removing edges will not introduce new unbalanced triangles, it can be directly applied to the training set. However, adding edges may potentially introduce unbalanced triangles, so it needs to be analyzed whether it should be applied to the training set. The specific criteria are as follows:

* \(\forall\left(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij})\right)\in D_{\text{train\_del}}^{ \text{card}}\), \(D_{\text{train}}\setminus\{(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\}\);
* \(\forall\left(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij})\right)\in D_{\text{train\_add}}^{ \text{card}}\), if \((v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\notin D_{\text{train}}\), and \(\forall v_{k}\in\mathcal{N}_{i}\cap\mathcal{N}_{j}\), \((\sigma(e_{ij})*\sigma(e_{ik})*\sigma(e_{jk}))>0\), then \(D_{\text{train}}\cup\{(v_{i},v_{j},\sigma(e_{ij}))\}\).

According to the above steps, we have merged the \(D_{\text{train\_add}}^{\text{card}}\) and \(D_{\text{train\_del}}^{\text{card}}\)into the training set \(D_{\text{train}}\).

### Introducing New Feature for Training Samples

In this part, we attempt to alleviate the negative impact of unbalanced triangles on SGNNs from another perspective by augmenting a new feature for training samples (i.e., edges), namely edge difficulty score. Intuitively, edges belonging to unbalanced triangles have higher difficulty scores, while those belonging to balanced triangles have lower difficulty scores. Based on the difficulty scores, we design a curriculum learning-based training plan, aiming to reduce the training weights of edges with high difficulty scores, thereby mitigating the negative impact of unbalanced triangles on SGNNs.

We provide a definition of global and local balance degree:

**Definition 3.1**.: The _Global Balance Degree_[35] of a signed graph is defined by:

\[D_{3}(\mathcal{G})=\frac{|\mathcal{O}_{3}^{+}|}{|\mathcal{O}_{3}|} \tag{4}\]

where \(\mathcal{O}_{3}\) represents the set of triangles, \(\mathcal{O}_{3}^{+}\) represents the set of balanced triangles. \(|\cdot|\) represents the set cardinal number.

**Definition 3.2** (Local Balance Degree).: For edge \(e_{ij}\), the local balance degree is defined by:

\[D_{3}(e_{ij})=\frac{|\mathcal{O}_{3}^{+}(e_{ij})|-|\mathcal{O}_{3}^{-}(e_{ij})| }{|\mathcal{O}_{3}^{+}(e_{ij})|+|\mathcal{O}_{3}^{-}(e_{ij})|} \tag{5}\]where \(\mathcal{O}_{3}^{+}(e_{ij})\) (\(\mathcal{O}_{3}^{-}(e_{ij})\)) represents the set of balanced (unbalanced) triangles containing edge \(e_{ij}\). \(|\cdot|\) represents the set cardinal number.

From Def. 3.2, we can observe that the edge's local balance degree is related to the count of balanced and unbalanced triangles that include this edge. Based on this, we can define the edge difficulty score:

**Definition 3.3** (Edge Difficulty Score).: For edge \(e_{ij}\), the difficulty score is defined by:

\[\text{Score}(e_{ij})=\frac{1-D_{3}(e_{ij})}{2} \tag{6}\]

where \(D_{3}(e_{ij})\) denotes the local balance degree of edge \(v_{ij}\).

Upon quantifying the difficulty scores for each edge within the training set, a curriculum-based training approach is applied to enhance the performance of the SGNN model. This curriculum is fashioned following the principles outlined in [36], which enables the creation of a structured progression from easy to difficult. The process entails initially sorting the training set \(\mathcal{E}\) in ascending order based on their respective difficulty scores. Subsequently, a pacing function \(g(t)\) is used to allocate these edges to distinct training epochs, transitioning from easier to more challenging samples, where \(t\) signifies the \(t\)-th epoch. we use a linear pacing function as shown below:

\[g(t)=\min\left(1,\lambda_{0}+(1-\lambda_{0})*\frac{t}{T}\right) \tag{7}\]

\(\lambda_{0}\) denotes the initial proportion of the easiest examples available, and \(T\) indicates the training epoch at which \(g(t)\) reaches value 1. The process of SGA is detailed in Appendix D.

## 4 Generalization Bound of SGNN

In this section, we are going to prove the generalization error bound for SGNN. Our results show that the generalization performance of the model is affected by the number of edges. A larger number of edges in the training set usually generalizes better, which means that dropout cannot always contribute to improving the model's generalization ability in many situations. For the basic setup and assumptions, please see the Appendix E.

**Main Result.** Under link prediction task, we denote \(A_{D}\) as a learning algorithm trained on dataset \(D\). According to Algorithm 2, we can set \(A_{D}=\sigma(f(z_{i},z_{j},w))\), the generalization gap is defined as the difference between training error and test error:

\[\delta_{gen}=E_{A}[R\left(A_{D_{train}}\right)-R(A_{D_{test}})] \tag{8}\]

\[\delta_{gen}\leq\Psi\left(\beta,\theta,\frac{1}{n_{t}},L\right) \tag{9}\]

**Theorem 1** (Generalization Gap of SGNN).: \[\delta_{gen}\leq 2\alpha_{L}^{x}+\frac{\sqrt{2}\alpha_{L}^{y}M\beta(\theta+t \eta\alpha_{L}^{x}\alpha_{f}\beta)}{n_{t}}\] (10)

Here \(\beta\) refers to the infinite norm of the matrix \(Z\), \(\theta\) refers to paradigm of initial weight matrix \(\|w_{init}\|\). \(R()\) is the error function and \(L\) is the loss function. The generalization ability is mainly influenced by scale of the graph(the number of nodes and edges) and the norm of weights matrix. In the main result, \(t\) is the number of iterations in training, \(eta\) is the learning rate, \(\alpha_{L}\), \(\alpha_{f}\), \(M\) are constants determined by the non-linear activation function, function \(g\) and function \(f\) respectively.

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we commence by assessing the enhancements brought about by SGA in comparison to diverse backbone models for the link sign prediction task. We will answer the following questions:

* **Q1**: Can SGA improve the performance of backbone models? Does SGA effectively alleviate issues related to graph sparsity and the presence of unbalanced triangles?

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

Regarding unbalanced triangles, we conduct a statistical analysis, as shown in Table 3. The calculation of balance degree is based on Definition 3.1. From the statistical results, it can be seen that in most cases, SGA indeed reduces the number of unbalanced triangles, improving the balance degree of real-world datasets.

In addition to the statistical results, we also validated the effectiveness of SGA through the case study illustrated in Figure 4. Both of these two cases are from Bitcoin-alpha dataset. Case 1 verifies that SGA, by exploring latent structures, assists SGCN in correctly predicting the sign of edge (\(e_{144,130},e_{130,147}\)) that are originally mispredicted. Case 2 indicates that SGA, by changing the signs of edges (\(e_{67,12}\)) in existing structures, reduces the impact of unbalanced triangles, allowing the model to achieve correct prediction results (\(e_{67,1536}\)).

### Ablation Study (Q2)

In this section, we explore how different parts of SGA, contribute to its overall effectiveness. We do this by testing the SGCN [11] under various settings:

* **SGCN:** Here, we use the SGCN in its basic form. It works directly on the original graph data without any additional techniques or modifications.
* **+SA (Structure Augmentation, refer to Sec. 3.1 and Sec. 3.2):** SGCN operates on augmented datasets. This augmentation involves the addition or removal of edges from the initial graph.
* **+TP (Training Plan, refer to Sec. 3.3):** SGCN runs on the original graph but with a modified training paradigm. Adopting a curriculum learning approach, we rank edges by their difficulty. The model is then progressively exposed to these edges, transitioning from simpler to more challenging ones as training epochs progress.
* **+SGA(Combining both the structural augmentation and the tailored training plan)** The SGCN runs on augmented graph using a curriculum learning training plan.

Our thorough ablation study, detailed in Table 4 and conducted across six benchmark datasets, reveals several insights:

* **Importance of Structural Augmentation:** This strategy proves crucial for improving model performance. In almost all cases, using only structural augmentation leads to better results than the baseline model, which is trained on the unmodified graph without any specific training strategy.

\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c c} \hline \hline Dataset & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Original} & \multicolumn{3}{c}{+SGA} \\ \cline{2-7}  & \# BT & \# UT & BD (\%) & \# BT & \# UT & BD (\%) \\ \hline Bitcoin-alpha & 52,126 & 6,971 & 88.20 & 63,535 & 5,060 & 92.58 \\ Bitcoin-oc & 75,460 & 9,292 & 89.04 & 72,105 & 9,289 & 88.60 \\ Epinions & 6,286,597 & 516,723 & 92.40 & 6,162,877 & 391,307 & 94.02 \\ Slashdot & 709,417 & 64,190 & 91.70 & 66,378 & 45,268 & 93.72 \\ Wiki-elec & 311,251 & 92,934 & 77.01 & 242,691 & 29,579 & 89.13 \\ Wiki-RfA & 603,753 & 195,532 & 75.54 & 491,458 & 84,840 & 85.38 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

* **Effect of the Training Plan Alone:** Implementing just the training plan, without other modifications, yields a smaller performance improvement compared to using structural augmentation alone.
* **Combined Advantages of Training Plan and Data Augmentation:** Combining the training plan with structural augmentation often enhances the benefits of each approach, yielding the largest performance gain on most of the datasets.

### Parameter Sensitivity Analysis (Q3)

In this subsection, we perform a sensitivity analysis focusing on six hyper-parameters: \(\epsilon^{+}_{del}\), \(\epsilon^{-}_{del}\), \(\epsilon^{+}_{add}\), \(\epsilon^{-}_{add}\) (these denote the probability thresholds for adding or removing positive/negative edges); \(T\) represents the number of intervals during the training process where more challenging edges are incrementally added to the training set; and \(\lambda_{0}\) designates the initial fraction of the easiest examples. Performance metrics for the SGCN model within the SGA framework, as measured by AUC across various hyper-parameter configurations, is illustrated in Figures 5. F1-binary, F1-macro and F1-micro scores are illustrated in Appendix K.

The figures reveal divergent patterns in AUC and F1 scores based on hyperparameter adjustments, with SGCN showing more significant variations on the Slashdot dataset compared to others. On a broader scale, the AUC is fairly consistent with changes to \(\epsilon^{+}_{del}\) and \(\epsilon^{-}_{add}\). Notably, as \(\epsilon^{-}_{del}\) or \(\epsilon^{+}_{add}\) rise, there's a tendency for the AUC to augment. Interestingly, AUC initially increases and then experiences a slight dip as \(\lambda_{0}\) rises. Regarding the F1 score, it is less sensitive to changes in \(\epsilon^{-}_{add}\), \(T\), and \(\lambda_{0}\), except for the case of the Slashdot dataset. In general, an increase in \(\epsilon^{-}_{del}\) and \(\epsilon^{+}_{add}\) boosts the F1 score. However, for \(\epsilon^{+}_{del}\), the optimal value can differ across datasets, typically lying between 0.1 and 0.4.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce the Signed Graph Augmentation framework (SGA), a novel approach designed to address two prominent issues in existing signed graph neural networks, namely, data

This framework has three main components: generating candidate training samples, selecting beneficial candidate training samples, and introducing a new feature (edge difficulty score) for training samples. Based on this new feature, we have designed a curriculum learning framework tailored for SGNNs. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, our SGA framework proves its effectiveness in boosting various models.

Experimental results of data augmentation through random structural perturbations

We employ three different random methods (random addition/removal of positive edges, random addition/removal of negative edges, and random sign-flipping of existing edges) were tested with the classic SGNN model, SGCN [11]. As is Shown in Figure 6, The results indicate that these random methods do not enhance SGCN performance, suggesting that data augmentation methods used in signed graph contrastive learning models [8, 29] do not readily extend to general SGNNs not using a contrastive learning paradigm.

## Appendix B Related Work

In this section, we will introduce two aspects related to this paper: signed graph neural networks and graph data augmentation.

### Signed Graph Neural Networks

Due to the widespread popularity of social media,signed networks have become ubiquitous.Therefore, the network representation of signed graphs has gained significant attention[37, 38, 29, 14, 39, 40]. Existing research has predominantly concentrated on tasks related to _link sign prediction_, while overlooking other crucial tasks like node classification [41], node ranking [42], and community detection [43]. Some signed graph embedding techniques, such as SNE [44], SIDE [45], SGDN [46], and ROSE [47], utilize random walks and linear probability methods to capture the positive and negative relationships within graphs.These techniques consider complex interactions between nodes when processing graph data, but they may not be sufficient to capture deep-seated relationships in signed graphs. With the further exploration of signed graphs, neural networks have also been applied to signed graph representation learning in recent years. There are some SGNN models based on GCN [9].For example,the first Signed Graph Neural Network (SGNN), SGCN [11], generalizes GCN to signed graphs by utilizing balance theory to correctly aggregate and propagate the information across layers of a signed GCN model. Another noteworthy GCN-based approach is GS-GNN, which moves beyond the traditional balance theory by categorizing nodes into multiple groups. Additionally, there are SGNN models based on GAT [48] such as SiGAT [32], SNEA [7], SDGNN [12], and SGCL [8],which further enhance the ability to identify the varying levels of importance of nodes in the graph by introducing attention mechanisms. Unlike the above methods dedicated to developing more advanced SGNN models, we introduce a plugin to enhance the performance of SGNNs.

### Graph Data Augmentation

With the rapid development of graph neural networks, there has been a growing interest and demand for graph data augmentation techniques. To address issues such as data sparsity and noise

Figure 6: Effectiveness of data augmentation through random structural perturbations (SGCN [11] as backbone model) on link sign prediction performance. (a) Randomly increasing or decreasing positive edges. (b) Randomly increasing or decreasing negative edges. (c) Randomly flipping the sign of edges.

in graphs, many research studies have focused on enhancing graph data augmentation techniques [49, 23, 24, 50, 51, 52]. According to a survey of graph data augmentation [53], graph augmentation methods can be classified into three types, i.e., feature-wise [24, 54, 55], structure-wise [56, 57, 58] and label-wise [59, 60]. Feature-wise augmentation methods primarily involve modifying, creating, or merging new features to enhance graph data. For example,LAGNN [24] operates by using a generative model that takes into account the localized neighborhood information of a target node to enrich the node's features. Other feature-wise methods [61, 25] generate augmented node features by random shuffling. Structure-wise augmentation methods target at modifying edges and nodes (e.g., randomly adding or deleting edges) to simulate different graph structures. GAUG [22] employs neural edge predictors that can effectively encode class-homophilic structure to promote intra-class edges and demote inter-class edges in a given graph structure. GraphSMOTE [62] inserts nodes to enrich the minority classes. Graph diffusion method (GDC [63]) can generate an augmented graph by providing global views of the underlying structure. Label-wise augmentation methods aim at augmenting the limited labeled training data,especially in cases where labeled data is scarce in graph data. G-Mixup [23] augment graphs for graph classification by interpolating the generator (i.e., graphon) of different classes of graphs.Note that these existing data augmentation methods rely on additional information such as node features and labels. However, the absence of key information such as node features and labels in signed graphs limits the applicability of traditional data augmentation techniques to SGNN. Therefore, it is necessary to develop data augmentation strategies tailored for signed graphs.

Theory Analysis

### Basic Setup

Before the proof begins, the framework of the SGNN for edge prediction is given in Algorithm 2. A network first performs feature aggregation, where each node learns the representations of its neighboring nodes, and subsequently uses the feature representations of several pairs of nodes as inputs to a classifier for predicting the nature of the edges connecting these two nodes. Before the proof begins, we show the framework of the SGNN for edge prediction below.

0: the adjacency matrix \(A\in\mathbb{R}^{|V|\times|V|}\) of graph \(\mathcal{G}\), number of aggregation layers \(L\), weight matrix \(w\)
2:Output: Label prediction of edge \(e_{i,j}\)
3:\(H_{0}\)=\(A\)
4:for\(l=0\to L-1\)do
5:\(H_{l+1}=p(H_{l},w)=\sum_{\nu_{i}\in\mathcal{N}^{+},\nu_{j}\in\mathcal{N}^{-}} aggregate(\nu,\nu_{i})+aggregate(\nu,\nu_{j})\)
6:endfor
7:\(Z=H_{L}\)// Classifier \(\hat{\sigma}\left(e_{ij}\right)=f\left(z_{i},z_{j},w\right)\)
8: Upgrade parameters based on loss function return\(\hat{A}_{ij}\)
```

**Algorithm 2**Simplified SGNN Framework

A network first performs feature aggregation, where each node learns the representations of its neighboring nodes, and subsequently uses the feature representations of several pairs of nodes as inputs to a classifier for predicting the edges connecting these two nodes. Here, \(z_{i}\),\(z_{j}\) denote the i-th and j-th rows respectively, in matrix \(Z\) and \(\hat{A}_{ij}\) is the predicted label of edge \(e_{ij}\). These vectors correspond to the node representations learned through graph filters in traditional GNNs. But actually SGNN does not have representations for each node, and this is done here to more clearly represent the variables that affect the generalization performance during the proof process next.

### Assumptions

\(l\)**-Lipschitz Continuous and Smooth Loss Function**: A function \(f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{1}\)-Lipschitz continuous if for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{X}\), \(|f(x)-f(y)|\leqslant\alpha_{1}\|x-y\|\). A function \(f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{2}\)-Lipschitz smooth if for all \(x,y\in\mathbb{X}\), \(|f^{\prime}(x)-f^{\prime}(y)|\leqslant\alpha_{2}\|x-y\|\), where \(f^{\prime}\) represents the differential function of \(f\), and \(\|\cdot\|\) represents the 2-norm.

Similarly, for functions of three variables, a function \(f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{1}\)-Lipschitz continuous if for all \(x,y,z\in\mathbb{X}\), \(|f\left(x_{i},y_{i},z\right)-f\left(x_{j},y_{j},z\right)|\leq\alpha_{1}\sqrt{ \left(x_{i}-x_{j}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{i}-y_{j}\right)^{2}}\). A function \(f:\mathbb{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) is \(\boldsymbol{\alpha}_{2}\)-Lipschitz smooth if for all \(x,y,z\in\mathbb{X}\), \(|f^{\prime}(x_{i},y_{i},z)-f^{\prime}(x_{j},y_{j},z)|\leq\alpha_{2}\sqrt{ \left(x_{i}-x_{j}\right)^{2}+\left(y_{i}-y_{j}\right)^{2}}\). We assume that the loss function \(L()\), \(f()\), \(g()\), satisfies the Lipschitz condition.

Actually, in simple terms, Lipschitz continuity portrays how smooth the function is, ensuring that the function does not have too steep a slope or abrupt changes: in the event of a small change in the input value, the change in the output value is also limited to a certain range.

In practice, regularization, normalization, gradient trimming, and other methods of keeping the model stable actually limit the drastic changes in the function, which means that the assumption is easily satisfied.

**Training set and Test set**: Training data is usually easier to obtain than test data. In the link prediction task, the training set contains more edges and can simulate the data distribution in real scenarios, while the test set is used to validate the performance of the model in real applications. It is also taken into account that if the number of edges in the test set is too high, it may cause the evaluation results to be skewed towards the distribution of the training set, which does not accurately reflect the generalization ability of the model. So we assume that the training set has more edges than the test set.

## Appendix F Proof of Theorem 1

In this section, we will present the entire proof of our main result about the generalization gap bound. Similar as proof of theorem 1[[64], Theorem 1], we have:

\[\delta_{gen} =E_{A}\left[R\left(A_{D_{main}}\right)-R\left(A_{D_{set}}\right)\right] \tag{11}\] \[=\left|\frac{1}{n_{t}}\sum_{e_{ij}\in e_{t}^{+}\cup e_{t}^{-}}L \left(\hat{A}_{ij},A_{ij}\right)-\frac{1}{n_{m}}\sum_{e_{pq}\in e_{m}^{+}\cup e _{m}^{-}}L\left(\hat{A}_{pq},A_{pq}\right)\right|\] \[\stackrel{{\rm(a)}}{{\leq}} \frac{1}{n_{t}}\left|\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}L\left(\hat{A}_{ij},A_{ ij}\right)-L\left(\hat{A}_{pq},A_{pq}\right)\right|\]

The loss function we use is based on link sign prediction, where \(n_{t}\),\(n_{m}\) is the number of edges in training set and test set respectively. Step (a) is the application of our assumption. In learning process, the number of edges in test set is always lower than it in training set. Therefore, we get Equation (11). Then using absolute value inequality, we have:

\[\left|\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}L\Big{(}\hat{A}_{ij},A_{ij}\Big{)}-L \Big{(}\hat{A}_{pq},A_{pq}\Big{)}\right| \tag{12}\] \[\leq\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\left|L\Big{(}\hat{A}_{ij},A_{ij}\Big{)}- L\Big{(}\hat{A}_{ij},A_{pq}\Big{)}\right|+\left|L\Big{(}\hat{A}_{ij},A_{pq}\Big{)} -L\Big{(}\hat{A}_{pq},A_{pq}\Big{)}\right|\] \[\stackrel{{\rm(b)}}{{\leq}} \sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\alpha_{L}^{x}\Big{|}A_{ij}-A_{pq}\Big{|}+\alpha_{L}^ {y}\Big{|}\hat{A}_{ij}-\hat{A}_{pq}\Big{|}\]

Step (b) uses the Lipshitz-continuity of loss function \(L\Big{(}\hat{A},A\Big{)}\). Next, we consider the first item. As \(A_{ij},A_{pq}\in\{1,-1,0\}\) signifies the original sign and the predicted sign of the edge \(e_{ij}\), obviously we get the upper bound: \(\max|A_{ij}-A_{pq}|\)=2.

For the last item, according to the process of link prediction:

\[\hat{A}_{ij}=\hat{\sigma}(e_{ij})=f(z_{i},z_{j},w) \tag{13}\]

Continuing to use the Lipschitz-continuity of the function \(f()\), we get:

\[\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\alpha_{L}^{y}\left|\hat{A}_{ij}-\hat{A}_{pq}\right| \tag{14}\] \[\leq\alpha_{L}^{y}\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\left|f\Big{(}z_{i},z_{j}, w\Big{)}-f\Big{(}z_{p},z_{q},w\Big{)}\right|\] \[\stackrel{{\rm(c)}}{{\leq}} \alpha_{L}^{y}M\|w\|\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\sqrt{\left(z_{i}^{2}-z_{ p}^{2}\right)+\left(z_{j}^{2}-z_{q}^{2}\right)}\] \[\leq\alpha_{L}^{y}M\|w\|\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\sqrt{z_{i}^{2}+z_{j }^{2}}\] \[\leq\sqrt{2}\alpha_{L}^{y}M\|w\|\sum_{e_{ij},e_{pq}}\|Z\|_{\infty}\]

Here, Step (c) is an extension of the Lipschitz-condition for multivariate functions. Similar to \(\alpha_{L}^{y}\) and \(\alpha_{L}^{x}\), \(M\) is constant determined only by the function \(f()\) itself. We will subsequently prove the existence of the constant \(M\) in the proof of Lemma 1.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly reflect the motivation and main contributions of this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please see the limitation part in introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation, while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: The main theoretical result is Theorem 1. For the complete proof, please refer to Appendix G and F.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to the code link provided in the abstract section and the experiment setting in the _Experiments_ section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to the code link provided in the abstract section. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to the **Baselines and Experiment Setting** Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use average improvement ratio to represent the statistical significance and calculate the results with average and standard deviation. (Please refer to Table 1) Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to the **Baselines and Experiment Setting** part. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: **Baselines and Experiment Setting** Justification: Please refer to the code link provided in the abstract section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to the introduction part. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have given proper citations or URLs to those existing datasets and codes 1451 of baselines. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
