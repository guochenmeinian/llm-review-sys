###### Abstract

We study the problem of PAC learning \(\gamma\)-margin halfspaces with Massart noise. We propose a simple proper learning algorithm, the Perspectron, that has sample complexity \(\widetilde{O}((\epsilon\gamma)^{-2})\) and achieves classification error at most \(\eta+\epsilon\) where \(\eta\) is the Massart noise rate. Prior works [1, 2] came with worse sample complexity guarantees (in both \(\epsilon\) and \(\gamma\)) or could only handle random classification noise [1, 2] -- a much milder noise assumption. We also show that our results extend to the more challenging setting of learning generalized linear models with a known link function under Massart noise, achieving a similar sample complexity to the halfspace case. This significantly improves upon the prior state-of-the-art in this setting due to [2], who introduced this model.

## 1 Introduction

We study the problem of learning halfspaces with a margin, one of the oldest problems in the field of machine learning dating to work of Rosenblatt [14]. Specifically, we consider the following formulation of this problem, where the label distribution is corrupted by Massart noise [15], where we use the following notation for halfspace hypotheses \(h_{\mathbf{w}}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\{\pm 1\}\):

\[h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}):=\operatorname{sign}\left(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x} \right),\text{ for }\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}. \tag{1}\]

**Definition 1** (Massart halfspace model).: _Let \(\eta\in[0,\frac{1}{2}]\) and \(\gamma\in(0,1)\). We say that a distribution \(D\) on \(\mathbb{B}^{d}\times\{\pm 1\}\) is an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\) if the following hold._

* _There exists_ \(\mathbf{w}^{*}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) _such that_ \(\|\mathbf{w}^{*}\|=1\)_,_4 _and_ \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\) _has margin_ \(\gamma\) _with respect to_ \(\mathbf{w}^{*}\)_,_5 _i.e.,_ \(\mathbf{Pr}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}[|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|< \gamma]=0\)_._ Footnote 4: This normalization is made for convenience, as the noise assumption of Definition 1 is scale-invariant.
* _For all_ \(\mathbf{x}\in\operatorname{supp}(D_{\mathbf{x}})\)_, there is an_ \(\eta(\mathbf{x})\in[0,\eta]\) _such that_ \(\mathbf{Pr}\left[y\neq h_{\mathbf{w}^{*}}(\mathbf{x})\mid\mathbf{x}\right]= \eta(\mathbf{x})\)_._

We note that Definition 1 extends straightforwardly to general halfspaces up to rescaling (i.e., with larger domain size bounds and constant shift terms), as discussed in Remark 2.

The _Massart noise_ model of Definition 1 for halfspaces (and more generally, binary classification problems) has garnered interest from the statistics, machine learning, and algorithms communities for a variety of reasons. This noise model was originally introduced as an intermediate noise model, between the simpler (from an algorithmic design standpoint) _random classification noise_ (RCN) model [1], and the more challenging _agnostic_ model [13, 20]. In the RCN model, \(\eta(\mathbf{x})\) in Definition 1 is restricted to be \(\eta\) pointwise, i.e., the noise level is uniform; polynomial-time PAC learning has long since known to be tractable under RCN [14, 15]. On the other hand, in the agnostic model (where learning is computationally intractable under well-studied conjectures [15, 16, 17]), an adversary is allowed to arbitrarily modify an \(\eta\) fraction of labels. As observed by [14], the Massart noise model of Definition 1 is equivalent to allowing an _oblivious_ adversary control an \(\eta\) fraction of labels, where the \(\eta\) fraction is crucially sampled independently at random. It was stated as a longstanding open question [13, 12] whether this obliviousness of the adversary impacts the polynomial-time tractability of learning halfspaces, even with a margin.

For additional motivation, it is reasonable to consider Massart noise to be a more realistic model of real-life noise (even when benign) when compared to the RCN model, as it allows for some amount of non-uniformity. This made Definition 1 a possibly tractable way to relax the noise assumption, without running into the aforementioned computational barriers for agnostic learning. In a series of recent exciting developments, in large part spurred by the breakthrough work of [13] who gave an (improper) polynomial-time PAC learning algorithm in the Massart halfspace model, significant algorithmic advances have been made towards understanding the polynomial-time tractability of learning under Massart noise [1, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]. However, less is understood about the fine-grained sample and computational complexity of these problems, which is potentially of greater interest from a practical perspective.

We investigate this question of fine-grained complexity for the Massart halfspace model, inspired by a line of recent work on _semi-random models_[14], a popular framework for understanding the overfitting of algorithms to their modeling assumptions. To motivate semi-random models, observe that from a purely information-theoretic standpoint, one might suspect that learning under Massart noise is actually _easier_ than RCN; the noise level \(\eta(\mathbf{x})\) is only allowed to decrease, giving more "signal" with respect to \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\). However, this modification poses challenges when designing algorithms, e.g., because it breaks independence between \(y\) and \(\mathbf{x}\) beyond the value \(\operatorname{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})\). Indeed, this is reflected in our current knowledge of halfspace learning algorithms. While it is known that one can learn halfspaces with margin \(\gamma\) under the RCN model to \(\epsilon\) error (in the zero-one loss) using \(\widetilde{O}((\epsilon\gamma)^{-2})\) samples [13, 14], state-of-the-art learners under Massart noise use \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-3})\) samples (if required to be proper) [14] or \(\widetilde{O}(\min(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-3},\gamma^{-3}\epsilon^{-5}))\) samples (otherwise) [13]. The semi-random model framework posits that this discrepancy reflects a lack of robustness in the current algorithmic theory for learning halfspaces, due to their overfitting to the RCN assumption.

For many statistical learning problems, new algorithms have been developed under semi-random modeling assumptions, with guarantees matching, or nearly-matching, classical algorithms under the corresponding fully random models [15, 16, 17], state-of-the-art learners under Massart noise use \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-3})\) samples our motivating problem, which aims to accomplish this goal for learning halfspaces.

_Is it possible to design algorithms for learning in the Massart halfspace model with sample complexities matching the state-of-the-art for learning in the RCN model?_

### Our results

As our main contribution, we resolve (2) in the affirmative in the setting of Definition 1. We also extend our results a substantial generalization of this model in Definition 2.

Massart halfspace model.We begin with our basic result in the setting of the Massart halfspace model, Definition 1. Our goal in this setting is to find a _proper_ hypothesis halfspace \(h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})=\operatorname{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\) for \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{B}^{d}\), achieving good zero-one loss \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}\) (see Section 2 for a definition) over examples \((\mathbf{x},y)\) drawn from the distribution \(D\). Our main result to this end is the following.

**Theorem 1** (Informal, see Theorem 3).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\), and let \(\epsilon\in(0,1)\). Then, Perspectron (Algorithm 1) returns \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{B}^{d}\) such that \(\ell_{0\cdot 1}(\mathbf{w})\leq\eta+\epsilon\) with probability \(0.99\),6 using \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})\) samples and \(\widetilde{O}(d\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-4})\) time._

Footnote 6: The formal variant, Theorem 3, gives high-probability bounds at a mild polylogarithmic overhead in sample and runtime complexities.

We pause to comment on Theorem 1. First, our error guarantee is of the form \(\eta+\epsilon\) rather than the more stringent goal of \(\ell_{0\cdot 1}(\mathbf{w}^{\star})+\epsilon=\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{ \mathbf{x}}}[\eta(\mathbf{x})]+\epsilon\). There is strong evidence that this distinction is necessary for polynomial-time algorithms in the statistical query (SQ) framework of [13], which our algorithm is an instance of, due to [12, 10, 11]. Next, the sample complexity bound of Theorem 1 matches the results of [13, 10], the state-of-the-art under the milder RCN model. There is evidence that the dependences in Theorem 1 on both \(\epsilon^{-1}\) and \(\gamma^{-1}\) are individually tight. In particular, [14] shows the sample complexity of the problem is \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-1})\), and [13] shows any efficient algorithm in the SQ framework must use \(\widetilde{\Omega}(\gamma^{-1/2}\epsilon^{-2})\) samples. We also remark that we can assume without loss of generality that \(\eta\) is known (see Appendix B.1).

Finally, as mentioned, prior to our work, the best-known polynomial-time learners under Definition 1 had sample complexities \(\widetilde{O}(\min(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-3},\gamma^{-3}\epsilon^{-5}))\)[12, 13]. In Table 1, we summarize relevant sample complexity bounds for learning variants of halfspace models with noise.

Massart generalized linear models.Our second result is an extension of Theorem 1 to the more challenging setting of learning generalized linear models (GLMs) with a known link function \(\sigma\) under Massart noise. As before, we only consider distributions that have a margin with respect to the optimal halfspace. We now formally define the setting we study.

**Definition 2** (Massart GLM).: _Let \(\sigma:[-1,1]\to[-1,1]\) be an odd, non-decreasing function. We say that a distribution \(D\) on \(\mathbb{B}^{d}\times\{\pm 1\}\) is an instance of the \(\sigma\)-Massart generalized linear model (GLM) with margin \(\gamma\) if the following conditions hold._

1. _There exists_ \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) _such that_ \(\|\mathbf{w}^{\star}\|=1\) _and_ \(\mathbf{Pr}[|\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x}|<\gamma]=0\)_._
2. _For all_ \(\mathbf{x}\in\text{supp}(D_{\mathbf{x}})\)_, it holds that_ \(\eta(\mathbf{x}):=\mathbf{Pr}[y\neq h_{\mathbf{w}^{\star}}(\mathbf{x})\mid \mathbf{x}]\leq\frac{1-|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})|}{2}\)_._

**Remark 1**.: _We remark that the assumption that \(\sigma\) is odd is also commonly used in prior works (see, e.g., [12, 13, 14]). We further show that our result extends to \(\sigma\) with bounded asymmetry, albeit with a weaker error guarantee (see Definition 3 and Theorem 4)._

To provide intuition for Definition 2, observe that that if \(\eta(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1-|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})|}{2}\) for some \(\mathbf{x}\in\text{supp}(D_{\mathbf{x}})\), then \(\mathbf{E}\left[y\mid\mathbf{x}\right]=|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot \mathbf{x})|\text{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})=\sigma(\mathbf{w}^ {\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})\), i.e., Definition 2 corresponds to the standard GLM definition. In Definition 2 (compared to Definition 1), we replace the fixed noise rate upper bound \(\eta\) with a data-dependent upper bound which is monotone (i.e., decreases as \(|\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x}|\) grows more confident). That is, Definition 2 generalizes the problem of learning Massart halfspaces, which follows by taking \(\sigma(t)=(1-2\eta)\text{sign}(t)\) for all \(t\in[-1,1]\).

When working with a Massart GLM \(D\), we define \(\mathrm{opt}_{\text{RCN}}:=\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}[\frac{1-|\sigma( \mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})|}{2}]\). Note that in the special case of a Massart halfspace model, we simply have \(\mathrm{opt}_{\text{RCN}}=\eta\). As in the case of Massart halfspace

spaces, known SQ lower bounds make competing with \(\operatorname{opt}:=\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w}^{\star}):=\mathbf{Pr}_{(\mathbf{x},y) \sim D}\left[y\neq h_{\mathbf{w}^{\star}}(x)\right]\) an intractable target, so our focus is again on attaining \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\approx\operatorname{opt}_{\text{RCN}}\).

To our knowledge, the model in Definition2 was first studied in [20], though we note that similar models have been considered in prior works [21, 22, 23], which we describe and compare to Definition2 in Section1.3. In [20], the parameterization of this model is slightly different; they assume \(\sigma\) is \(L\)-Lipschitz and that \(\mathbf{Pr}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}[|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot \mathbf{x})|\geq\gamma]=1\), i.e., they impose a margin on \(\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})\) rather than \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x}\). This implies our margin assumption (with \(\gamma\leftarrow\frac{\gamma}{L}\) in Definition2), but not vice versa. Under their slightly more restrictive assumptions, [20] claims a runtime which is an unspecified polynomial in \(L\gamma^{-1}\epsilon^{-1}\), that is at least \(\widetilde{\Omega}(L^{4}\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-6})\) when specialized to the halfspace case (see their Theorems5.2 and 6.14). On the other hand, we achieve improved rates extending our simple algorithmic approach for the Massart halfspace case in this more challenging setting.

**Theorem 2** (Informal, see Theorem4).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\sigma\)-Massart GLM with margin \(\gamma\), and let \(\epsilon\in(0,1)\). There is an algorithm returning \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) so that \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\leq\operatorname{opt}_{\text{RCN}}+\epsilon\) with probability \(0.99\), using \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-4})\) samples and \(\widetilde{O}(d\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-6})\) time._

In particular, parameterizing our problem using the margin and Lipschitz assumptions in [20] (with \(\gamma\leftarrow\frac{\gamma}{L}\)), we obtain an improved sample complexity of \(\widetilde{O}(L^{2}\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-4})\).

### Technical overview

Learning Massart halfspaces.Our learning algorithms are inspired by the certificate framework for learning with semi-random noise developed in [23, 20]. In that framework, given a sub-optimal hypothesis \(\mathbf{w}\), i.e., with error \(\mathbf{Pr}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}[\operatorname{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{ x})\neq y]\geq\eta+\epsilon\), the goal is to construct a certificate of sub-optimality in the form of a separating hyperplane between \(\mathbf{w}\) and the target \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\), i.e., a vector \(\mathbf{g}\) such that \(\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{w}\geq\mathbf{g}\cdot\mathbf{w}^{\star}\iff\mathbf{g} \cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{\star})\geq 0\). Given such a separating hyperplane, prior works rely on cutting-plane methods (e.g., [18]) or on first-order regret minimization methods to learn a hypothesis achieving the target error.

We first describe our algorithm in the halfspace setting, by motivating our choice of a certificate. Prior work [20] achieving a proper Massart halfspace learner uses the gradient of the Leaky-ReLU objective \(\ell_{\eta}(t):=(1-\eta)\max(0,t)-\eta\max(0,-t)\) conditioned on a band around the current hypothesis \(\mathbf{w}\) as a separating hyperplane. That is, they argue that for some appropriate interval \(I\), it holds that \(\mathbf{E}[\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\mid\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{w}\in I]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{\star})\geq 0\). This yields a sample complexity scaling as \(\widetilde{O}(\epsilon^{-3})\) because one has to sample conditionally from the band \(I\) and estimate the gradient of the Leaky-ReLU on these samples up to error \(\epsilon\), as well as additional overhead in \(\gamma^{-1}\) due to use of expensive outer loops taking advantage of these certificates, such as cutting-plane methods.

To avoid the sample complexity overhead of this conditioning (implemented via rejection sampling), we use a simple reweighting scheme pointwise, which puts a larger weight of \(|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\) (an inverse margin) on points closer to the boundary of our current hypothesis \(h_{\mathbf{w}}\). Intuitively, this reweighting is a soft implementation of the hard conditioning done in [20]. This is motivated by our first important observation: any significantly sub-optimal hypothesis \(\mathbf{w}\) with \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\) satisfies

\[\mathbf{E}\left[\frac{\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{| \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{\star})\geq\epsilon,\]

proven in Lemma1. This suggests using \(\mathbf{g}=\mathbf{E}[\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})|\mathbf{ w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|^{-1}]\) (rather than \(\mathbf{E}[\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\mid\mathbf{x}\cdot \mathbf{w}\in I]\) as in [20]) as our certificate, which we can estimate via a single sample.

While reweighting by the inverse margin \(|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\) gives a separating hyperplane certificate, it may be impossible to estimate this certificate from few samples, e.g., if the weight \(|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\) is often very large, which introduces significant variance. For instance, even if \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\) has margin with respect to a target \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\), this is not necessarily true with respect to the current hypothesis \(\mathbf{w}\) (without further distributional assumptions on \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\)). To overcome this, we change our pointwise reweighting to be less aggressive and instead use \((|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma)^{-1}\). In Lemma2, we exploit the margin assumption about \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\) to show that when \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\), it is still the case that \(\mathbf{E}[\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})(|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|+\gamma)^{-1}]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{\star})\geq\epsilon\). Moreover, we still have an unbiased estimator for this separating hyperplane \(\mathbf{E}[\nabla\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})(|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|+\gamma)^{-1}]\), and the estimator is bounded in Euclidean norm by \(\gamma^{-1}\) with probability \(1\) by our margin assumption.

Standard concentration inequalities now show \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-2})\) samples suffice to obtain a separation oracle with high probability. Plugging this certificate into oracle-efficient cutting-plane methods (e.g., [20]) implies an algorithm with sample complexity \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-2})\) (after a random projection process [1] to reduce to \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2})\) dimensions). This already improves upon the prior best-known \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-4}\epsilon^{-3})\) sample complexity. We further improve our dependence on \(\gamma\) by using it in a perceptron-like regret minimization scheme, where at every step we update the current hypothesis \(\mathbf{w}\) using the aforementioned bounded unbiased estimator of our certificate, see Lemma3 and Algorithm1. Overall, our algorithm iterates the following _very simple update_ for a step-size \(\lambda>0\) and \(\beta:=1-2\eta\):

\[\mathbf{w}^{(t+1)}\leftarrow\mathbf{w}^{(t)}-\lambda(\beta\mathrm{sign}( \mathbf{w}^{(t)}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{(t)})-y^{(t)})\frac{\mathbf{x}^{(t)}}{| \mathbf{w}^{(t)}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{(t)}|+\gamma}\quad\text{ with }\quad\mathbf{w}^{(0 )}\leftarrow\mathbf{0}\,. \tag{3}\]

Since at every step we perform an (approximate) perspective projection \((|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma)^{-1}\) on our sample, we call Algorithm1 which iterates the update in Equation3 the \(\mathsf{Perspectron}\).

Learning Massart GLMs.For learning Massart GLMs (Definition2), we use a similar certificate-based approach. While it is simple to show reweighting with the inverse margin \(|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|^{-1}\) still works in this case (see Lemma5), using the bounded reweighting \((|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma)^{-1}\) does not. Instead we use a new reweighting of of the form \((|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\alpha\gamma)\) where \(\alpha=O(\epsilon)\) (see Lemma6). Using a similar iterative method as the \(\mathsf{Perspectron}\) defined in (3), we obtain our sample complexity of \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-4})\) for learning Massart GLMs.

### Related work

We briefly survey some additional related works here. First, a common worst-case assumption used in statistical learning is that the label noise is adversarial (a.k.a. agnostic) [14]. In that setting, a lot of progress has been made for learning halfspaces when the underlying distribution satisfies structural assumptions (e.g., it is Gaussian or log-concave) [13, 1, 1, 2, 3, 14]. For learning halfspaces with a margin, the best-known agnostic results have runtime and sample complexity that depend exponentially on the margin \(\gamma\) and/or the accuracy parameter \(\epsilon\)[29, 1, 14]. Another important line of work [14, 15] has focused on learning halfspaces under Tsybakov noise: a semi-random noise model that extends Massart noise, but is still easier than the agnostic setting. We also note that variants of Definition2 have appeared before: the _generalized Tsybakov low noise condition_ of [14] is a close relative which imposes different noise rates within and outside a margin, and the _strong Massart noise_ of [13, 15] is an instance of Definition2 without the margin restriction.

Our algorithms rely on the certificate framework developed in [14, 15] and the Leaky-ReLU loss that has been extensively used in prior works on learning with random classification and Massart label noise [13, 15, 16, 17]. Our main technical contribution is a new certificate that relies on an inverse-margin reweighting scheme and can be estimated using a single sample at every iteration. Similar, "inverse-margin" reweighting schemes have been used for learning general halfspaces [15] and online linear classification [14]. Those results have no implications for the sample complexity of the problem studied here. Finally, we mention that a local reweighting scheme that is somewhat similar in spirit to ours (but very different in its implementation) was previously employed by [14], for a different semi-random statistical learning problem.

### Limitations and open problems

One interesting open direction is providing improved sample complexity guarantees for more general noise models. For example, the misspecified GLM framework (Definition3.2, [15]) generalizes Definition2 to include an additional misspecification parameter \(\zeta\) such that \(\eta(\mathbf{x})\leq\frac{1-|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})|}{2}+\zeta\). Our approach does not directly apply in this setting, since \(\zeta=0\) is important for our separation oracle result of Lemma6. A different interesting generalization of the noise model corresponds to the case where the link function \(\sigma\) is unknown, which the [15] algorithm can handle (at a much higher sample complexity). While our algorithms require knowledge of \(\sigma\), it would be interesting to explore whether techniques from learning single-index models (e.g., [13, 16]) can be used to extend our algorithms in this setting.

A clear next step is to design efficient algorithms with sample complexities independent of the margin but still linear in the dimension \(d\).7, e.g., with an \(\approx d\epsilon^{-2}\) sample complexity. In prior work [1] such an algorithm is given, albeit with a significantly worse \(\mathrm{poly}(d\epsilon^{-1})\) sample complexity.

Footnote 7: By standard random-projection procedures [1], the dimension \(d\) is comparable to \(\gamma^{-2}\) under a \(\gamma\)-margin assumption, and therefore our sample complexity is nearly-linear in the “dimension.”

## 2 Preliminaries

We denote vectors in lower-case boldface, and \(\|\mathbf{x}\|\) is the Euclidean norm of \(\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\). We use \(\mathbb{B}^{d}\) to denote the unit ball in \(\mathbb{R}^{d}\), i.e. \(\mathbb{B}^{d}:=\{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid\|\mathbf{x}\|\leq 1\}\). We use \(\mathbf{\Pi}_{\mathbb{B}^{d}}(\mathbf{w}):=\min\{1,\frac{1}{\|\mathbf{w}\|} \}\mathbf{w}\) to denote the Euclidean projection of a vector \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) onto \(\mathbb{B}^{d}\). We let \(\mathbb{O}_{d}\) be the all-zeroes vector in dimension \(d\). We reserve the overline notation \(\bar{\mathbf{x}}\) to denote the unit vector in the direction of \(\mathbf{x}\), i.e. \(\bar{\mathbf{x}}:=\frac{\mathbf{x}}{\|\mathbf{x}\|}\). We let \(\mathrm{sign}:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\{\pm 1\}\) be defined so \(\mathrm{sign}(t)=1\) iff \(t\geq 0\). We use \(\mathbb{1}\{\mathcal{E}\}\) to denote the \(0\)-\(1\) indicator of a random event \(\mathcal{E}\), \(\mathbf{Pr}[\mathcal{E}]\) to denote its probability, and \(\mathbf{E}\) to denote the expectation operator. The support of a distribution \(D\) is denoted \(\mathrm{supp}(D)\), and \([N]:=\{i\in\mathbb{N}\mid i\leq N\}\).

Throughout the paper we study the problem of learning a binary classifier, given labeled examples from a distribution \(D\) over labeled examples \((\mathbf{x},y)\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\times\{0,1\}\), under various models on the distribution to be discussed. We refer to the \(\mathbf{x}\)-marginal of \(D\) by \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\), and the conditional distribution of the label \(y\mid\mathbf{x}\) by \(D_{y}(\mathbf{x})\). We will primarily be interested in learning halfspace hypotheses, which for \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) are the corresponding functions \(h_{\mathbf{w}}:\mathbb{R}^{d}\rightarrow\{\pm 1\}\) defined by \(h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x}):=\mathrm{sign}\left(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right)\). We also denote the _zero-one loss_ of a halfspace hypothesis \(h_{\mathbf{w}}\) corresponding to \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) as follows, when the distribution \(D\) over labeled examples is clear from context: \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w}):=\mathbf{Pr}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[h_{ \mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})\neq y\right]\). We define the Leaky-ReLU function with parameter \(\lambda>0\) as \(\ell_{\lambda}(t):=(1-\lambda)\max(0,t)-\lambda\max(0,-t)\). Given vectors \(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{x}\) and \(y\in\{\pm 1\}\), it holds that the (sub) gradient of \(\ell_{\lambda}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\) with respect to \(\mathbf{w}\) is \(\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{\lambda}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2}(( 1-2\lambda)\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-y)\cdot\mathbf{x}\). We also provide some brief remarks on how to extend Definition 1 to more general settings here.

**Remark 2**.: _Definition 1 extends straightforwardly to the case where \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\) has margin \(\gamma\) and is supported on a subset of \(R\cdot\mathbb{B}^{d}\) for \(R\neq 1\), by rescaling so \(R\gets 1\) and \(\gamma\leftarrow\frac{\gamma}{R}\), as halfspace hypotheses and our label noise assumptions only depend on signs. Other than these margin and support assumptions, we make no additional distributional assumptions about the \(\mathbf{x}\)-marginal \(D_{\mathbf{x}}\). Further, due to working in the distributional assumption-free setting, we can assume with up to constant factor loss(in margin) that the halfspace is homogeneous, i.e., has no constant shift term. That is, given a halfspace \(\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}+b)\) with \(\|\mathbf{w}\|\,,|b|\leq 1\), after a feature expansion (\(e:\mathbf{x}\mapsto\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mathbf{x},1)\)) the halfspace \(h_{\mathbf{w}^{\prime}}(\mathbf{z})=\mathrm{sign}((\mathbf{w},b)\cdot\mathbf{ z})\) is homogeneous while still having a margin \(\geq\frac{\gamma}{2}\) with respect to \(\mathbf{w}^{\prime}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+b^{2}}}(\mathbf{w},b)\). Finally, the Massart noise model of [13] is defined for any hypothesis class and is not tied to halfspaces. Since we focus on learning halfspaces with a margin, we combined the hypothesis class \(\{h_{\mathbf{w}}\}_{\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}}\) with the noise model in Definition 1 for simplicity._

## 3 Massart halfspaces

In this section, we give our result on learning Massart halfspaces with margin. Our proof is surprisingly short, and we separate it into its two main components: a structural lemma in Section 3.1 which shows how to estimate a separating hyperplane given a sub-optimal \(\mathbf{w}\), and a perceptron-like analysis of a stochastic iterative method in Section 3.2.

### Separating hyperplanes for Massart halfspaces

We prove our main structural lemma here, used to argue the progress of our iterative method. As highlighted in Section 1.2, we show that when the current \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\), we can construct an unbiased estimator for a separating hyperplane between \(\mathbf{w}\) and the target vector \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\).

Warmup: an "unbounded" separating hyperplane.Before presenting the full proof, we first give a separating hyperplane that works for any feature distribution -- even without margin assumptions. The proposed separating hyperplane works due to the fact that we can express the zero-one in terms of the Leaky-ReLU which is a convex function, as was previously observed by [1].

**Lemma 1** (Separating hyperplane for Massart halfspaces).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model, and \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) has classification error \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\). It holds that \(\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[\frac{\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{\eta}(-y \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]\cdot(\mathbf{w }-\mathbf{w}^{*})\geq\epsilon\,.\)_

Proof.: We recall Claim 2.1 from [1]: for all \(\mathbf{w},\mathbf{x}\), it holds that \(\mathbf{E}_{y\sim D_{y}(\mathbf{x})}\left[\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})\right]=(\mathbf{P}\mathbf{r}_{y\sim D_{y}(\mathbf{x})}\left[\mathrm{ sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\neq y\right]-\lambda)\cdot|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|\). In particular, we have \(\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[\frac{\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]=\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w}) -\eta\). From the convexity of \(\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\), we obtain that \(\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\cdot(\mathbf{w}- \mathbf{w}^{*})\geq\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-\ell_{\eta}(-y \mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\). By dividing both sides by \(|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|\) and taking expectation over \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(y\), we obtain

\[\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y}\left[\frac{\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}(\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{ w}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{*} )\geq\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y}\left[\frac{\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]-\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y} \left[\frac{\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|}\right]\geq\epsilon\,,\]

where the last inequality follows from the following facts: (1) for all \(\mathbf{x}\), it holds that \(\mathbf{E}_{y\sim D_{y}(\mathbf{x})}\left[\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot \mathbf{x})\right]=(\mathbf{P}\mathbf{r}_{y\sim D_{y}(\mathbf{x})}\left[ \mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\neq y\right]-\eta)\cdot|\mathbf{w} ^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|=(\eta(\mathbf{x})-\eta)\cdot|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x }|\leq 0\), and (2) \(\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y}\left[\frac{\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{ |\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\right]=\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})-\eta\geq\epsilon\). This completes the proof. 

A "bounded" separating hyperplane for \(\gamma\)-margin Massart halfspaces.Our claim in the previous lemma was very general: it works for any marginal distribution. However, as discussed in Section 1.2, the unbounded nature of this separating hyperplane may make it impossible to estimate from samples. To overcome this, we propose a new candidate hyperplane: \(\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y}\left[\frac{\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{ w}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\right]\). We prove that this candidate is indeed a separating hyperplane by leveraging the fact that we have margin \(\gamma\) with respect to the optimal halfspace \(\mathbf{w}^{*}\). Recall from Section 2 that \(\nabla_{\mathbf{w}}\ell_{\eta}(-y\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2}((1-2 \eta)\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-y)\).

**Lemma 2** (Bounded separating hyperplane for Massart halfspaces).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\) (with respect to \(\mathbf{w}^{*}\)) and define \(\beta=1-2\eta\). If \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) has \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\), it holds that_

\[\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[(\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})-y)\frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\right] \cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{*})\geq 2\epsilon\,.\]

Proof.: We first observe that by the definition of the Massart halfspace model, \(\mathbf{E}_{y\sim D_{y}(\mathbf{x})}[y]=(1-2\eta(\mathbf{x}))\mathrm{sign}( \mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})=\beta(\mathbf{x})\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*} \cdot\mathbf{x})\), where \(\beta(\mathbf{x}):=1-2\eta(\mathbf{x})\). Therefore, we have that

\[I :=\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[(\beta\mathrm{sign}( \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-y)\frac{(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{w}^{*} \cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\right]\] \[=\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\Big{[}(\beta\mathrm{ sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-\beta(\mathbf{x})\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*} \cdot\mathbf{x}))\frac{(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x })}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\Big{]}\,.\]

We denote by \(g(\mathbf{x}):=(\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-\beta(\mathbf{x} )\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}))\frac{(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}- \mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\), which we bound differently based on whether \(\mathbf{x}\) falls in the agreement region \(A:=\big{\{}\mathbf{x}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\mid h_{\mathbf{w}^{*}}(\mathbf{x})=h_{ \mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})\big{\}}\). For \(\mathbf{x}\in A\),

\[g(\mathbf{x}) =\big{(}\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-\beta( \mathbf{x})\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\big{)}\frac{(\mathbf{w }\cdot\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\] \[=\big{(}\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x})\big{)}\frac{|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|-|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma} \geq\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x})\,.\]

The second equality follows from the fact that \(\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})=\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{ x})\). The final inequality holds since \(\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x})\leq 0\) and \(\frac{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|-|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}{|\mathbf{w} \cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma}\leq 1\). Similarly, for \(\mathbf{x}\notin A\), an analogous calculation yields \(g(\mathbf{x})=\big{(}\beta+\beta(\mathbf{x})\big{)}\frac{|\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x}|+|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+\gamma} \geq\beta+\beta(\mathbf{x})\,.\) The first equality holds because \(\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\neq\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}\cdot \mathbf{x})\) and the final inequality follows since \(|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|\geq\gamma\) from the margin assumption. Thus

\[I\geq\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\big{[}1\,\{\mathbf{x}\in A\}( \beta-\beta(\mathbf{x})\big{]}+\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\big{[}1 \,\{\mathbf{x}\notin A\}(\beta+\beta(\mathbf{x}))\big{]}. \tag{4}\]We will now use our lower bound on \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\), which we relate to Equation4. We have \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\big{[}1\left\{ \mathbf{x}\in A\right\}\eta(\mathbf{x})\big{]}\ +\ \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{ \mathbf{x}}}\left[1\left\{\mathbf{x}\not\in A\right\}(1-\eta(\mathbf{x}))\right] =\ \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\left[1\left\{\mathbf{x}\not \in A\right\}\beta(\mathbf{x})\right]\ +\ \mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\left[\eta( \mathbf{x})\right]\). Next, by our definition \(\beta(\mathbf{x})=1-2\eta(\mathbf{x})\), rearranging and expanding we have:

\[\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})-\eta =\underset{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}}\big{[}1 \left\{\mathbf{x}\not\in A\right\}\beta(\mathbf{x})\big{]}+\frac{1}{2}\underset {\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}}[\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x})]\] \[=\underset{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}}\big{[}1 \left\{\mathbf{x}\not\in A\right\}\beta(\mathbf{x})\big{]}+\frac{1}{2}\underset {\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}}[(1\left\{\mathbf{x}\in A\right\}+ 1\{\mathbf{x}\not\in A\})(\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x}))]\] \[=\frac{1}{2}\underset{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}} [1\left\{\mathbf{x}\not\in A\right\}(\beta(\mathbf{x})+\beta)]+\frac{1}{2} \underset{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}{\mathbf{E}}\big{[}1\left\{\mathbf{x} \in A\right\}(\beta-\beta(\mathbf{x}))\big{]}\,. \tag{5}\]

We finish the proof by combining Equation4, Equation5, and \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})-\eta\geq\epsilon\). 

### Perspectron

We now present and analyze Perspectron, our algorithm for learning Massart halfspaces.

```

**Algorithm 1**Perspectron

We begin by giving a self-contained analysis of a single loop \(j\in[N]\) of Line6 to Line9, showing that for sufficiently large \(T\), at least one iterate achieves small \(\ell_{0\_1}\) with constant probability.

**Lemma 3**.: _Let \(\{\mathbf{x}^{i},y^{i}\}_{i\in[T]}\sim_{i.i.d.}D\), where \(D\) is an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\) with respect to \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\). Consider iterating, from \(\mathbf{w}^{1}:=\mathbb{0}_{d}\),_

\[\mathbf{w}^{t+1}\leftarrow\mathbf{w}^{t}-\lambda\frac{\beta\mathrm{sign}( \mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}}{|\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t} |+\gamma}\mathbf{x}^{t}, \tag{6}\]

_for \(\beta:=1-2\eta\), \(\lambda:=\frac{\gamma}{2\sqrt{T}}\). Then if \(T\geq\frac{16}{\epsilon^{2}\gamma^{2}}\), \(\mathbf{Pr}[\min_{t\in[T]}\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w}^{t})\geq\eta+\frac{\epsilon} {2}]\leq\frac{1}{2}\)._

Proof.: Throughout the proof, say \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) is _bad_ iff \(\ell_{0\_1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\), and let \(\mathcal{E}_{t}\) denote the event that all of the iterates \(\{\mathbf{w}^{s}\}_{s\in[t]}\) updated according to (6) are bad. Define the potential function \(\Phi_{t}:=\mathbf{E}[1\left\{\mathcal{E}_{t}\right\}\cdot\|\mathbf{w}^{\star }-\mathbf{w}^{t}\|^{2}]\) for all \(t\in[T]\). On expanding the expression for the squared norm and using the fact that \(1\left\{\mathcal{E}_{t+1}\right\}\leq 1\left\{\mathcal{E}_{t}\right\}\),

\[\Phi_{t+1} \leq\mathbf{E}\left[1\left\{\mathcal{E}_{t}\right\}\cdot\left\| \mathbf{w}^{\star}-\mathbf{w}^{t+1}\right\|^{2}\right]\] \[\leq\Phi_{t}+\lambda^{2}\,\mathbf{E}\left[\left\|\frac{\beta \mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}}{|\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot \mathbf{x}^{t}|+\gamma}\mathbf{x}^{t}\right\|^{2}\right]\] \[-2\lambda\,\mathbf{E}\left[1\left\{\mathcal{E}_{t}\right\}\cdot \frac{\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}}{|\mathbf{w} ^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t}|+\gamma}\mathbf{x}^{t}\cdot(\mathbf{w}^{t}-\mathbf{w} ^{\star})\right]\] \[\leq\Phi_{t}+\frac{4\lambda^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}-2\lambda\,\mathbf{Pr }\left[\mathcal{E}_{t}\right]\mathbf{E}\left[\frac{\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{ w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}}{|\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t}|+\gamma} \mathbf{x}^{t}\cdot(\mathbf{w}^{t}-\mathbf{w}^{\star})\mid\mathcal{E}_{t}\right]\] \[\leq\Phi_{t}+\frac{4\lambda^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}-2\lambda\epsilon\, \mathbf{Pr}\left[\mathcal{E}_{t}\right].\]

Here, the third inequality used \(\mathbf{x}^{t}\in\mathbb{B}^{d}\) and \(|\beta\mathrm{sign}(\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}|\leq 2\), and the fourth applied Lemma 2. Now using that \(\Phi_{1}\leq\left\|\mathbf{w}^{\star}\right\|^{2}=1\), \(\Phi_{T+1}\geq 0\), and \(\mathbf{Pr}[\mathcal{E}_{t}]\geq\mathbf{Pr}[\mathcal{E}_{T}]\) for \(t\in[T]\), we have \(2\lambda\epsilon T\mathbf{Pr}\left[\mathcal{E}_{T}\right]\leq 1+\frac{4\lambda^{2} \gamma^{2}}{\gamma^{2}}\). The conclusion \(\mathbf{Pr}\left[\mathcal{E}_{T}\right]\leq\frac{1}{2}\) follows from our choices of \(\lambda\), \(T\). 

We next analyze the hypothesis selection step in Line 13.

**Lemma 4** (Hypothesis selection).: _Suppose there exists \(\hat{\mathbf{w}}\in H\) with \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\leq\eta+\frac{\epsilon}{2}\). Then if \(T_{2}\geq\frac{8}{\epsilon^{2}}\log(\frac{2|H|}{\delta})\), with probability \(\geq 1-\delta\) the \(\mathbf{w}\) returned by Line 13 satisfies \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\leq\eta+\epsilon\)._

Proof.: Because \(S\) is independent of \(H\), Hoeffding's inequality and a union bound implies that \(\left|\mathbf{Pr}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim_{\text{unit}}S}[h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{ x})\neq y]-\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\right|\leq\frac{\epsilon}{4}\) with probability \(\geq 1-\delta\), for all \(\mathbf{w}\in H\). Conditioning on this event, \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})>\eta+\epsilon\) yields a contradiction:

\[\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})-\frac{\epsilon}{4}\leq\underset{(\mathbf{x},y) \sim_{\text{unit}}S}{\mathbf{Pr}}[h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})\neq y]\leq \underset{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim_{\text{unit}}S}{\mathbf{Pr}}[h_{\hat{\mathbf{w} }}(\mathbf{x})\neq y]\leq\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\hat{\mathbf{w}})+\frac{\epsilon}{ 4}\leq\eta+\frac{3\epsilon}{4}.\qed\]

We are now ready to state and prove our main theorem.

**Theorem 3** (Learning \(\gamma\)-margin Massart halfspaces).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\), and let \(\epsilon,\delta\in(0,1)\). Algorithm 1 with \(T_{1}\geq\frac{16}{\epsilon^{2}\gamma^{2}}\lceil\log_{2}(\frac{2}{\delta})\rceil\), \(T_{2}\geq\frac{8}{\epsilon^{2}}\log(\frac{4|T_{1}|}{\delta})\) returns \(\mathbf{w}\) such that \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\leq\eta+\epsilon\) with probability \(\geq 1-\delta\), using \(O((\epsilon\gamma)^{-2}\log(\delta^{-1})+\epsilon^{-2}\log((\epsilon\gamma \delta)^{-1}))\) samples and \(O(d\epsilon^{-4}\gamma^{-2}\log(\delta^{-1})\log((\epsilon\gamma\delta)^{-1})\) time._

Proof.: First, applying Lemma 3 to each of the \(N\) independent runs of Line 6 to Line 9 shows that the premise of Lemma 4 is met except with probability \(\frac{\delta}{2}\). The correctness claim then follows from Lemma 4. The sample complexity is immediate, and the runtime bound follows because the bottleneck operation is computing the value of \(h_{\mathbf{w}}(\mathbf{x})\) for all \((\mathbf{x},y)\in S\) and \(\mathbf{w}\in H\). 

## 4 Massart generalized linear models

In this section, we present a key piece of intuition motivating our extension to the Massart GLM noise model (see Definition 2), deferring a full proof to Appendix A. In this setting, instead of being upper bounded by a fixed constant \(\eta\), the noise rate is data-dependent and upper bounded by \(\frac{1-\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\cdot\mathbf{x})}{2}\) where \(\sigma\) is odd non-decreasing and \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\) is the optimal halfspace. Inspired by our approach in Section 3, we propose a novel separating hyperplane based on the previously described reweighting scheme. We argue in this section that \(\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x},y}\left[\frac{(\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-y)}{| \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\mathbf{x}\right]\) is a valid separating hyperplane, generalizing Lemma 1.

**Lemma 5** (Separating hyperplane for Massart GLMs).: _Let \(D\) be an instance of the \(\sigma\)-Massart GLM model with margin \(\gamma\) (with respect to halfspace \(\mathbf{w}^{\star}\)), and \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) has \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\mathrm{opt}_{\mathbf{RCN}}+\epsilon\). We have that \(\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[\frac{(\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x} )-y)}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|}\mathbf{x}\right]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w }^{\star})\geq 2\epsilon\,.\)_Proof Sketch.: We use the definition of sets \(A\), \(\beta(\mathbf{x})\) from Lemma2. By expanding out the expression for \(\ell_{0\text{-}1}(\mathbf{w})\) similarly to Lemma2, we obtain that \(\frac{1}{2}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})\sim D}\left[\left(\left| \sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|-\beta(\mathbf{x})\right)\right] \mathbb{1}\{\mathbf{x}\in A\}\right]+\frac{1}{2}\cdot\mathbf{E}_{(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{y})\sim D}\left[\left(\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}) \right|+\beta(\mathbf{x})\right)\right]\mathbb{1}\{\mathbf{x}\notin A\}\right]\geq\epsilon\). Let \(g(\mathbf{x})=\frac{\left(\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-\mathbf{y}\right) }{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|}\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{*})\). Now, we argue that \(\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x}\sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}[g(\mathbf{x})]\) is greater than the left hand side of the previous inequality. We do a case analysis. For \(\mathbf{x}\in A\), we observe that \(g(\mathbf{x})\geq\left(\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|- \beta(\mathbf{x})\right)\frac{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|-\left| \mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|}{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|} \geq\left(\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|-\beta(\mathbf{x})\right)\). Here, we obtained the first inequality by adding and subtracting the corresponding term with \(\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\) and then using monotonicity. The final inequality follows from the fact that \(\beta(\mathbf{x})\geq\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|\). For \(\mathbf{x}\notin A\), we obtain that \(g(\mathbf{x})=\left(\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|+\beta( \mathbf{x})\right)\frac{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|+\left|\mathbf{w} ^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|}{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|}\geq\left( \left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|+\beta(\mathbf{x})\right)\) where we obtain the inequality by doing a case analysis: (1) \(\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\leq\left|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\), in this case \(\frac{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|+\left|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{ x}\right|}{\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|}\geq 2\) and (2), \(\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\geq\left|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\), in this case \(\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})\right|\geq\left|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*} \cdot\mathbf{x})\right|\) and hence we are done. Now, taking the expectation of \(g(\mathbf{x})\) completes the proof of the claim. 

However, we are met with the same obstacle as before: \(\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\) can be arbitrarily small. The previous approach of adding \(\gamma\) to the denominator does not work immediately. Instead, we add the rescaled term \(\frac{\epsilon}{2-\epsilon}\cdot\gamma\). Adding a smaller term in the denominator increases the bound on the norm of the increments in each step, resulting to a larger bound on the number of iterations (and, therefore, sample complexity) by a factor of \(\epsilon^{-2}\). However, this rescaling is useful to obtain an analogue of Lemma2 for the case of Massart GLMs (Lemma6). The rescaling essentially accounts for the part of the distribution where \(\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\) is smaller than \(\left|\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\) and the signs disagree. This is important because the size of \(\left|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}\right|\) is quantitatively more significant in the Massart GLM case.

Combining this with a modified version of the Perspectrum algorithm and analysis (see Algorithm2), we obtain our final result with sample complexity \(\widetilde{O}(\gamma^{-2}\epsilon^{-4})\) (see Theorem4).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:16]

Proof.: Given Lemma 6, the first step of the proof is exactly analogous to the proof of Lemma 3, i.e., we can show the following claim.

**Claim 1**.: _Let \(\{\mathbf{x}^{i},y^{i}\}_{i\in[T]}\sim_{i.i.d.}D\), where \(D\) satisfies Definition 3. Consider iterating, from \(\mathbf{w}^{1}:=\mathbb{0}_{d}\),_

\[\mathbf{w}^{t+1}\leftarrow\mathbf{w}^{t}-\lambda\frac{\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{t} \cdot\mathbf{x}^{t})-y^{t}}{|\mathbf{w}^{t}\cdot\mathbf{x}^{t}|+\gamma\epsilon /(2-\epsilon)}\mathbf{x}^{t}, \tag{8}\]

_for \(\lambda:=\frac{\gamma\epsilon}{(2-\epsilon)\sqrt{2T}}\). Then if \(T\geq\frac{32}{\epsilon^{4}\gamma^{2}}\), \(\mathbf{Pr}[\min_{t\in[T]}\ell_{0\cdot 1}(\mathbf{w}^{t})\geq\mathbf{E}_{\mathbf{x} \sim D_{\mathbf{x}}}\left[\frac{1-|\sigma(\mathbf{w}^{*}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+ \tau}{2}\right]+\frac{\epsilon}{2}]\leq\frac{1}{2}\)._

The proof is analogous to the proof of Lemma 3, but we use \(\gamma\epsilon/(2-\epsilon)\) in the place of \(\gamma\). To amplify the success probability and finish the proof, we once more use Lemma 4. 

## Appendix B Omitted proofs

### Learning with unknown noise rate

In this section, we can obtain the same sample complexity (upto logarithmic factors) as Theorem 3 even when the noise rate \(\eta\) is unknown to the learner. The argument is the following: we argue that our separating hyperplane (Lemma 2) is tolerant to \(O(\epsilon)\) noise in the parameter \(\eta\). We can then discretize the interval \([0,1/2]\) into intervals of size \(\epsilon\) and run the training algorithm multiple times for these different choices. Then, we can output the hypothesis with lowest validation error among the classifiers output by these different runs of the algorithm. We now argue that this idea indeed works.

**Lemma 7**.: _If \(D\) is an instance of the \(\eta\)-Massart halfspace model with margin \(\gamma\) with respect to \(\mathbf{w}^{*}\), and \(\mathbf{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) has \(\ell_{0\cdot 1}(\mathbf{w})\geq\eta+\epsilon\),_

\[\mathop{\mathbf{E}}_{(\mathbf{x},y)\sim D}\left[(\tilde{\beta}\mathrm{sign}( \mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x})-y)\frac{\mathbf{x}}{|\mathbf{w}\cdot\mathbf{x}|+ \gamma}\right]\cdot(\mathbf{w}-\mathbf{w}^{*})\geq 2\epsilon,\;\text{for }\tilde{ \beta

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide proofs and/or references for all claims made in the abstract and introduction. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We thoroughly discuss the assumptions under which our results hold, as well as their scope and comparison with related work, in an explicit limitations and future work section. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We provide full proofs for all of our formal statements.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments requiring code. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: We read the code of ethics and our work conforms with the stated code. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our work is of theoretical nature, focusing on improving the reliability of a basic learning algorithm. We do not foresee any direct path to any negative applications. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not use existing assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
