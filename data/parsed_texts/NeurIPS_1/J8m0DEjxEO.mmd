###### Abstract

This paper studies the vulnerabilities of transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) to jailbreaking attacks, with a particular focus on the optimization-based Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) strategy. Noting a positive correlation between the effectiveness of attacks and the internal behaviors of models--for instance, attacks are less effective when models robustly focus on system instructions specialized for mitigating harmful behaviors and ensuring safety alignment--we introduce an enhanced method that additionally manipulates models' attention scores to enhance the large language model (LLM) jailbreaking. We term this novel strategy AttnGCG. Empirically, AttnGCG demonstrates consistent performance enhancements across diverse LLMs, with an average improvement of 7% in the Llama-2 series and 10% in the Gemma series. This strategy also exhibits stronger attack transferability when testing on unknown or closed-sourced LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4. Moreover, we show that AttnGCG is able to offer enhanced interpretability by visualizing models' attention scores across different input components, thus providing clear insights into how targeted attention manipulation contributes to more successful jailbreaking.

## 1 Introduction

Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) [27] have enabled tremendous success in the field of natural language processing (NLP), propelling these systems toward near human-level intelligence [24, 7, 14, 16, 3, 1]. Nevertheless, to ensure these sophisticated systems remain safe and ethical, preventing them from generating harmful responses, LLMs typically undergo comprehensive safety training [23, 16, 6]. This critical training process enables models to refuse inappropriate requests and produce responses that are socially acceptable and contextually suitable, which aims at significantly enhancing their functional utility in real-world NLP applications [23, 16, 6].

However, despite these established safety protocols, aligned LLMs remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can provoke toxic responses [9], particularly those that employ optimization-based approaches. These attacks typically exploit the model's inherent security flaw by optimizing for malicious adversarial input, including optimization-based gradient-searching methods [35, 34, 13], approaches that adapt genetic algorithms [17, 19] and LLM-aided jailbreakings [10, 21], collectively highlighting the ongoing security '_bugs_' of advanced LLMs.

In this paper, we focus on the optimization-based attack, whose target is to maximize the probability of generating harmful textual content. We notice two limitations with existing optimization-based attacks. First, these methods heavily rely on the likelihood of generating target tokens as an indicator of a successful jailbreak. Although many techniques are developed for maximizing this targeted probability [35, 34, 13, 5, 17, 19], the recent study points out that a high probability of harmful tokensdoes not necessarily equate to a successful jailbreak [18]. For example, as shown in figure 1, the adversarial prompt crafted by the popular Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) [35] may initially cause the LLM to generate the target tokens, but subsequently, the model could reject the request, rendering the jailbreak unsuccessful. Second, existing attack frameworks predominantly operate at the output layer of LLMs, evaluating performance based on metrics like the probability of target tokens [35, 34, 13, 5, 17, 19] or using scores from auxiliary evaluation models [10]. These approaches neglect the internal workings of LLMs, resulting in a lack of interpretability. Without this understanding, it would be challenging to grasp why some attacks succeed while others fail, limiting the development of more effective attack strategies.

To mitigate these issues, we advocate for a deeper understanding of the underlying factors that contribute to the success of LLM jailbreaks. Our key insight is the crucial role of the attention score, which reveals where the model focuses during token generation, in achieving successful jailbreaking. Specifically, in aligned LLMs, the input typically consists of two parts: a system prompt (though, for some LLMs, defaulted to be empty) and a user prompt, assuming a zero-shot scenario. In the jailbreaking context, the user prompt can be further segmented into the goal prompt, representing the user's intent, and the adversarial suffix, which our method targets for optimization to facilitate jailbreak. In Figure 2, we illustrate the distribution of the model's attention score across these three input components during the jailbreak process. Interestingly, our findings indicate that the model's attention score on the adversarial suffix could serve as a strong indicator of the jailbreaking performance, _e.g._, a successful jailbreak typically corresponds with a high attention score on the adversarial suffix. The rationale behind this is that as the attention score on the adversarial suffix increases, the model's focus on the system prompt and the input goal would decrease, thereby diminishing their effectiveness in safeguarding the system and giving the adversarial suffix a higher chance to circumvent the model's safety protocols.

Building upon this key observation, we introduce AttnGCG. AttnGCG leverages the attention score as an additional optimization target, creating adversarial suffixes that are more challenging for LLMs to defend against. Specifically, we augment the traditional GCG objective with an auxiliary attention loss function, which gradually increases the importance of the suffix during adversarial training. By pivoting the optimization focus from solely targeting token probabilities to also manipulating models' attention scores, we concentrate the model's attention more effectively on the adversarial suffix, thereby enhancing jailbreak success, resulting in an increase in attack success rate from an average of 64.3% to 70.6% over 7 aligned LLMs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of our method by adding it to other existing jailbreaking techniques, which register an average of 5.3% ASR increases over the vanilla GCG. Additionally, AttnGCG exhibits stronger transferability to closed-source LLMs, achieving an average improvement of 2.8% over the GCG baseline. Qualitative visualizations are also provided to showcase that the the attention scores of the model to adversarial suffixes can serve as an interpretable indicator of jailbreaking performance, providing new insights for evaluating and enhancing the quality of an adversarial prompt.

Figure 1: A higher attention score on the adversarial suffix can indicate a higher attack success rate. We show that the original GCG [35] is not sufficient for jailbreak, as the model may generate the first few target tokens, but may still fail to fulfill the request. In contrast, our method, AttnGCG, successfully bypasses the safety protocols rooted in LLMs by increasing the attention score on the adversarial suffix.

## 2 Method

In this section, we first give a brief introduction of the GCG method [35], which our AttnGCG is built on. Then, we formalize attention scores of different LLM input components, and finally the core contribution in this paper: attention loss, which greatly enhances the learning of the adversarial suffix.

### Greedy Coordinate Gradient

The Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) [35] is a pioneering method for eliciting malicious text outputs from aligned LLMs by employing a discrete token-level optimization. In this approach, an LLM is considered as a mapping from a sequence of \(n\) tokens \(x_{1:n}\) to a distribution over the next token \(x_{n+1}\). In the jailbreaking scenario, the first \(n\) tokens \(x_{1:n}\) fed to the language model contains both the goal which the user aim to achieve \(x_{\mathcal{G}}=x_{1:j}\) as well as an adversarial suffix \(x_{\mathcal{I}}=x_{j+1:n}\) that we aim to optimize. The objective of GCG is to find an adversarial suffix \(x_{\mathcal{I}}\) that minimizes the negative log probability of a target sequence of tokens \(x_{n+1:n+L}^{*}\), representing affirmative response (_i.e._, "Sure, here is...") Under this context, GCG uses a target loss function \(\mathcal{L}_{t}\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{t}(x_{1:n})=-\log p(x_{n+1:n+L}^{*}|x_{1:n}). \tag{1}\]

Formally, the optimization problem of GCG can be expressed as:

\[\min_{x_{\mathcal{I}}\in\{1,...,V\}^{|\mathcal{I}|}}\mathcal{L}_{t}(x_{1:n}), \tag{2}\]

where \(\mathcal{I}\) denotes the indices of the adversarial suffix tokens in the LLM input, and \(V\) denotes the vocabulary size. This objective is optimized by the Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) [35] algorithm (Algorithm 1) to find the optimal adversarial suffix.

### Attention Loss

As current LLMs are mostly attention-based architecture, we can assume that when generating the next tokens, the model will generate an attention matrix indicating the importance of all previous tokens \(x_{1:n}\) to the next token \(x_{n+1}\). As we are calculating the loss in Eq. 1 using a sequence of target tokens \(x_{n+1:n+L}\), we can obtain the attention weight matrix \(w\) with the shape of \((n+L)\times(n+L)\) where \(w_{i,j}\) represents the attention weight of token \(x_{j}\) on the token of \(x_{i}\). In our implementation, we use the attention matrix from the last decoder layer. We define the attention score \(s_{j}\) on the token \(x_{j}\) as the average of the attention weights of token \(x_{j}\) on the output tokens \(x_{n+1:n+L}\):

\[s_{j}=\sum_{i\in[n+1:n+L]}\frac{w_{i,j}}{L}. \tag{3}\]

Figure 2: The attention scores and attack success rate (ASR) of GCG [35] (_left_) and our method (_left_) on Llama-2-Chat-7B. We observe that (1) the attention score on adversarial suffix can grow simultaneously with the ASR. (2) Meanwhile, attention scores on the goal and system prompt can decrease as the training continues.

Similarly, we can represent the attention score of the adversarial suffix \(x_{\mathcal{I}}\) as:

\[s_{\mathcal{I}}=\sum_{i\in\mathcal{I}}\frac{s_{j}}{|\mathcal{I}|}, \tag{4}\]

where \(\mathcal{I}\) denotes the indices of the adversarial suffix tokens in the LLM input. Based on our insight of that the model's attention score on the adversarial suffix can indicate the jailbreaking performance, we can directly optimizing for the below objective:

\[\max_{x_{\mathcal{I}}\in\{1,...,V\}^{|x_{\mathcal{I}}|}}s_{\mathcal{I}}. \tag{5}\]

We can rewrite this as a loss function:

\[\mathcal{L}_{a}(x_{1:n})=-s_{\mathcal{I}}. \tag{6}\]

We can easily integrate this new loss function into the original GCG loss by a weighted sum \(\mathcal{L}_{t+a}(x_{1:n})=w_{t}\mathcal{L}_{t}(x_{1:n})+w_{a}\mathcal{L}_{a}( x_{1:n})\), where \(w_{t}\) and \(w_{a}\) are the weights. Therefore, the optimization objective of AttnGCG can be written as:

\[\min_{x_{\mathcal{I}}\in\{1,...,V\}^{|\mathcal{I}|}}\mathcal{L}_{t+a}(x_{1:n}). \tag{7}\]

We use the Greedy Coordinate Gradient method [35] to optimize this objective augmented with attention loss.Algorithm 2 and 1 shows a comparison of our AttnGCG to the original GCG method.

## 3 Experiments

In this section, we first introduce the experimental setup. Second, we present ans analyze results of AttnGCG across different white-box LLMs compared with the original GCG. Then, we validate the universality of our method by connecting AttnGCG with other attacks. Finally, we conduct transfer attacks on black-box LLMs to validate the transferability of prompts generated by AttnGCG.

Figure 3: The components of prompts fed into LLMs. ‘System’ is the default system prompt of the model, ‘Goal’ and ‘Suffix’ make up the user prompt where ‘Goal’ describes the actual user request, and ‘Suffix’ is an adversarial prompt our method will optimize for. ‘Target’ is the model’s generation, on which we calculate the loss function to generate the desired output.

### Experimental Setups

**Dataset.** We employ the AdvBench Harmful Behaviors benchmark [35] to assess jailbreak attacks. This dataset comprises \(520\) requests spanning profanity, graphic depictions, threatening behavior, misinformation, discrimination, cybercrime, and dangerous or illegal suggestions. We randomly sample \(100\) behaviors from this dataset for our evaluation.

**Language Models** In this paper, we attempt to jailbreak both open-source and closed-source LLMs. For open-source LLMs, we test the LLaMA [16], Gemma [15], and Mistral [2] series of seven aligned models, particularly including Mistral-8x7B-Instruct [3], the open-source MoE model that outperforms GPT-3.5, and LLaMA-3 [1], the most capable openly available LLM to date. For closed-source LLMs, we mainly focus on GPT-3.5 [22], GPT-4 [24], and the Gemini [14] series, due to their widespread use. For each of these target models, we use a temperature of zero for deterministic generation. For a list of all system prompts used in this paper, see Table 8.

**Baselines and hyperparameters.** We mainly adopt the simple and effective GCG [35] as our baseline on both direct attack on white-box LLMs and the transfer attack. We also incorporate optimization-free method ICA [30] and AutoDAN [19] as baselines and use their generated suffix as the initialization of our training. For evaluation, we conduct comparisons under the condition of training for \(500\) steps, using the same implementation and parameters as our method, i.e., at the same query count. Detailed parameters can be found in the Appendix A.

**Evaluation** To comprehensively access our proposed attack, we use two types of evaluation protocols, one is the keyword-detection method introduced in Zou et al. [35] which assesses harmfulness by checking the presence of predefined keywords in the response. Another evaluation leverages LLMs as the judge [10], we utilize GPT-4 [24] as our judge to determine whether or not the attack is successful, which is proven to better align with the attacker's interests [10].

### Base Experiments on GCG and AttnGCG

**Main results and analysis.** We first conduct white-box attack of GCG and our AttnGCG where we can optimize the adversarial suffix directly based on LLM probabilities. Results from Table 1 suggest that, incorporating attention loss (Eq. 6) into the optimization objective leads to a general improvement in attack performance. This observation is well supported as the proposed AttnGCG consistently outperforms GCG across various models, showcasing an average improvement of 6.3% with GPT-4 judge and 3.9% using the keyword detection. Note that, our statistics also indicate the 'false jailbreak' of current LLMs mentioned by Chao et al. [10], as the ASR measured by generating target tokens is 9.8% higher than GPT-4-aided evaluation (_i.e._ 64.3% _vs._ 74.1%). Our AttnGCG with additional attention loss can handle such situation by generating complete responses given malicious input. For example, on the popular Gemma models, AttnGCG narrows the gap between two evaluation aspects by 8% from 23.5% to 15.5% on average. These results validate that our proposed AttnGCG is a competent jailbreaking strategy for aligned LLMs.

#### Transfer AttnGCG to other methods

From Table 4, we observe that:

1. Using AttnGCG to further optimize the prompts generated by ICA and AutoDAN leads to additional enhancement over the performance of these methods. Moreover, the average improvement is 5% higher than that achieved by GCG, demonstrating that optimizing adversarial prompts based on attention can effectively further enhance existing methods.
2. ICA+AttnGCG and AutoDAN+AttnGCG both outperform AttnGCG alone, indicating the significance of properly initializing prompts in AttnGCG. A good initialization can reduce the search space. The standard for evaluating the quality of initialization can be referenced in the Table3, from which we can observe that AutoDAN prompts have the smallest attention score on the goal part. Furthermore, AutoDAN+AttnGCG achieves the highest performance. Therefore, prompts with smaller attention score on the goal part, _i.e._, prompts that can shift more attention of the model away from the goal, serve as better initializations.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Model & Method & GPT-4 judge & keyword-detection \\ \hline Llama-2-Chat-7B & Vanilla & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & GCG & 48.0 & 51.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & AttnGCG & 58.0 & 60.0 \\ \hline Llama-2-Chat-7B & AutoDAN-HGA & 35.0 & 56.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & AutoDAN-HGA+GCG & 86.0 & 87.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & AutoDAN-HGA+AttnGCG & 91.0 & 92.0 \\ \hline Llama-2-Chat-7B & ICA & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & ICA+GCG & 56.0 & 56.0 \\ Llama-2-Chat-7B & ICA+AttnGCG & 61.0 & 62.0 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: We compared the effects of further adding GCG and AttnGCG to different base methods(ICA, AutoDAN). AttnGCG consistently enhances base methods and provides a greater improvement compared to GCG.

### Transfer to Closed-Source Models

Since our method relies on data from the model's internal workings and requires outputting attention weights during the jailbreak process, our direct victim models are limited to open-source ones. However, as successful jailbreaks developed for one large language model can often be reused on another model [35], our method offers the possibility of attacking closed-source models. Therefore, we also tested the transferability of AttnGCG to unknown models.

From table 5, we observe that the prompts created by AttnGCG show greater transferability to closed-source models compared to GCG. AttnGCG surpasses GCG by an average of 2.8% on GPT-4 judge and by an average of 2.4% on keyword detection.

We also test the transfer performance on the latest models such as Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and GPT-4o. However, both GCG and AttnGCG exhibited very low transferability to these models. For instance, on Gemini-1.5-Flash, the average attack success rate (as judged by GPT-4) for GCG is 0.5%, and for AttnGCG, it is 1%. We believe that conclusions drawn under such low ASR conditions are not representative and that more future studies are needed.

Optimization-based JailbreakingOptimization-based method design a criteria to find the most effective adversarial prompts for jailbraking LLMs. This paradigm is initially explored with gradient-based optimization and introduced by GCG [35], which employs a combination of greedy and gradient-based search techniques for both white-box and black-box LLM jailbreaking. PGD [13] revisit Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) on the continuously relaxed input prompt for creating adversarial prompts.

box LLMs. Prompt Automatic Iterative Refinement (PAIR) [10] use an attacker LLM to generate jailbreaks for the targeted LLM with iterative queries for the target LLM to update and refine a candidate jailbreak. Building upon PAIR, [21] propose a refined version for adversarial prompt searching, which employ a tree-based search method. Our AttnGCG belongs to the optimization-based category and employ the attention score as an additional objective for enhanced jailbreaking.

**Optimization-free Jailbreaking** Optimization-free jailbreakings generally attack models by twitching the input prompts. Early attack strategies are tested on ChatGPT since its initial release, users realized that by "delicately" design the input prompts, the aligned ChatGPT always chooses to answer malicious questions without refusal [11, 4, 8]. Since this kind of attack method only requires adjust the model input, it has drawn huge attention from role play [28] to semi-subversion of the safety training objective [29]. A main trend for producing the malicious textual prompt is by leveraging another LLM. Shah et al. [25] employ an LLM that is guided by persona modulation to generate jailbreaking prompts. GPTFuzzer [31] demonstrate an iterative jailbreaking enhancement over human-written templates with LLMs. Zeng et al. [33] and Takemoto [26] chose to refine the input adversarial examples using stronger LLMs (_e.g._, fintuned GPT-3.5) and high-quality prompts. Deng et al. [12] propose a novel attacking using reverse engineering and an LLM as the automatic prompt generator. Besides, by interpolating rare linguistic knowledge, Yuan et al. [32] discover the intriguing fact that conducting chats in cipher can bypass the LLM safety alignment. ICA [30] successfully attack LLMs by adapting the in-context technique that contain a few examples of harmful question-answer pairs.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we study the jailbreaking attacks of transformer-based LLMs. Our exploration results in an insight of the effectiveness of the jailbreaking attack and the model's internal behaviors -- the attention on the adversarial suffix matters for successful jailbreaking. Based on this insight, we proposed a novel method termed AttnGCG that directly manipulates the model's attention score to optimize for a enhanced jailbreaking suffix. Our experiments have shown an impressive improvement in both white box attacks and transfer attacks. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by visualizing the model's attention score, we can provide a clear insight on how jailbreaking is achieved by manipulating the attention distributions. We believe our work can inspire future works on the attack and defense of LLMs.

**Limitations** The transfer attack performance of AttnGCG is unsatisfactory on the latest models, including Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest, Gemini-1.5-Flash, and GPT-4o, necessitating further research to address this issue. The results are presented in the Table 12. Nonetheless, our method still consistently perform well on models released before January 25, 2024.

Due to the limited availability of high-quality red teaming datasets, we only conduct the experiment on the most widely used redteaming benchmark, _AdvBench Harmful Behaviors_, where our method demonstrates consistently strong performance. This highlights the general issues faced by current adversarial attacks, underscoring the necessity for a more comprehensive redteaming benchmark and emphasizing the requirement for further efforts in this regard.

## 6 Ethics Statement

Operating within a white-box setting, our proposed jailbreak targets open-sourced LLMs derived from unaligned models like Llama2-7B for Llama2-7B-Chat. Adversaries can manipulate these base models directly, rather than use our specific prompt.

Looking ahead, while we acknowledge that our method, like previous jailbreak studies, has limited immediate harm, it prompts further investigation into stronger defense measures. We argue that openly discussing attack methods at this stage of LLM advancement is beneficial, as it allows for the enhancement of future LLM iterations with improved security measures if necessary.

### Settings for Target Models

We set do_sample = False for open-source models referring to [10]. And for closed-source models, we set temperature = 0.

### Hyper-Parameters

The hyper-parameters utilized during Section 3

### Details in accelerating attack

GCG is an effective but costly method, with an average running time of approximately 75 minutes for 500 steps. To achieve a faster attack, we utilize the "common prefix" technique, reducing time cost to approximately 15 minutes, which is 5\(\times\) faster.

Table 9: Hyper-parameters of GCG and AttnGCG in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3In detail, The objects we optimize are limited to tokens at the suffix. Thus, candidate adversarial prompts for one harmful behavior share the same prefix (system+goal), called the common prefix. This common prefix is repeatedly input into the model during the optimization process, leading to significant redundant computations. To address this, we save the intermediate states (Key and Value) obtained from the model when inputting the common prefix, thereby reducing redundant computations. Additionally, we adjusted the batch-size and top-k parameters in GCG to reduce computational load without significantly lowering performance. These simple adjustments resulted in a 7.2\(\times\) speedup, reducing the time for each step from 8.6 seconds to 1.2 seconds on average.1 However, our method incurs additional overhead due to the calculation of attention loss, increasing the average time cost to 1.6 seconds per step. Consequently, our method completes one round of adversarial prompt generation, including 500 steps, in approximately 15 minutes.

## Appendix B Additional Results

### Jailbreaking Vicuna models

Since Vicuna-7B and Vicuna-13B are not specifically safety-aligned, we excluded them from the main evaluation. However, due to their widespread use, we evaluated their robustness for the sake of completeness. The results are shown in Table 11

### Transfer attacks

We compare the transferability of prompts generated by GCG and AttnGCG, using the latest closed-source models as our target models. It is worth noting that Google AI performed an API update for Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest on May 14, 2024, and the experimental data for the transfer attack on Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest, shown below, was validated on May 18, 2024. This differs from the results we obtained prior to May 14 on Gemini-1.5-Pro-latest (15% for GPT-4-judge from Llama2-chat-7b), but we chose to use the updated API data. The results are shown in Table 12

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: They both highlight the development of the AttnGCG strategy to enhance jailbreaking attacks on LLMs by manipulating attention scores, and align well with the theoretical and experimental results presented, showing empirical improvements and enhanced interpretability across several representative models, ranging from open-source to closed-source, thus demonstrating the generalizability of AttnGCG. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss the limitations of our study in Section 5. The overhead of our method is showed in 3.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs**Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.

4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our experiments exhibit excellent reproducibility. We detail our experimental setup and disclosed all hyperparameters in Section 3.1 and the Appendix A.4. After completing the security disclosure process, we will open-source our code on GitHub. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not.
* If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable.
* Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed.
* While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.

5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: After completing the security disclosure process, we will open-source our code on GitHub. If needed, feel free to contact us for experiment results and code before we fully open-source them to the public. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We detail our experimental setup and disclosed all hyperparameters in Section 3.1 and the Appendix A.4. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The results presented in our experiments are all averages, including both model-level averages and behavior-level averages (see Table 1). Additionally, we have disabled the randomness of the relevant models, and all hyperparameters are fixed (see the Appendix A.4). Therefore, the experimental results have statistical significance and can support our core conclusions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. ** The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.

8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report the memory of our computer resources and time of execution in our experiments in the Appendix A.5.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage.
* The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).

9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: Since the work in this paper involves jailbreaking LLMs, which carries security risks, we will not open-source our code to the public until the security disclosure process is completed. Before this, only vetted private requests will be allowed. We consider the ethical implications of this work in Section 6 and disclose essential elements for reproducibility in Section 3.1 and the Appendix A.4, in alignment with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.
* If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
* The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).

10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed?Answer: [Yes]
* Justification: We discuss this in Section 6. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed.
* If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.
* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: For safety concerns, we will not open-source our code to the public until the security disclosure process is completed. And the existing prompts generated by our method will not be released with our code. Only vetted private requests, such as those for related research purposes, will be permitted. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort. 12. **License for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In the Section 2, we clearly state the citation of the existing _AdvBench_ dataset and GCG algorithm, including the relevant license in the code. Guidelines: ** The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
3. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: Temporarily we will not open-source our code to the public for safety concerns until the whole security disclosure process, _e.g._ license, is completed. However, vetted private requests for research purposes can be permitted. Before we open-source our code, we will follow all the rules below.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
4. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
5. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?Answer: [NA]

Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
