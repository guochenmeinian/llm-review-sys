###### Abstract

Recent Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) present remarkable zero-shot conversational and reasoning capabilities given multimodal queries. Nevertheless, they suffer from object hallucination, a phenomenon where LVLMs are prone to generate textual responses not factually aligned with image inputs. Our pilot study reveals that object hallucination is closely tied with Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE), a widely adopted positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. Due to the long-term decay in RoPE, LVLMs tend to hallucinate more when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in the multimodal input sequence. Additionally, we observe a similar effect when reversing the sequential order of visual tokens during multimodal alignment. Our tests indicate that long-term decay in RoPE poses challenges to LVLMs while capturing visual-instruction interactions across long distances. We propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that mitigates the impact of RoPE long-term decay in LVLMs by naturally reducing relative distance between visual and instruction tokens. With CCA, visual tokens can better interact with instruction tokens, thereby enhancing model's perception capability and alleviating object hallucination. Without bells and whistles, our positional alignment method surpasses existing hallucination mitigation strategies by large margins on multiple object hallucination benchmarks.

## 1 Introduction

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) [46, 45, 84, 71, 6, 15, 5] have drawn increasing attention from the AI research community due to their impressive power in understanding the visual world and unprecedented ability to interact with humans via conversations. Their capability to process multimodal sequences has opened up new possibilities for a wide range of vision and language tasks [32, 2], such as handling interleaved image-text inputs [4, 35] and interactive user queries [82]. However, existing LVLMs still suffer from object hallucination [57, 41, 44, 14], a tendency to generate inaccurate responses that are not factually aligned with image inputs. Such phenomenon challenges the faithfulness and reliability of LVLMs in practical use, impeding their deployments to real-world applications [14].

A wide range of approaches have been proposed to mitigate object hallucination in LVLMs. One straightforward approach involves post-hoc correction using revisor models [73, 83], reducing occurrences of hallucinated responses. Another viable approach is to improve supervised fine-tuning by diversifying instruction tuning data [43] or additionally aligning model responses with human preference [62, 76]. Despite their effectiveness in mitigating LVLM object hallucination, acquiring high-quality annotations can be labor-intensive, making these approaches costly to implement.

Recently, several studies explore training-free mitigation of object hallucination by rectifying fallacies in LVLM autoregressive decoding [26; 34]. However, the need to compare among many candidates inevitably slows down the decoding process, making these approaches less efficient during inference.

Distinct from previous efforts, we attend to Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [61], a widely used positional dependency modeling design in LVLMs [46; 84], and investigate how it may affect object hallucination in LVLMs. Similar to sinusoidal function [65], RoPE is proposed to encode position information into representations, enhancing model's ability in understanding sequential order of input tokens. In spite of its success in modeling natural language [53; 63; 64], this design leads to long-term decay [61] in multimodal alignment, a phenomenon where information flow from visual tokens to instruction tokens1 gradually diminishes with increasing relative distance.

Footnote 1: Information flow here refers to self-attentions from instruction tokens to visual tokens.

We analyze the impact of long-term decay [61; 53] on LVLMs. For every visual token in a multimodal sequence, we aggregate its information flow to all instruction tokens and examine how these aggregations distribute across all visual tokens. As presented, in contrast to information flows of visual tokens without RoPE (Fig. 1, (b)), applying RoPE attenuates information flows of leftmost visual tokens, which are located the farthest from instruction tokens in the sequence (Fig. 1, (c)). Such long-term decay benefits natural language modeling [61], but induces insufficient interactions between visual tokens and instruction tokens, leading to inferior multimodal alignment and object hallucinations in the trained LVLMs (see our experiments in Sec. 3 for details).

To this end, we propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a novel position alignment method for training LVLMs with mitigated object hallucination. CCA consists of a position reorganization module for visual tokens and an accompanying causal mask rectification module for modeling 2-D continuous positional dependency. Instead of following raster-scan 2 sequential order of existing LVLMs, CCA starts from peripheral of 2-D images and ends in centers. Such position alignment strategy enjoys two merits: 1) relative distance from instruction tokens to visual tokens are significantly reduced, alleviating limitations brought by long-term decay in RoPE; 2) rectified causal attentions follow 2-D spatial locality of images, as compared to 1-D causal attention originally designed for natural languages. We carry out pre-training and instruction tuning as [46] and verify our trained model on multiple object hallucination benchmarks [41; 57; 20] (+4.24% on Accuracy and +2.73% on F1 score, as compared to the state-of-the-art method [34] on POPE). From a broader perspec

(a) a schematic view of inference in LVLMs, typically involving a pre-trained vision encoder, a large language model and a projector to map visual tokens to textual space. For each of \(V\) visual tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\), we aggregate its information flow to instruction tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{instruct}\) and reshape the aggregation results to 2-D (\(\sqrt{V}\) by \(\sqrt{V}\)). Applying RoPE on visual tokens introduces long-term decay as illustrated in (c), referring to the phenomenon where information flowing from visual tokens to instruction tokens gradually decays from lower-right region (rightmost visual tokens in the 1-D sequence) to upper-left region (leftmost visual tokens). For instruction tokens, they have much less direct interaction with leftmost visual tokens as compared with rightmost visual tokens, leading to inferior multimodal alignment in the trained LVLMs. (b) and (c) are derived from the adversarial subset of the \(3k\) POPE [41] image-instruction pairs. Best viewed in color.**

tive, our method also improves general perception capability of LVLMs. Preliminary experiments show that our positional alignment approach surpasses the baseline consistently over 6 multimodal benchmarks [36; 48; 22; 28; 49; 8].

Our contributions are three-fold. First, we perform in-depth analysis on correlation between rotary position encoding and object hallucination in large vision-language models. Second, motivated by our analysis, we propose Concentric Causal Attention (CCA), a simple yet effective method to mitigate LVLM object hallucination caused by RoPE long-term decay. Third, experiments on multiple benchmarks and comparisons with the state-of-the-art methods support efficacy of our design.

## 2 Related Works

**Large Vision Language Models**. Language modeling has made notable progress in recent years, evolving from robust representation models [17; 56; 55] to instruction-tuned conversational chatbots [63; 64; 12; 1]. These achievements have driven research in creating Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) that can manage multimodal inputs [72; 46; 45; 84; 71; 6; 67; 40; 51; 39]. Pioneering studies in this field [2; 4; 38; 37] connect a vision-only encoder with a powerful frozen language-only model to bridge modality gap, enabling dense interactions across visual and textual features. Powered by instruction-tuned LLMs [12], LLaVA [46], InstructBLIP [15] and MiniGPT4 [84] allow interactive conversations between trained models and users. On top of these studies, LVLMs are empowered with more advanced capabilities, such as engaging in referential dialogues [7; 74; 81; 54; 77], handling interleaved image-text data [2; 4; 35] or understanding visual prompts, like point or box inputs from users [54; 82; 9; 77]. Despite advancements in LVLMs, many of these models still generate inaccurate responses not aligned with visual inputs.

**Object Hallucination** refers to a common problem of existing LVLMs [14; 44; 21; 41; 68; 52; 3; 19; 66]. Specifically, LVLMs tend to generate inaccurate responses that are not factually aligned with image inputs. To address this issue, several recent explorations [73; 83; 33] resort to post-hoc correction of model hallucinated outputs. These methods rely on either external models [47] to correct hallucinated responses [73] or on self-correction techniques [33; 70]. However, both of these methods break end-to-end inference scheme. In contrast, [43; 76; 62; 29; 78; 75] ground their approaches on improving instruction tuning, by either diversifying instruction data or aligning model responses with human feedback. However, acquisition of more instruction data or preference data is labor-intensive. Recently, several studies attempt to mitigate object hallucination in a training-free manner [26; 34; 10]. However, the need to compare among many candidates inevitably slows down the decoding process, making these approaches less efficient during inference. From a distinct perspective, we ground our design in correlation between widely adopted rotary position encoding and object hallucination.

**Position Encoding in Transformers**. Transformer models [65] do not inherently comprehend sequential information of input tokens, which is inferior for modeling sequential data like natural language as compared to recurrent structures like [24]. To mitigate this issue, [65] introduces sinusoidal position encodings to incorporate position information to input embeddings. In addition, several studies resort to learnable position encodings [18], which allow their models to update positional parameters during training. In contrast to absolute position encodings, relative position encodings [59; 31; 23; 27] focus on relative position among tokens. They integrate position information in self-attentions, presenting potential for modeling sequences with variable lengths [61; 53]. Among these studies, Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [61] encodes position information by multiplying input embeddings with rotation matrices. In comparison to other position encoding designs, RoPE is capable of equipping linear self-attention with relative position encoding, which is proven effective for pre-training large language models [63; 64]. A few recent studies explores RoPE for vision tasks [13; 50; 69], showcasing its potential to domains beyond natural language. In this paper, we investigate the role of RoPE in LVLMs and how it affects object hallucination in these models.

## 3 Motivation

In this section, we further examine the long-term decay in RoPE and conduct quantitative analyses to illustrate its correlation with object hallucination. We begin with a brief introduction to the widely adopted LVLM architecture and how RoPE [61] is applied in LVLMs. Then, we highlight the long-term decay in RoPE [61; 53], which benefits language modeling but is under-explored for multimodal alignment. Finally, we examine the role of RoPE in LVLM object hallucination through comparative experiments, which forms a strong foundation of our design.

**LVLM**. Typically, an LVLM \(\mathcal{F}\) is composed of a pretrained vision encoder \(\mathcal{F}_{v}\), a large language model \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\) and a projector module \(f\) that maps visual embeddings to textual space. Given an image input \(I_{v}\) and instruction input \(I_{t}\) (e.g., _"please describe this image in detail"_), \(\mathcal{F}\) encodes these two inputs into a multimodal sequence \(\mathbb{S}=\{\mathbb{S}_{vision},~{}\mathbb{S}_{instruct}\}\), where \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}=f(\mathcal{F}_{v}(I_{v}))=\{w_{m}\}_{m=1}^{V}\) and \(\mathbb{S}_{instruct}=\mathcal{F}_{t}(I_{t})=\{w_{m}\}_{m=1}^{T}\) represent visual and instruction tokens of lengths \(V\) and \(T\), respectively. In such sequence, visual and instruction tokens share the same dimension \(d\), noted as \(w_{m}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\).

**Rotary Position Encoding in LVLM**. In LLMs like LLaMA [63] and its multimodal successors, RoPE [61] encodes position information with input tokens by multiplying every token \(w_{m}\) with a rotation matrix \(R_{\theta,m}^{d}\),

\[R_{\theta,m}^{d}=\begin{pmatrix}\cos m\theta_{1}&-\sin m\theta_{1}&0&0&\cdots &0&0\\ \sin m\theta_{1}&\cos m\theta_{1}&0&0&\cdots&0&0\\ 0&0&\cos m\theta_{2}&-\sin m\theta_{2}&\cdots&0&0\\ 0&0&\sin m\theta_{2}&\cos m\theta_{2}&\cdots&0&0\\ \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\ 0&0&0&0&\cdots&\cos m\theta_{d/2}&-\sin m\theta_{d/2}\\ 0&0&0&0&\cdots&\sin m\theta_{d/2}&\cos m\theta_{d/2}\end{pmatrix} \tag{1}\]

where \(m\in[1,...,V+T]\) indicates position of input token \(w_{m}\) and \(\{\theta_{i}=10000^{-2(i-1)/d}\},i\in[1,2,...,d/2]\) are pre-defined sinusoidal function values following [65]. In LVLMs like LLaVA [46], rotary matrices \(R_{\theta,m}^{d}\) are applied to query and key tokens in all decoder layers, such that relative position dependency among tokens are modeled and integrated in self-attentions across the network. In comparison to absolute position encodings [65] and learnable position encodings in ViT [18], RoPE captures relative distance among input tokens and has the potential to extend the input context window beyond a fixed length [53].

**RoPE Long-term Decay**. Assume a query token \(q_{i}\) at position \(i\) and a key token \(k_{j}\) at position \(j\), which are derived from input tokens \(w_{i}\), \(w_{j}\). The self attention \(a_{i,j}\) between tokens \(q_{i}\) and \(k_{j}\) can be calculated via

\[\mathrm{a}_{i,j}=\mathrm{softmax}(\frac{q_{i}^{T}\cdot k_{j}}{\sqrt{d}}) \tag{2}\]

RoPE applies rotation matrix \(R_{\theta,m}^{d}\) to the self-attention above, which is in the form of,

\[\mathrm{a}_{i,j}=\mathrm{softmax}(\frac{q_{i}^{T}\cdot(R_{\theta,i}^{d})^{T} \cdot R_{\theta,j}^{d}\cdot k_{j}}{\sqrt{d}})=\mathrm{softmax}(\frac{q_{i}^{T} \cdot R_{\theta,j-i}^{d}\cdot k_{j}}{\sqrt{d}}) \tag{3}\]

where \(j-i\) stands for relative position between \(q_{i}\) and \(k_{j}\). The long-term decay refers to the decrease of \(\mathrm{a}_{i,j}\) as the relative distance \(j-i\) increases. As presented in Fig. 1 (c), visual-to-instruction information flow (i.e., instruction-to-visual self-attention) is less significant when \(j-i\) is large and vice versa.

This is favorable for pre-trained LLMs like LLaMA [63], as it aligns with language modeling intuition: pairs of tokens with a long relative distance should have weaker connection. However, we observe that this property brings negative effect in multimodal alignment, in which case visual tokens far from instructions are less attended. This is not expected for multimodal alignment, as the connection between instruction tokens and visual tokens should not be attenuated by their relative distances.

**Pilot Experiment**. We quantitatively examine the effect of RoPE long-term decay on LVLM object hallucination. To determine how object hallucination is influenced by the distance between visual and instruction tokens, we first train two LVLMs 3 following [46] with two different position alignment strategies, including:

Footnote 3: Training details for these two models are in Appendix C.1.

* \(\mathcal{F}^{b}\) (_raster-scan_): it follows [46] the position alignment strategy on visual tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\). Under this scenario, visual tokens follow a sequential order, starting from upper-left corner to lower-right corner of input \(2\)-D visual features, row by row. The order of a multimodal sequence \(\mathbb{S}\) is in format of \(\{1,2,...,V,V+1,...,V+T\}\).4 Footnote 4: For demonstration purpose, we assume visual tokens are pre-pended before instruction tokens. For implementation, we adapt our design for flexible structure of multimodal sequences.
* \(\mathcal{F}^{r}\) (_reverse raster-scan_): it reverses the sequential order of visual tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\). In this case, sequence order of visual tokens starts from lower-right corner of input \(2\)-D visual features to upper-left corner, row by row. The order of full multimodal sequence \(\mathbb{S}\) is in format of \(\{V,V-1,...,1,V+1,...,V+T\}\).

The _reverse raster-scan_ model \(\mathcal{F}^{r}\) alters relative positions between visual tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\) and instruction tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{instruct}\). For example, for instruction token \(w_{V+1}\), its relative distance to visual token \(w_{V}\) changes from \(1\) to \(V\), resulting in weaker correlations between \(w_{V}\) and \(w_{V+1}\).

Our experiment setup is as follows. Given an image \(I_{v}\), we follow [41] and ask questions in a polling-base manner. Specifically, for an object \(O_{v}\) in image \(I_{v}\), we follow the instruction format of "is there a/an {object} in this image?" to test our models. We crop region of object \(O_{v}\) from \(I_{v}\) according to its bounding box annotation and paste the cropped object over different positions of a pre-defined image template (more details are covered in Appendix C.1). This results in new images \(\{I_{v_{1}},...,I_{v_{k}}\}\), where \(\{v_{1},...,v_{k}\}\) indicates different pasting positions. We carry out these testing over \(N\) images from [42] and aggregate correct responses with respect to pasting positions \(\{v_{1},...,v_{k}\}\).

**RoPE affects object hallucination**. The quantitative results of model \(\mathcal{F}^{b}\) and \(\mathcal{F}^{r}\) are visualized in Fig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively. For model \(\mathcal{F}^{b}\), we find that the response is less likely correct when object \(O_{v}\) is pasted on the upper part of the image, and it is more likely correct when object \(O_{v}\) is pasted on the lower part of image template. This is in stark contrast to \(\mathcal{F}^{r}\) experimental results: model responses are more likely to be correct when pasting image crop \(O_{v}\) on the upper part of images, while less likely to be correct when pasting position is the lower part. For model \(\mathcal{F}^{r}\), we note

Figure 2: **Motivation Experiment.** Given an image \(I_{v}\) with object \(O_{v}\), we crop \(O_{v}\) and paste it to various spatial positions \(\{v_{1},...,v_{k}\}\) within a pre-defined template. For every pasting position, we ask two LVLMs (\(\mathcal{F}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{r}\)) if object \(O_{v}\) is in this template, where \(\mathcal{F}_{b}\) refers to a baseline model that follows raster-scan positional alignment strategy and \(\mathcal{F}_{r}\) refers to a model that resorts to reversal raster-scan position alignment strategy. The total number of correct responses at different pasting positions \(\{v_{1},...,v_{k}\}\) is reported in (a) and (b), which refers to results from model \(\mathcal{F}_{b}\) and \(\mathcal{F}_{r}\), respectively. We observe that LVLM \(\mathcal{F}_{b}\) are more likely to generate correct responses when pasting object \(O_{v}\) to lower region, while \(\mathcal{F}_{r}\) are less hallucinated when pasting object \(O_{v}\) to upper region. Pasting positions with the most and the least correct responses are highlighted in solid-line and dotted-line red boxes. More details are provided in Appendix C.1. Best viewed in color.

of length \(V\) and a instruction token sequence of length \(T\), the maximum distance between visual tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\) and instruction tokens \(\mathbb{S}_{instruct}\) is \((\frac{\sqrt{V}}{2}+T-1)\). This concentric sequential ordering also better maintains 2-D spatial locality of visual tokens. Under this scenario, visual tokens that are closer in euclidean distances are causally correlated when position \(m\) increases. Meanwhile, visual tokens that share the same position are correlated in visual self-attention. We note that such design mitigates negative effect from RoPE long-term decay, via decreasing relative distances between \(\mathbb{S}_{vision}\) and \(\mathbb{S}_{instruct}\) while keeping causal inference scheme in pre-trained LLMs like LLaMA [64].

**Concentric Causal Masking**. Another part of our method resorts to modification of default causal attention masking towards our concentric visual token reorganization. As presented in Fig. 3 (c), a query feature \(q_{m}\) (derived from \(w_{m}\)) only attends to preceding key features \(k_{<=m}\). Likewise for our method, we follow the same principle to force causal attention masking in 2-D visual inputs. We visualize our masking in Fig. 3 (d), where the total length of visual tokens are 36 (6 by 6). Combining visual token re-organization with concentric causal masking, our method models 2-D continuity for visual inputs and effectively mitigates the object hallucination issue brought by long-term decay in RoPE.

## 5 Experiments

We first describe training details for our position alignment approach and evaluation setups in Sec. 5.1. Subsequently, we report results for several popular benchmarks that demonstrates efficacy of our simple design in the remaining subsections. Further, we present qualitative comparison in Appendix D.2 where our approach generates less hallucinated responses. From a broader scope, we present that our positional alignment strategy benefits general perception capability of LVLMs, where preliminary experiments show that it surpasses the baseline consistently over six multimodal benchmarks [36, 28, 22, 48, 8, 49]. We refer to these results in Appendix D.1 due to page limits. By default, we conduct our training and evaluation with Vicuna-7B [11] model, unless otherwise stated.

### Training Details

Following [46, 45], we adopt pre-trained CLIP ViT-L/14 [55] with 336x336 resolutions as visual encoder and Vicuna-7B [12] as LLM, and a 2-layer MLP that connects the visual encoder and LLM. Training consists of two stages, including 1) a pre-training over CC-558K dataset [46] with global batch size of 256 and 2) a instruction tuning with a 665k multi-turn conversation dataset [45] with global batch size of 128.

### Pope

Polling-based Object Probing Evaluation (POPE) [41] is proposed to provide a detailed evaluation of object hallucination in LVLMs, by querying the models about presence of specific objects in given images with yes-or-no questions. POPE adopts three sampling options to sample negative objects: random, popular and adversarial. We refer to [41] for these setups. Following [34], three datasets are included in our evaluation, including COCO [42], GQA [28] and A-OKVQA [58]. For each evaluation setup, every subset includes 3,000 questions for 500 images, which leads to 27,000 yes-or-no questions in total.

The experimental results are presented in Tab. 1. Our method achieves the highest accuracy and F1 scores across all datasets and negative sampling setups. By re-organization of visual tokens and concentric masking, our approach achieves 5.48%, 7.86% and 6.70% accuracy improvement and 5.89%, 7.71% and 6.19% F1 score improvement over the baseline model [46]. We also observe consistent and notable performance gains against state-of-the-art hallucination mitigation methods. CCA surpasses VCD [34] by 1.02%, 4.51% and 2.65% on three datasets. Particularly, we observe 3.09%, 5.01% and 3.59% F1 score improvement over adversarial evaluation set, which selects the most frequent co-occuring objects with ground-truth objects in image inputs, posing challenges for LVLMs to discern spurious correlation. Our trained model is also comparable to LLaVA-RLHF model (with Vicuna-\(13\)B as its LLM) [62] that additionally aligns model responses with human preference. These results indicate importance of re-organizing visual tokens in vision-language alignment.

### Chair

We further evaluate our method on Caption Hallucination Assessment with Image Relevance (CHAIR) metric. CHAIR was a pioneering study introduced to measure object hallucination in image captioning [57]. It quantifies the factuality of a model by calculating the proportion of objects not present in ground truth over all objects in caption output. It contains both instance level score CHAIR\({}_{I}\) (shorted for \(C_{I}\)) and sentence level score CHAIR\({}_{S}\) (\(C_{S}\)) which holistically assess a model's performance. Specifically, CHAIR metric is formulated as:

\[C_{S}=\frac{|\{\text{sentences with hallucinated objects}\}|}{|\{\text{all sentences}\}|},\ C_{I}=\frac{|\{\text{hallucinated objects}\}|}{|\{\text{all mentioned objects}\}|}\]

where lower scores corresponds to better performance. Following previous studies [26], we prompt LVLMs with _"Please describe this image in detail."_. Note that LVLM's performance on CHAIR metric is highly dependent on their output sentence length. Short and succinct responses have less chances to make mistakes and thus would generally have better CHAIR scores. Different textual prompts such as _"in detail"_ and _"in brief"_ also influences output length and creates bias in CHAIR evaluation [41]. To offset the influence of output length and prompt phrasing and ensure fair basis of comparison, we follow the experimental setup in OPERA [26] and set the maximum text token to 64 and 512 respectively to examine hallucination on both short and long responses. Following [26], we sample 500 images from COCO VAL 2014 [42] to generate descriptions from different models and hallucination mitigation methods.

Our image caption evaluation result on CHAIR is shown in Tab. 2. For greedy decoding, our model surpasses baseline model [46] by 3.2% while maintaining high object recall (80.3% v.s. 80.4%) for long-response generation (by setting max new tokens to \(512\)). Note that longer textual responses suggests more significant distance between visual and instruction tokens, leading to higher hallucination rates [83], which can be improved by our approach that reduces relative distance between visual and textual tokens. Our results are comparable against LLaVA-RLHF [62] over this setup. On short responses, our model also outperforms baseline model by 2.8% on sentence-level and 0.8% on instance-level while maintaining high object recall.

Our approach is also effective when using beam search for autoregressive decoding. We surpass the baseline by 0.8% and 0.5% on long-response generation, and 2.2% and 0.5% on short-response generation for \(C_{S}\) and \(C_{I}\), respectively. Our approach is also complementary to OPERA [26]. In comparison to baseline model that using OPERA decoding, our approach are 1.8% and 1.1% better for \(C_{S}\) and \(C_{I}\) on long-response setting. We observe consistent performance gains in short-response generation (1.6% for \(C_{S}\) and 0.9% for \(C_{I}\)). Quantitative evaluations on open-ended generation indicates importance of a better positional alignment strategy and efficacy of our design.

Following [34], we evaluation 4 perception sub-tasks that examines LVLMs on object-level and attribute-level hallucinations, including measure of object existence, count, position and color. As presented in Tab. 3, our method surpasses the baseline by 76.33 on these tasks. In comparison to previous hallucination mitigation method VCD, our approach demonstrates non-negligible performance gains over all subtasks (e.g., 2.00 improvement from VCD v.s. 24.00 improvement from our method). These results indicate the potential of CCA to improve general perception capability of LVLMs.

### GPT4V-Aided Evaluation

We also evaluate our approach on LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild) [46], composed of 24 images with 60 questions in total. LLaVA-Bench (In-the-Wild) constitutes three types of questions, including conversation, detailed description and complex reasoning. Following [46, 26], we ask these models to generate responses and let the text-only GPT-4 [1] be the judge to rate these responses. The results are presented in Tab. 4. In comparison to OPERA [26] that specializes in open-ended generation, our method still stands out when examined by GPT-4 according to detailness and correctness, suggesting efficacy of our positional alignment strategy on generating accurate long responses.

## 6 Conclusion and Limitations

In this paper, we aim to mitigate object hallucination in Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM). We perform in-depth analysis on correlation between object hallucination and Rotary Position Encoding, a widely used positional dependency modeling design in existing LVLMs. We find that LVLMs are more likely to hallucinate when relevant visual cues are distant from instruction tokens in 1-D multimodal sequence, due to long-term decay in RoPE. To this end, we propose Concentric Causal Attention, a simple yet effective positional alignment strategy that reduces relative distances between visual and instruction tokens, alleviating negative impact brought by RoPE long decay on object hallucination. Experimental results over multiple evaluation benchmarks supports our design, indicating importance of better position alignment strategy.

**Limitation**. While this study shows improvements on mitigating object hallucination in LVLMs, our focus is only limited to handling of image-text inputs. We consider positional alignment strategy for other modalities of input data as future works, such as audio or video inputs that differs from image-text modalities.

## Appendix A Broader Impact

Like other LVLMs, models trained by our CCA approach have their potential benefits and risks when they are publicly released. As our approach is validated on LLaVA which constitutes CLIP, Vicuna and LLaMA, our trained models may inherit risks from these pre-trained visual encoders and large language models, including handling malicious inputs, hallucination or potential biases. We mitigate these issues following other LVLMs.

## Appendix B RoPE in LLaMA

We further clarify the role of Rotary Position Encoding (RoPE) [61] in LLaMA architecture with a separate illustration. As Fig. 4 shows, RoPE is densely involved in LLaMA [63, 64], namely in all self-attention layers. This is architectually distinct from how positions are involved in ViT, where absolute PEs are only added once right after patch embedding layer. As most open-source LVLMs are using LLaMA as their language backbones [46, 84, 15, 67, 30, 79], it is noteworthy to study how RoPE may affect multimodal perception when we connect pretrained vision models (e.g., CLIP) with LLaMA.

We include more details here about implementation for Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 results in main paper, including data and model architecture we use, and training details we follow.

### Pilot Experiment

**Training**. As described in Sec. 3 of main paper, we train a baseline LVLM \(\mathcal{F}_{b}\) that follows raster-scan positional alignment and another LVLM \(\mathcal{F}_{r}\) that follows reversal raster-scan position alignment. For these two models, we carry out two-stage training following [46], except for the second stage we train both models for 20K steps with LoRA [25] due to resource limitations. Both experiments share the same training hyper-parameters as 665K full schedule training.

**Inference**. We sample 3,000 annotations from COCO VAL 2014 [42] to carry out our motivation experiments. For each annotation with its corresponding image, we crop an object according to its bounding box and paste it within a pre-defined template (a visually gray image), which is initialized with ImageNet [16] average pixel values. We test \(k\) spatial positions \(\{v_{1},...,v_{k}\}\), where \(k\) is set to \(144\), resulting in resolution of \(12\) by \(12\) for both aggregated results in Fig. 2. Workflow on how we construct such synthetic data is further presented in Fig. 5.

Figure 4: **RoPE in LLaMA**. A schematic view for LLaMA where RoPE is highlighted, and an example illustration on how RoPE is applied over query or key feature. We use a short input sequence with length of 4 and feature dimension of 4 for demonstration purpose. Input tokens are rotated with angles, subject to token positions. For mathematical definition, please refer to Sec. 3.

### Information Flow

We reveal long-term decay property of RoPE [61] in scope of LVLMs. To implement this, we use 3,000 imagery pairs from POPE [41] adversarial setup, and LLaVA-1.5-7B [46] as our LVLM. For each image-query pair, we extract and aggregate self-attentions from the first decoder layer of LLaMA [64]. We average obtained self-attentions across heads and images to obtain our quantitative results in Fig. 1. A pseudo code is provided below for further clarification.

## Appendix D More Results

### Comparison over Multiple-Choice Benchmarks

Beyond the scope of visual hallucination, we consider our proposed positional alignment as a general approach for improving perception capability for LVLMs. We further evaluate our trained model over six benchmarks that examines LVLMs general perception capability, including SEED-Bench [36], ScienceQA [49], GQA [28], Vizwiz [22], MMBench [48] and MMStar [8] which evaluates LVLMs perception capability with multiple choice questions. We use Imms-eval [80] to do our comparison.

For details of our evaluation benchmarks, SEED-Bench [36] consists of 19k multiple choice questions with human annotations, while spanning 12 evaluation dimensions, including both image and video data. MMBench [48] also examines LVLMs on general perception capabilities using a wide range of tasks. We also present our comparisons on ScienceQA [49], Vizwiz [22] and GQA [28] that examines certain perception capability, like knowledge and relation. Note that MMStar [8] is a vision-indispensible benchmark, which requires better visual grounding in trained LVLMs. We present our results against baseline model [46] in Tab. 5. In comparison to our baseline model LLaVA, our positional alignment approach achieves non-negligible gains across all six benchmarks, without introducing additional computation during training. Such performance gains highlight potential of Concentric Causal Attention on enhancing general visual perception capability of LVLMs.

Figure 5: Workflow illustration on how we synthesize testing data. Given an image and box annotation for one object instance, we crop it and paste it on a template image, initialized with ImageNet mean pixel values. We paste every cropped region on every spatial position. Resulting data constitutes a large amount of questions about object existence, diverse in spatial positions.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the claims made in the paper. The claims match experimental results and reflect that our method can be expected to generalize to other settings. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 6 for limitations. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include theoretical results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.

* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 5.1 in the main text and Sec. C.1 for training our models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We refer readers to [https://github.com/xing0047/cca-llava](https://github.com/xing0047/cca-llava) for details of data and code guideline. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.

* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Sec. 5.1 in the main text for training details while Sec. 5 in the main text and Appendix D.1 for evaluation details. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: Error bars are not reported since training of LVLMs is computationally expensive. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix E for GPUs we use and execution time for training LVLMs. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. ** The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute.
* The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: The research conducted in the paper conforms with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please find Broader Impacts in Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We use open-sourced models and data only. We have properly cited original papers of our training and evaluation data. The license for assets used in this paper are under CC-BY 4.0. Our models in this paper will be under CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0 license. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. ** Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have properly cited original papers of our training and evaluation data. The licenses for models we use include CLIP, which is under MIT License, and LLaMA2, which is under Apache-2.0. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects**Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained?

Answer: [NA]

Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
