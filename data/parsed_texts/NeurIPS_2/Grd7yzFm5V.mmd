###### Abstract

Recent methods are proposed to improve performance of domain adaptation by inferring domain index under an adversarial variational bayesian framework, where domain index is unavailable. However, existing methods typically assume that the global domain indices are sampled from a vanilla gaussian prior, overlooking the inherent structures among different domains. To address this challenge, we propose a Bayesian Domain Adaptation with **G**aussian **M**ixture **D**omain-**I**ndexing(GMDI) algorithm. GMDI employs a Gaussian Mixture Model for domain indices, with the number of component distributions in the "_domain-themes_" space adaptively determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. By dynamically adjusting the mixtures at the domain indices level, GMDI significantly improves domain adaptation performance. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GMDI achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound, closer to the log-likelihood. For classification, GMDI outperforms all approaches, and surpasses the state-of-the-art method, VDI, by up to 3.4%, reaching 99.3%. For regression, GMDI reduces MSE by up to 21% (from 3.160 to 2.493), achieving the lowest errors among all methods.

## 1 Introduction

Machine learning models often suffer from performance degradation when applied to new domains that differ from their training domains, a phenomenon known as domain shift [21, 8, 28, 15]. Domain Adaptation (DA) [4, 44, 49, 42, 6, 1, 37, 32, 38, 13] seeks to mitigate this issue by producing domain-invariant features, thereby enhancing generalization from source to target domains [23, 19, 12, 39, 45].

Recent research has explored the use of domain identity and domain index to improve domain-invariant data encoding and enhance domain adaptation performance [36, 40, 41]. _Domain identity_[41], a one-hot discrete variable vector, differentiates between domains, whereas _domain index_[41], a real-valued continuous variable vector, captures domain semantics. Due to the limited information in the discrete domain identity vector, research has increasingly focused on the domain index. Current approaches to incorporating domain index in domain adaptation include: (1) Directly using existing additional information in the dataset as the domain index [36, 40], which is impractical for datasets lacking such indices [22, 29], and (2) Treating the domain index as a latent variable to be inferred [26, 41]. However, these methods typicallymodel the domain indices with a simple Gaussian distribution, limiting the domain indices space and thus hindering adaptation to diverse target domains, resulting in suboptimal performance.

To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a Bayesian Domain Adaptation with Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing (GMDI) algorithm. The proposed adversarial Bayesian algorithm assumes that domain indices follow a mixture of Gaussian distributions, with the number of mixture components dynamically determined by a Chinese Restaurant Process. As shown in Figure 1, a single Gaussian distribution struggles to adequately fit the domain indices, neglecting the inherent structures among different domains. This observation motivates us to model domain indices from different domains collectively as a Gaussian mixture distribution. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to model domain indices as a mixture of Gaussian distributions to address the aforementioned challenges. Inspired by [3], the latent space of the mixture is defined as the "domain-themes" space. The mixtures of distributions provide a higher level of flexibility in a larger latent space, thereby increasing the capability to adapt to various target domains with domain shift. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that GMDI achieves a more rigorous evidence lower bound, and that maximizing this bound along with adversarial loss effectively infers optimal domain indices. Extensive experimental results validate the significant effectiveness of GMDI.

Our key contributions are summarized as: (1) Our proposed GMDI is the first one to consider the entire distributions of domain indices in the "domain-themes" space following a mixture of Gaussian distributions, and dynamically determining the number of components in the mixture with the Chinese Restaurant Process. (2) Our detailed theoretical analysis demonstrates that training with GMDI's superior evidence lower bound together with adversarial loss can yield optimal and more interpretable domain indices. (3) Extensive experiments on classification and regression tasks showcase the strong domain index modeling capability of GMDI, significantly outperforming the state-of-the-art.

## 2 Related Work

**Adversarial domain adaptation.** There exists a substantial body of work on domain adaptation [4, 44, 49, 42, 6, 1, 37, 32, 38]. They focus on generating domain-invariant data encoding by aligning the distributions of source and target domains to adapt to target domains. This alignment is achieved by directly matching the statistics of distributions [25, 24] or by employing adversarial loss [33, 31], which encourages domain confusion through adversarial objective with a discriminator. Adversarial domain adaptation is widely used due to its integration with deep learning, strong theoretical foundation [7], and superior performance. Various different types of adversarial losses have been explored: [35] uses an inverted label GAN loss, [5] utilizes a minimax loss, and [34] employs a cross-entropy loss against the uniform distribution. Typically, the discriminators in these models rely on _domain identity_, which contains limited information, to align data encoding distributions. [20] and [10] also pay attention to domain identity. Our work, however, focuses on _domain index_, providing a more detailed representation of domains.

**Domain adaptation related to domain indices.** Recently, there has been growing interest in using continuous _domain index_, which contain richer and more interpretable information, to enhance domain adaptation performance. [36] use the rotation angle of images as the domain index for the Rotating MNIST dataset and patients' ages as the domain index for Healthcare Datasets. Their theoretical analysis demonstrates the value of utilizing domain indices to generate domain-invariant features. [40] employ graph node embeddings as domain indices to achieve domain adaptation in graph-relational domains. These methods assume that domain indices are available. However, in practice, domain indices are not always accessible [22, 29]. [26] generates features representing the similarity between different domains but do not formally define the domain index. [41] formally define the domain index and treat it as a latent variable to be inferred. Although [41] takes steps towards Bayesian approximation to parameter distributions, it only assumes a single domain index

distribution, limiting its capability to adapt to diverse target domains effectively. In contrast, we address this issue by representing the domain index with a dynamically updated mixture model.

## 3 Background

### Problem setup

We aim at unsupervised domain adaptation: given \(N\) domains with different domain shifts, each domain has a domain identity \(w\in\mathcal{W}=[N]\triangleq\{1,...,N\}\), and each domain contains \(D_{w}\) data points. Similar to the conventional unsupervised domain adaptation setting, the \(N\) domains are divided into source domains with labeled data \(\mathcal{D}^{S}=\{(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{s},y_{i}^{s},w_{i}^{s})\}_{i=1}^{n_{s}}\) and target domains with unlabeled data \(\mathcal{D}^{T}=\{(\mathbf{x}_{i}^{t},w_{i}^{t})\}_{i=1}^{n_{t}}\). A foundational element that builds up our research problem is the diverse domain shifts [14] between different target domains and source domains. For source domains, the complexity of each target domain varies, which motivates us to dynamically infer domain indices in the "domain-themes" space and model them with dynamic Gaussian Mixture Model. We aim to (1) predict the label \(\{y_{i}^{t}\}_{i=1}^{n_{t}}\) of target domain data, and (2) infer local domain index \(\mathbf{u}_{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{B_{u}}\) and global domain index \(\mathbf{\theta}_{w}\in\mathbb{R}^{B_{\mathbf{\theta}}}\) in the dynamic "domain-themes" space. The summary of the notations is presented in Appendix J.

### Preliminary

**Domain index.** The domain index, distinct from domain identity \(w\), represents domain semantics, thus empowering it to significantly enhance domain adaptation performance. As per its definition [36; 41], the domain index satisfies the following : (1) To acquire domain-invariant data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\), the global domain index \(\mathbf{\theta}\) must remain independent of data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\), i.e., \(\mathbf{\theta}\perp\!\!\!\perp z\) or equivalently \(p(\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{\theta})=p(\mathbf{z})\). (2) Effectively representing data point \(\mathbf{x}\) while averting the occurrence of collapsing. (3) Ensuring optimal performance of downstream tasks utilizing the data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\) learned by the encoder under the aforementioned constraints, and necessitating the maintenance of sensitivity to labels.

**Variational domain index.** In circumstances where the domain index may not be readily accessible, the Variational Domain Index (VDI) [41] is a Bayesian approach to infer the domain index \(\mathbf{\theta}\) and \(\mathbf{u}\) as latent variables. VDI factorizes the generative model \(p(\mathbf{x},y,\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{\varepsilon})\) as:

\[p(\mathbf{x},y,\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{\varepsilon})=p(\mathbf{\theta}\mid \mathbf{\varepsilon})p(\mathbf{u}\mid\mathbf{\theta})p(\mathbf{x}\mid\mathbf{u})p(\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{x },\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta})p(y\mid\mathbf{z})\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathbf{\varepsilon}\) denotes the parameters for the prior probability distribution of the domain index \(

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:4]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

where \(\mathbf{\mu}_{k}\) and \(\mathbf{\sigma}_{k}^{2}\) are mean vector and semi-positive covariance matrix of the \(k\)-th component in dynamic Gaussian mixture of domain indices, respectively. Figure 3 illustrates the generative process of VDI with a single distribution and GMDI with a mixture of distributions for domain indices. Since CRP is computationally intensive. To improve computational efficiency, we consider the stick-breaking construction to transform the infinite Gaussian mixture of domain indices into a finite one. It can be achieved by directly specifying an upper bound \(K\) for the number of components in Gaussian mixture of domain indices. Selecting an appropriate \(K\) allows to effectively reduce computational overhead. The finite version of the generative process of GMDI is available in Appendix A.

Accordingly, the generative model can be factorized as follows:

\[p(\mathbf{x},y,\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v,\mathbf{\beta}\mid\alpha)=p(\mathbf{\beta}\mid \alpha)p(v\mid\mathbf{\beta})p(\mathbf{\theta}^{v})p(\mathbf{u}\mid\mathbf{\theta}^{v})p(\mathbf{ x}\mid\mathbf{u})p(\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v})p(y\mid\mathbf{z})\,. \tag{12}\]

The predictor \(p(y\mid\mathbf{z})\) is a categorical distribution for classification tasks and a Gaussian distribution for regression tasks.

### Evidence Lower Bound

The exact posterior of all latent variables, i.e., \(p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v,\mathbf{\beta}\mid\mathbf{x})\) is intractable, variational inference is used to approximate the posterior. Compared to the Monte Carlo sampling, variational inference allows both uncertainty quantification and computational efficiency. We employ structured variational inference to approximate the exact posterior, factorizing the approximate posterior \(q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v,\mathbf{\beta}\mid\mathbf{x})\):

\[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v,\mathbf{\beta}\mid\mathbf{x})=q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})q (v;\mathbf{\eta})q(\mathbf{u}\mid\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}\mid\mathbf{u};\bm {\psi}_{\theta})q(\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v};\mathbf{\psi}_{z})\,, \tag{13}\]

where \(\mathbf{\gamma},\mathbf{\eta},\mathbf{\psi}_{u},\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta}\) and \(\mathbf{\psi}_{z}\) respectively represent the parameters of the variational distributions \(q(\mathbf{\beta})\), \(q(v)\), \(q(\mathbf{u}\mid\mathbf{x})\), \(q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}\mid\mathbf{u})\) and \(q(\mathbf{z}\mid\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v})\).

We train GMDI by maximizing the evidence lower bound(ELBO) to obtain the optimal variational distributions which best approximate exact posterior distributions. Section 5 demonstrates that our proposed GMDI has a more stringent evidence lower bound. Based on generative and inference process of GMDI, we calculate the ELBO as follows:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}} =\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\phi})q(v; \mathbf{\eta})}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]+\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})}[ \log p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u})]\] \[+\mathbb{E}_{q(v;\mathbf{\eta})q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{ x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})}[\log p(\mathbf{u}| \mathbf{\theta}^{v})]-\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})||p(\mathbf{\beta})]\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})}[\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{v};\mathbf{ \eta})||p(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\psi}_{v})]]-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{ \theta})q(v;\mathbf{\eta})}[\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{\beta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta })||p(\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]]\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})}[\log q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x} ;\mathbf{\psi}_{u})]\,, \tag{14}\]

where \(\mathbf{\phi}\) and \(\mathbf{\xi}\) represent the parameters of the variational distributions \(q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\) and \(q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{x})\), respectively, and \(\mathrm{KL}\left[\cdot||\cdot\right]\) is the Kullback-Leibler divergence.

### Adversarial loss with a discriminator

To ensure the independence between global domain index \(\mathbf{\theta}\) and data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\) as defined, we follow VDI [41] by training an additional discriminator D with an adversarial loss. As we prove in Section 5 that the independence between global domain index \(\mathbf{\theta}\) and data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\) relies on the independence between domain identity \(w\) and data encoding \(\mathbf{z}\), the adversarial loss is simplified to discriminate the domain identity \(w\):

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{D}}=\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\psi}_{z})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w|\mathbf{z})]\,. \tag{15}\]

### Objective function

Combining Equation 14 and Equation 15, the final objective of GMDI is:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}=\max\min_{D}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}-\lambda* \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{D}}\,, \tag{16}\]

where \(\lambda\) denotes the hyper-parameter that balances two terms. Since the exact posterior of all latent variables is intractable, we propose to use a structured variational inference method to approximate the exact posterior. More details can be viewed in the appendix B.

**Variational distribution of \(\mathbf{\beta}\).** To derive the optimal variational distribution of \(\mathbf{\beta}\), we only consider the terms related to \(\mathbf{\beta}\) in \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}\), then we can get the posterior \(q(\mathbf{\beta}_{k};\mathbf{\gamma}_{k})=\mathrm{Beta}(\mathbf{\beta}_{k};\gamma_{k,1}, \gamma_{k,2})\) with parameters \(\gamma_{k,1}=1+\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\) and \(\gamma_{k,2}=\alpha+\sum_{i=k+1}^{K}\mathbf{\eta}_{i}\).

**Variational distribution of \(v\).** Similarly, the variational posterior of \(v\) can be calculated as a Categorical distribution \(q(v;\mathbf{\eta})=\mathrm{Categorical}_{K}(v;\mathbf{\eta})\), where the pareameters can be updated as:

\[\log\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\propto \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})}[\mathbf{\pi}]+\mathbb{E}_{q( \mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})}[ \log p(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})}[ \mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})||p(\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]]\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\xi})}[\mathrm{ KL}[q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{z})||p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{ \theta},\mathbf{x})]]\,, \tag{17}\]

where \(\sum_{k=1}^{K}\mathbf{\eta}_{k}=1\) and \(q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})=\prod_{k=1}^{K-1}q(\mathbf{\beta}_{k};\mathbf{\gamma}_{k})\).

**Variational distribution of \(\mathbf{\theta}\),\(\mathbf{u}\) and \(\mathbf{z}\).** With assuming that the latent parameters are sampled from Gaussian, we have the following forms:

\[q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta}) =\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}_{\theta},\mathbf{\sigma}_{\theta}^{2})\,, \tag{18}\] \[q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u}) =\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}_{u},\mathbf{\sigma}_{u}^{2})\,,\] (19) \[q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v};\mathbf{\psi}_{z}) =\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{\mu}_{z},\mathbf{\sigma}_{z}^{2})\,, \tag{20}\]

where \(\mathbf{\mu}\) and \(\mathbf{\sigma}^{2}\) are mean vector and semi-positive covariance matrix of Gaussian distribution. The parameters are updated by gradient descend. Specifically, we follow VDI [41] by using Earth Mover's ELBO is better than the VDI, which means that a mixture of Gaussian prior can get better results. See Appendix C for detailed proof.

**Lemma 1**: _The ELBO of \(p(\mathbf{x},y)\) is bounded by the following formula with the Mutual Information, the Entropy and the \(\mathrm{KL}\)-divergence:_

\[\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)}[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))]\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)-(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y))\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)}[\mathrm{KL}[q (\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})]]\] \[-\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{v},\mathbf{z})]\,.\]

The main difference between and Lemma 1 in GMDI and Lemma 4.1 in VDI [41] is the last two \(\mathrm{KL}\) terms and the inclusion of \(v\).

**Lemma 2**: _(Information Decomposition of the Adversarial Loss [41])We can decompose the global maximum of adversarial loss as follows:_

\[\max_{D}\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}( w|\mathbf{z})]=I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})+I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})-H(w)\,.\]

_The global minimum of the function is achieved if and only if \(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})=0\) and \(I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})=0\)._

**Theorem 1**: _The upper bound of the objective function can be decomposed as follows:_

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)-I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})-I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})-(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y)-H(w))\,.\]

The main difference between Theorem 1 in GMDI and Theorem 4.1 in VDI [41] is the inclusion of \(v\).

**Theorem 2**: _The global optimum is achieved if and only if: (1)\(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})=I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})=0\), (2)\(I(y;\mathbf{z})\) and \(I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)\) are maximized, (3)\(\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z })]=0\) and \(\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})]=0\)._

The main difference between Theorem 2 in GMDI and Theorem 4.2 in VDI [41] is that \(I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)\), which includes \(v\), needs to be maximized, and the two \(\mathrm{KL}\) divergences should equal zero.

**Theorem 3**: _Assuming the ELBO and objective of VDI are \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm VDI-ELBO}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm VDI}\) respectively, where domain indices are sampled from a simple Gaussian prior, we can prove that our objective achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound which is closer to the log-likelihood, and also a tighter upper bound of the objective: \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm VDI-ELBO}\leq\mathcal{L}_{\rm ELBO}\leq\log p(\mathbf{x},y)\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\rm VDI}\leq\mathcal{L}_{\rm GMDI}\)._

## 6 Experimental Study

We verify the effectiveness of GMDI via experimental comparison and analysis. In particular, we answer three research questions: (**RQ1**) Can the performance of GMDI for domain adaptation outperform baselines? (**RQ2**) How effective is the global domain indices inferred by GMDI? (**RQ3**) How does the number of mixture components K affect results? Additional experimental results are available in Appendix K.

### Experimental setup

**Datasets.** We compare GMDI with existing DA methods on the following datasets (see Appendix H and Appendix I for more details): _Circle_[36] is used for binary classification task. _DG-15_ and _DG-60_[40] are synthetic datasets used for binary classification task. _TPT-48_[40] dataset is a real-world dataset used for regression task. W (6) \(\rightarrow\) E (42): Adapting models from the 6 states in the west to the 42 states in the east. N (24) \(\rightarrow\) S (24): Adapting models from the 24 states in the north to the 24 states in the south. _level-1 target domains_: one hop away from the closest source domain. _level-2 target domains_: two hops away from the closest source domain. _level-3 target domains_: more than two hops away from the closest source domain. _CompCars_[43] dataset is a real-world dataset for 4-way classification task.

**Baselines.** To evaluate our proposed GMDI, we compare it against eight state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods: Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (**DANN**) [4], Adversarial Discriminative Domain Adaptation (**ADDA**) [5], Conditional Domain Adaptation Neural Networks (**CDANN**) [48], Margin Disparity Discrepancy (**MDD**) [47], **SENTRY**[27], Domain to Vector (**D2V**) [26], and Variational Domain Index (**VDI**) [41]. Additionally, we include the results for models trained and tested only on the source domain (**Source-only**). Note that D2V is not applicable to regression tasks, so its results are not reported on the _TPT-48_ dataset. Moreover, since our proposed GMDI focuses on inferring domain indices when they are unavailable, whereas [36] and [40] assume domain indices

### Results and discussion

Rq1: Performance on classification and regression tasks.(1) _Circle, DG-15_ and _DG-60_. The results in Table 1 show that, on all three datasets, the performance of baselines other than D2V and VDI is only marginally better or worse than random guess (accuracy of 50\(\%\) ). This is likely due to the complex relationships between domains within the datasets, making it difficult to adapt to target domains. Additionally, Source-only performs poorly due to overfitting. Compared to VDI, our GMDI improves accuracy by up to 3.4\(\%\), achieving very high accuracy (over 96.5\(\%\)). This improvement is attributed to proposal of modeling the global domain index as the mixture distributions (e.g., Figure 8). (2) _TPT-48_. In Table 2, we report the mean square error (MSE) of the evaluated methods on _TPT-48_. In both E (6) \(\rightarrow\) W (42) and N (24) \(\rightarrow\) S (24) regression tasks, all methods except DANN, SENTRY, and VDI performed worse than Source-only, indicating the occurrence of negative transfer. In contrast, GMDI significantly reduced the MSE compared to VDI, with average MSE decreases of 16\(\%\) and 21\(\%\), respectively. (3) _CompCars_. The results in Table 1 show that our method achieves the best classification accuracy. All domain adaptation methods improved to varying degrees compared to Source-only, but our method achieved the highest increase in accuracy, with an improvement of up to 5\(\%\). In Figure 7(left), the data encoding generated by VDI are clustered together, indicating a mixture of points from different class labels. In contrast, in Figure 7(right), the data encoding of GMDI are separated by class label, demonstrating that GMDI can better distinguish points by class label. **Across all datasets, GMDI significantly outperforms baselines, with minimum accuracy of 96.5 \(\%\) on synthetic datasets, while MSE is reduced by at least 16 \(\%\) on _TPT-48_ dataset.**

RQ2: Effectiveness of inferred domain indices.Note that our proposed GMDI have no access to ground-truth domain indices \(\mathbf{\theta}\) during traning. To evaluate the effectiveness of GMDI in inferring domain indices, we compare the inferred domain indices with the ground-truth domain indices and calculate MSE between them. As shown in Figure 5, for nearly all 30 domains on _Circle_ dataset, the MSE of the domain indices inferred by GMDI is significantly lower than that inferred by VDI. On _TPT-48_ dataset, the domain indices for E (6) \(\rightarrow\) W (42) and N (24) \(\rightarrow\) S (24) regression tasks correspond to longitude and latitude of 48 states. Therefore, we use longitude and latitude as the ground-truth domain indices and calculate the corresponding MSE. In Figure 4, it is evident that the MSE of the domain indices inferred by GMDI is still substantially lower than that of VDI. Although the _CompCars_ lacks ground-truth domain indices, the data encoding visualization of VDI and GMDI(Figure 7) show that data encoding generated by GMDI form more distinct clusters compared to VDI. It indirectly indicates the effectiveness of the domain indices inferred by GMDI, demonstrating the considerable impact of modeling the global domain indices as Gaussian Mixture Model. **On all datasets, the domain indices inferred by GMDI outperform those by VDI, owing to the dynamic mixture of domain indices distributions.**

RQ3: Number of mixture components.We utilize the stick-breaking representation of the CRP to improve computational efficiency, setting an upper bound \(K\) on the number of components in GMM. To study the impact of the number of components on domain adaptation performance, we report classification accuracy on _CompCars_, more complex dataset for different values of K.

is obtained with \(K=3\). The results in Figure 6 show that accuracy is the lowest when \(K=1\), suggesting that maintaining a single domain index distribution is insufficient for diverse target domains. The choice of \(K\) is related to the concentration parameter of CRP and the dataset; the larger the concentration parameter and the more complex the dataset, the larger the value of \(K\) should be.

## 7 Conclusion and Limitations

In this work, we propose GMDI, a novel Gaussian Mixture Domain-Indexing algorithm, to address the challenge of inferring domain indices when they are unavailable. Unlike existing methods that assume global domain indices are sampled from a single static Gaussian, GMDI is the first one to utilize a mixture of dynamic Gaussians. The number of mixture components is determined adaptively by the Chinese Restaurant Process, enhancing the flexibility and effectiveness of domain adaptation. Our theoretical analysis confirms that GMDI achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound, closer to the log-likelihood. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GMDI in inferring domain indices and highlight its potential practical applications. Specifically, for classification tasks, GMDI outperforms all approaches, and surpasses the state-of-the-art method, VDI, by up to 3.4%, reaching 99.3%. For regression tasks, GMDI reduces MSE by at least 16% (from 2.496 to 2.087) and by 21% (from 3.160 to 2.493), achieving the lowest errors among all methods. Despite these advantages, GMDI still relies on the availability of domain identities and cannot infer them as latent variables. Future work will focus on developing algorithms capable of inferring domain indices together with domain identities to further enhance the robustness and applicability of our approach.

Similarly, we only consider the terms related to \(v\) in \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}\) to derive the optimal varational posterior, which is calculated as:

\[F(q(v;\mathbf{\eta}))= -\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{\gamma})}[\mathrm{KL}[q(v;\mathbf{\eta}) ||p(v|\mathbf{\beta})]]-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q(v;\mathbf{\eta})}[ \mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})||p(\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]]\] \[+\mathbb{E}_{q(v;\mathbf{\eta})q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q(\mathbf{ \theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})}[\log p(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\xi})}[\mathrm{KL }[q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})||p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v)]]\] \[= \sum_{k=1}^{K}\left\{\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{\beta};\mathbf{ \gamma})}[\log p(v|\mathbf{\beta})]-\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\log\mathbf{\eta}_{k}-\mathbf{\eta}_{k} \mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})}[\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{ u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})||p(\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]]\right.\] \[+\left.\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{x};\mathbf{\psi}_{u})q( \mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{u};\mathbf{\psi}_{\theta})}[\log p(\mathbf{u}|\mathbf{\theta}^{v})]\right.\] \[-\left.\mathbf{\eta}_{k}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{\xi})Proof.: In order to give an upper bound of \(p(\mathbf{x},y)\), we first calculate the ELBO as follows:

\[\log p(\mathbf{x},y) =\log\int p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z},y)dzd\mathbf{ u}\mathbf{d}\mathbf{\theta}^{v}dvd\mathbf{\beta}\] \[=\log\int\frac{p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z},y)* q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{ \beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}dzd\mathbf{u}d\mathbf{\theta}^{v}dvd\mathbf{\beta}\] \[=\log\mathbb{E}_{q}\left[\frac{p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{ \beta},\mathbf{z},y)}{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}\right]\] \[\geq\mathbb{E}_{q}\left[\log\frac{p(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v, \mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z},y)}{q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}\right]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{q}\left[\log\frac{p(y|\mathbf{z})p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{ \theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}{q(\mathbf{u },\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}\right]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]+\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}| \mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]-\mathrm{KL}[p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v, \mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})||q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]\,.\]

Accordingly, we have the following ELBO objective:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))=\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]+ \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]-\mathrm{ KL}[p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})||q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta}, \mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]\,. \tag{41}\]

Here we aim at giving a formula only including **Mutual Information**, **Entropy** and **KL-divergence** to bound the objective. To achieve this, we first calculate the upper bound of \(\mathbb{E}_{q}\log p(y|\mathbf{z})\), with denoting \(r(\mathbf{x},y,\mathbf{z})=p(\mathbf{x},y)q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})\):

\[\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)}\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})] =\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})] \tag{42}\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{r(\mathbf{x},y,\mathbf{z})}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]\] (43) \[\leq\mathbb{E}_{r(y,\mathbf{z})}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]\] (44) \[=\mathbb{E}_{r(y,\mathbf{z})}[\log r(y|\mathbf{z})]\] (45) \[=\mathbb{E}_{r(y,\mathbf{z})}[\log\frac{r(y|\mathbf{z})}{p(y)}]+\mathbb{E} _{r(y,\mathbf{z})}[\log p(y)]\] (46) \[=I(y|\mathbf{z})-H(y)\,. \tag{47}\]

When \(p(y|\mathbf{z})=r(y|\mathbf{z})\), the maximum of \(\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]\) is achieved and then we have \(\max\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]=I(y;\mathbf{z})-H(y)\).

Secondly, we need to give an upper bound of \(\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]\). For convenient, we denote the joint distribution \(s(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})=p(\mathbf{x})q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}, v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})\), then we can calculate as follows:

\[\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)}\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{ \theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]=\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{ x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}{p(\mathbf{x})}\frac{p(\mathbf{x})p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\bm {\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}{q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z })}]\] \[=\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log\frac{q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}{p(\mathbf{x})}]+\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E} _{q}[\log\frac{p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}{q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{ u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})}]\] \[=I_{s}(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})+H(\mathbf{x})- \mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{\beta},\mathbf{z})]\,.\]

Finally, we apply these two bounds on the Eq. 41 and then we can prove the Lemma C.1:

\[\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)}[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))]\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)-(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y))\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)}[\mathrm{KL}[q( \mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})]]\] \[-\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{ \theta},\mathbf{z},v)]\,.\]

**Lemma C.2**: _(Information Decomposition of the Adversarial Loss [41]) We can decompose the global maximum of adversial loss as follows:_

\[\max_{D}\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w| \mathbf{z})]=I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v)+I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta},v)-H(w)\,.\]

_The global minimum of the function is achieved if and only if \(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})=0\) and \(I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta})=0\)_

Proof.: With denoting \(t(w,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z})=p(w,\mathbf{x})q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})q(\mathbf{\theta},v|w)\), we have:

\[\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w|\mathbf{z})] =\mathbb{E}_{t(w,\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w|\mathbf{z})]\leq\mathbb{E}_{t(w,\mathbf{z})}[ \log t(w|\mathbf{z})]\,, \tag{48}\]and \(\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w|\mathbf{z})]\) achieves the maximum when \(t(w,\mathbf{x},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z})=D(w|\mathbf{z})\). To further analyze the joint distribution \(t(w,\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z}):=q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{\theta},v,w)q(\mathbf{\theta},v|w)p(w)\), we assume that there is a function \(v(w)\) mapping \(w\) to a group of domain-related weights \(v\), then we can have:

\[p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{\theta},v,w)=p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{\theta},v(w),w)=p(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{\theta}^{v (w)})=p(\mathbf{z}|w)\,. \tag{49}\]

Accordingly, we can factorize the joint distribution \(t(w,\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})=q(\mathbf{z}|w)q(\mathbf{\theta}^{v}|w)p(w)\). Therefore, we can factorize \(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v,w)\) into two different styles with the chain rule for mutual information:

\[I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v)+I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta},v)=I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v,w)=I( \mathbf{z};w)+I_{q}(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{\theta},v|w)\,, \tag{50}\]

where \(I_{q}(\mathbf{z},\mathbf{\theta},v|w)=0\) due to the chain rule. That means:

\[I(z;w)=I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v)+I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta},v)\,. \tag{51}\]

And we also have:

\[\mathbb{E}_{t(w,\mathbf{z})}[\log t(w|\mathbf{z})] =\mathbb{E}_{t(w,\mathbf{z})}[\log\frac{t(w|\mathbf{z})}{q(w)}]+\mathbb{E} _{t(w,\mathbf{z})}[\log q(w)] \tag{52}\] \[=I(w;\mathbf{z})-H(w)\,. \tag{53}\]

Thus we have:

\[\max_{D}\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D}(w |\mathbf{z})]=I(w;\mathbf{z})-H(w)=I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v)+I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta},v)-H( w)\,. \tag{54}\]

Accordingly, \(\min\max_{D}\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D }(w|\mathbf{z})]=0\) if and only if \(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta},v)=I(\mathbf{z},w|\mathbf{\theta},v)=0\) due to the fact that \(I(\cdot)\geq 0\).

**Theorem C.1**: _The upper bound of the objective function can be decomposed as follows:_

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z}, v)-I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})-I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})-\left(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y)-H(w) \right).\]

The main difference between Theorem C.1 in GMDI and Theorem B.1 in VDI [41] is the inclusion of \(v\).

Proof.: To prove the theorem, we apply the Lemma C.1 and C.2 to directly get the final upper bound:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}} =\mathbb{E}_{p(\mathbf{x},y)}[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y) )]-\max_{D}\mathbb{E}_{p(w,\mathbf{x})}\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})}[\log\mathrm{D }(w|\mathbf{z})]\] \[\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)-I(\mathbf{z}; \mathbf{\theta})-I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})-\left(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y)-H(w)\right)\] \[\quad-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)}[\mathrm{ KL}[q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})]] -\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},z,v)]\] \[\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)-I(\mathbf{z}; \mathbf{\theta})-I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})-\left(H(\mathbf{x})+H(y)-H(w)\right),\]

where the second equality holds when all the terms of \(\mathrm{KL}\)-divergence are equal to zero.

**Theorem C.2**: _The global optimum is achieved if and only if: (1)\(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{\theta})=I(\mathbf{z};w|\mathbf{\theta})=0\), (2)\(I(y;\mathbf{z})\) and \(I(\mathbf{z};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)\) are maximized,(3)\(\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})]=0\) and \(\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},v,\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta}, v,\mathbf{z})]=0\)._

The main difference between Theorem C.2 in GMDI and Theorem B.2 in VDI [41] is that \(I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\mathbf{\theta},\mathbf{z},v)\), which includes \(v\), needs to be maximized, and the two \(\mathrm{KL}\) divergences should equal zero.

Proof.: The theorem can be proved by observing the conditions from Lemma C.1, C.2 and Theorem C.1.

**Theorem C.3**: _Assuming the ELBO and objective of VDI are \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI-ELBO}}\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI}}\) respectively, where domain indices are sampled from a simple Gaussian prior, we can prove that our objective achieves a more stringent evidence lower bound which is closer to the log-likelihood, and also a tighter upper bound of the objective: \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI-ELBO}}\leq\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ELBO}}\leq\log p(\mathbf{x},y)\) and \(\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI}}\leq\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}\)._

Proof.: To compare our objective loss with the VDI's, we first list the ELBO loss of VDI here and provide an upper bound:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI-ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))= \mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(y|\mathbf{z})]+\mathbb{E}_{q}[\log p(\mathbf{x}|\bm {u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z})]-\mathrm{KL}[p(\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z}) ||q(\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})]\] \[\leq I(y;\mathbf{z})+I(\mathbf{x};\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z},v)-(H( \mathbf{x})+H(y))\] \[-\mathbb{E}_{q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z})}[\mathrm{KL} [q(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z})||p(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z })]]\] \[-\mathrm{KL}[q(\mathbf{u},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z}|\mathbf{x})||p(\mathbf{u}, \hat{\mathbf{\theta}},\mathbf{z})]\,.\]We can observe that the most significant difference is the prior distribution, which mainly affects the term of \(\mathrm{KL}\)-divergence. To further analyze, it is obvious that when \(\mathbf{\theta}^{v=k}=\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\), VDI is a special case of our proposed method GMDI. Hence we have:

\[max\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI-ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))\leq\max\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{ GMDI-ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))\,. \tag{55}\]

Further more, we can notice that the adversarial loss is independent of the prior distribution of global indices and we can have:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI}}= \max\min_{D}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{VDI-ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))-\lambda* \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{D}} \tag{56}\] \[\leq \max\min_{D}\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI-ELBO}}(p(\mathbf{x},y))-\lambda* \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{D}}\] \[= \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{GMDI}}\,.\]

## Appendix D Visualization of Inferred Domain Indices for Circle

Figure 8 shows the inferred domain indices for _Circle_ dataset. GMDI's inferred indices have a correlation of 0.99 with true indices, even though _GMDI does not have access to true indices during training_.

## Appendix E Architecture and Implementation Details

### Architecture

The latent variables are estimated by neural networks. Specifically, for the local domain index \(\mathbf{u}\), we employ ResNet-18 [9] to approximate its posterior on _CompCars_ dataset, while using multi-layer perceptrons for the other datasets. Additionally, all neural networks are implemented as multi-layer perceptrons. We use the features obtained from the ResNet-18 as inputs to our model. Furthermore, all inputs are uniformly normalized.

We implement our model based on the code of VDI[41]. We appreciate the authors for making their code publicly available. We run experiments on a single machine using 1 NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti with 11GB memory, 56 Intel Xeon CPUs (E5-2680 v4 @ 2.40GHz). It takes about 30 minutes to train GMDI with K=2 on synthetic datasets, 4 hours on _TPT-48_, and 6 hours on _CompCars_ with K=3.

### DG-15 and DG-60

_DG-15 and DG-60_ datasets containing 15 and 60 domains, respectively. Both used for binary classification task. Adjacent domains in the datasets have similar decision boundaries. For these two datasets, we select 6 connected domains as the source domains, while the remaining domains serve as the target domains.

### Tpt-48

Figure 10[40] visualizes the detailed information of _TPT-48_ dataset. It contains the monthly average temperatures of 48 contiguous states in the United States from 2008 to 2019. Our regression task is to predict the average temperatures for the next 6 months using the average temperatures of the first 6 months. We divide this task into two finer-grained regression tasks with different adaptation directions:

* W (6) \(\rightarrow\) E (42): Adapting models from the 6 states in the west to the 42 states in the east.
* N (24) \(\rightarrow\) S (24): Adapting models from the 24 states in the north to the 24 states in the south.

To better verify performance, the target domains in the above two regression tasks are divided into three groups based on their distance from the closest source domains. _level-1 target domains_: one hop away from the closest source domain. _level-2 target domains_: two hops away from the closest source domain. _level-3 target domains_: more than two hops away from the closest source domain.

### CompCars

_CompCars_ dataset includes three attributes: car types, viewpoints, and years of manufacture (YOMs). We select a subset of _CompCars_ with 4 types (MPV, SUV, sedan and hatchback), 5 viewpoints (front(F), rear (R), side (S), front-side (FS), and rear-side (RS)), and 6 YOMs(2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014) for our experiments. This subset is divided into 30 domains(5 viewpoints \(\times\) 6 YOMs) based on viewpoints and YOMs. The car types are used as labels for prediction. The first domain, which has the front view and YOM 2009, is treated as the source domain, while the remaining 29 domains are target domains.

## Appendix J Notation

Table 4 provides a summary of the notations used in this paper.

## Appendix K Additional Experimental Results

To evaluate the impact and computational cost of the CRP, we conduct ablation and computational cost experiments.We implement GMDI w/o CRP using Gumbel-Softmax [11]. The number of components for GMDI w/o CRP is set to the upper bound \(K\) of GMDI, and the hyperparameter temperature \(\tau\) for Gumbel-Softmax ranges from 0.1 to 50 (with the best performance reported). "Total time" refers to the total training duration, which concludes when the loss converges.

\end{table}
Table 5: The results of the ablation and computational cost experiments on _TPT-48_.

The experimental results are shown in Table 5 and Table 6. We find that although the proposed GMDI has a longer "Time per epoch" compared to GMDI w/o CRP, it converges faster due to the flexible number of components adaptively controlled by CRP. Therefore, the "Total time" is roughly the same as GMDI w/o CRP. On the _TPT-48_(W->E) dataset, due to faster convergence, the "Total time" of GMDI is less than that of GMDI w/o CRP and is even comparable to VDI. In all three datasets, the performance of GMDI w/o CRP is worse than that of GMDI. On the two _TPT-48_ datasets, compared to the baseline VDI, GMDI w/o CRP reduces MSE by 1% and 3%, whereas GMDI reduces MSE by 16% and 21%, surpassing GMDI w/o CRP. On the _CompCars_ dataset, GMDI's accuracy is higher than that of GMDI w/o CRP. These results indicate that although using a fixed-component GMM is simpler, the computational costs are roughly equivalent to using CRP, but the performance is inferior to CRP, demonstrating the significance of CRP in GMDI.

Additionally, compared to VDI, which models the domain index as a single Gaussian distribution, GMDI's computational costs are only slightly higher, yet its performance is superior. For large-scale datasets with numerous domains, modeling the domain index as a simple single Gaussian distribution may result in poor performance due to the dataset's complexity. The experimental results indicate that GMDI has broad applicability.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline \hline Method & Accuracy(\%) & Total time & Epochs & Time per epoch \\ \hline VDI & 42.5 & 3h 13m 15s & 600 & 19s \\ GMDI w/o CRP & 43.0 & 4h 3m 48s & 700 & 21s \\ GMDI & 44.4 & 4h 16m 14s & 600 & 26s \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Abstract and Section 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: See Appendix.

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Codes and dataset to reproduce the experiments are included in the supplemental material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Data and code will be publicly available once the paper is accepted. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes]

Justification: Experimental training details are provided in Appendix

Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes]

Justification: We report performance mean after running experiments for multiple times with different seeds. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).

* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The amount and the type of computing resource used in our experiments are described in Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: Our research is conducted with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: See appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Citations for the existing assets (code, data and baseline models) are provided in Section 6 and Appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review. *
