###### Abstract

Policy Optimization (PO) methods are among the most popular Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms in practice. Recently, Sherman et al. (2023) proposed a PO-based algorithm with rate-optimal regret guarantees under the linear Markov Decision Process (MDP) model. However, their algorithm relies on a costly pure exploration warm-up phase that is hard to implement in practice. This paper eliminates this undesired warm-up phase, replacing it with a simple and efficient contraction mechanism. Our PO algorithm achieves rate-optimal regret with improved dependence on the other parameters of the problem (horizon and function approximation dimension) in two fundamental settings: adversarial losses with full-information feedback and stochastic losses with bandit feedback.

## 1 Introduction

Policy Optimization (PO) is a widely used method in Reinforcement Learning (RL) that achieved tremendous empirical success, with applications ranging from robotics and computer games (Schulman et al., 2015, 2017; Mnih et al., 2015; Haarnoja et al., 2018) to Large Language Models (LLMs; Stiennon et al. (2020); Ouyang et al. (2022)). Theoretical work on policy optimization algorithms initially considered tabular Markov Decision Processes (MDPs; Even-Dar et al. (2009); Neu et al. (2010); Shani et al. (2020); Luo et al. (2021)), where the number of states is assumed to be finite and small. In recent years the theory was generalized to infinite state spaces under function approximation, specifically under linear function approximation in the linear MDP model (Luo et al., 2021; Dai et al., 2023; Sherman et al., 2023, 2023; Liu et al., 2023).

Recently, Sherman et al. (2023) presented the first policy optimization algorithm that achieves rate-optimal regret in linear MDPs, i.e., a regret bound of \(O(\mathrm{poly}(H,d)\sqrt{K})\), where \(K\) is the number of interaction episodes, \(H\) is the horizon, and \(d\) is the dimension of the linear function approximation. However, their algorithm requires a pure exploration warm-up phase to obtain an initial estimate of the transition dynamics. To that end, they utilize the algorithm of Wagenmaker et al. (2022) for reward-free exploration which is not based on the policy optimization paradigm. Moreover, although this algorithm is computationally efficient, it relies on intricate estimation techniques that are hard to implement in practice and unlikely to generalize beyond linear function approximation (see discussion in section 4).

In this paper, we propose a novel contraction mechanism to avoid this costly warm-up phase. Both our contraction mechanism and the warm-up phase serve a similar purpose - ensuring that the Q-value estimates are bounded and yield "simple" policies. But, unlike the warm-up, our method is integrated directly into the PO algorithm, implemented using a simple conditional truncation of the Q-estimates, and only contributes a lower-order term to the final regret bound. Moreover, our approach is muchmore efficient in practice since it does not rely on any reward-free methods, which explore the state space uniformly without taking the reward into account.

Based on this contraction mechanism, we build a new policy optimization algorithm that is simpler, more computationally efficient, easier to implement, and most importantly, improves upon the best-known regret bounds for policy optimization in linear MDPs. Our regret bound holds in two fundamental settings:

1. Adversarial losses with full-information feedback, where the loss function changes arbitrarily between episodes and is revealed to the agent entirely at the end of each episode.
2. Stochastic losses with bandit feedback, where the loss function in each episode is sampled i.i.d from some unknown fixed distribution and the agent only observes instantaneous losses in the state-action pairs that she visits.

In these settings, the best-known regret bound (by Sherman et al. (2023)) was \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^{\tau}d^{4}K})\). Our algorithm, Contracted Features Policy Optimization (CFPO), achieves \(\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{H^{4}d^{3}K})\) regret, yielding a \(\sqrt{H^{3}d}\) improvement over any algorithm for the adversarial setting and matching the value iteration based approach of Jin et al. (2020) in the stochastic setting. We conjecture that this is the best regret we can hope for without more sophisticated variance reduction techniques (Azar et al., 2017; Zanette and Brunskill, 2019; He et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024), that have not yet been applied to PO algorithms even in the tabular setting.1 Ignoring logarithmic factors, the regret of CFPO leaves a gap of only \(\sqrt{Hd}\) from the \(\Omega(\sqrt{H^{3}d^{2}K})\) lower bound for linear MDPs (Zhou et al., 2021). Finally, our analysis relies on a novel regret decomposition that uses a notion of contracted (sub) MDP and may be of separate interest (see section 5).

Footnote 1: Wu et al. (2022) apply variance reduction techniques to get better regret bounds in the tabular setting, but they use \(L_{2}\)-regularization instead of KL-regularization which does not align with practical PO algorithms Schulman et al. (2015, 2017).

### Related work

Policy optimization in tabular MDPs.The regret analysis of PO methods in tabular MDPs was introduced by Even-Dar et al. (2009), which considered the case of known transitions and adversarial losses under full-information feedback. Neu et al. (2010, 2010) extended their algorithms to adversarial losses under bandit feedback. Then, Shani et al. (2020) presented the first PO algorithms for the case of unknown transitions (for both stochastic and adversarial losses), and finally Luo et al. (2021) devised a PO algorithm with rate-optimal regret for the challenging case of unknown transitions with adversarial losses under bandit feedback. Since then, PO was studied in more challenging cases, e.g., delayed feedback (Lancewicki et al., 2022, 2023) and best-of-both-worlds (Dann et al., 2023).

Other regret minimization methods in tabular MDPs.An alternative popular method for regret minimization in tabular MDPs with adversarial losses is O-REPS (Zimin and Neu, 2013; Rosenberg and Mansour, 2019, 2019; Jin et al., 2020), which optimizes over the global state-action occupancy measures instead of locally over the policies in each state. However, this method is hard to implement in practice and does not generalize to the function approximation setting (without restrictive assumptions). For stochastic losses, optimistic methods based on Value Iteration (VI; Jaksch et al. (2010); Azar et al. (2017); Zanette and Brunskill (2019)) and Q-learning (Jin et al., 2018; Zhang et al., 2020) are known to guarantee optimal regret, which has not been established yet for adversarial losses.

Policy optimization in linear MDPs.While Sherman et al. (2023) established rate-optimal regret for PO methods in linear MDPs with stochastic losses, most of the recent research focused on the case of adversarial losses with bandit feedback (Luo et al., 2021; Neu and Olkhovskaya, 2021; Dai et al., 2023; Sherman et al., 2023; Kong et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023; Zhong and Zhang, 2023), where rate-optimality has not been achieved yet.

Other regret minimization methods in linear MDPs and other models for function approximation.Unlike O-REPS methods that do not generalize to linear function approximation, value-based methods (operating under the stochastic loss assumption) are also popular in linear MDPs and have been shown to yield optimal regret (Jin et al., 2020; Zanette et al., 2020; Wagenmaker et al., 2022;Hu et al., 2022; He et al., 2023; Agarwal et al., 2023). Another line of works (Ayoub et al., 2020; Modi et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2022; He et al., 2022; Zhou and Gu, 2022) study linear mixture MDP which is a different model that is incomparable with linear MDP (Zhou et al., 2021). Finally, there is a rich line of works studying statistical properties of RL with more general function approximation (Munos, 2005; Jiang et al., 2017; Dong et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2021; Du et al., 2021), but these usually do not admit computationally efficient algorithms.

## 2 Problem setup

Episodic Markov Decision Process (MDP).A finite-horizon episodic MDP \(\mathcal{M}\) is defined by a tuple \((\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},x_{1},\{\ell^{k}\}_{k=1}^{K},P,H)\) with \(\mathcal{X}\), a set of states, \(\mathcal{A}\), a set of actions, \(H\), decision horizon, \(x_{1}\in\mathcal{X}\), an initial state (assumed to be fixed for simplicity), \(P=(P_{h})_{h\in[H]},P_{h}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\Delta( \mathcal{X})\), the transition probabilities, and \(\{\ell^{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\), sequence of loss functions such that \(\ell^{k}=(\ell^{k}_{h})_{h\in[H]},\ell^{k}_{h}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A} \rightarrow[0,1]\), is a horizon dependent immediate loss function for taking action \(a\) at state \(x\) and horizon \(h\) of episode \(k\). A single episode \(k\) of an MDP is a sequence \((x^{k}_{h},a^{k}_{h},\ell^{k}_{h}(x^{k}_{h},a^{k}_{h}))_{h\in[H]}\in(\mathcal{X }\times\mathcal{A}\times[0,1])^{H}\) such that

\[\Pr[x^{k}_{h+1}=x^{\prime}\mid x^{k}_{h}=x,a^{k}_{h}=a]=P_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a).\]

For the losses, we consider two settings: stochastic and adversarial. In the stochastic setting, there exists a fixed loss function \(\ell=(\ell_{h})_{h\in[H]},\ell_{h}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow[0,1]\) such that \(\ell^{k}\) is sampled i.i.d from a distribution whose expected value is defined by \(\ell\), i.e., \(\mathbb{E}\big{[}\ell^{k}_{h}(x,a)\mid x,a\big{]}=\ell_{h}(x,a)\). In the adversarial setting, the loss function sequence \(\{\ell^{k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\) is chosen by an adaptive adversary.

Linear MDP.A linear MDP Jin et al. (2020) satisfies all the properties of the above MDP but has the following additional structural assumptions. There is a known feature mapping \(\phi:\mathcal{X}\times A\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d}\) such that \(P_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a)=\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}\psi_{h}(x^{\prime})\) where \(\psi_{h}:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{d}\) are unknown parameters. Moreover, for all \(h\in[H],k\in[K]\), there is an unknown vector \(\theta^{k}_{h}\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) such that, in the adversarial case, \(\ell^{k}_{h}(x,a)=\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}\theta^{k}_{h}\), while in the stochastic case, \(\theta^{k}_{h}=\theta_{h}\) and \(\ell_{h}(x,a)=\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}\theta_{h}\). We make the following normalization assumptions, common throughout the literature:

1. \(\|\phi(x,a)\|\leq 1\) for all \(x\in X,a\in\mathcal{A}\);
2. \(\|\theta^{k}_{h}\|\leq\sqrt{d}\) for all \(h\in[H],k\in[K]\);
3. \(\||\psi_{h}|(\mathcal{X})\|=\|\sum_{x\in\mathcal{X}}\lvert\psi_{h}(x)\rvert\| \leq\sqrt{d}\) for all \(h\in[H]\);

where \(\lvert\psi_{h}(x)\rvert\) is the entry-wise absolute value of \(\psi_{h}(x)\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\). We follow the standard assumption in the literature that the action space \(\mathcal{A}\) is finite. In addition, for ease of mathematical exposition (e.g. Cassel et al. (2024)), we also assume that the state space \(\mathcal{X}\) is finite. This allows for simple matrix notation and avoids technical measure theoretic definitions. Importantly, our results are completely independent of the state space size \(\lvert\mathcal{X}\rvert\), both computationally and in terms of regret. Thus, there is no particular loss of generality.

Policy and value.A stochastic Markov policy \(\pi=(\pi_{h})_{h\in[H]}:[H]\times\mathcal{X}\mapsto\Delta(\mathcal{A})\) is a mapping from a step and a state to a distribution over actions. Such a policy induces a distribution over trajectories \(\iota=(x_{h},a_{h})_{h\in[H]}\), i.e., sequences of \(H\) state-action pairs. For \(f:(\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A})^{H}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\), which maps trajectories to real values, we denote the expectation with respect to \(\iota\) under dynamics \(P\) and policy \(\pi\) as \(\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi}[f(\iota)]\). Similarly, we denote the probability under this distribution by \(\mathbb{P}_{P,\pi}[\cdot]\). We denote the class of stochastic Markov policies as \(\Pi_{M}\). For any policy \(\pi\in\Pi_{M}\), horizon \(h\in[H]\) and episode \(k\in[K]\) we define its loss-to-go, as

\[V^{k,\pi}_{h}(x)=\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi}\Bigg{[}\sum_{h^{\prime}=h}^{H}\mathbb{E}[ \ell^{k}_{h^{\prime}}(x_{h^{\prime}},a_{h^{\prime}})\mid x_{h^{\prime}},a_{h^{ \prime}}]\biggm{|}x_{h}=x\Bigg{]},\]

which is the expected loss if one starts from state \(x\in\mathcal{X}\) at horizon \(h\) of episode \(k\) and follows policy \(\pi\) onwards. Note that the inner expectation is only relevant for stochastic losses as its argument is deterministic in the adversarial setup. The performance of a policy in episode \(k\), also known as its value, is measured by its expected cumulative loss \(V^{k,\pi}_{1}(x_{1})\).

Interaction protocol and regret.We consider a standard episodic regret minimization setting where an algorithm performs \(K\) interactions with an MDP \(\mathcal{M}\). For stochastic losses we consider bandit feedback, where the agent observes only the instantaneous losses along its trajectory, while for adversarial losses we consider full-information feedback, where the agent observes the full loss function \(\ell^{k}\) in the end of episode \(k\in[K]\). Concretely, at the start of each interaction/episode \(k\in[K]\), the agent specifies a stochastic Markov policy \(\pi^{k}=(\pi^{k}_{h})_{h\in[H]}\). Subsequently, it observes the trajectory \(\iota^{k}\) sampled from the distribution \(\mathbb{P}_{P,\pi^{k}}\), and, either the individual episode losses \(\ell^{k}_{h}(x^{k}_{h},a^{k}_{h}),h\in[H]\) in the case of bandit feedback, or the entire loss function \(\ell^{k}\) in the case of full-information feedback.

We measure the quality of any algorithm via its _regret_ - the difference between the value of the policies \(\pi^{k}\) generated by the algorithm and that of the best policy in hindsight, i.e.,

\[\mathrm{Regret}=\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\min_{\pi\in\Pi_{M}} \sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{1}^{k,\pi}(x_{1})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-V_{ 1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x_{1}),\]

where the best policy in hindsight is denoted by \(\pi^{*}\) (known to be optimal even among the class of stochastic history-dependent policies).

Notation.Throughout the paper \(\phi^{k}_{h}=\phi(x^{k}_{h},a^{k}_{h})\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) denote the state-action features at horizon \(h\) of episode \(k\). In addition, \(\left\lVert v\right\rVert_{A}=\sqrt{v^{\top}Av}\). Hyper-parameters follow the notations \(\beta_{z}\) and \(\eta_{z}\) for some \(z\), and \(\delta\in(0,1)\) denotes a confidence parameter. Finally, in the context of an algorithm, \(\leftarrow\) signs refer to compute operations whereas \(=\) signs define operators, which are evaluated at specific points as part of compute operations.

## 3 The role of value clipping

Before presenting our contraction technique and main results, we discuss the role that value clipping plays in regret minimization and its apparent necessity for linear MDPs. As a starting point, it is important to note that, while commonly used (Azar et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021), value clipping is not strictly necessary in tabular MDPs. To demonstrate this, consider a fairly standard optimistic Value Iteration (VI) algorithm that constructs sample-based estimates \(\hat{\ell},\hat{P}\) with empirical error estimates \(\Delta_{\ell},\Delta_{P}\), defines exploration bonuses \(b=(\Delta_{\ell}+H\cdot\Delta_{P})\), and chooses a policy \(\hat{\pi}^{*}\) that is optimal in the empirical MDP whose dynamics are \(\hat{P}\) and losses are \(\hat{\ell}-b\). Then its single-episode regret may be decomposed as

\[V_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})-V_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})=\underbrace{V_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{ 1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})}_{(i)-\text{bias}/\text{cost of optimism}}+ \underbrace{\hat{V}_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})}_{(ii) -\text{FTL}/\text{EM}}+\underbrace{\hat{V}_{1}^{\pi^{*}}(x_{1})-V_{1}^{\pi^{*} }(x_{1})}_{(iii)-\text{optimism}},\]

where \(\hat{V}\) is the value under the empirical MDP. Now, by definition of \(\hat{\pi}^{*}\), we have that \((ii)\leq 0\). Now, let \(\Delta\ell=\hat{\ell}-\ell,\Delta P=\hat{P}-P\). Using a standard value difference lemma (lemma 14 in appendix B) we have that \((i)\lesssim b\) and

\[(iii) =\mathbb{E}_{\hat{P},\pi^{*}}\left[\sum_{h\in[H]}\Delta\ell(x_{h},a_{h})-b(x_{h},a_{h})+\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}\Delta P(x^{\prime}\mid x _{h},a_{h})V_{h+1}^{\pi^{*}}(x^{\prime})\right] \tag{1}\] \[\leq\mathbb{E}_{\hat{P},\pi^{*}}\left[\sum_{h\in[H]}\Delta_{\ell }(x_{h},a_{h})+H\Delta_{P}(x_{h},a_{h})-b(x_{h},a_{h})\right]=0,\]

where the inequality also used that \(V_{h}^{\pi^{*}}\in[0,H]\). The final regret bound is concluded by summing over \(k\in[K]\) and using a bound on harmonic sums. We note that a similar clipping-free method also works for tabular PO (see Cassel et al. (2024)).

Moving on to Linear MDPs, one might expect a similar approach to work. Unfortunately, the standard approach that estimates the dynamics backup operators \(\psi_{h},h\in[H]\) using regularized least-squares presents a significant challenge. This is because, unlike the tabular setting, the resulting estimate \(\hat{P}_{h}(\cdot\mid x,a)=\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}\widehat{\psi}_{h}(\cdot)\) (eq. (2)) is not guaranteed to yield a valid probability distribution, i.e., there could exist \(x\in\mathcal{X},a\in\mathcal{A},h\in[H]\) such that

\[\left\|\hat{P}_{h}(\cdot\mid x,a)\right\|_{1}=c>1\quad\text{and/or}\quad\min_{ x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}\hat{P}_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a)<0.\]

\(\hat{P}\) is still a finite signed-measure, which is enough for the first equality in eq. (1) to hold. However, since \(\mathbb{E}_{\hat{P},\pi^{*}}\) could contain negative probability terms, the inequality in eq. (1) does not hold. These negative probabilities also seem to make calculating \(\hat{\pi}^{*}\) computationally hard. Finally, the \(\ell_{1}-\)norm exceeding 1 may cause term \((i)\) to depend on \(H\) exponentially. While some of these issues could be mitigated without clipping, we are not aware of a method that resolves all simultaneously.

The use of value clipping opens the path for an alternative value decomposition that replaces \(\mathbb{E}_{\hat{P},\pi^{*}}\) in eq. (1) with \(\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{*}}\) at the cost of also replacing \(V_{h+1}^{\pi^{*}}\) with \(\hat{V}_{h+1}^{\pi^{*}}\). We thus need that \(|\hat{V}_{h+1}^{\pi^{*}}|\lesssim H\) for the inequality in eq. (1) to work. This is made possible using a clipping mechanism that decouples the scale of \(\hat{V}_{h+1}^{\pi^{*}}\) from the magnitude of the bonuses \(b\), which may be much larger when the error estimates \(\Delta_{\ell},\Delta_{P}\) are large. This is typically achieved by adding \(\max\{0,\cdot\}\) to the recursive formula for the value function. A similar clipping approach also works for tabular PO and VI (Azar et al., 2017; Luo et al., 2021), and even for VI in linear MDPs (Jin et al., 2020).

However, this is not the case for PO in linear MDPs where Sherman et al. (2023) explain that this type of value clipping leads to prohibitive complexity of the policy and value function classes, and thus sub-optimal regret. Concretely, the complexity of the soft-max policy class roughly corresponds to the number of parameters required to represent \(\sum_{k\in[K]}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}\). If \(\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)=\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}w_{h}^{k}\) are linear, then the sum remains linear and depends on \(d\) parameters (with slightly larger magnitude). If \(\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)=\max\{0,\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}w_{h}^{k}\}\), the sum may, in general, have \(dK\) parameters thus degrading the regret. Sherman et al. (2023) overcome this issue using a warm-up based truncation technique. In what follows, we suggest an alternative solution that uses a novel notion of contracted features and has several advantages over their approach (see discussion at the end of section 4).

## 4 Algorithm and main result

We present Contracted Features Policy Optimization (CFPO; algorithm 1), a policy optimization routine for regret minimization in linear MDPs. The algorithm operates in epochs, each beginning when the uncertainty of the dynamics estimation shrinks by a multiplicative factor, as expressed by the determinant of the covariance matrices \(\Lambda_{h}^{k},h\in[H]\) (see line 13 for the definition of \(\Lambda_{h}^{k}\) and line 4 for the epoch change condition). At the start of each epoch \(e\), we reset the policy to its initial (uniform) state, and define the contracted features \(\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{*}},h\in[H]\) (line 6) by multiplying the original features with coefficients in the range \([0,1]\), and thus shrinking their distance to the origin. Inspired by ideas from Zanette et al. (2020), these coefficients are chosen inversely proportional to the current uncertainty of the least squares estimators in each state-action pair, essentially degenerating the MDP in areas of high uncertainty. Inside an epoch, at episode \(k\), we compute the estimated reward vector \(\bar{\theta}^{k}\) (line 14) and estimated dynamics backup operators \(\widehat{\psi}_{h}^{k}\) (eq. (2)). Then, we use these \(\bar{\theta}^{k}\) and \(\widehat{\psi}_{h}^{k}\) to compute our Q-value estimates with the contracted features (eq. (3)), and run an online mirror descent (OMD) update over them (eq. (5)), i.e., run a policy optimization step with respect to the contracted empirical MDP (more on this in section 5.1).

We note that the computational complexity of algorithm 1 is comparable to other algorithms for regret minimization in linear MDPs, such as LSVI-UCB (Jin et al., 2020). The following is our main result for algorithm 1 (see the full analysis appendix A).

**Theorem 1**.: _Suppose that we run CFPO (algorithm 1) with the parameters defined in theorem 9 (in appendix A). Then, with probability at least \(1-\delta\), we have_

\[\mathrm{Regret}=O\left(\sqrt{H^{4}d^{3}K\log(K)\log(KH/\delta)}+\sqrt{H^{5}dK \log(K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}\right).\]

Discussion.Policy optimization algorithms typically entail running OMD over estimates \(\hat{Q}\) of the state-action value function \(Q\), as in eq. (5). The crux of the algorithm is in obtaining such estimates that satisfy an optimistic condition similar to eq. (1), while also keeping the complexity of the policy class bounded. As discussed in Sherman et al. (2023), the latter depends on \(\sum_{k^{\prime}\in[k]}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k^{\prime}}\) (eq. (3))having a low dimensional representation nearly independent of \(k\). Although standard unclipped estimates admit such a representation, they lack other essential properties (see discussion in section 3). On the other hand, the standard clipping method, which restricts the value to \([0,H]\) between each backup operation (see, e.g., Jin et al. (2020)), does not admit the desired representation.

Sherman et al. (2023) overcame this issue by employing a warm-up phase based on a reward-free pure exploration algorithm by Wagenmaker et al. (2022) to obtain initial backup operators \(\bar{\psi}_{h}^{0},h\in[H]\) and subsets \(\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{h}\subseteq\mathcal{X},h\in[H]\) such that: (i) for every \(x,a\in\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{h}\times\mathcal{A}\) the bonuses (b in section 3), which are proportional to the estimation uncertainty of the value backup estimates, are small (\(\leq 1\)); and (ii) for all policies \(\pi\in\Pi_{M}\), the probability of reaching any \(x,a\notin\cup_{h\in[H]}\bar{\mathcal{X}}_{h}\times\mathcal{A}\) is small (\(\lesssim K^{-1/2}\)). To ensure that the overall value estimates remain bounded, they truncate (zero out) the Q-value estimate of these nearly unreachable state-action pairs, an operation that allows for a low-dimensional representation of the policies. Nonetheless, their warm-up approach has several drawbacks.

* It runs for \(K_{0}=\mathrm{poly}(d,H)\sqrt{K}\) episodes, contributing the leading term in their regret guarantee;
* It relies on a first-order regret algorithm by Wagenmaker et al. (2022) that is not PO-based and uses a computationally hard variance-aware Catoni estimator for robust mean estimation of the value backups, instead of the standard least-squares estimator. To maintain computational efficiency, they use an approximate version of the estimator, losing a factor of \(\sqrt{d}\) in the regret;
* Still, to the best of our knowledge, even the approximate estimator must be computed using binary search methods, making it hard to apply in practical methods that typically rely on gradient-based continuous optimization techniques;* It runs separate algorithms for each horizon \(h\in[H]\), using only \(1\) out of \(H\) samples during the warm-up phase;
* It is not reward-aware, and thus has to explore the space uniformly to ensure that the uncertainty is small for all policies, which could be highly prohibitive in practice.

Our feature contraction approach obtains the desired bounded Q-value estimates and low-complexity policy class without relying on a dedicated warm-up phase. Crucially, it only contributes a lower order term of \(\mathrm{poly}(d,H)\log K\) to the regret guarantee, thus improving the overall dependence on \(d\) and \(H\). Additionally, it uses all samples, is easy to implement, and is reward-aware. To understand the benefit of reward-awareness, consider an MDP where at the initial state the agent has two actions, each leading to a distinct MDP. Now, suppose that both MDPs have only a single state and action for the first \(H/2\) steps with one MDP incurring a loss of \(1\) in these steps while the other incurring \(0\) loss. Notice that regardless of the last \(H/2\) steps, the \(0\) loss MDP will outperform the \(1\) loss MDP. Nonetheless, the reward-free warm-up, which does not observe the losses, will have to fully explore both MDPs. In contrast, our reward-aware approach would quickly stop exploring the inferior MDP, leading to better performance in practice.

## 5 Analysis

In this section, we prove the main claims of our result. For full details see appendix A. We begin by introducing the main technical tool for our contraction mechanism - the contracted MDP.

### Contracted (sub) MDP

For any MDP \(\mathcal{M}=(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},x_{1},\{\ell^{k}\}_{k=1}^{K},P,H)\) and contraction coefficients \(\rho:[H]\times\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow[0,1]\) we define a contracted (sub) MDP \(\bar{\mathcal{M}}(\rho)=(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{A},x_{1},\{\bar{\ell}^{k}\}_{k= 1}^{K},\bar{P},H)\) where as \(\bar{\ell}^{k}_{h}(x,a)=\rho_{h}(x,a)\ell^{k}_{h}(x,a)\in[0,1]\) are the contracted losses and \(\bar{P}_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a)=\rho_{h}(x,a)P_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a)\in[0,1]\) are the contracted (sub) probability transitions. Notice that the transitions being a sub-probability measure implies that \(\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}P_{h}(x^{\prime}\mid x,a)\leq 1\) as compared with a probability measure where this holds with equality. For any Markov policy \(\pi\in\Pi_{M}\), let \(\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h}(\cdot;\rho):\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R},h\in[H]\) be the loss-to-go (or value) functions of the contracted MDP. In particular, these may be defined by the usual backward recursion

\[\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h}(x;\rho)=\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi(\cdot\mid x)}\Bigg{[}\mathbb{ E}[\bar{\ell}^{k}_{h}(x,a)\mid x,a]+\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}\bar{P}_{h}(x^ {\prime}\mid x,a)\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h+1}(x^{\prime};\rho)\Bigg{]},\]

with \(\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{H+1}(x;\rho)=0\) for all \(x\in\mathcal{X}\). The following result shows that the value of any contracted MDP lower bounds its non-contracted variant.

**Lemma 2**.: _For any \(\rho:[H]\times\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow[0,1],\pi\in\Pi_{M},h\in[ H],k\in[K]\), and \(x\in\mathcal{X}\) we have that \(\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h}(x;\rho)\leq V^{k,\pi}_{h}(x)\)._

**Proof.** The proof follows by backward induction on \(h\in[H+1]\). For the base case \(h=H+1\), both values are \(0\) and the claim holds trivially. Now suppose the claim holds for \(h+1\), then we have that for all \(x\in\mathcal{X}\)

\[\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h}(x;\rho) =\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi(\cdot\mid x)}\Bigg{[}\mathbb{E}[\bar{\ell}^ {k}_{h}(x,a)\mid x,a]+\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}\bar{P}_{h}(x^{\prime} \mid x,a)\bar{V}^{k,\pi}_{h+1}(x^{\prime};\rho)\Bigg{]}\] \[\leq\mathbb{E}_{a\sim\pi(\cdot\mid x)}\Bigg{[}\mathbb{E}[\bar{ \ell}^{k}_{h}(x,a)\mid x,a]+\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}P_{h}(x^{\prime} \mid x,a)V^{k,\pi}_{h+1}(x^{\prime})\Bigg{]}=V^{k,\pi}_{h}(x).\qed\]

Next, for any epoch \(e\in[E]\), consider its contracted linear MDP (line 6 in algorithm 1) whose contraction coefficients are \(\rho^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)=\sigma\Big{(}-\beta_{w}\|\phi(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{ h})^{-1}}+\log K\Big{)}\). The following result gives an upper bound on the performance gap between the contracted and non-contracted variants.

**Lemma 3**.: _For any \(e\in[E]\) and \(v\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\) we have that_

\[(\phi(x_{h},a_{h})-\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h}))^{\mathsf{T}}v\leq(4\beta ^{2}_{w}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|^{2}_{(\Lambda^{k}_{h})^{-1}}+2K^{-1})\big{|}\phi( x_{h},a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}v\big{|}.\]

**Proof.** We have that

\[(\phi(x_{h},a_{h})-\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x_{h},a_{h}))^{\sf T}v =\sigma(\beta_{w}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{w}})^{-1}}- \log K)\cdot\phi(x_{h},a_{h})^{\sf T}v\] \[\leq 2(\beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{w}})^{ -1}}+K^{-1})\big{|}\phi(x_{h},a_{h})^{\sf T}v\big{|}\] \[\leq(4\beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}^ {2}+2K^{-1})\big{|}\phi(x_{h},a_{h})^{\sf T}v\big{|},\]

where the first relation is by the property of the sigmoid \(1-\sigma(x)=\sigma(-x)\), the second is by a simple algebric argument that a quadratic function bounds the sigmoid (lemma 19 in appendix B), and the last relation uses \(\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k})\leq 2\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}})\) by line 4 in algorithm 1 (see lemma 16 in appendix B). \(\blacksquare\)

We note that the analogous claim in Sherman et al. (2023) shows that for all \(\pi\in\Pi_{M}\)

\[\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi}\big{[}(\phi(x_{h},a_{h})-\mathds{1}_{\{x_{h}\in\mathcal{Z}_{ h}\}}\phi(x_{h},a_{h}))^{\sf T}v\big{]}\leq\Pr(x_{h}\notin\mathcal{Z}_{h})\max_{x,a} \bigl{|}\phi(x,a)^{\sf T}v\big{|}, \tag{6}\]

where \(\mathcal{Z}_{h}\) is an outcome of the reward-free warmup phase and \(\Pr(x_{h}\notin\mathcal{Z}_{h})\approx K^{-1/2}\). Summing this over \(k\in[K]\) yields a term that scales as \(\sqrt{K}\). In contrast, we use a standard bound on elliptical potentials (lemma 15 in appendix B) to get that

\[\sum_{k\in[K]}(4\beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^ {-1}}^{2}+2K^{-1})\lesssim\log K.\]

This implies that the cost of our contraction is significantly lower than the truncation of Sherman et al. (2023). We achieve this reduced cost by using a quadratic (rather than linear) bound on the logistic function. The challenge in our approach is that the above bound only holds for the observed trajectories rather than for all policies as in Sherman et al. (2023). In what follows, we overcome this challenge using a novel regret decomposition.

### Regret bound

For any epoch \(e\in[E]\), let \(K_{e}\) be the set of episodes that it contains, and let \(\bar{V}_{1}^{k,\pi}(x_{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\) denote the value of its contracted MDP as defined above and in line 6 of algorithm 1. We bound the regret as

\[\mathrm{Regret} =\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-V_{1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x_{1})\] \[\leq\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\bar{ V}_{1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x_{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\] (lemma 2) \[=\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1})+ \sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1})-\bar{V}_{1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x _{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\] \[=\underbrace{\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^ {k}(x_{1})}_{(i)-\text{Bias}/\text{Cost of optimism}}\] \[\quad+\underbrace{\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{h\in[H]}\mathbb{E}_{ \bar{P}^{k_{e}},\pi^{*}}\biggl{[}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\hat{Q }_{h}^{k}(x_{h},a)(\pi_{h}^{k}(a\mid x_{h})-\pi_{h}^{\star}(a\mid x_{h})) \biggr{]}}_{(ii)-\text{OMD regret}}\] \[\quad+\underbrace{\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\sum_{h\in[H]} \mathbb{E}_{\bar{P}^{k_{e}},\pi^{*}}\Bigl{[}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x_{h},a_{h})-\bar {\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x_{h},a_{h})^{\sf T}(\theta_{h}^{k}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{ k})\Bigr{]}}_{(iii)-\text{Optimism}},\]

where the last relation is by the extended value difference lemma (see Shani et al. (2020) and lemma 14 in appendix B). This decomposition is very similar to the standard one for PO algorithms, but with the crucial difference that term \((iii)\) depends on the contracted features \(\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x_{h},a_{h})\) instead of the true features \(\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\). As a by-product, the expectation in terms \((ii)\) and \((iii)\) is taken with respectto the contracted MDP instead of the true one. The purpose of this modification will be made clear in the proof of optimism (see lemma 4).

In what follows, we bound each term deterministically, conditioned on the following "good event":

\[E_{1} =\Big{\{}\forall k\in[K],h\in[H]:\|\theta_{h}^{k}-\widehat{\theta}_ {h}^{k}\|_{\Lambda_{h}^{k}}\leq\beta_{r}\Big{\}}; \tag{7}\] \[E_{2} =\Big{\{}k\in[K],h\in[H]:\|(\psi_{h}-\widehat{\psi}_{h}^{k}) \hat{V}_{h+1}^{k}\|_{\Lambda_{h}^{k}}\leq\beta_{p},\|\hat{Q}_{h+1}^{k}\|_{ \infty}\leq 2H\Big{\}}. \tag{8}\]

\(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are error bounds on the loss and dynamics estimation, respectively. In the full feedback setting, \(E_{1}\) holds trivially with \(\beta_{r}=0\). In the bandit setting, it holds with high probability with \(\beta_{r}=O(\sqrt{d\log(KH/\delta)})\) by well-established bounds for regularized least-squares estimation [1]. Showing that \(E_{2}\) holds with high probability follows similarly to Sherman et al. (2023a), again using least-squares arguments but also using the contraction to ensure that \(\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}\) are bounded (see sketch at the end of this section and lemma 6 in appendix A for full details), specifically \(\beta_{p}=O(Hd\sqrt{\log(KH/\delta)})\). The proof of theorem 1 is concluded by bounding each of the terms in the regret decomposition, summing over \(k\in[K]\) and using a standard bound on elliptical potentials (lemma 15 in appendix B). Term \((ii)\) is bounded using a standard Online Mirror Descent (OMD) argument (lemma 7 in appendix A).

Optimism and its cost.The following lemmas bound terms \((iii)\) and \((i)\), respectively.

**Lemma 4** (Optimism).: _Suppose that eqs. (7) and (8) hold, then_

\[\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)-\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}^{k}+ \psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k})\leq 0\quad,\forall h\in[H],k\in[K],x\in\mathcal{X},a \in\mathcal{A}.\]

Proof.: We have that

\[\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)-\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}( \theta_{h}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k}) =\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\widehat{\theta}_{h}^{ k}-\theta_{h}+(\widehat{\psi}_{h}^{k}-\psi_{h})\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k})\] \[\quad-\beta_{h}\|\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{ e}})^{-1}}\] \[\leq(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)\|_{\Lambda _{h}^{k_{e}-1}}-\beta_{h}\|\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}}) ^{-1}}\] \[\leq(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}-\beta_{b})\|\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x,a)\| _{(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}})^{-1}}=0,\]

where the first relation is by definition of \(\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}\) (eq. (3) in algorithm 1), the second relation is by eqs. (7) and (8) together with Cauchy-Schwarz, the third relation follows since \(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}}\preceq\Lambda_{h}^{k}\) and the last one is by our choice \(\beta_{b}=\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}\) (see theorem 9 in appendix A for hyper-parameter choices). 

Notice that the standard PO decomposition would have required that we bound the non-contracted expression \(\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{*}}[\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)-\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}^ {k}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k})]\). In Sherman et al. (2023a) the gap between this argument and that of lemma 4 can be bounded using eq. (6). However, the equivalent argument for our contraction is lemma 3, which is bounded only for \(\pi^{k}\) and not for any policy \(\pi\in\Pi_{M}\).

**Lemma 5** (Cost of optimism).: _Suppose that eqs. (7) and (8) hold, then for every \(k\in[K]\)_

\[V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1}) \leq 3(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{k}}\left[\sum_{h\in[H] }\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}\right]\] \[\quad+16H\beta_{w}^{2}\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{k}}\left[\sum_{h\in[H]} \|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}^{2}\right]+16H^{2}K^{-1}.\]

Proof.: First, by lemma 14 in appendix B, a value difference lemma by Shani et al. (2020),

\[V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1})=\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{k}}\Bigg{[} \sum_{h\in[H]}\phi(x_{h},a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}\Big{(}\theta_{h}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_ {h+1}^{k}\Big{)}-\hat{Q}_{k}^{k}(x_{h},a_{h})\Bigg{]}.\]

Now, using lemma 3 with \(v=\theta_{h}^{k}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k}\) we have that \(|\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}v|\leq 4H\) (by eq. (8)) and thus

\[[\phi(x_{h},a_{h})-\bar{\phi}_{h}^{k_{e}}(x_{h},a_{h})]^{\mathsf{T}}\Big{(} \theta_{h}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k}\Big{)}\leq 16H\beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{( \Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}^{2}+16H^{2}K^{-1}.\]We can thus conclude the proof using standard arguments to show that

\[\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h}, a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}\Big{(}\theta_{h}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1} \Big{)}-\hat{Q}^{k}_{k}(x_{h},a_{h})\] \[=\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}\Big{(}\theta^{k}_ {h}-\widehat{\theta}^{k}_{h}+(\psi_{h}-\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h})\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1} \Big{)}+\beta_{b}\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h}) ^{-1}}\] (eq. (3)) \[\leq(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{( \Lambda^{k}_{h})^{-1}}+\beta_{b}\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{( \Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\] (Cauchy-Schwarz, eqs. (7) and (8)) \[\leq 3(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})\|_ {(\Lambda^{k}_{h})^{-1}} (\det(\Lambda^{k}_{h})\leq 2\det(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h}),\beta_{b}= \beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\] \[\leq 3(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda^{k}_{h} )^{-1}}, (\sigma(x)\in[0,1],\forall x\in\mathbb{R})\]

as desired. 

Bounding the Q-values (proof sketch).The following are the main ideas in showing that \(E_{2}\) (eq. (8)) holds with high probability. First, we define appropriate value classes \(\widehat{\mathcal{V}}_{h}\) that contain all value functions \(V_{h}\) of the form in eq. (4) whose underlying \(Q_{h}\) function (eq. (3)) satisfies \(\left\|Q_{h}\right\|_{\infty}\leq 2(H+1-h)\). Because both the bonus and contraction operator are kept fixed during each epoch, the log covering number of this class is logarithmic in \(K\) (similarly to Sherman et al. (2023a)). Thus, we can use standard least squares arguments (lemma 22) to show that with high probability \(\left\|(\psi_{h}-\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h})V\right\|_{\Lambda^{k}_{h}}\leq\beta_{p}\) for all \(k\in[K],h\in[H],V\in\widehat{\mathcal{V}}_{h}\). The proof is concluded by showing that \(\|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}\|\leq\beta_{Q,h}=2(H+1-h)\), and thus \(\hat{V}^{k}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{V}}_{h}\), which implies that eq. (8) holds. We prove this by backward induction on \(h\in[H+1]\).

The base case \(h=H+1\) is satisfied because, by definition, \(\hat{Q}^{k}_{H+1}=0\). Now, suppose the claim holds for \(h+1\) and we show it also holds for \(h\). Recalling the definition of \(\hat{Q}\) in eq. (3), we have that

\[|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}(x,a)| =|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\widehat{\theta}^{k}_{ h}+\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1})-\beta_{b}\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a) \|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\] \[\leq|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}+( \widehat{\theta}^{k}_{h}-\theta_{h})+(\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}-\psi_{h})\hat{V}^ {k}_{h+1}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1})|+\beta_{b}\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\| _{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\] \[\leq 1+\|\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1}\|_{\infty}+\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a )\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\Big{[}\|\widehat{\theta}^{k}_{h}-\theta_{h}\|_ {\Lambda^{k}_{h}}+\|(\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}-\psi_{h})\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1}\|_{ \Lambda^{k}_{h}}+\beta_{b}\Big{]},\]

where the last inequality also used the triangle and Cauchy-Schwarz inequalities, and that \(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h}\preceq\Lambda^{k}_{h}\). By the induction hypothesis, \(\|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h+1}\|_{\infty},\|\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1}\|_{\infty}\leq\beta_{Q,h+1}\) and thus \(\hat{V}^{k}_{h+1}\in\widehat{\mathcal{V}}_{h+1}\). Combining with \(E_{1}\) (eq. (7)) and plugging into the above we get that

\[|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}(x,a)|\leq 1+\beta_{Q,h+1}+(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+\beta_{b})\| \bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}.\]

Now, using a technical algebraic argument (lemma 18), we show that

\[\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\leq\max_{y\geq 0}[ y\cdot\sigma(-\beta_{w}y+\log K)]\leq 2\beta_{w}^{-1}\log(eK).\]

Finally, plugging this into the above and choosing \(\beta_{w}\geq 2(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+\beta_{b})\log(eK)\), we get

\[|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}(x,a)|\leq 1+\beta_{Q,h+1}+2\beta_{w}^{-1}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+ \beta_{b})\log(eK)\leq 2+\beta_{Q,h+1}=\beta_{Q,h},\]

concluding the induction.

## 6 Conclusions

In this paper we presented a simple and efficient contraction mechanism for policy optimization in linear MDPs, yielding an overall algorithm with improved regret guarantees under both stochastic (bandit feedback) and adversarial (full feedback) losses. We note that, in the stochastic setting, there are value iteration based methods (He et al. (2023)) that use variance reduction techniques to achieve better regret bounds. We conjecture that such techniques could be applicable to PO, however, this is highly non-trivial and thus left for future research. Finally, regarding practical implementations, we note that our bonuses and contraction technique are computationally feasible, especially compared to the reward-free warmup phase in Sherman et al. (2023a). Nonetheless, it remains open whether our techniques could be applied heuristically to drive exploration in practical deep RL methods. In particular, it would be interesting to examine the necessity of the contraction mechanism. These are challenging questions on exploration in deep RL that we leave for future research.

Analysis

We begin by defining a so-called "good event", followed by optimism, cost of optimism, and Policy Optimization cost. We conclude with the proof of theorem 9.

Good event.We define the following good event \(E_{g}=\bigcap_{i=1}^{3}E_{i}\), over which the regret is deterministically bounded:

\[E_{1} =\Big{\{}\forall k\in[K],h\in[H]:\|\theta_{h}^{k}-\widehat{\theta} _{h}^{k}\|_{\Lambda_{h}^{k}}\leq\beta_{r}\Big{\}};\] (eq. (7)) \[E_{2} =\Big{\{}k\in[K],h\in[H]:\|(\psi_{h}-\widehat{\psi}_{h}^{k}) \hat{V}_{h+1}^{k}\|_{\Lambda_{h}^{k}}\leq\beta_{p},\|\hat{Q}_{h+1}^{k}\|_{ \infty}\leq\beta_{Q}\Big{\}};\] (eq. (8)) \[E_{3} =\left\{\sum_{k\in[K]}\mathbb{E}_{p,\pi^{k}}[Y_{k}]\leq\sum_{k\in [K]}2Y_{k}+4H(3(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})+4\beta_{Q}\beta_{w}^{2})\log\frac{6}{ \delta}\right\}\!. \tag{9}\]

where \(Y_{k}=\sum_{h\in[H]}3(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^ {k})^{-1}}+4\beta_{Q}\beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}} ^{2}\).

**Lemma 6** (Good event).: _Consider the parameter setting of theorem 9. If \(\eta_{o}\leq 1,\beta_{w}^{2}\leq K/(32Hd)\) then \(\Pr[E_{g}]\geq 1-\delta\)._

Proof in appendix A.1.

Policy online mirror descent.We use standard online mirror descent arguments to bound the local regret in each state.

**Lemma 7** (Omd).: _Suppose that the good event \(E_{g}\) holds (eqs. (7), (8) and (9)) and set \(\eta_{o}\leq 1/\beta_{Q}\), then_

\[\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)(\pi_{h}^{*}(a\mid x )-\pi_{h}^{k}(a\mid x))\leq\frac{\log|\mathcal{A}|}{\eta_{o}}+\eta_{o}\sum_{k \in K_{e}}\beta_{Q}^{2}\quad,\forall e\in[E],h\in[H],x\in\mathcal{X}.\]

**Proof.** Notice that the policy \(\pi^{k}\) is reset at the beginning of every epoch. Then, the lemma follows directly by lemma 13 with \(y_{t}(a)=-\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a),x_{t}(a)=\pi_{h}^{k}(a\mid x)\) and noting that \(|\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x,a)|\leq\beta_{Q}\) by eq. (8). 

Epoch schedule.The algorithm operates in epochs. At the beginning of each epoch, the policy is reset to be uniformly random. We denote the total number of epochs by \(E\), the first episode within epoch \(e\) by \(k_{e}\), and the set of episodes within epoch \(e\) by \(K_{e}\). The following lemma bounds the number of epochs.

**Lemma 8**.: _The number of epochs \(E\) is bounded by \((3/2)dH\log(2K)\)._

**Proof.** Let \(\mathcal{T}_{h}=\{e_{h}^{1},e_{h}^{2},\ldots\}\) be the epochs where the condition \(\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k})\geq 2\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}})\) was triggered in line 4 of algorithm 1. Then we have that

\[\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e}})\geq\begin{cases}2\det(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e-1}})&,e\in \mathcal{T}_{h}\\ \det(\Lambda_{h}^{k_{e-1}})&,\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}\]

Unrolling this relation, we get that

\[\det(\Lambda_{h}^{K})\geq 2^{|\mathcal{T}_{h}|-1}\det I=2^{|\mathcal{T}_{h}|-1},\]

and changing sides, and taking the logarithm we get that

\[|\mathcal{T}_{h}| \leq 1+\log_{2}\det(\Lambda_{h}^{K})\] \[\leq 1+d\log_{2}\|\Lambda_{h}^{K}\|\] ( \[\det(A)\leq\|A\|^{d}\] ) \[\leq 1+d\log_{2}\!\left(1+\sum_{k=1}^{K-1}\|\phi_{h}^{k}\|^{2}\right)\] (triangle inequality) \[\leq 1+d\log_{2}K\] ( \[\|\phi_{h}^{k}\|\leq 1\] ) \[\leq(3/2)d\log 2K.\]We conclude that

\[E=|\big{(}\cup_{h\in[H]}\mathcal{T}_{h}\big{)}|\leq\sum_{h\in[H]}|\mathcal{T}_{h}| \leq(3/2)dH\log(2K).\qed\]

**Regret bound.**

**Theorem 9**.: _Suppose that we run algorithm 1 with parameters_

\[\eta_{o}=\sqrt{\frac{3dH\log(2K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}{K\beta_{0}^{2}}},\beta_{b}= \beta_{r}+\beta_{p},\beta_{w}=4(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\log(eK),\]

_where \(\beta_{r}=2\sqrt{2d\log(6KH/\delta)},\beta_{p}=28Hd\sqrt{\log(10K^{5}H/\delta)},\beta_{Q}=2H\). Then with probability at least \(1-\delta\) we incur regret at most_

\[\mathrm{Regret} \leq 264\sqrt{Kd^{3}H^{4}\log(2K)\log(10K^{5}H/\delta)}+8\sqrt{KdH^ {5}\log(2K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}\] \[\qquad\qquad+64H^{2}d\max\{\beta_{w}^{2},\log|\mathcal{A}|\}\log \frac{12K}{\delta}\] \[=O(\sqrt{Kd^{3}H^{4}\log(K)\log(KH/\delta)}+\sqrt{KdH^{5}\log(K) \log|\mathcal{A}|}).\]

**Proof.** First, if \(\beta_{w}^{2}>K/(32Hd)\) or \(\eta\geq 1/\beta_{Q}\) then

\[\mathrm{Regret}\leq KH\leq 32H^{2}d\max\{\beta_{w}^{2},\log|\mathcal{A}|\} \log(2K),\]

and the proof is concluded. Otherwise, if \(\beta_{w}^{2}\leq K/(32Hd)\) then suppose that the good event \(E_{g}\) holds (eqs. (7), (8) and (9)). By lemma 6, this holds with probability at least \(1-\delta\). For any epoch \(e\in[E]\), let \(K_{e}\) be the set of episodes that it contains, and let \(\tilde{V}_{1}^{k,\pi}(x_{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\) denote the value of its contracted MDP as defined in section 5.1 and line 6 of algorithm 1. We bound the regret as

\[\mathrm{Regret} =\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-V_{1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x_{1})\] \[\leq\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})- \tilde{V}_{1}^{k,\pi^{*}}(x_{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\] (lemma 2) \[=\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1})+ \sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\hat{V}_{1}^{k}(x_{1})-\tilde{V}_{1}^{k,\pi^{*} }(x_{1};\rho^{k_{e}})\] \[=\underbrace{\sum_{k\in[K]}V_{1}^{k,\pi^{k}}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}^ {k}(x_{1})}_{(i)-\text{Bias}\,/\text{Cost of optimism}}\] \[\quad+\underbrace{\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{h\in[H]}\mathbb{E}_{P^{k_{ e},\pi^{*}}}\bigg{[}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x_{h},a )(\pi_{h}^{k}(a\mid x_{h})-\pi_{h}^{*}(a\mid x_{h}))\bigg{]}}_{(ii)-\text{OMD regret}}\] \[\quad+\underbrace{\sum_{e\in[E]}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\sum_{h\in[H]} \mathbb{E}_{P^{k_{e},\pi^{*}}}\bigg{[}\hat{Q}_{h}^{k}(x_{h},a_{h})-\bar{\phi}_ {h}^{k_{e}}(x_{h},a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}^{k}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}_{h+1}^{k} )\bigg{]},}_{(iii)-\text{Optimism}}\]

where the last relation is by the extended value difference lemma (see Shani et al. [2020] and lemma 14 in appendix B).

For term \((i)\), we use lemma 5 as follows.

\[(i) \leq\sum_{k\in[K]}\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi^{k}}\!\left[\sum_{h\in[H]}3( \beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}+8\beta_{Q} \beta_{w}^{2}\|\phi(x_{h},a_{h})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}^{2}\right]+8H\beta_ {Q}\] \[\leq\sum_{k\in[K]}\left[\sum_{h\in[H]}6(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\|\phi( x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}+16\beta_{Q}\beta_{w}^{2}\| \phi(x_{h}^{k},a_{h}^{k})\|_{(\Lambda_{h}^{k})^{-1}}^{2}\right]+20H\beta_{Q} \beta_{w}^{2}\log\frac{6}{\delta}\] (eq. ( 9 ), \[\beta_{w}\geq 4(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})\geq 32\] ) \[\leq 6(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})H\sqrt{2Kd\log(2K)}+32\beta_{Q}\beta_ {w}^{2}Hd\log(2K)+20H\beta_{Q}\beta_{w}^{2}\log\frac{6}{\delta}\] (lemma 15 ) \[\leq 6(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})H\sqrt{2Kd\log(2K)}+32Hd\beta_{Q}\beta_ {w}^{2}\log\frac{12K}{\delta}.\]

By lemmas 7 and 8 (with our choice of \(\eta_{o}\)) we have

\[(ii)\leq\sum_{h\in[H]}\sum_{e\in[E]}\mathbb{E}_{\bar{P}^{\mu_{e},\pi^{*}}}\! \left[\frac{\log A}{\eta_{o}}+\eta_{o}\sum_{k\in K_{e}}\beta_{Q}^{2}\right] \leq 4H\beta_{Q}\sqrt{KdH\log(2K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}.\]

By lemma 4\((iii)\leq 0\). Putting all bounds together, we get that

\[\mathrm{Regret} \leq 6(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p})H\sqrt{2Kd\log(2K)}+32Hd\beta_{Q}\beta_ {w}^{2}\log\frac{12K}{\delta}+4H\beta_{Q}\sqrt{KdH\log(2K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}\] \[\leq 264\sqrt{Kd^{3}H^{4}\log(2K)\log(10K^{5}H/\delta)}+8\sqrt{ KdH^{5}\log(2K)\log|\mathcal{A}|}+64H^{2}d\beta_{w}^{2}\log\frac{12K}{\delta}\] \[=O(\sqrt{Kd^{3}H^{4}\log(K)\log(KH/\delta)}+\sqrt{KdH^{5}\log(K) \log|\mathcal{A}|}).\qed\]

### Proofs of good event

We begin by defining function classes and properties necessary for the uniform convergence arguments over the value functions. We then proceed to define a proxy good event, whose high probability occurrence is straightforward to prove. We then show that the proxy event implies the desired good event.

Value and policy classes.We define the following class of restricted Q-functions:

\[\widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(C_{\beta},C_{w},C_{Q})\] \[=\Big{\{}\hat{Q}(\cdot,\cdot;\beta,w,\Lambda,\mathcal{Z})\mid \beta\in[0,C_{\beta}],\|w\|\leq C_{w},(2K)^{-1}I\preceq\Lambda\preceq I,\left\| \hat{Q}(\cdot,\cdot;w,\Lambda,\mathcal{Z})\right\|_{\infty}\leq C_{Q}\Big{\}},\]

where \(\hat{Q}(x,a;\beta,w,\Lambda)=[w^{\mathsf{T}}\phi(x,a)-\beta\|\phi(x,a)\|_{ \Lambda}]\cdot\sigma(-\beta_{w}\|\phi(x,a)\|_{\Lambda}+\log K)\). Next, we define the following class of soft-max policies:

\[\Pi(C_{\beta},C_{w})=\Big{\{}\pi(\cdot\mid\cdot;\hat{Q})\mid\hat{Q}\in \widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(C_{\beta},C_{w},\infty)\Big{\}},\]

where \(\pi(a\mid x;\hat{Q})=\frac{\exp(\hat{Q}(x,a))}{\sum_{a^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}} \exp(\hat{Q}(x,a^{\prime}))}\). Finally, we define the following class of restricted value functions:

\[\widehat{\mathcal{Y}}(C_{\beta},C_{w},C_{Q})=\Big{\{}\hat{V}(\cdot;\pi,\hat{Q} )\mid\pi\in\Pi(C_{\beta}K,C_{w}K,C_{Q}),\hat{Q}\in\widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(C_{ \beta},C_{w},C_{Q})\Big{\}}, \tag{10}\]

where \(\hat{V}(x;\pi,\hat{Q})=\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\pi(a\mid x)\hat{Q}(x,a)\). The following lemma provides the bound on the covering number of the value function class defined above.

**Lemma 10**.: _For any \(\epsilon,C_{w}>0,C_{\beta},C_{Q}\geq 1\), we have_

\[\log\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}\Big{(}\widehat{\mathcal{V}}(C_{\beta},C_{w},C_{Q}) \Big{)}\leq 6d^{2}\log(1+4(\sqrt{192K^{3}}C_{Q}C_{\beta}\beta_{w})(KC_{\beta}+KC _{w}+\sqrt{d})/\epsilon),\]

_where \(\mathcal{N}_{\epsilon}\) is the covering number of a class in supremum distance._

**Proof.** We begin by showing that the class of \(Q\) function is Lipschitz in its parameters. For ease of notation, denote \(y=\phi(x,a)\). Then

\[\|\nabla_{\beta}Q(x,a;\beta,w,\Lambda)\|=\left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda}\cdot\sigma(- \beta_{w}\left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda}+\log K)\leq 1\quad\quad(\sigma(\cdot)\in[0,1], \left\|y\right\|\leq 1,\Lambda\preceq I)\]

\[\|\nabla_{\theta}\hat{Q}(x,a;\beta,w,\Lambda)\|=\left\|y\cdot\sigma(-\beta_{w} \left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda}+\log K)\right\|\leq 1\quad\quad\quad\quad(\sigma(\cdot) \in[0,1],\left\|y\right\|\leq 1)\]

\[|Q(x,a; \beta,w,\Lambda)-Q(x,a;\beta,w,\Lambda^{\prime})|\] \[\leq\beta\|\|y\|_{\Lambda}-\left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda^{\prime}}| \cdot\sigma(-\beta_{w}\left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda}+\log K)\] \[\quad+\beta\|y\|_{\Lambda^{\prime}}|\sigma(-\beta_{w}\left\|y \right\|_{\Lambda}+\log K)-\sigma(-\beta_{w}\left\|y\right\|_{\Lambda^{\prime }}+\log K)|\] \[\leq\beta\|(\Lambda^{1/2}-(\Lambda^{\prime})^{1/2})y\|+\beta \beta_{w}\|y\|_{\Lambda^{\prime}}\|(\Lambda^{1/2}-(\Lambda^{\prime})^{1/2})y\|\] \[\leq 2\beta\beta_{w}\|\Lambda^{1/2}-(\Lambda^{\prime})^{1/2}\| (\|y\|\leq 1,\Lambda\preceq I,\beta_{w}\geq 1)\] \[\leq\sqrt{2K}\beta\beta_{w}\|\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime}\| (\text{lemma \ref{eq:2}, \Lambda,\Lambda^{\prime}\succeq(2K)^{-1}I})\] \[\leq\sqrt{2K}\beta\beta_{w}\|\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime}\|_{F}. (\|\cdot\|\leq\left\|\cdot\right\|_{F})\]

We thus have that for any such \(y\)

\[|Q(x,a;\beta,w, \Lambda)-Q(x,a;\beta^{\prime},w^{\prime},\Lambda^{\prime})|\] \[\leq|Q(x,a;\beta,w,\Lambda)-Q(x,a;\beta^{\prime},w,\Lambda)|+|Q(x, a;\beta^{\prime},w,\Lambda)-

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

**Induction step:** Now, suppose the claim holds for \(h+1\) and we show it also holds for \(h\). We have that

\[|\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}(x,a)| =|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}w^{k}_{h}-\beta_{b}\|\bar{ \phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}|\] \[\leq|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}+(\widehat {\theta}^{k}_{h}-\theta_{h})+(\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}-\psi_{h})\hat{V}^{k,i}_{h +1}+\psi_{h}\hat{V}^{k,i}_{h+1})|+\beta_{b}\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\|_{( \Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\] \[\leq 1+\|\hat{V}^{k,i}_{h+1}\|_{\infty}+\|\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}(x, a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\big{[}\|\widehat{\theta}^{k}_{h}-\theta_{h}\|_ {\Lambda^{k}_{h}}+\|(\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}-\psi_{h})\hat{V}^{k,i}_{h+1}\|_{ \Lambda^{k}_{h}}+\beta_{b}\big{]}\] (triangle inequality, Cauchy-Schwarz, \[\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h}\preceq\Lambda^{k}_{h}\] ) \[\leq 1+\beta_{Q,h+1}+(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+\beta_{b})\|\bar{\phi} ^{k_{e}}_{h}(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}}\] (induction hypothesis, eqs. (7) and (11)) \[\leq 1+\beta_{Q,h+1}+(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+\beta_{b})\max_{y\geq 0 }[y\cdot\sigma(-\beta_{w}y+\log K)] (\bar{\phi}^{k_{e}}_{h}\text{ definition})\] \[\leq 1+\beta_{Q,h+1}+\frac{2\log(eK)}{\beta_{w}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{ p,h}+\beta_{b})\] (lemma 18) \[\leq 2+\beta_{Q,h+1} (\beta_{w}\geq 2(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p,h}+\beta_{b})\log(eK))\] \[=\beta_{Q,h}.\]

Additionally, \(\beta_{b}=\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}\), \((\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}\preceq I\), \(\|\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h}\|\leq 1+\sum_{k\in[K]}\|\phi^{k}_{h}\|\leq 2K\), thus \((\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1}\succeq(2K)^{-1}I\), and

\[\|w^{k}_{h}\|=\|\widehat{\theta}^{k}_{h}+\widehat{\psi}^{k}_{h}\hat{V}^{k,i}_{h +1}\|\leq K+\beta_{Q}K\leq 2\beta_{Q}K=C_{w}.\]

We conclude that \(\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p},2\beta_{Q}K,\beta _{Q,h})\). Since \(\pi^{k}_{h}\in\Pi(K(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}),2\beta_{Q}K^{2})\), we also conclude that \(\hat{V}^{k}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{V}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p},2\beta_{Q}K,\beta _{Q,h})\), proving the induction step and finishing the proof. 

**Lemma (restatement of lemma 6).**_Consider the parameter setting of theorem 9. If \(\eta_{o}\leq 1,\beta^{2}_{w}\leq K/(32Hd)\) then \(\Pr[E_{g}]\geq 1-\delta\)._

**Proof.** Suppose that \(\bar{E}_{g}\) holds. By lemma 11, this occurs with probability at least \(1-\delta\). We show that \(\bar{E}_{g}\) implies \(E_{g}\), thus concluding the proof. Notice that

\[\pi^{k}_{h}(a|x)\propto\exp\!\left(\eta\sum_{k^{\prime}=k_{e}}^{k -1}\hat{Q}^{k^{\prime}}_{h}(x,a)\right)\] \[=\exp\!\left(\sigma(-\beta_{w}\|\phi(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h} )^{-1}}+\log K)\cdot\left[\phi(x,a)^{\mathsf{T}}\sum_{k^{\prime}=k_{e}}^{k-1} \eta w^{k}_{h}-\eta\beta_{b}(k-k_{e})\|\phi(x,a)\|_{(\Lambda^{k_{e}}_{h})^{-1} }\right]\right)\!.\]

We show by induction on \(k\in K_{e}\) that \(\pi^{k}_{h}\in\Pi(K(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}),2\beta_{Q}K^{2})\) for all \(h\in[H]\). For the base case, \(k=k_{e}\), \(\pi^{k}_{h}\) are uniform, corresponding to \(w,\beta=0\in\Pi(K(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}),2\beta_{Q}K^{2})\). Now, suppose the claim holds for all \(k^{\prime}<k\). Then by lemma 12 we have that \(\hat{Q}^{k^{\prime}}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p},2\beta_{Q} K,\beta_{Q,h})\) for all \(k^{\prime}<k\) and \(h\in[H]\). This implies that \(\|\sum_{k^{\prime}=k_{e}}^{k-1}\eta w^{k}_{h}\|\leq 2\beta_{Q}K^{2}\) for all \(h\in[H]\), thus \(\pi^{k}_{h}\in\Pi(K(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}),2\beta_{Q}K^{2})\) for all \(h\in[H]\), concluding the induction step.

Now, since \(\pi^{k}_{h}\in\Pi(K(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p}),2\beta_{Q}K^{2})\) for all \(k\in[K],h\in[H]\), we can apply lemma 12 to get that \(\hat{Q}^{k}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{Q}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p},2\beta_{Q}K,\beta _{Q,h}),\hat{V}^{k}_{h}\in\widehat{\mathcal{V}}(\beta_{r}+\beta_{p},2\beta_{Q} K,\beta_{Q,h})\) for all \(k\in[K],h\in[H]\). Using \(\bar{E}_{2}\) (eq. (11)) we conclude that \(E_{2}\) (eq. (8)) holds, thus concluding the proof.

Technical tools

### Online Mirror Descent

We begin with a standard regret bound for entropy regularized online mirror descent (hedge). See (Sherman et al., 2023a, Lemma 25).

**Lemma 13**.: _Let \(y_{1},\ldots,y_{T}\in\mathbb{R}^{A}\) be any sequence of vectors, and \(\eta>0\) such that \(\eta y_{t}(a)\geq-1\) for all \(t\in[T],a\in[A]\). Then if \(x_{t}\in\Delta_{A}\) is given by \(x_{1}(a)=1/A\)\(\forall a\), and for \(t\geq 1\):_

\[x_{t+1}(a)=\frac{x_{t}(a)e^{-\eta y_{t}(a)}}{\sum_{a^{\prime}\in[A]}x_{t}(a^{ \prime})e^{-\eta y_{t}(a^{\prime})}},\]

_then,_

\[\max_{x\in\Delta_{A}}\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{a\in[A]}y_{t}(a)(x_{t}(a)-x(a))\leq \frac{\log A}{\eta}+\eta\sum_{t=1}^{T}\sum_{a\in[A]}x_{t}(a)y_{t}(a)^{2}.\]

### Value difference lemma

We use the following extended value difference lemma by Shani et al. (2020). We note that the lemma holds unchanged even for MDP-like structures where the transition kernel \(P\) is a sub-stochastic transition kernel, i.e., one with non-negative values that sum to at most one (instead of exactly one).

**Lemma 14** (Extended Value difference Lemma 1 in Shani et al. (2020)).: _Let \(\mathcal{M}\) be a (sub) MDP, \(\pi,\hat{\pi}\in\Pi_{M}\) be two policies, \(\hat{Q}_{h}:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{A}\rightarrow\mathbb{R},h\in[H]\) be arbitrary function, and \(\hat{V}_{h}:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) be defined as \(\hat{V}_{h}(x)=\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\hat{\pi}_{h}(a\mid x)\hat{Q}_{h}(x,a)\). Then_

\[V_{1}^{\pi}(x_{1})-\hat{V}_{1}(x_{1}) =\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi}\Bigg{[}\sum_{h\in[H]}\sum_{a\in\mathcal{A}} \hat{Q}_{h}(x_{h},a)(\pi(a\mid x_{h})-\hat{\pi}(a\mid x_{h}))\Bigg{]}\] \[+\mathbb{E}_{P,\pi}\Bigg{[}\sum_{h\in[H]}\ell_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})+ \sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}P(x^{\prime}\mid x_{h},a_{h})\hat{V}_{h+1}(x^{ \prime})-\hat{Q}_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})\Bigg{]}.\]

_We note that, in the context of linear MDP \(\ell_{h}(x_{h},a_{h})+\sum_{x^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}}P(x^{\prime}\mid x_{h},a _{h})\hat{V}_{h+1}(x^{\prime})=\phi(x_{h},a_{h})^{\mathsf{T}}(\theta_{h}+\psi _{h}\hat{V}_{h+1})\)._

### Algebraic lemmas

Next, is a well-known bound on harmonic sums (see, e.g., Cohen et al., 2019, Lemma 13). This is used to show that the optimistic and true losses are close on the realized predictions.

**Lemma 15**.: _Let \(z_{t}\in\mathbb{R}^{d^{\prime}}\) be a sequence such that \(\left\lVert z_{t}\right\rVert^{2}\leq\lambda\), and define \(V_{t}=\lambda I+\sum_{s=1}^{t-1}z_{s}z_{s}^{\mathsf{T}}\). Then_

\[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\lVert z_{t}\rVert_{V_{t}^{-1}}\leq\sqrt{T\sum_{t=1}^{T}\lVert z _{t}\rVert_{V_{t}^{-1}}^{2}}\leq\sqrt{2Td^{\prime}\log(T+1)}.\]

Next, we need the following well-known matrix inequality.

**Lemma 16** (Cohen et al. (2019), Lemma 27).: _If \(N\succeq M\succ 0\) then for any vector \(v\)_

\[\left\lVert v\right\rVert_{N}^{2}\leq\frac{\det N}{\det M}\lVert v\rVert_{M}^ {2}\]

Next, we need a bound on the Lipschitz constant of the spectral norm of a square-root matrix.

**Lemma 17**.: _For any \(\lambda>0\) and matrices \(\Lambda,\Lambda^{\prime}\in\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}\) satisfying \(\Lambda,\Lambda^{\prime}\succeq\lambda I\) we have that_

\[\lVert\Lambda^{1/2}-\Lambda^{\prime 1/2}\rVert\leq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{ \lambda}}\lVert\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime}\rVert.\]

**Proof.** Let \(\mu\) be an eigenvalue of \(\Lambda^{1/2}-\Lambda^{\prime 1/2}\) with eigenvector \(x\in\mathbb{R}^{d}\). Then we have that

\[|x^{\mathsf{T}}(\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime})x| =|x^{\mathsf{T}}(\Lambda^{1/2}-\Lambda^{\prime 1/2})\Lambda^{1/2}x+x^{ \mathsf{T}}\Lambda^{\prime 1/2}(\Lambda^{1/2}-\Lambda^{\prime 1/2})x|\] \[=|\mu|x^{\mathsf{T}}(\Lambda^{1/2}+\Lambda^{\prime 1/2})x.\]

Next, notice that \(|x^{\mathsf{T}}(\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime})x|\leq\|x\|^{2}\|\Lambda-\Lambda^{ \prime}\|\), and \(x^{\mathsf{T}}(\Lambda^{1/2}+\Lambda^{\prime 1/2})\geq 2\sqrt{\lambda}\|x\|^{2}\). We thus therefore change sides to get that

\[|\mu|\leq\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\lambda}}\|\Lambda-\Lambda^{\prime}\|,\]

and since we can take \(\mu=\pm\|\Lambda^{1/2}-\Lambda^{\prime 1/2}\|\), the proof is concluded. \(\blacksquare\)

Finally, we need the following bounds on the logistic function.

**Lemma 18**.: _For any \(K\geq 1,\beta>0\) we have that_

\[\max_{y\geq 0}[y\cdot\sigma(-\beta y+\log K)]\leq\frac{2\log(eK)}{\beta}\]

**Proof.** First, if \(y^{\prime}\leq(2\log K)/\beta\) then using \(\sigma(y)\in[0,1]\) we have that

\[y^{\prime}\sigma(-\beta y^{\prime}+\log K)\leq y^{\prime}\leq(2\log K)/\beta,\]

as desired. Now, if \(y^{\prime}\geq(2\log K)/\beta\) then

\[y^{\prime}\sigma(-\beta y^{\prime}+\log K)\leq y^{\prime}\sigma(-\beta y^{ \prime}/2)=\frac{y^{\prime}}{1+e^{\beta y^{\prime}/2}}\leq\frac{y^{\prime}}{ \beta y^{\prime}/2}=\frac{2}{\beta},\]

where the first inequality also used that \(\sigma(y)\) is increasing and the last inequality used that \(1+e^{y}\geq y\) for all \(y\geq 0\). \(\blacksquare\)

**Lemma 19**.: _For any \(K\geq 1,z\geq 0\) we have that \(\sigma(z-\log K)\leq 2(z^{2}+K^{-1})\)._

**Proof.** Recall the logistic function \(\sigma(z)=1/(1+e^{-x})\) and define the function \(g(z)=\sigma(z-\log K)-(z+K^{-1/2})^{2}\). We show that \(g(z)\leq 0\) for all \(z\geq 0\). First, notice that

\[g(0)=\sigma(-\log K)-K^{-1}=(K+1)^{-1}-K^{-1}\leq 0.\]

Next, recall that \(\sigma^{\prime}(x)=\sigma(x)\sigma(-x)\) and thus

\[g^{\prime}(z)=\sigma(z-\log K)\sigma(-z+\log K)-2(z+K^{-1/2}).\]

Examining \(z=0\) we further have that

\[g^{\prime}(0) =\sigma(-\log K)\sigma(\log K)-2K^{-1/2}\] \[=(K+1)^{-1}(1+K^{-1})^{-1}-2K^{-1/2}\] \[\leq 2[(K+1)^{-1}-K^{-1/2}]\leq 0,\]

where the last two inequalities used \(K\geq 1\). Now, we have that

\[g^{\prime\prime}(z)=\sigma(z-\log K)\sigma(-z+\log K)^{2}-\sigma(z-\log K)^{2} \sigma(-z+\log K)-2\leq 0,\]

where the inequality is since \(\sigma(z)\in[0,1]\) for all \(z\in\mathbb{R}\). Since \(g(0),g^{\prime}(0)\leq 0\) and \(g^{\prime\prime}(z)\leq 0\) for all \(z\geq 0\), we conclude that \(g(z)\leq 0\) for all \(z\geq 0\). The proof is concluded using the AM-GM inequality. \(\blacksquare\)

### Concentration bounds

We give the following Bernstein type tail bound (see e.g., (Rosenberg et al., 2020, Lemma D.4).

**Lemma 20**.: _Let \(\{X_{t}\}_{t\geq 1}\) be a sequence of random variables with expectation adapted to a filtration \(\mathcal{F}_{t}\). Suppose that \(0\leq\tilde{X}_{t}\leq 1\) almost surely. Then with probability at least \(1-\delta\)_

\[\sum_{t=1}^{T}\mathbb{E}[X_{t}\mid\mathcal{F}_{t-1}]\leq 2\sum_{t=1}^{T}X_{t}+4 \log\frac{2}{\delta}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:23]

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The abstract and introduction clearly state the accurate contribution of this paper: a new algorithm for linear MDPs with new state-of-the-art regret guarantees. They review existing algorithms and accurately describe the differences to our approach. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper clearly states the setting in which the algorithm operates (linear MDPs) and describes the assumptions made in Section 2. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof?Answer: [Yes] Justification: Section 2 clearly describes the setup and assumptions. Our theoretical result in Theorem 1 is fully proved in the appendix (proof sketch is found in the main text). Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results.
* All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced.
* All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems.
* The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition.
* Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material.
* Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments requiring code. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code.
* Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark).
* The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details.
* The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc.
* The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why.
* At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable).
* Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them.
* The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments.
* The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper.
* The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).
* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not include experiments. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: We have reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and verified that our research conforms with it. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [NA] Justification: This is a theoretical paper that advances state-of-the-art theoretical guarantees in general reinforcement learning settings. It is not directly related to any practical application or practical algorithm. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact.

* Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.
* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).

11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper poses no such risks. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks.
* Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.

12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not use existing assets. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.

* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not release new assets. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
