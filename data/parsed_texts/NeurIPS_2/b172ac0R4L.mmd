###### Abstract

Noise in data significantly influences decision-making in the data science process. In fact, it has been shown that noise in data generation processes leads practitioners to find simpler models. However, an open question still remains: what is the degree of model simplification we can expect under different noise levels? In this work, we address this question by investigating the relationship between the amount of noise and model simplicity across various hypothesis spaces, focusing on decision trees and linear models. We formally show that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for several different noise models. Furthermore, we prove that Rashomon sets (sets of near-optimal models) constructed with noisy data tend to contain simpler models than corresponding Rashomon sets with non-noisy data. Additionally, we show that noise expands the set of "good" features and consequently enlarges the set of models that use at least one good feature. Our work offers theoretical guarantees and practical insights for practitioners and policymakers on whether simple-yet-accurate machine learning models are likely to exist, based on knowledge of noise levels in the data generation process.

## 1 Introduction

Machine learning (ML) is being used more and more for high-stakes decisions, and there is a need for clear policy guidance. Simple models have advantages: they are much easier to troubleshoot and use. However, there is a concern that they are not as accurate as more complex black box models, which makes it challenging to provide guidance for policy makers to recommend simple models.

We believe we have barely scratched the surface of understanding simplicity in machine learning. Recent work suggests we consider the _Rashomon Effect_Breiman (2001), which is the phenomenon that datasets often admit many different good models. Semenova et al. (2022) shows that when there are a lot of good models, some of them are probably simple, meaning that there is no accuracy-simplicity trade-off. But we do not know in advance _how_ simple these models can get. For some applications, very sparse additive models or decision trees perform as well as the best black box models; these datasets do not benefit from complex models at all. When does that happen? How extreme on the simplicity scale do we expect these models to go?

A key insight into this question comes from Semenova et al. (2023), who showed that the simplicity we can expect seems to be related to the amount of outcome noise in the data generation process, which we denote informally as "\(\rho\)." When \(\rho\) is larger, we can get simpler models with performance comparable to the best models. However, while Semenova et al. (2023) showed that noise levels are important, they did not provide a quantitative relationship between noise and simplicity.

In this work, we ask a question that allows us to better understand the connections among noise in the data generation processes, model simplicity, and the Rashomon Effect. The question is asfollows: Given the noise level \(\rho\), how much simpler can our ML models get as compared to the non-noisy case while still maintaining similar generalization performance? Semenova et al. (2023) proves only that the hypothesis space could be simplified in the presence of noise, but does not discuss how much.

To answer this question, we formally prove for two common hypothesis spaces that _noise is an implicit regularizer_, thus leading to simpler models. We quantify how much regularization is added to models as a precise function of the amount of noise, \(\rho\), for several types of noise and regularization. Table 1 summarizes the main results of this paper. For various combinations of hypothesis spaces, losses, and types of noise, we show that if we have regularization \(\lambda\) and noise \(\rho\), the optimization problem on noisy data is equivalent to optimizing over the cleaner data with stronger regularization (described in the rightmost column). This means that if we have noisy data, we get a simpler model than if the data were cleaner and we had performed the same optimization.

Since the Rashomon Effect seems to be an important mechanism to understand simplicity, we also study how noise affects it. The _Rashomon set_ is the set of models that have comparable performance to the best models within a class. In this work, we show that, in the presence of noise, the Rashomon set tends to consist of simpler models than in the non-noisy setting. This means that if a user is looking for a model in the Rashomon set that obeys specific constraints (e.g., fairness or monotonicity), these models will be simpler (and this task is likely to be easier) in the presence of noise.

We also study how noise changes the relationship between features and outcomes in an unregularized setting. Specifically, we show that, for decision trees, the number of "good features" (having high AUC relative to other features) increases with noise, and the set of models that use at least one good feature grows larger. Since most models in the Rashomon set use at least one good feature, the Rashomon set of the unregularized hypothesis space might also increase in size with increased noise. This attempts to shed more light on the results that previous work (Semenova et al., 2023) only observed empirically.

We confirm our results empirically and provide practical guidance for the datasets from domains of criminal justice and lending, where we expect outcome noise due to the random nature of the data generation process. We hope that our results are the initial steps that will help machine learning practitioners, and possibly policymakers, to reason about the simplicity of models they can expect to encounter for many high-stakes decision domains.

## 2 Related Work

There are several bodies of related literature.

**Rashomon sets.** The Rashomon set - the set of all near-optimal models - has been studied primarily in the context of its usefulness for solving downstream problems. Examples include developing stable measures of variable importance (Donnelly et al., 2023; Dong and Rudin, 2020; Fisher et al., 2019; Smith et al., 2020), quantifying predictive multiplicity (Marx et al., 2020; Hsu and Calmon, 2022; Watson-Daniels et al., 2023), and understanding fairness (Aivodji et al., 2021; Coston et al., 2021; Shamsabadi et al., 2022). There are also algorithms for computing complete or approximate Rashomon sets for a variety of hypothesis spaces (Mata et al., 2022; Xin et al., 2022; Zhong et al., 2023). The most related prior work to this paper is the work of Semenova et al. (2022) and Semenova et al. (2023), which together demonstrate the existence of large Rashomon sets, and therefore simple models, when there is a significant amount of randomness in the data generation process. In

\end{table}

comparison to prior work, ours is the first to provide a quantitative relationship between noise levels and quantities related to simplicity such as regularization and the contents of the Rashomon set.

**Policy and interpretable ML.** With new regulations including "right to explanation," users can request an explanation if an automated decision has been made about them. However, such explanations are often post-hoc and may be misleading (Rudin et al., 2022; Rudin, 2019; Han et al., 2022; Adebayo et al., 2018), contradictory (Krishna et al., 2022), incomplete (Rudin, 2019), or failing in adversarial contexts (Bordt et al., 2022). Interpretable models do not have these problems, and empirically, interpretable models in high-stakes decision domains tend to be as accurate as black-box models; this has been shown in lending (e.g., Chen et al., 2022), criminal justice (e.g., Angelino et al., 2017), and healthcare (e.g., Zhu et al., 2023). However, policy makers still permit black boxes for high-stakes domains, possibly based on accuracy-simplicity trade-off concerns. Thus, more evidence about when this trade-off does and does not exist will be helpful.

**Noise and regularization.** The influence of noise on regularization has been studied for the hypothesis space of neural networks, though no prior work is directly relevant to our aims. Bishop (1995) showed that injecting a small amount of random attribute noise into the training data for a neural network was equivalent in the infinite data limit to a form of Tikhonov regularization on the magnitude of weights. Dhifallah and Lu (2021) extended these results to arbitrary noise for random feature models, which are a restricted class of neural networks. These papers supplement work designing loss functions robust to noisy data for training neural networks (Wang et al., 2019; Ma et al., 2020; Jin et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2023) and greedily-grown decision trees (Wilton and Ye, 2024). Here, we study the effect of noise on the regularization of sparse models based on 0-1 loss, such as sparse decision trees (Lin et al., 2020), and on linear models trained under exponential loss.

**Noise and SGD.** There has also been recent work focused on analyzing the behavior of the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm in the presence of artificially injected noise during the training process. More specifically, HaoChen et al. (2021) found that applying label noise at each step of SGD allows the ground truth function of a data distribution to be approximated arbitrarily well, while Gaussian parameter noise may instead lead to poor generalization. Blanc et al. (2020) showed that SGD with label noise acts as an implicit regularizer for models with training error. Damian et al. (2021) and Vivien et al. (2022) generalize this result by showing that SGD implicitly optimizes a regularized objective function under various regimes. Our work instead focuses on noisy data generation processes, independent of the algorithm used to optimize the objective.

## 3 Definitions and Notation

Consider a dataset \(S=\{z_{i}=(x_{i},y_{i})\}_{i=1}^{n}\), where each \(z_{i}\in\mathcal{Z}=\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{Y}\) is drawn i.i.d. from an unknown true distribution \(\mathcal{D}\). Here, \(\mathcal{X}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times p}\) is the input space, and \(\mathcal{Y}\in\{-1,1\}^{n}\) is the output space. Let \(\mathcal{F}\) be a hypothesis space, where \(f\in\mathcal{F}\) is a model mapping inputs to outputs, \(f:\mathcal{X}\rightarrow\mathcal{Y}\). Define \(\phi:\mathcal{Y}\times\mathcal{Y}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}\) as a loss function. For the misclassification error or 0-1 loss, we have \(\phi(f(x),y)=\mathbbm{1}_{[f(x)\neq y]}\). The true risk \(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\) is the expected loss over the true distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), given by \(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)=\mathbb{E}_{z\sim\mathcal{D}}[\phi(f(x),y)]\), and the empirical risk \(\hat{L}_{S}(f)\) is the average loss on the dataset \(S\) drawn from \(\mathcal{D}\), calculated as \(\hat{L}_{S}(f)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\phi(f(x_{i}),y_{i})\). We denote by \(R(f)\) an arbitrary regularization term with regularization parameter \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\). Regularization induces simplicity in this work; for example, \(R(\cdot)\) can represent the number of leaves in a decision tree, the length of a rule list, or \(\ell_{0}\), \(\ell_{1}\), or \(\ell_{2}\) norms. We are interested in learning a model \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\) that minimizes the true objective \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\) that combines risk and regularization:

\[Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)=L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)+\lambda R(f), \tag{1}\]

where \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\in\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\). Since this model depends on an unknown distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), we estimate it using the empirical risk minimizer \(\hat{f}_{S}\), defined as: \(\hat{f}_{S}\in\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\widehat{Obj_{S}}(f),\) where \(\widehat{Obj_{S}}(f)=\hat{L}_{S}(f)+\lambda R(f)\).

Following Fisher et al. (2019); Semenova et al. (2022, 2023); Xin et al. (2022), we define the _true Rashomon set_\(R_{\mathit{sat_{\mathcal{D}}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) to be

\[R_{\mathit{sat_{\mathcal{D}}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta):=\{f\in\mathcal{F}:Obj_{ \mathcal{D}}(f)\leq Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta\}, \tag{2}\]

that is, if \(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)+\lambda R(f)\leq L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\lambda R (f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta\), the model \(f\) is included in the Rashomon set. \(\theta\geq 0\) is the additive Rashomon parameter defined by the user. Similarly, the _empirical_Rashomon set \(\hat{R}_{\text{\tiny{set}}_{S}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\)_, contains models within \(\theta\) of the regularized empirical risk minimizer: \(\hat{R}_{\text{\tiny{set}}_{S}}(\mathcal{F},\theta):=\{f\in\mathcal{F}:\widehat {Obj}_{S}(f)\leq\widehat{Obj}_{S}(\hat{f}_{S})+\theta\}\). Past work has shown that the true and empirical Rashomon sets may be similar (Semenova et al., 2022; Donnelly et al., 2023). We will omit "true" or "empirical" and use only "Rashomon set" when it is not significant over which distribution the set is computed.

We will model noise in the labels of data with a uniform label noise model, where each label is flipped independently with the fixed probability \(\rho\in\left(0,\frac{1}{2}\right)\). To sample data with random label noise from the distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), we sample \(z=(x,y)\sim\mathcal{D}\), then with probability \(\rho\) we change the label of \(y\). We denote the noisy version of this data distribution as \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\). By this definition, for \(x,y\sim\mathcal{D}\), with probability of \(y=1|x\) denoted as \(p_{y}\), when sampling from \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\), we have \(p_{y}(1-2\rho)+\rho\)(Semenova et al., 2023). For a finite dataset, we denote \(S_{\rho}\) to be a dataset sampled according to distribution \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\). Let \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}^{n}\) be the distribution of datasets \(S_{\rho}\) under this noise model. As shorthand notation, define \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\) to mean \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}\sim\mathcal{D}_{\rho}^{n}}\). We assume that in practice we receive noisy data \(S_{\rho}\) and not cleaner data \(S\). (Here, \(S\) does not have the uniform random label noise, but it is not necessarily clean in other ways.)

In this work, we measure how noise impacts the simplicity of the best model in the hypothesis space as well as the models in the Rashomon set. First, in Section 4, we consider random label noise and 0-1 loss, and then examine additive attribute noise for the exponential loss in Section 6. For both of these cases, we show that with more noise, we can expect simpler models.

## 4 Random Label Noise and Regularized 0-1 Loss

Noisy labels are common in real-world datasets, especially in high-stakes decision domains. There are many sources of this noise, including subjective judgments, typographical and clerical errors, and systematic biases. Next, we show that when there is noise in the labels, the regularization of the optimal model is implicitly stronger.

### Noise Increases Regularization

We study the effect of random label noise on the optimal models for 0-1 misclassification loss. We first show that optimizing over the noisy data distribution is equivalent to optimizing over the cleaner data distribution with stronger regularization. Formally:

**Theorem 1** (Regularized 0-1 loss under random label noise).: _Consider true data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), and uniform label noise with noise parameter \(\rho\in(0,1/2)\). Let \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\) denote the noisy version of \(\mathcal{D}\). Consider 0-1 loss \(L\) and let \(R:\mathcal{F}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\) be a regularization function with \(\lambda\in\mathbb{R}^{+}\) a regularization parameter. Formally,_

\[\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f)+\lambda R(f)=\arg\min_{f \in\mathcal{F}}L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)+\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}R(f).\]

_Similarly, given a dataset \(S\) sampled according to \(\mathcal{D}\), and \(S_{\rho}\) the noisy version of \(S\), \(\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\,\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)+\lambda R (f)=\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\hat{L}_{S}(f)+\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}R(f)\)._

Theorem 1 applies to any model class and any regularization function over the models in the model class. This includes model classes such as sparse decision trees, which regularize the number of leaves (Lin et al., 2020), rule lists, which regularize the number of rules (Angelino et al., 2017), and scoring systems, which regularize the \(\ell_{0}\)-norm of the parameter vector (Ustun and Rudin, 2016). We prove Theorem 1 in Appendix A. This result proves the first row of Table 1, as each of these hypothesis spaces optimize 0-1 loss with a hypothesis-space-specific regularization function.

A consequence of Theorem 1, intuitively, is that the optimal model with a higher regularization penalty should be simpler and fit the original data less precisely. Formally,

**Theorem 2** (Optimal model simplifies under random label noise).: _Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 1, let \(f_{\mathcal{D}}^{*}\) be the optimal model in \(\mathcal{F}\) over distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) and let \(f_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}^{*}\) be the optimal model in \(\mathcal{F}\) over \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\). Then either \(R(f_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}^{*})=R(f_{\mathcal{D}}^{*})\) and \(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}^{*})=L_{\mathcal{D}}(f_{\mathcal{D}}^{ *})\) (same complexity model) or_

\[R(f_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}^{*})<R(f_{\mathcal{D}}^{*})\text{ and }L_{\mathcal{D}}(f_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}}^{*})>L_{\mathcal{D}}(f_{\mathcal{D}}^{*})\text{ (strictly simpler model)}.\]

_An identical result applies for finite data when \(f_{S_{\rho}}^{*}\) is optimized over the loss function \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\,\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)\)._

A proof of Theorem 2 is in Appendix B. Corollary 10 in Appendix B gives a bound for how much simpler the noisy optimal model will be, based on its performance on the cleaner training data.

### Noise Simplifies the Rashomon Set

In the previous section, we considered optimizing for one model, namely the best-performing model in the class. However, the Rashomon set of models provides a lot of benefits, including deeper insights into the data, flexibility in model selection by choosing a more fair, robust model or model that obeys better domain constraints, and quantification of prediction uncertainty over this set of well-performing models (Rudin et al., 2024). Therefore, we further study how label noise influences the complexity of the models in the true Rashomon set. More specifically, we show that the models in the true Rashomon set arising from a noisy distribution cannot be more complex than those in the Rashomon set for the corresponding cleaner distribution.

Consider two true Rashomon sets \(R_{\mathit{setD}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) and \(R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) over cleaner data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) and noisier data distribution \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\). We may partition these two sets of models into three disjoint sets: \(\mathcal{F}_{both}=\{f\in\mathcal{F}:f\in R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\cap R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\}\) (the set of models in both the cleaner and noisier Rashomon sets), \(\mathcal{F}_{out}=\{f\in\mathcal{F}:f\in R_{\mathit{setD}}(\mathcal{F},\theta )\setminus R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\}\) (the set of models in the Rashomon set over the cleaner data distribution, but not the noisy one), and \(\mathcal{F}_{in}=\{f\in\mathcal{F}:f\in R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F}, \theta)\setminus R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\}\) (the set of models in the Rashomon set over the noisy data distribution, but not the cleaner one).

We are interested in studying the relationship between the complexity of models in Rashomon sets over cleaner and noisy data. In this direction, we show that under mild assumptions, any models that are in the Rashomon set over the noisier data distribution, but not the cleaner one (\(\mathcal{F}_{in}\)), will be simpler than the optimal model over the cleaner data. Since models in \(\mathcal{F}_{both}\) have the same complexity in both Rashomon sets, and models in \(\mathcal{F}_{out}\) tend to be complex (see Theorem 11 in Appendix C), this result shows that the Rashomon set over noisy data will tend to contain lower complexity models than the Rashomon set over cleaner data. Formally,

**Theorem 3** (Models that enter the noisier true Rashomon set are simple).: _Consider true data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), 0-1 loss function, regularization \(R(\cdot)\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). Consider also uniform label noise, where each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho\in(0,\frac{1}{2})\). Let \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\) be the noisier data distribution. If \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})>Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+2\rho\theta\), i.e., the optimal model over the cleaner data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is not in the Rashomon set of the noisy distribution with Rashomon parameter \(2\rho\theta\), then every model from \(\mathcal{F}_{in}\) in the noisier true Rashomon set \(R_{\mathit{setD}_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) is simpler than \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\):_

\[\forall\tilde{f}\in\mathcal{F}_{in}:R(\tilde{f})<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}).\]

_More specifically, \(R(\tilde{f})<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-\frac{1}{\lambda}\left(\frac{\Delta}{2\rho }-\theta\right)\), where \(\Delta=Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}( f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\). Note that \(\frac{\Delta}{2\rho}-\theta>0\). An identical result applies for finite data when models are optimized over \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)\)._

The proof of Theorem 3 is in Appendix C. Note that we showed in the previous section that an optimal model over the noisier data distribution tends to be simpler than an optimal model of the cleaner data distribution, \(R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})\). Therefore, we believe the assumption that \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\) is not in the noisier true Rashomon set with the Rashomon parameter \(2\rho\theta\) is plausible in practical noisy settings. For smaller amounts of noise, the cleaner and noisier Rashomon sets may be similar enough to violate the assumption in Theorem 3; in this case, we expect the two Rashomon sets to overlap a lot, leading to larger \(\mathcal{F}_{both}\) and similar model complexity between the Rashomon sets.

When the data is noisy, practitioners can expect to find simple-and-accurate models within the Rashomon sets for regularized 0-1 loss. We experimentally support our results in Sections 4.1 and 4.2 for empirical datasets and the expected empirical Rashomon set in Section 7 and Appendix I.

## 5 Unregularized Decision Trees and the Set of Grounded Models

The Rashomon ratio measures the size of the Rashomon set relative to the size of the hypothesis space (Semenova et al., 2022, 2023; Rudin et al., 2022). For regularized 0-1 loss, we demonstrated that random label noise is equivalent to an increase in the regularization parameter. A larger regularization parameter penalizes more complicated models and effectively shrinks the hypothesis space, which tends to increase the Rashomon ratio (Semenova et al., 2023). In turn, larger Rashomon ratios correspond to a higher probability of obtaining a desired (e.g., interpretable or simpler) model and correlate with the existence of simpler-yet-accurate models (Semenova et al., 2022).

However, what happens if there is no regularization in the first place and the hypothesis space does not change in size (for example, consider fully-grown decision trees without penalties on the number of leaves)? In this scenario, in the presence of noise, we show that practitioners can still expect to find simple models within the Rashomon set. However, the reason is not due to noise affecting regularization, but rather because noise makes the Rashomon set increase in size. We give theoretical evidence for this claim in Section 5.2, where we show that the _set of grounded models_ (as defined in Section 5.2) grows with noise. This set usually contains the Rashomon set (see Appendix I.3). We begin with an observation about features in our dataset: noise distorts signal in high-quality features faster than in lower-quality features. This leads to an increase in the size of the _set of (relatively) good features_, which we define formally next.

### The Set of Good Features Increases under Noise

For a dataset \(S=X\times Y\), let \(\mathcal{G}=\{g_{j}\}_{j=1}^{p}\) denote the set of features, where each \(g_{j}=\{x_{\cdot,j}\}\) is the \(j^{th}\) column of the feature matrix \(X\). Note that \(X\) can be continuous or binary. For every feature \(g\), we can evaluate its quality based on how close it is to the label vector \(Y\) according to a similarity function \(\mathcal{M}_{S}(g)=\mathcal{M}(g,Y)\). Different metrics can be used as \(\mathcal{M}(\cdot)\), including area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), normalized Hamming similarity (one minus the normalized Hamming distance, which is the normalized count of different element values between two binary vectors) if \(g_{j}\) are binary (\(g_{j}\in\{-1,1\}\)), and correlation if both the labels and the feature are continuous. Given \(\mathcal{M}_{S}(g)\), we define a set of good features as follows:

**Definition 4** (Set of good features).: _Assume we are given a dataset \(S=X\times Y\), set of features \(\mathcal{G}=\{g_{j}\}_{j=1}^{p}=\{x_{\cdot,j}\}_{j=1}^{p}\), a feature quality metric \(\mathcal{M}_{S}(g)\) and a parameter \(\gamma\). Let \(\hat{g}:=\arg\max_{g\in\mathcal{G}}\mathcal{M}_{S}(g)\). Then we define the set of good features \(G_{\mathcal{M}_{S}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)\) to be_

\[G_{\mathcal{M}_{S}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma):=\{g\in\mathcal{G}:\mathcal{M}_{S}(g) \geq\mathcal{M}_{S}(\hat{g})-\gamma\}.\]

We can think of the set of good features similarly to the Rashomon set, where the former contains all relatively good features based on the quality metric, and the Rashomon set contains all relatively good models (combinations of features) with respect to risk.

Intuitively, we expect that datasets originating from less noisy data generation processes will have higher quality features. For example, if there exists a feature with a very high AUC, then the accuracy of learned models utilizing this feature will also be high. In the presence of label noise, we can precisely calculate how the quality of each feature changes for specific cases, including unnormalized AUC (as demonstrated in Theorem 5 below, proven in Appendix D) and normalized Hamming similarity with binary features (direct consequence of proof in Theorem 1). For a balanced dataset \(S\), where the number of positive and negative samples are the same and equal to \(n/2\), we define the unnormalized AUC as \(\overline{AUC}_{S}(g)=\frac{n^{2}}{4}AUC_{S}(g)\) (AUC between \(g\) and the label on \(S\)).

**Theorem 5** (Unnormalized AUC for continuous features increases with label noise).: _Consider a balanced dataset \(S=X\times Y\), i.e. \(\Pr(y=1)=\Pr(y=-1)\). Let \(g=x_{\cdot,j}\) be a continuous feature with distinct values \(g^{1}<\ldots<g^{n}\). Let \(\overline{AUC}_{S}(g)\) denote the unnormalized AUC value of \(g\) on the labels \(Y\). Consider uniform label noise, where each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho<\frac{1}{2}\). Let \(S_{\rho}\) be a noisier dataset. Then for every feature \(g\in\mathcal{G}\):_

\[\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}[\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho}}(g)]=(1-2\rho)\overline{AUC}_{ S}(g)+C(\rho,n),\]

_where \(C(\rho,n)=\rho\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\left(\frac{n}{2}+\rho-1\right)\) is constant for a given \(\rho\) and \(n\)._

An important corollary directly follows from Theorem 5, which states that under noise, good features with higher AUC lose signal faster than features with lower AUC.

**Corollary 6**.: _Under the same amount of uniform random label noise \(\rho\), the expected unnormalized AUC of features with higher initial value decreases faster than the expected unnormalized AUC of features with lower initial value. For two features \(g_{1},g_{2}\), if \(\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{1})<\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{2})\), then_

\[\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{1})-\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho}}(g_{1} )<\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{2})-\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho}}(g_{ 2}).\]

The different rate of change of features with different values of AUC also means that under noise, the set of good features increases. Since the quality metric \(\mathcal{M}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(g)\) decreases with noise for a given feature \(g\), this implies that in the noisier dataset there are more features with equivalently weak signals as compared to a cleaner dataset.

**Corollary 7**.: _Consider a dataset \(S=X\times Y\). Let \(\{\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{j})\}_{j=1}^{p}\) be in decreasing order and spaced by distances at most \(\delta\), meaning that \(0\leq\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{j})-\overline{AUC}_{S}(g_{j+1})\leq\delta\) for each \(j=1,\ldots,p-1\). Assume that we apply uniform label noise with flip probabilities \(\rho_{1}\) and \(\rho_{2}\) to \(S\) to obtain \(S_{\rho_{1}}\) and \(S_{\rho_{2}}\), and that \(|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma )|<p\). If \(\rho_{2}\geq\nu(\rho_{1}):=\frac{1}{2}\left(1-\frac{\gamma(1-2\rho_{1})}{\gamma +\delta(1-2\rho_{1})}\right)\) noting that \(\nu(\rho_{1})>\rho_{1}\), then the size of the set of features which are good in expectation is strictly larger with more noise,_

\[|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma )|<|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}(\mathcal{G}, \gamma)|.\]

The proof of Corollary 7 is in Appendix E and more experimental results are in Appendix I.3. Note that Corollaries 6 and 7 apply as well to the case of normalized Hamming similarity.

Interestingly, Corollary 7 provides one possible explanation for the existence of large Rashomon sets. If there are more features that can explain the labels approximately-equally-well, then multiple good models could be composed of these features, as we will discuss next.

### The Fraction of Grounded Models Increases for Unregularized Decision Trees

Consider a dataset with binary features and a hypothesis space \(\mathcal{F}_{d}\) of fully grown decision trees of depth \(d\). For example, a fully grown tree of depth \(2\) has three (internal) nodes (root and two child nodes) and four leaves (two leaves for each child node). Let the _set of grounded models_ (set of models that use good features), \(\mathcal{H}_{set_{S}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\), consist of models that (1) use at least one feature from the set of good features \(G_{\textit{set}_{S}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)\), (2) use labels determined by a majority vote of data in the leaves. Let \(\mathcal{H}_{ratios}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\) be the fraction of such models in the hypothesis space, meaning that, similar to the Rashomon ratio, \(\mathcal{H}_{ratios}(\mathcal{F}_{d})=\frac{|\mathcal{H}_{\textit{sets}_{S}}( \mathcal{F}_{d})|}{|\mathcal{F}_{d}|}\). Often, the set of grounded models contains most of the Rashomon set, because the trees in the Rashomon set usually rely on at least one feature with a strong relationship with the label (measured by AUC; see Appendix I.3).

Next, we formally show that the fraction of grounded models increases with more random label noise. We again use the set of good features discussed above, with features ordered by AUC values.

**Theorem 8** (Fraction of grounded models increases when the set of good features increases).: _For a dataset \(S=X\times Y\) with binary feature matrix \(X\in\{-1,1\}^{n\times p}\), consider a hypothesis space \(\mathcal{F}_{d}\) of fully grown trees of depth \(d\). Consider uniform random label noise with noise parameter \(\rho\). Let \(\mathcal{H}_{\textit{set}_{S_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\) denote the set of grounded models, based on the set of good features \(G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)\). Under the assumptions of Corollary 7 on the set of good features, the fraction of grounded models increases with uniform random label noise. More formally, for \(\rho_{2}\geq\nu(\rho_{1})\),_

\[\left|\mathcal{H}_{\textit{set}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\right|<\left| \mathcal{H}_{\textit{set}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\right|\text{ and }\mathcal{H}_{\textit{ ratio}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})<\mathcal{H}_{\textit{ratio}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}).\]

The proof of Theorem 8 is in Appendix F. The key observation made in our proof of Theorem 8 is that the set of grounded models increases in size as the set of good features grows. Since the set of grounded models typically contains the Rashomon set, this tends to increase the Rashomon ratio in unregularized hypothesis spaces. As a reminder, larger Rashomon ratios are associated with the existence of simpler-yet-accurate models. We expect the results of this section to hold for other hypothesis spaces as well, e.g., tree ensembles. So far we have considered 0-1 loss with random label noise. Unsurprisingly, we can expect simpler, more regularized, models for other losses and noise models as well. In particular, we next demonstrate that additive attribute noise acts as an implicit regularizer for the hypothesis space of linear models optimized for exponential loss.

## 6 Additive Attribute Noise and the Exponential Loss

It has been known since the 1990s that additive attribute noise to a dataset in the setting of ridge regression acts as an implicit regularizer [1, 2]. More specifically, adding noise \(\epsilon_{i}\sim\mathcal{N}(\bar{0},\sigma^{2}I)\), where \(\bar{0}\) is a zero vector and \(I\) is identity matrix, to every sample \(x_{i}\) (and thus creating a new sample \(x^{\prime}_{i}=x_{i}+\epsilon\)) implicitly increases the \(\ell_{2}\) regularization parameter from \(C\) to \(C+\sigma^{2}\). Semenova et al. [2] have also shown that using additive attribute noise increases the Rashomon ratio for ridge regression. However, this work does not address other continuous losses for classification. In this section, we prove that for exponential loss and binaryclassification, additive attribute noise similarly functions as implicit \(\ell_{2}\) regularization on the logarithm of the loss for an otherwise unregularized setting. We give an explicit characterization of the regularization parameter based on the variance of the noise added.

**Theorem 9** (Exponential loss under additive attribute noise).: _Consider the dataset \(S\) and a hypothesis space \(\mathcal{F}\) of linear models, \(\mathcal{F}=\{f=\omega^{T}x,\omega\in\mathbb{R}^{p}\}\). For a given model \(f\in\mathcal{F}\), consider the exponential loss \(L_{S}(f)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}e^{-y_{i}\omega^{T}x_{i}}\). Let \(\epsilon_{i}\), such that \(\epsilon_{i}\sim\mathcal{N}(\bar{0},\sigma^{2}I)\) (\(\sigma>0\), \(I\) is identity matrix), be i.i.d. noise vectors added to every sample: \(x^{\prime}_{i}=x_{i}+\epsilon_{i}\). If \(\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\,L_{S_{\epsilon(\sigma)}}(f)\) is the expected exponential loss under additive Gaussian noise, then_

\[\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\,L_{S_{\epsilon(\sigma)}}(f)=L_{S}(f)\cdot e^{\frac{ \sigma^{2}}{2}\left\|\omega\right\|_{2}^{2}},\]

_where for simplicity we denote \(\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon_{1},\ldots,\epsilon_{n}\sim\mathcal{N}(\bar{0},\sigma^{2 }I)}\) as \(\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\)._

A proof of Theorem 9 is in Appendix G. Immediately from Theorem 9, we have that

\[\operatorname*{argmin}_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}_{\epsilon}\,L_{S_{\sigma}} (f)=\operatorname*{argmin}_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\left(\log L_{S}(f)+\frac{\sigma^ {2}}{2}\left\|\omega\right\|_{2}^{2}\right).\]

In other words, additive noise introduces \(\ell_{2}\) regularization on the logarithm of the exponential loss. Furthermore, the \(\ell_{2}\) regularization parameter is explicitly given as \(\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\). This shows that additive attribute noise encourages linear models to become simpler when there is more noise present.

## 7 Experimental Results

We now present experimental results supporting the results in Section 4 for uniform label noise and 0-1 loss and Section 6 for additive attribute noise and exponential loss. We give evidence for our finding that noise acts as an implicit regularizer and that the optimal model optimized over data with injected noise is simpler than the optimal model without additional noise. We focus our experiments in this section on criminal recidivism and financial datasets to emphasize the applicability of our work to high-stakes domains with human data. Please see Appendix I for additional experiments.

### Sparse Decision Trees, 0-1 Loss, Random Label Noise.

We used the GOSDT-guesses algorithm by McTavish et al. (2022) to optimize sparse decision trees over varying amounts of label noise (between 0.0 and 0.3). In order to correctly simulate the results in Theorem 1, the experiment estimates the size of a _model_ optimized over the _expectation_ over

Figure 1: (a), (b): For the hypothesis space of sparse decision trees and 0-1 loss, the number of leaves in optimal models for several datasets decreases with increased label noise. The solid lines depict the observed number of leaves in an optimal model over noisy data. The dashed lines depict the number of leaves of the optimal model over the cleaner data with regularization \(\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}\) (see Theorem 1). (c): For the hypothesis space of linear models and exponential loss, the sum of the squares of the weights corresponding to the continuous features decreases as additive noise with standard deviation \(\sigma\) is applied to the dataset.

noise draws of the loss (i.e., \(R(f^{*}_{S_{\rho}})\), where \(f^{*}_{S_{\rho}}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho} }\,\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}+\lambda R(f)\)). This is different from taking the _expectation_ of the _size_ of models optimized over data with only a single noise draw (\(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\,R(f^{*})\), where \(f^{*}\in\operatorname*{arg\,min}_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}(f)+ \lambda R(f)\)). To approximate optimization over expected noise draws, we concatenated \(250\) noise draws into a single dataset upon which to optimize a decision tree. The full experimental design is presented in Appendix I. The results of this experiment are shown in Figure 1(a)-(b). These results demonstrate simplification in accordance with Theorem 2 and the alignment between models trained on cleaner data with varying regularization and models trained on noisy data with consistent regularization (Theorem 1).

An interesting observation from these experiments is that as we increase the label noise parameter, the generalization gap between the accuracy on the cleaner train and test set tends to shrink and the test accuracy remains very stable (see Figures 2, 6, 7). This is what we would expect given Theorems 1 and 2, since optimizing over the expectation of noise increases the effective regularization in the cleaner problem.

### Linear Models, Exponential Loss, Additive Attribute Noise

To show that additive attribute noise has a regularizing effect on linear models under the exponential loss, we computed the optimal models on datasets under different noise levels and compared their complexities, measured by the norm of the weights. For each dataset, we sampled \(100\) independent noise draws for \(10\) different noise levels with \(\sigma\in[0.05,0.5]\). For each noise draw, we computed the optimal linear model on the noisy dataset using gradient descent. In Figure 1(c), we observe that, as the noise level \(\sigma\) increases, the complexity of the optimal model rapidly decreases. This corroborates the regularizing effect of noise demonstrated in Theorem 9.

### Empirical Evidence that Rashomon Sets Over Noisier Data Contain Simpler Models

In Figure 3, we show empirical evidence that the complexity of the Rashomon set of sparse decision trees tends to decrease with the injection of label noise. Moreover, the more noise added to the dataset, the simpler the models in the Rashomon set become. We provide detailed descriptions of the experiments in this section in Appendix I.

## 8 Limitations and Future Work

One limitation of our work is that the theoretical results in Section 4 apply to models optimized over the expected loss over the distribution of possible noise draws with label-flip probability \(\rho\). For larger sample sizes, we expect optimizing over the expectation of noise draws to behave similarly to optimizing over a single noise draw. However, for smaller sample sizes, the optimal model optimized over a single noise draw may deviate from the optimal model over the expectation of noise draws.

Figure 2: Experimental results for Section 4 on recidivism datasets. In accuracy plots (left), blue is accuracy on cleaner test data, orange is accuracy on cleaner train data, and green is accuracy on noisy train data. In complexity plots, blue corresponds to leaves in optimal model over noisy data, orange to optimal model over cleaner data with higher regularization as in Figure 1. Green is the leaf upper bound from Corollary 10. Lambda is regularization parameter optimized via 5-fold CV.

One possible future direction is to bound the expected complexity of a model optimized over a single noise draw in terms of sample size and the probability of flipping labels.

A natural extension of our work is to adapt our results to other losses, like hinge loss and logistic loss. These results are not immediate, because in loss functions more complicated than 0-1 loss, the error considers distances to the decision boundary. Focusing on specific hypothesis spaces rather than on particular choices of loss function (e.g., rule lists optimized on logistic loss, or GAMs optimized on exponential loss) can also help to produce more specific and possibly tighter results similar to those as in Section 6.

We can also try to generalize to other noise models (i.e. random flipping noise in the inputs, or constrained non-uniform noise in the outputs). Dropping the assumption of uniform random label noise needs other techniques as opposed to those that are used in Theorem 1, as the optimization problems are no longer equivalent. If there is non-uniform noise _at least_\(\rho\), it can be decomposed into the non-uniform distribution plus \(\rho\) uniform label noise, and our results in Theorem 1 can be applied. However, such decomposition is not always realistic as, for example, it is very likely that some features are not noisy.

## 9 Practical Guidance for High-Stakes Decision Domains

The fallacy of the premise of the movie Minority Report is that it is possible to predict with perfect accuracy whether someone will commit a crime in the future. In reality, predictions of recidivism are made \(\sim\)2 or 3 years in advance, giving time for a multitude of random interactions in the world to take place. This unpredictability leads, as we showed in this paper, to inherent regularization, and provably simpler models than if noise were not present. Rather than assuming that increased algorithmic sophistication in the future can potentially lead to improved accuracy using the same types of data, it is more realistic to assume that the distributions of data in the future are generally similar to those in the present, and that our best ML methods already reach an approximate performance maximum for these types of data. This latter view clears the way for policy-makers to regulate the use of simpler models. Already the use of black box models has led to individuals being denied freedom based on typographical errors [24, 13, 14] and patients being deceived about the value of expensive medical treatment options [1].

Our findings underscore the critical importance of using simpler models for datasets affected by noise, thereby prioritizing model interpretability and transparency. We believe that this understanding can empower policymakers to advocate for the use of simple, interpretable models, ensuring the trustworthy, accessible, and equitable deployment of AI systems in high-stakes decision domains.

Figure 3: A visual demonstration of the simplifying effect of noise on Rashomon sets. This shows a bar chart of the discrete probability distribution of the number of leaves among models in the Rashomon set. Results are shown aggregated in (a) for 23 real-world and synthetic datasets, and in (b), just real-world data, for 9 recidivism and finance datasets.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:15]

Assume for contradiction that \(R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})>R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})\iff R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-R(f^{ *}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})<0\). Then

\[L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*} _{\mathcal{D}}) \geq\lambda\left(R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho }})\right)\] \[\iff\frac{L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{ \mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})}{R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D }_{\rho}})} \leq\lambda\] \[\text{and}\] \[L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{ *}_{\mathcal{D}}) \leq\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}\left(R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-R(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\right)\] \[\iff\frac{L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{ \mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})}{R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D }_{\rho}})} \geq\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}.\]

Since \(\frac{\lambda}{1-2\rho}>\lambda\) for \(0<\rho<\frac{1}{2}\), this is a contradiction. Thus, \(R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\leq R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})\) which immediately gives \(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\geq L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}})\). The two cases in the lemma follow from (3). An identical argument holds for the finite data case. 

We now highlight an intermediate step in the proof of Theorem 2, which gives us an upper bound on the complexity of an optimal model over a noisy data distribution.

**Corollary 10**.: _Under the same assumptions as in Theorem 2,_

\[R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\leq R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-\frac{1-2\rho}{ \lambda}\left(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{ *}_{\mathcal{D}})\right).\]

_This follows immediately from (3). As we expect, the same result holds for finite sample \(S\) and \(S_{\rho}\) sampled from distributions \(\mathcal{D}\) and \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\)._

Note that, for a fixed amount of label noise, this bound depends only on the complexity of the optimal model over cleaner data, and the difference in loss over the cleaner distribution between optimal models optimized over noisy and cleaner data. The amount of implicit simplification due to noise depends on the degradation of generalization performance caused by noise. We plot this bound in Figures 2, 6, and 7, noting that the bound loosens as \(\rho\) increases and the generalization difference remains constant.

## Appendix C Proof of Theorem 3

**Theorem 3** (Models that enter the noisier true Rashomon set are simple).: _Consider true data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), 0-1 loss function, regularization \(R(\cdot)\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). Consider also uniform label noise, where each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho\in(0,\frac{1}{2})\). Let \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\) be the noisier data distribution. If \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})>Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*} _{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+2\rho\theta\), i.e., the optimal model over the cleaner data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\) is not in the Rashomon set of the noisy distribution with Rashomon parameter \(2\rho\theta\), then every model from \(\mathcal{F}_{in}\) in the noisier true Rashomon set \(R_{\text{set}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) is simpler than \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\):_

\[\forall\tilde{f}\in\mathcal{F}_{in}:R(\tilde{f})<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}).\]

_More specifically, \(R(\tilde{f})<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-\frac{1}{\lambda}\left(\frac{\Delta}{2 \rho}-\theta\right)\), where \(\Delta=Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}} (f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\). Note that \(\frac{\Delta}{2\rho}-\theta>0\). An identical result applies for finite data when models are optimized over \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\)\(\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)\)._

Proof.: Consider \(\tilde{f}\in\mathcal{F}_{in}\). Then we have that \(\tilde{f}\not\in R_{\text{set}_{\mathcal{D}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta),\tilde{f} \in R_{\text{set}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\), and therefore:

\[L_{\mathcal{D}}(\tilde{f})+\lambda R(\tilde{f})>L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}})+\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta, \tag{4}\]

\[L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(\tilde{f})+\lambda R(\tilde{f})\leq L_{\mathcal{D}_{ \rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta. \tag{5}\]

Additionally, from Semenova et al. [2023], we have:

\[L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(\tilde{f})=(1-2\rho)L_{\mathcal{D}}(\tilde{f})+\rho. \tag{6}\]Thus we have:

\[Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta= L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\lambda R(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta\] \[\stackrel{{\eqref{eq:D_rho}}}{{\geq}} L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(\tilde{f})+\lambda R(\tilde{f})\] \[\stackrel{{\eqref{eq:D_rho}}}{{=}} (1-2\rho)L_{\mathcal{D}}(\tilde{f})+\rho+\lambda R(\tilde{f})\] \[\stackrel{{\eqref{eq:D_rho}}}{{>}} (1-2\rho)\left(L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\lambda R(f^{* }_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta-\lambda R(\tilde{f})\right)+\rho+\lambda R(\tilde{f})\] \[= (1-2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+(1-2\rho)\theta+ \rho+2\rho\lambda R(\tilde{f}).\]

Therefore, we get that

\[R(\tilde{f})<\frac{1}{2\rho\lambda}\left(2\rho\theta-\rho+\left( Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-(1-2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_ {\mathcal{D}})\right)\right). \tag{7}\]

Let's focus on the difference between two objectives:

\[Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-(1-2\rho) Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}) =Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-(1-2\rho)L_ {\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-(1-2\rho)\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})\] \[=Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-(1-2\rho)L_{ \mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-\rho-(1-2\rho)\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\rho\] \[\stackrel{{\eqref{eq:D_rho}}}{{=}} Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-L_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_ {\mathcal{D}})-\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+2\rho\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D }})+\rho\] \[=Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{ \rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+2\rho\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\rho\] \[=2\rho\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\rho-\Delta,\]

where \(\Delta=Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}( f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})\). Since by assumption \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}\not\in R_{\text{a}\Gamma_{\rho}}(\mathcal{F},2\rho\theta)\), then \(\Delta>2\rho\theta\) and \(\frac{\Delta}{2\rho}-\theta>0\). Therefore in (7) we have:

\[R(\tilde{f}) <\frac{1}{2\rho\lambda}\left(2\rho\theta-\rho+\left(Obj_{\mathcal{ D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-(1-2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}})\right)\right)\] \[=\frac{1}{2\rho\lambda}\left(2\rho\theta-\rho+2\rho\lambda R(f^{ *}_{\mathcal{D}})+\rho-\Delta\right)\] \[=R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})-\frac{1}{\lambda}\left(\frac{\Delta}{2 \rho}-\theta\right)\] \[<R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}}).\]

An identical proof applies to the finite dataset \(S\), where the model \(f\) is in the noisier expected Rashomon set if \(\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\,\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)+R(f)\leq\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}\, \hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}})+R(f^{*}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho }}})\), where \(f^{*}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}\in\arg\min_{f\in\mathcal{F}}\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}} \,\hat{L}_{S_{\rho}}(f)+R(f)\). 

Models in \(F_{out}\) are complex.As the theorem above states, models in \(F_{in}\) in the noisy Rashomon set tend to be simpler. Now, we will show that the models in \(F_{out}\) in the cleaner Rashomon set are complex models that potentially will overfit the noisier data. We illustrated this empirically in Section 7.3 and now prove it more formally in the next theorem.

**Theorem 11** (Models that exit the cleaner true Rashomon set are complex).: _Consider true data distribution \(\mathcal{D}\), 0-1 loss function, regularization \(R(\cdot)\) and regularization parameter \(\lambda\). Consider also uniform label noise, where each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho<\frac{1}{2}\). Let \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\) be the noisier data distribution. If \(Obj_{D}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})>Obj_{D}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+2\rho\theta\), i.e., the optimal model over noisy data distribution \(\mathcal{D}_{\rho}\) is not in the cleaner true Rashomon set with Rashomon parameter \(2\rho\theta\) (note that this is a symmetric assumption to the assumption in Theorem 3), then every model from \(\mathcal{F}_{out}\) in the cleaner true Rashomon set \(R_{set_{\mathcal{D}}}(\mathcal{F},\theta)\) is more complex than \(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}\):_

\[\forall f\in\mathcal{F}_{out}:R(f)>R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+2(1-\rho) \frac{\theta}{\lambda}.\]

Proof.: Let \(f\in F_{out}\). By the definition of \(F_{out}\), we have

\[Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f)>Obj_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{ \rho}})+\theta, \tag{8}\]\[Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\leq Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta. \tag{9}\]

From (8), (6) and by the definition of the objective, we have that,

\[(1-2\rho)L_{\mathcal{D}}(f)+\lambda R(f)>(1-2\rho)L_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta,\]

and

\[(1-2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)+2\rho\lambda R(f)>(1-2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{ *}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+2\rho\lambda R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta.\]

We use Equation (9) to substitute in \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta\) for \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f)\) and obtain

\[(1-2\rho)(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})+\theta)+2\rho\lambda R(f)>(1- 2\rho)Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+2\rho\lambda R(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\theta.\]

We can rearrange this inequality to solve for the regularization \(R(f)\) of the models that exit the cleaner true Rashomon set:

\[R(f)>R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\frac{\theta}{\lambda}+\frac{1-2\rho}{2 \rho\lambda}(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})-Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f ^{*}_{\mathcal{D}})).\]

By assumption, \(Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})>Obj_{\mathcal{D}}(f^{*}_{ \mathcal{D}})+2\rho\theta\) and, therefore we get that

\[R(f)>R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\frac{\theta}{\lambda}+\frac{1-2\rho}{2\rho \lambda}2\rho\theta=R(f^{*}_{\mathcal{D}_{\rho}})+\frac{2(1-\rho)\theta}{ \lambda}.\]

## Appendix D Proof of Theorem 5

For a given continuous feature \(g\) with values \(g^{1}\leq\ldots\leq g^{T}\) and a set of binary labels \(Y\) for each sample, the AUC of \(g\) is defined as the area under the ROC curve of \(g\), where the ROC curve is plotted against the false positive rate (FPR) and true positive rate (TPR) of a decision stump on \(g\). We can choose instead to plot the absolute number of negatively and positively classified samples, forming the _unnormalized ROC curve_ of \(g\). The resulting _unnormalized AUC_ of \(g\) is defined as the area under the unnormalized ROC curve of \(g\), which can be written as

\[\overline{AUC}_{S}(g)=n^{+}n^{-}AUC_{S}(g),\]

where \(n^{+}\) and \(n^{-}\) are the number of positively and negatively labelled samples respectively. For more explicit notation in this section, we will use \(\overline{AUC}(g,Y)\) to denote unnormalized AUC, where \(\overline{AUC}(g,Y)=\overline{AUC}_{S}(g)\). If \(g\) has \(T\) distinct values, then the unnormalized AUC has a closed-form:

\[\overline{AUC}(g,Y)=\sum_{i=1}^{T}\sum_{j=i+1}^{T}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1\wedge y _{j}=-1}. \tag{10}\]

Intuitively, equation 10 counts the number of unit squares below the unnormalized ROC curve. We now recall and prove Theorem 5.

**Theorem 5**.: _Consider a balanced dataset \(S=X\times Y\), i.e. \(\Pr(y=1)=\Pr(y=-1)\). Let \(g=x_{\cdot,j}\) be a continuous feature with distinct values \(g^{1}<\ldots<g^{n}\). Let \(\overline{AUC}_{S}(g)\) denote the unnormalized AUC value of \(g\) on the labels \(Y\). Consider uniform label noise, where each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho<\frac{1}{2}\). Let \(S_{\rho}\) be a noisier dataset. Then for every feature \(g\in\mathcal{G}\):_

\[\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}[\overline{AUC}_{S_{\rho}}(g)]=(1-2\rho)\overline{AUC}_{ S}(g)+C(\rho,n),\]

_where \(C(\rho,n)=\rho\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\left(\frac{n}{2}+\rho-1\right)\) is constant for a given \(\rho\) and \(n\)._Proof.: Under the noise model, each label is flipped independently with probability \(\rho\), where \(1-\rho\) is then the probability that the label was not flipped. Using equation 10, we can write

\[\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Y}}[\overline{AUC}(g,\tilde{Y})] =\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Y}}\left[\sum_{i<j}\mathbbm{1}_{\tilde{y}_{i} =1\wedge\tilde{y}_{j}=-1}\right]\] \[=\sum_{i<j}\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Y}}\left[\mathbbm{1}_{\tilde{y}_{i} =1\wedge\tilde{y}_{j}=-1}\right]\] \[=\sum_{i<j}\Pr(\tilde{y}_{i}=1,\tilde{y}_{j}=-1)\] \[=\sum_{i<j}[\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=-1}\Pr(y_{i}\neq\tilde{y} _{i},y_{j}=\tilde{y}_{j})\] \[+\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1,y_{j}=-1}\Pr(y_{i}=\tilde{y}_{i},y_{j}= \tilde{y}_{j})\] \[+\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=1}\Pr(y_{i}\neq\tilde{y}_{i},y_{j} \neq\tilde{y}_{j})\] \[+\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1,y_{j}=1}\Pr(y_{i}=\tilde{y}_{i},y_{j}\neq \tilde{y}_{j})]\] \[=\sum_{i<j}[\rho(1-\rho)\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=-1}+(1-\rho)^ {2}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1,y_{j}=-1}\] \[+\rho^{2}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=1}+\rho(1-\rho)\mathbbm{1}_{ y_{i}=1,y_{j}=1}].\]

Consider each of the terms separately. We have that

\[\sum_{i<j}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=-1}=\sum_{i<j}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1,y_{j} =1}=\binom{n/2}{2},\]

since there are \(\frac{n}{2}\) positive and negative samples, so there are \(\binom{n/2}{2}\) unordered pairs of each. We also have by definition that

\[\sum_{i<j}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=1,y_{j}=-1}=\overline{AUC}(g,Y),\]

and since there are \((\frac{n}{2})^{2}\) unordered pairs of exactly one positive and one negative value, we lastly have that

\[\sum_{i<j}\mathbbm{1}_{y_{i}=-1,y_{j}=1}=\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{2}- \overline{AUC}(g,Y).\]

Thus, putting it all together, we obtain the following for the unnormalized AUC:

\[\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Y}}[\overline{AUC}(g,\tilde{Y})] =(1-\rho)^{2}\overline{AUC}(g,Y)+\rho^{2}\left(\left(\frac{n}{2} \right)^{2}-\overline{AUC}(g,Y)\right)+2\rho(1-\rho)\binom{\frac{n}{2}}{2}\] \[=(1-2\rho)\overline{AUC}(g,Y)+\rho^{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)^{ 2}+\rho(1-\rho)\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\left(\frac{n}{2}-1\right)\] \[=(1-2\rho)\overline{AUC}(g,Y)+\rho\left(\frac{n}{2}\right)\left( \frac{n}{2}+\rho-1\right).\]

If the dataset is not balanced, then we can use an identical proof to show that

\[\mathbb{E}_{\tilde{Y}}\overline{AUC}(g,\tilde{Y})=(1-2\rho)\overline{AUC}(g,Y) +C(\rho,n^{+},n^{-}),\]

where \(C(\rho,n^{+},n^{-})=-\rho(1-2\rho)n^{+}n^{-}+\rho(1-\rho)\binom{n^{+}+n^{-}}{ 2}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:20]

Therefore, we proved that \((1-2\rho_{2})a_{k+1}\leq\gamma\), which means that \(|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}(\mathcal{G}, \gamma)|\geq k+1\) and consequently \(|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)|<|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}( \mathcal{G},\gamma)|\) as claimed. 

## Appendix F Proof of Theorem 8

**Theorem 8** (Empirical Rashomon ratio increases when the set of good features increases).: _For a dataset \(S=X\times Y\) with binary feature matrix \(X\in\{-1,1\}^{n\times p}\), consider a hypothesis space \(\mathcal{F}_{d}\) of fully grown trees of depth \(d\). Consider uniform random label noise with noise parameter \(\rho\). Let \(\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{S_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\) denote the set of grounded models, based on the set of good features \(G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)\). Under the assumptions of Corollary 7 on the set of good features, the fraction of grounded models increases with uniform random label noise. More formally, for \(\rho_{2}\geq\nu(\rho_{1})\),_

\[\left|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}) \right|<\left|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})\right|\text{ and }\mathcal{H}_{\text{ratior}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d})<\mathcal{H}_{\text{ratior}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}).\]

Proof.: As in Proposition 6 of Semenova et al. (2023), the hypothesis space of fully-grown trees of depth \(d\) contains

\[|\,\mathcal{F}_{d}\,|=2^{2^{d}}\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}\]

trees, where symmetric trees are not included, meaning that split \(=0\) is on the left and \(1\) is on the right.

The trees in the set of grounded models must have at least one good feature. Moreover, the labels in the set of grounded models are assigned to the trees based on the data, meaning that it contains

\[|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}}|=\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^ {k-1}}-\prod_{k=1}^{d}(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}^{bad}|-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}\]

trees, where \(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}^{bad}|=p-|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}\overline{ \lambda UC}_{S_{\rho}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)|\). Therefore the fraction of grounded models is:

\[H_{\text{ratior}_{S_{\rho}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}^{p}) =\frac{|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}}( \mathcal{F}_{d}^{p})|}{|\,\mathcal{F}_{d}^{p}|}=\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^ {2^{k-1}}-\prod_{k=1}^{d}(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}^{bad}|-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}}{2^ {2^{d}}\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}}\] \[=\frac{1}{2^{2^{d}}}\left(1-\frac{\prod_{k=1}^{d}(|p_{\mathbb{E} _{S_{\rho}}}^{bad}|-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}}{\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}}\right)\] \[=\frac{1}{2^{2^{d}}}\left(1-\prod_{k=1}^{d}\left(\frac{|p_{ \mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho}}}^{bad}|-k+1}{p-k+1}\right)^{2^{k-1}}\right).\]

For noise levels \(\rho_{1},\rho_{2}\) from Corollary 7 if \(\rho_{2}\geq\nu(\rho_{1})\), then \(|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}(\mathcal{G},\gamma)|<|G_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}\overline{\lambda UC}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}( \mathcal{G},\gamma)|\), and \(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}^{bad}|>|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{2}}}}^{bad}|\). Therefore,

\[|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}^{p})| =\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}-\prod_{k=1}^{d}(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{ S_{\rho_{1}}}}^{bad}|-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}\] \[<\prod_{k=1}^{d}(p-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}-\prod_{k=1}^{d}(|p_{\mathbb{E}_{ S_{\rho_{2}}}}^{bad}|-k+1)^{2^{k-1}}=|\mathcal{H}_{\text{sert}_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{ \rho_{2}}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}^{p})|,\]

and

\[H_{\text{ratior}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}(\mathcal{F}_{d}^{p})=\frac{1}{2^{2^{d}}} \left(1-\prod_{k=1}^{d}\left(\frac{|p_{\mathbb{E}_{S_{\rho_{1}}}}^{bad}|-k+1}{p- k+1}\right)^{2^{k-1}}\right)\]

## Appendix H Datasets

In Table 2, we provide the description of the datasets used in this paper and pre-processing steps. All categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and all continuous data was binned into a one-hot binary encoding using thresholds determined by the GOSDT-guesses algorithm [14]. All rows with missing values were removed from the datasets unless otherwise indicated in the processing notes. The GOSDT-guesses algorithm was also used to perform feature selection. The dataset statistics presented in Table 2 reflect the data used in the experiments after all pre-processing, including feature selection. When necessary, we downsampled to balance classes to avoid trivial optimal sparse decision trees.

## Appendix I Additional Experiments

### The Complexity of Models in the Expected Empirical Rashomon Set

We now present an experiment demonstrating the results of Section 4.2, where we showed that the complexity of models in the true Rashomon set tends to decrease with the injection of label noise. In the experimental setting, we may only observe samples from the true data distribution, and thus we only have access to empirical Rashomon sets. To simulate the Rashomon set of models trained on the expected distribution of datasets under label noise, 150 noise draws were independently sampled then concatenated for every dataset to create a training set for sparse decision trees. We used a multiplicative Rashomon parameter of \(0.05\) and a regularization parameter of \(0.02\) throughout these experiments. Figure 3 shows how the discrete probability distribution of the number of leaves of models in the expected empirical Rashomon set skews simpler as noise is injected into the data. This result holds both for the aggregated number of leaves in all of our datasets (a), in recidivism and credit default datasets (b), and in individual datasets, some of which are displayed in Figure 5

### Model Simplification Under Expected Label Noise

0-1 Loss and Sparse Decision TreesWe now discuss the set-up of the experiment conducted to review Theorems 1 and 2. This experiment was conducted with sparse optimal decision trees trained on a subset of the complete feature set, with continuous features binarized via the binning procedure of the GOSDT-guesses algorithm [14]. Throughout the experiment, we allowed a maximum depth of 5, which we did not find to be a limiting factor. Each dataset is split into a training set and a test set, where the training set consists of roughly 80% of the data. Before injecting

Table 2: Summary count statistics of all datasets after preprocessingany noise, the optimal value \(\lambda\) of the regularization parameter for the GOSDT algorithm was chosen using 5-fold cross validation on the training set. Then, for 51 parameters \(\rho\) for label noise linearly spaced between \(0\) and \(0.3\), inclusive, we run the following procedure:

1. Sample 250 i.i.d. draws of random label noise with parameter \(\rho\).
2. Stack all of these draws of random label noise into a single dataset.
3. Find the optimal sparse decision tree on this new, concatenated dataset.
4. Report the accuracy of the tree on its noisy training set (green), on the original (cleaner) training set (orange), and on the held out test set (blue).
5. Report the number of leaves (blue) of the optimal model trained on the noisy concatenated dataset.
6. Separately find the optimal sparse decision tree over the original training set with regularization parameter \(\lambda/(1-2\rho)\), and report the number of leaves in this model (orange).
7. Compute the upper bound from Corollary 10 (green) based on the loss difference between the noisy optimal model and the baseline optimal model on the original data (difference in orange accuracy line from its initial value).

Complete results of these experiments for all datasets are shown in Figure 2, 6, and 7.

Exponential Loss and Linear ModelsFor the experiment corresponding to Theorem 9, we use a simpler setup to demonstrate that additive noise has a regularizing effect. We seek to optimize the exponential loss of a given binary classification dataset over the set of linear models. To do this, we directly use gradient descent with the exponential loss. We optimize for \(1000\) epochs with an initial learning rate of \(0.1\) with the ADAM optimizer [14]. We furthermore decrease the learning rate by a factor of \(0.3\) if the exponential loss plateaus for over \(50\) epochs. Using this optimization procedure, our experiment is as follows:

1. Sample \(100\) i.i.d. draws of additive Gaussian noise with standard deviation \(\sigma\) on all continuous features.
2. For each noisy draw, find the optimal linear model using the gradient descent procedure described above.

### Empirical Evidence that the Set of Grounded Models Tend to Contain the Rashomon Set

Trees in the Rashomon set tend to rely on features with good signals; therefore, the set of grounded models tends to overlap significantly with the Rashomon set. We demonstrate this empirically based on 19 classification datasets in Table 4. To compute the set of good features, we used the AUC as a feature quality metric and set \(\gamma\) to \(0.05\). To compute the Rashomon set, we considered the hypothesis space of sparse decision trees of depth 4 with a regularization parameter of 0.01. We used TreeFARMS and set the Rashomon parameter to 5%. For every tree in the Rashomon set, we verified whether it relies on at least one feature from the set of good features. The results are reported in the fourth column of Table 4. At least 95% of trees in every Rashomon set contains at least one feature from the set of good features.

### Noise Distorts the Signal in Features and Increases the Size of the Set of Good Features

We now present an empirical demonstration of the effect of label noise on relative feature quality, which we measure as a feature's AUC with the labels (see Section 5.1). The uniformity assumption in our results in that section was designed to avoid situations where one feature is clearly more predictive than all of the others, which negates the effect of small amounts of label noise on the set of good features. Therefore, we designed our experiments to align with the assumptions in our theoretical results by intentionally removing features that were clear outliers in predictive quality. We are left with a somewhat uniform distribution of cleaner-data AUC values in Figure 4. With label noise, the distribution skews left as predicted - this indicates that the high-quality features degrade towards 0.5 AUC faster than low-quality features, as predicted in Theorem 5.

### Computation Resources

We performed experiments on Duke University's Computer Science Department cluster. We requested 200GB of shared total memory, and one compute core per dataset (23 datasets) so that we could run the experiments for each dataset in parallel. It took up to 10 hours to compute the optimal models for all different noise levels and draws (Figures 0(a)-0(e), 0(f), 0(f)), and 0(f) hours to compute the simplicity of models in the Rashomon set (Figures 3, 5). For the experiments corresponding to Figure 0(c), it took up to \(3\) hours per dataset to compute the optimal models for all different noise levels and draws.

Table 4: The set of grounded models is likely to contain the Rashomon set for various datasets.

Figure 4: Feature AUC distribution before (left; blue) and after (right; orange) injecting 15% label noise, aggregated across 9 criminal recidivism and financial datasets with feature quality parameter \(\gamma=0.05\) (total of 109 features). All features degrade towards 0.5 AUC when label noise is introduced, and better features tend to degrade faster. This increases the size of the set of features within \(\gamma\) AUC of the best feature (green shaded regions) from 15 features with original (cleaner) labels to 27 features with noisy labels, which aligns with our prediction in Corollary 7.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Limitations are discussed throughout the work, and we provide limitation paragraph in Section 9. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.

3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Appendices A-G give proofs for all theorems, with detailed assumptions in the statements of theorems. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Experimental designs are detailed in Appendix I. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. *3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Code and data may be found in the supplemental materials. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines ([https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy](https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy)) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: For experiments performed over multiple trials, error bars are described in the experimental design. Many of the experiments in this paper are performed by fitting a model on the concatenated version of many independent noise draws - performing this operation many times to measure the error is prohibitively expensive. The error is sufficiently mitigated by sampling a very large number of noise draws. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discuss our compute time and resources in a separate subsection in Appendix I. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics**Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Section 9 details the practical implications of our work for policy decisions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. ** Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters.
* Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images.
* We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We use open access datasets and cite the sources of all the datasets we used in the paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided. * If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file. *14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
