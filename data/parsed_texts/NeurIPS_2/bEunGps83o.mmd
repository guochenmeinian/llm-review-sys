###### Abstract

We consider a dynamic mechanism design problem where an auctioneer sells an indivisible good to two groups of buyers in every round, for a total of \(T\) rounds. The auctioneer aims to maximize their discounted overall revenue while adhering to a fairness constraint that guarantees a minimum average allocation for each group. We begin by studying the static case (\(T=1\)) and establish that the optimal mechanism involves two types of subsidization: one that increases the overall probability of allocation to all buyers, and another that favors the group which otherwise has a lower probability of winning the item. We then extend our results to the dynamic case by characterizing a set of recursive functions that determine the optimal allocation and payments in each round. Notably, our results establish that in the dynamic case, the seller, on the one hand, commits to a participation reward to incentivize truth-telling, and, on the other hand, charges an entry fee for every round. Moreover, the optimal allocation once more involves subsidization in favor of one group, where the extent of subsidization depends on the difference in future utilities for both the seller and buyers when allocating the item to one group versus the other. Finally, we present an approximation scheme to solve the recursive equations and determine an approximately optimal and fair allocation efficiently.

## 1 Introduction

Auctions play a pivotal role in allocation decisions across various domains, serving as a structured methodology for determining the distribution of resources based on bids. Housing, government contracts, electromagnetic spectrum rights, and advertising slots are a few of the many domains where allocations are determined by auctions. In many of the real-world applications of auction-based allocations, the resource in question is both valuable and limited, which raises concerns about fairness.

For instance, housing auctions are often governed by policies addressing the needs of low- and moderate-income households, such as Affordable Housing Quotas in the United Kingdom to tax credits and vouchers in the United States [20, 22]. Government procurement contracts for goods and services in the United States are subject to the United States Small Business Act which outlines target contracting rates across categories (e.g., woman-owned businesses, veteran-owned businesses, historically underutilized zones) [17]. The United States Federal Communications Commission drives initiatives ensuring, for instance, that small and regional companies maintain reasonable access to connectivity [35].

The importance of incorporating a consideration of fairness in important real-world use cases motivates recent work that extends classical work on auction design emphasizing economic efficiency to ensure outcomes do not disproportionately favor some bidders over others. Integrating fairnessinto auction designs is, however, a source of significant complexity, given that buyers often have different valuations, which can lead to strategic bidding behavior that may skew fairness.

In this paper, we focus on studying the question of fairness in a dynamic mechanism design setting, where a seller allocates an indivisible item through an auction at every round and for \(T\) rounds to two groups of buyers, each group including \(n\) buyers. At each round, the buyers' values are realized independently from an underlying distribution (which may differ between the two groups), and the buyers then submit their bids. The seller's goal is to decide on an allocation rule as a function of the submitted bids that maximizes their total discounted revenue with a discount factor \(\delta\), while ensuring that each group receives a minimum allocation, or more specifically, that group \(i\)'s average discounted allocation is greater than or equal to some \(\alpha_{i}\).

This fairness constraint enforces a proportional notion of fairness regarding the number of items each group wins. There are several advantages to adopting such a fairness notion. First, it is typically more straightforward from a policy perspective compared to, for instance, focusing on the total value won by each group. For example, most regulations concerning fair housing allocation emphasize the percentage of housing allocated to low-income groups as a measure of success [27]. Moreover, a buyer's value in private-value auctions is not solely determined by the intrinsic value of the item but also depends on the financial constraints of the buyers or asymmetric information about the item's value. Therefore, a proportional fairness constraint is a suitable choice in cases where one group's values are systematically lower than another's. For example, in the context of housing allocation, low-income individuals may assign lower monetary value to homes compared to wealthier individuals, as they are more concerned with basic shelter than with investment or resale value. In such scenarios, the allocation ratio is a more effective approach to mitigate allocation inequality compared to using buyers' value.

We start by considering the static case with \(T=1\). In the unconstrained case, it is well-known that the optimal allocation is the second-price auction with a reserve price, which allocates the item to the buyer with the highest bid, conditioned on the bid being above a certain reserve price. Here, we establish that the optimal allocation under the fairness constraint has two main differences: first, the optimal fair mechanism subsidizes one group that would otherwise not meet the target fairness constraint. Second, the optimal allocation may increase the chance of allocating the item to both groups in general by reducing the reserve price (again disproportionately in favor of one group).

We next focus on the general dynamic case. Here, we characterize the optimal allocation through a set of recursive functions. At any round \(t\), we define the _residual minimum allocation_, which, roughly speaking, given the allocation so far, updates the fairness constraint as if we were to start at this round. We establish that, given the residual minimum allocation, we may have to allocate the item to one of the two groups to be on track to satisfy the fairness constraint overall, and that, in this case, we would simply allocate to the highest bidder in the group and charge them the second-highest bid within their group. However, in cases where we have the option to allocate to both groups, the design of the optimal allocation is more complicated because buyers in each group may consider underreporting their value in the current round to keep their chances of winning the item in future rounds higher, especially if they expect their value in future rounds to be higher.

In this case, we establish that, as the above reasoning suggests, there is a utility associated with not winning the item. This utility is the difference between a buyer's expected utility in future rounds if their group does not win the item this round, compared to the scenario where their group wins the item at the current round. We establish that, in the optimal allocation, and to incentivize buyers to report their values truthfully, the seller commits to paying them a participation reward if their group wins the item, and this reward is equal to the aforementioned net utility of not winning the item. On the other hand, the seller charges them an entry fee, which is equal to the expected reward payment that they would miss if they did not participate. Finally, we also prove that the optimal allocation rule is similar to the static case at a high level: when allocating an item to a group, it is assigned to the buyer with the highest bid. Second, the decision regarding which group receives the item takes the form of a subsidy. However, here, the amount of the subsidy depends on the above net utility of not winning the item and the seller's future utility from allocating the item to one group or the other.

As our results so far suggest, finding the optimal allocation requires solving a set of recursive functions, and as we see, the computational complexity could grow exponentially with the number of rounds. Our next contribution is to provide an efficient approximation scheme. In particular, we establish that, for any \(\varepsilon>0\), we can find an allocation that guarantees the same utility to the seller and a fairness constraint of \((1-\varepsilon)(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\) for group \(i\). This requires only \(\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-1/(1-\delta)})\)) calls to an oracle that computes integrals. We further provide a constant approximation scheme which requires \(\text{Poly}(1/(1-\delta))\) calls to the oracle, which is more applicable to scenarios where \(\delta\) is close to one. We conclude our paper by providing a simple numerical experiment to illustrate the impact of the fairness constraint on the utility of both the seller and users.

**Related work:** Our work is related to the growing literature on questions related to fairness in mechanism design [15; 36; 24]. Many works in fair mechanism design with an algorithmic focus draw from notions of fairness central to computer science and machine learning [19]. For instance, a prominent related area of fair algorithmic mechanism design studies frameworks that ensure equity in the distribution of online advertisements across protected user attributes in the setting of online auctions, e.g. [14; 13], and [21].

Our work is also related to a rich literature on fair division that studies fair allocation without considering the strategic behavior of agents, e.g. [8; 16; 11; 34; 12; 3]. Our work joins the set of works that consider both fairness and incentive compatibility in allocation. Where [25; 9; 12] consider truthful fair allocations with respect to variants of envy-freeness and [7; 6] consider more broadly the feasibility of different notions of fairness in a strategic setting, we join works that adopt a proportional notion of fairness, e.g, [1; 2; 4; 15]. We further depart from these works in our focus on revenue optimization (instead of, e.g., optimizing social welfare [36]) and in our treatment of the dynamic strategic environment.

Another group of related works studies the impact of budgetary and liquidity constraints on auction revenue, e.g. [26], and [18]. These works' motivation for considering budget constraints aligns with the setting where fair allocation guarantees are relevant. In particular, both settings drop the assumption that a bidder's valuation is accurately reflected by their willingness to pay. The setting of asymmetric budgetary constraints studied by [32] motivates the relevance of our work's introduction of guarantees for relative allocative fairness between groups. We build upon this set of work by introducing a framework where the allocative limitations of both homogeneous and heterogeneous budget constraints can be simultaneously overcome as efficiently as possible. A separate set of related works empirically studies the impact on efficiency of subsidizing targeted groups of bidders in procurement auctions [23; 5]. These works complement ours by pointing to bid subsidies as the cost-optimal mechanism to enforce fairness.

The closest setting to ours is that of [31] which examines a similar notion of fairness in the single-round (static) case, but only for one group. We depart from their work as we consider the dynamic case and present an approximation scheme. Additionally, even in the static case, we consider a minimum allocation constraint for both groups, which introduces a second type of subsidization.

## 2 Model

We consider a monopolist seller that interacts with two groups of buyers over \(T\) rounds,1 with \(n\) buyers in each group.2 At each round \(t\in[T]\),3 the seller conducts an auction to sell a single indivisible item. The private value of buyer \(k\in[n]\) from group \(i\in[2]\) (or simply, buyer \((i,k)\)) for this item is denoted by \(v^{t}_{i,k}\), which is drawn from the publicly known and full support continuous distribution with density \(f^{t}_{i}:[v^{t}_{i},\bar{v}^{t}_{i}]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}\). We also denote its cumulative distribution function by \(F^{t}_{i}(\cdot)\). We assume the buyers' values are independent.

Footnote 1: We demonstrate that the results extend to the case of multiple groups of buyers in an extended version available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147).

Footnote 2: Here, for simplicity in notation, we assume that the two groups are of equal size \(n\). However, our analysis and results apply to the general case, including unequal group sizes and scenarios with more than two groups.

Footnote 3: For any integer \(N\), \([N]\) denotes the set \(\{1,\ldots,N\}\).

**Timeline of the auction:** At each time \(t\), buyers' private values are realized, and then each buyer \((i,k)\) submits a bid \(b^{t}_{i,k}\). We denote the vector of bids at round \(t\) by \(\mathbf{b}^{t}\). The seller then conducts the auction and decides on the allocation \(\mathbf{x}^{t}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\) where \(\mathbf{h}^{t}\) denotes the public history of allocations up to (but not including) time \(t\), i.e., which buyers received the items in the previous \(t-1\) rounds. In particular, \(x^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\in\{0,1\}\) denotes whether the \(k\)th buyer in group \(i\) gets the item in round \(t\). Notice that since we allocate a single item at each round, we should have \(\sum_{i=1}^{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\leq 1\) for every \(t\in[T]\). Finally, buyer \((i,k)\) makes the payment \(p^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\)to the seller. The vector of payments at time \(t\) is denoted by \(\mathbf{p}^{t}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\). Notice that the mechanism is determined by the allocation and payment functions \((\mathbf{x}^{1:T},\mathbf{p}^{1:T})\).

Utility functions:The utility function of buyer \((i,k)\) at time \(t\) is given by \(\mathcal{U}^{t}_{i,k}(v^{t}_{i,k};\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t}):=x^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})v^{t}_{i,k}-p^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\). Buyer \((i,k)\) and seller's overall utilities are, respectively, given by:

\[\mathcal{U}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{1:T}_{i,k};\mathbf{b}^{1:T},\mathbf{h}^{1:T}):=\sum_{t=1}^{T }\delta^{t-1}\mathcal{U}^{t}_{i,k}(v^{t}_{i,k};\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\text{ and }\mathcal{U}_{0}(\mathbf{b}^{1:T},\mathbf{h}^{1:T}):=\sum_{t=1}^{T}\delta^{t-1}\sum_{(i,k)}p^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t}) \tag{1}\]

where \(\delta\in(0,1]\) is the discount factor. Our goal is to identify mechanisms that maximize the seller's expected utility, subject to certain fairness constraints ensuring a minimum allocation is guaranteed to each group. We next formally define these fairness constraints.

The fairness constraint:The seller, acting as the auctioneer, aims to ensure that a minimum allocation is guaranteed to each group in this dynamic setting. More specifically, let \(\alpha_{i}\) represent the minimum (discounted) average allocation promised to group \(i\), with the condition that \(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\leq 1\). Then, at each round \(t\), the seller ensures that the discounted average of the items allocated to group \(i\) thus far, combined with the expected allocation in the remaining rounds, is at least \(\alpha_{i}\):

\[\frac{1-\delta}{1-\delta^{T}}\left(\sum_{r=1}^{t-1}\delta^{\tau-1}\sum_{k=1}^{ n}x^{\tau}_{i,k}+\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{r=t}^{T}\delta^{\tau-1}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x^{ \tau}_{i,k}\right]\right)\geq\alpha_{i}, \tag{2}\]

where the expectation is taken over the realization of the private values at time \(t\) and the future rounds. We call the auction _infeasible_ at round \(t\) if it is not possible to satisfy the fairness constraint over the remaining rounds.

Notice that this condition is ex ante with respect to the allocation at time \(t\) onwards as we find this condition more compatible compared to an ex post fairness in a setting with indivisible goods. Also, it is straightforward to verify that if the condition (2) holds for \(t=T\), then it would hold for any \(t\leq T\). However, as we will elaborate later, this condition determines the set of feasible allocations for any \(t\leq T-1\). For instance, suppose \(T=4\) and \(\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=1/3\). Then, if we allocate the item to group 1 in the first three rounds, we cannot satisfy condition (2) for group 2 in the last round.

Direct truthful mechanisms:The dynamic revelation principle states that, without loss of generality, we can focus on direct, truthful mechanisms where buyers bidding truthfully is a Nash equilibrium [29]. It is important to note that the dynamic revelation principle requires truthful reporting only on the equilibrium path; that is, assuming all buyers have been truthful in the past. However, in our setting, this would imply truthful reporting under any history, even if a buyer has previously been dishonest (and we are off the equilibrium path). To see why this is the case, note that the utility of each buyer depends on their current (private) value and all past bids (but not on the past true values). Thus, when it is optimal for the buyer to bid truthfully when past reports have been truthful, it remains optimal for them to bid truthfully even if some buyers have lied in the past. This argument generally holds true for Markovian environments (see [33, 37] for a detailed discussion on this topic.)

In this paper, we use the _periodic ex post incentive compatibility_ (see [10] for a discussion on this definition and its comparison with the weaker notion of Bayesian incentive compatibility in dynamic mechanism design). More specifically, for any mechanism \((\mathbf{x}^{1:T},\mathbf{p}^{1:T})\), the following Markovian decision problem finds the best bid for buyer \(k\) from group \(i\), assuming that all other buyers are reporting their values truthfully:

\[U^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t}):=\max_{b^{t}_{i,k}}\left\{\mathcal{U}^{t}_{ i,k}\left(v^{t}_{i,k};b^{t}_{i,k},\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)},\mathbf{h}^{t}\right)+\delta \ \mathbb{E}\left[U^{t+1}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t+1},\mathbf{h}^{t+1})\Big{|}\mathbf{h}^{t} \right]\right\}, \tag{3}\]

with the convention that \(U^{T+1}_{i,k}(\cdot,\cdot):=0\). This is a recursive formula in which the buyer identifies the optimal bid by maximizing the sum of their utility at the current moment and the maximum of what they could achieve in the future, while they assume that all other buyers are bidding truthfully. A mechanism is called ex post incentive compatible if the maximum is achieved through truthful bidding. The formal definition is provided below.

**Definition 1**.: _A mechanism \((\mathbf{x}^{1:T},\mathbf{p}^{1:T})\) is ex post incentive compatible (EPIC) if:_

\[v^{t}_{i,k}\in\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{b^{t}_{i,k}}\left\{\mathcal{U}^{t}_{i,k }\left(v^{t}_{i,k};b^{t}_{i,k},\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)},\mathbf{h}^{t}\right)+\delta\ \mathbb{E}\left[U^{t+1}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t+1},\mathbf{h}^{t+1})\Big{|}\mathbf{h}^{t} \right]\right\}\ \forall i,k,t,\mathbf{v}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t}. \tag{4}\]Note that the EPIC mechanism can be identified through backward induction, starting at the last round and progressing back to the first. By doing so, at time \(t\), we would realize that maximum utility in future rounds is achieved through truthful bidding. Consequently, the term \(U^{t+1}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t+1},\mathbf{h}^{t+1})\) could be replaced with the utility assuming that everyone reports truthfully. In other words, to identify the EPIC mechanism, it is sufficient to find a mechanism that satisfies the following condition:

\[v^{t}_{i,k}\in\operatorname*{arg\,max}_{b^{t}_{i,k}}\left\{\mathcal{U}^{t}_{i,k }\left(v^{t}_{i,k};b^{t}_{i,k},\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)},\mathbf{h}^{t}\right)+\delta\ \mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\mathcal{U}^{\tau}_{i,k}(v^{\tau}_{i,k};\mathbf{v}^{\tau},\mathbf{h}^{\tau})\Big{|}\mathbf{h}^{t}\right]\right\}. \tag{5}\]

Finally, we state the individual rationality assumption or the participation condition. This assumption ensures that, at each round, each buyer (knowing only their value) would weakly prefer to participate in the auction. In other words, each buyer's expected utility is weakly higher if they participate rather than choosing their outside option, which is skipping that round.

**Definition 2**.: _A mechanism \((\mathbf{x}^{1:T},\mathbf{p}^{1:T})\) is individually rational (IR) if for all \(i,k,t,v^{t}_{i,k}\), and \(\mathbf{h}^{t}\):_

\[\mathbb{E}\left[U^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\right]\geq\delta\ \mathbb{E}\left[U^{t+1}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t+1},(\mathbf{h}^{t})^{t+1})\Big{|}\mathbf{h}^{t} \right], \tag{6}\]

_where \((\mathbf{h}^{\prime})^{t+1}\) denotes the history under which buyer \((i,k)\) has not participated at round \(t\), and the expectations are taken over \(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}\) and \(\mathbf{v}^{t+1:T}\).4_

Footnote 4: In the case of \(n=1\), a buyer’s non-participation could lead to the infeasibility of the auction as the item cannot be allocated to their group in that round. To avoid such special cases, in the case of \(n=1\), we assume that we may still allocate the item to their group even if they do not participate, but this potential allocation does not count towards their outside option utility.

The left hand side of (6) demonstrates the expected utility of buyer \((i,k)\) at time \(t\) and thereafter, assuming their participation in round \(t\). However, the right hand side of (6) shows the expected utility of buyer \((i,k)\) when they skip the \(t\)-th round (and receive no utility in the \(t\)-th round).

Throughout our analysis, we adopt the following regularity assumption on the distribution of values that is common in mechanism design literature. This assumption applies to a variety of distributions, including uniform, exponential, and normal distributions.5

Footnote 5: We demonstrate that the results in both the static and dynamic cases hold when this is assumption is weakened via ironing in an extended version available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00147).

**Assumption 1**.: _For any \(i\) and \(t\), the distribution \(F^{t}_{i}\) is regular, i.e., the virtual value function \(\phi^{t}_{i}(v):=v-\frac{1-F^{t}_{i}(v)}{f^{t}_{i}(v)}\) is increasing in \(v\)._

For the rest of the paper, our goal is to find an EPIC and IR mechanism \((\mathbf{x}^{1:T},\mathbf{p}^{1:T})\) that maximizes the expected seller utility subject to the fairness constraint (2). We start our analysis by discussing the static case, i.e., \(T=1\), which will be used in our analysis for the dynamic setting.

## 3 The static case

To simplify the notation, we drop the dependence of the parameters on time \(t\) in this section. Here, our fairness constraint (2) reduces to \(\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{i,k}\right]\geq\alpha_{i},\) where the expectation is taken over a single realization of the private values.

It is well-known that in the absence of the fairness constraint, and under Assumption 1, the item is allocated to the buyer who has the highest virtual value, provided that at least one buyer's virtual value is non-negative. Conversely, the seller does not allocate the item if all virtual values are negative. This mechanism is known as the second-price auction (or Vickrey auction) with reserve pricing, as detailed in [30]. This allocation is depicted in Figure 0(a). We next present the main result of this section which establishes the optimal allocation under the fairness constraint.

**Theorem 1**.: _Suppose Assumption 1 holds. For any \(i\in[2]\), let \(v_{i}:=\max_{k}v_{i,k}\) be the maximum value among buyers in group \(i\). Then, the following results hold for the optimal allocation:_

1. _If the item is allocated to group_ \(i\)_, then it is allocated to the buyer in group_ \(i\) _with the highest value, i.e., if_ \(x_{i,k}=1\)_, then_ \(v_{i,k}=v_{i}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

The dynamic case

We next turn our attention to the dynamic case. Here, our main approach involves using backward induction. The analysis from the previous section serves as the basis for the optimal allocation at the last round, i.e., \(t=T\). In this section, we describe how we proceed backward to find the optimal dynamic auction under the fairness constraint. We make the following assumption which simplifies the characterization of the optimal mechanism and allows us to focus on the insights. In the appendix, we discuss how our analysis extends to cases where this assumption does not hold.

**Assumption 2**.: _We assume the seller must allocate the item in any round, except possibly the last._

We start our analysis by making a number of definitions and observations. Suppose we are at the beginning of round \(t\). Given (2), our allocation at round \(t\) and the future rounds should satisfy the following constraint:

\[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T-1}\delta^{\tau-t}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{i,k}^{\tau}+ \delta^{T-t}\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{i,k}^{T}\right]\geq R_{i}^{t}:= \frac{1}{\delta^{t-1}}\left(\frac{1-\delta^{T}}{1-\delta}\alpha_{i}-\sum_{\tau =1}^{t-1}\delta^{\tau-1}\sum_{k=1}^{n}x_{i,k}^{\tau}\right), \tag{8}\]

We refer to the right-hand side as the _residual minimum allocation_ for group \(i\). It is noteworthy that equation (8) can be interpreted as if the auction is starting at time \(t\), with the fairness constraint given by \(R_{i}^{t}(1-\delta)/(1-\delta^{T-t})\). We next make the following simple observation:

**Fact 1**.: _Given the allocation at time \(t\), the residual minimum allocation at time \(t+1\), i.e., \(R_{i}^{t+1}\), is equal to \(\frac{1}{\delta}(R_{i}^{t}-1)\) when the item is allocated to group \(i\) and equal to \(\frac{1}{\delta}R_{i}^{t}\) otherwise._

We next introduce two interim functions. For the sake of these two definitions, assume the auction starts at time \(t\), i.e., the utility at any time \(\tau\), for \(\tau\geq t\), is discounted by a factor of \(\delta^{\tau-t}\). With this assumption, and for a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\), we define \(\mu^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) as the (discounted) sum of the expected utility of the seller at time \(t\) and thereafter, under the optimal mechanism satisfying equation (8), prior to the realization of values. Similarly, \(\nu_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) represents the expected utility of a buyer in group \(i\). It is worth noting that, given the distribution of values within each group is similar, \(\nu_{i}^{t}\) does not depend on \(k\) (the buyer's index within the group). We also set the these functions equal to \(-\infty\) if there is no feasible auction satisfying (8). The following result regarding \(\nu_{i}^{T}(\cdot,\cdot)\) and \(\mu^{T}(\cdot,\cdot)\) is a corollary of Theorem 1. Notice that the last round can be seen as a static auction with fairness constraint for group \(i\) given by \(R_{i}^{T}\).

**Corollary 1**.: _At round \(T\), and for a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T})\), we have_

\[\nu_{i}^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T}) =\frac{1}{n}\int_{G_{i}}\frac{1-F_{i}^{T}(v_{i})}{f_{i}^{T}(v_{i} )}dF_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1},v_{2}), \tag{9a}\] \[\mu^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T}) =\int_{G_{1}}\phi_{1}^{T}(v_{1})dF_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1},v_{2})+ \int_{G_{2}}\phi_{2}^{T}(v_{2})dF_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1},v_{2}), \tag{9b}\]

_where \(F_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1},v_{2})=F_{1}^{T}(v_{1})^{n}F_{2}^{T}(v_{2})^{n}\) and \(G_{i}\)'s are defined in Theorem 1._

This corollary is proved in the appendix. Now, suppose we are in the \(t\)-th round, conducting the backward induction. Consequently, we have access to \(\nu_{i}^{t+1}(\cdot,\cdot)\) (for \(i\in[2]\)) and \(\mu^{t+1}(\cdot,\cdot)\). Next, we will establish the optimal allocation for round \(t\) and describe how to compute \(\nu_{i}^{t}(\cdot,\cdot)\) and \(\mu^{t}(\cdot,\cdot)\) accordingly. We have three main regimes:

(I) When the auction is infeasible:Suppose that no matter whether the seller gives the item to the first or second group, they would not be able to satisfy the residual minimum allocation constraint in the remaining rounds. In this case, we declare the auction is infeasible at round \(t\).

**Fact 2**.: _For a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\), suppose we have \(\mu^{t+1}((R_{1}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{2}^{t}/\delta)\) and \(\mu^{t+1}(R_{1}^{t}/\delta,(R_{2}^{t}-1)/\delta)=-\infty\). Then, there is no feasible auction satisfying the residual minimum allocation constraints, and hence, we set \(\mu^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) and \(\nu_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\), for both \(i\in[2]\), equal to \(-\infty\)._

To better highlight this proposition, let us consider a simple example. Suppose \(T=2\), \(\delta=0.5\), and \(\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=0.4\). In this scenario, \(R_{1}^{1}=R_{2}^{1}=0.6\). Now, the residual minimum allocation for the second round for the group that doesn't receive the item in the first round would be \(1.2\), which is not feasible. Hence, there is no feasible auction that satisfies the fairness constraint.

(II) When the item must be allocated to a certain group:Suppose, for instance, that if the seller allocated the item to the second group, they would not be able to satisfy the resulting residual minimum allocation constraints in the remaining rounds. However, allocating the item to the first group would result in a feasible auction. Therefore, in this case, the seller must allocate the item (if keeping it were feasible, then allocating it to the second group would also have been feasible), and moreover, the item must be allocated to the first group. The following result formalizes the optimal allocation for this scenario.

**Proposition 2**.: _Suppose Assumption 1 holds. For a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) and some \(i\in[2]\), suppose we have \(\mu^{t+1}(R_{i}^{t}/\delta,(R_{-i}^{t}-1)/\delta)=-\infty\) but \(\mu^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta)>-\infty\). Then, the seller allocates the item to the buyer with the highest value in group \(i\), with the payment being equal to the second-highest value within the same group._

Intuitively, if the item must be allocated to the first group, the question of who within that group receives the item essentially boils down to a static Vickrey auction: the buyer offering the highest value acquires the item and pays the price equal to the second highest value in the group. It is important to note that, in this scenario, there is no reserve price (and we do not need to explicitly impose Assumption 2) because the seller is obliged to allocate the item to meet the fairness constraint. Lastly, the update of interim functions are provided in Appendix A.4.1.

(III) When allocation to both groups is feasible:Suppose that whether the seller allocates the item to the first or second group, they still have the opportunity to meet the allocation constraint in future rounds. Now, what should be the seller's allocation strategy to maximize their utility?

Note that the expected utility of buyers in each group changes based on whether or not they receive the item in the current round. The difference between these two scenarios can be interpreted as the expected utility of not receiving the item. More formally, for a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\), and when allocation to both groups is feasible, the net utility of not receiving the item for group \(i\) is defined as

\[\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}):=\nu_{i}^{t+1}(R_{i}^{t}/\delta,(R_{-i}^{t }-1)/\delta)-\nu_{i}^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta). \tag{10}\]

It is worth noting that, interestingly, the net utility of not receiving the item could be negative in some case (See Appendix A.5). Lastly, we define \(\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) as the difference in seller's future utility by allocating the item to the first group, compared to allocating it to the second group, i.e.,

\[\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}):=\mu^{t+1}((R_{1}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{2}^{t}/ \delta)-\mu^{t+1}((R_{2}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{1}^{t}/\delta). \tag{11}\]

**Theorem 2**.: _Suppose Assumptions 1 and 2 hold. For a given pair of residual minimum allocations \((R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\), suppose both \(\mu^{t+1}(R_{1}^{t}/\delta,(R_{2}^{t}-1)/\delta)\) and \(\mu^{t+1}((R_{1}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{2}^{t}/\delta)\) are finite. Then, the seller allocates the item to the buyer with the highest value in group \(i\) if \((v_{1}^{t},v_{2}^{t})\in G_{i}^{t}\), where \(v_{j}^{t}:=\max_{k}v_{j,k}^{t}\) is the maximum value among buyers in group \(j\) and \(G_{i}^{t}\) is given by_

\[G_{i}^{t}:=\Big{\{}(v_{1},v_{2})\,\Big{|}\,\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i})-\phi_{-i}^{t}(v_ {-i})\geq n\delta\,\big{(}\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})-\Delta_{-i}^{t}(R _{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\big{)}+(-1)^{i}\delta\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}) \Big{\}}.\]

_Moreover, let \(i^{*}\) denote the index of the winner group. Then, the payment of buyer \((i,k)\) is given by_

\[v_{i,k}^{t}\;x_{i,k}^{t}(v_{i,k}^{t},\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t})-\int_{\underline{v}_{ i}^{t}}^{v_{i,k}^{t}}x_{i,k}^{t}(z,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t})dz+\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R _{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})(\zeta_{i}^{t}-\mathbb{1}\,(i^{*}=i)), \tag{12}\]

_where \(\zeta_{i}^{t}\) denotes the probability of group \(i\) winning the item if the auction runs with \(n-1\) buyers from their group instead of \(n\) buyers._

The explicit characterization of \(\zeta_{i}^{t}\)'s along with the update of interim functions are provided in Appendix A.6. It is worth emphasizing that while the term \(\zeta_{i}^{t}\) depends on the allocation rule of an auction with \(2n-1\) buyers, we can derive it in a non-recursive manner. The reason is that finding the allocation, similar to \(G_{i}^{t}\) above, does not require running the smaller-size auction. Next, we would like to draw a few insights from this result. First, notice that, similar to the static case, the boundary of allocation rule is a linear function of the maximum virtual values of both group.

Next, note that the payment function consists of three terms. The first term, \(v_{i,k}^{t}\;x_{i,k}^{t}(v_{i,k}^{t},\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t})-\int_{\underline{v}_{ i}^{t,k}}^{v_{i,k}^{t}}x_{i,k}^{t}(z,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t})dz\), represents what only the winner pays and is equal to the minimum bid they could have made to still win the item. This is indeed similar to the second-price auction in which the winner's payment is equal to the second highest bid. To better understand the other two terms, and for the sake of discussion, suppose \(\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\)'s are non-negative, indicating a non-negative net future utility associated with not receiving the item at the current time (because it means your chance of receiving it in the future increases). The second term of the payment function is \(-\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\mathbb{1}\left(i^{*}=i\right)\), which is negative and thus represents a transfer from the seller to the buyers (we call this _participation reward_). Only the buyers from the group that wins the item receive this payment. To understand why such a reward is needed from the seller, notice that when a buyer's group wins the item, they are in fact losing an amount of \(\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) in their future utility because their group has a lower chance of winning in the future. Hence, in some sense, this reduces the value of the item in the current round, and the buyers may find it profitable to underreport their value. That said, this payment serves to incentivize truthful reporting. Finally, the last term in the payment function is \(\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\zeta_{i}^{t}\), which is a payment that every buyer should make to the seller. The rationale here is that if the buyer skips the current round, then if their group wins, which happens with probability \(\zeta_{i}^{t}\), their group would receive a payment equal to \(\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) from the seller, as we elaborated above. Hence, the seller charges the same amount as the _entry fee_.

Lastly, notice that in the allocation rule \(G_{i}^{t}\), there is a threshold of \(n\delta\left(\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})-\Delta_{-i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{ 2}^{t})\right)+(-1)^{i}\delta\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) which determines which group receives the item. Notice that this threshold increases as \(\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) increases, meaning that the seller is less willing to give the item to group \(i\). This is because a higher \(\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) means that the seller has to make a higher payment to group \(i\)'s buyers if they win. Additionally, this threshold decreases for the first group when \(\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) increases, indicating that the seller is more willing to allocate the item to the first group when \(\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\) is higher. This is intuitive as this term represents the seller's future net utility by allocating the item to the first group compared to allocating it to the second group.

**An approximation scheme:** Our results so far offer an exact characterization of the optimal dynamic allocation. However, due to the recursive nature of the analysis, the computational complexity of this allocation increases exponentially with the number of rounds, \(T\). We conclude this section by discussing efficient methods to find an approximately optimal allocation. Since our focus is not on approximating the integrals here, we assume we have access to an oracle which can compute integrals and solve integral equations.

**Assumption 3**.: _We have access to an oracle that, for any \(i\in[n]\) and \(t\in[T]\), can compute the integrals \(\int_{G}\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i}^{t}),dF_{\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v_{2})\) and \(\int_{G}\frac{1-F_{i}^{t}(v_{i})}{f_{i}^{t}(v_{i})},dF_{\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v _{2})\) with \(F_{\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v_{2})=F_{1}^{t}(v_{1})^{nNotice that the complexity of the approximation given by proposition 3 grows large for \(\delta\) close to 1. Next, we present a second approximation scheme for the case where \(\delta\) is close to one.

**Proposition 4**.: _Suppose Assumptions 1-3 hold and that \(\delta<1\). Then, for a fixed constant \(c<\delta^{2}\), there exists an allocation \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) with the following properties: \((1)\)\(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) satisfies the fairness constraint for group \(i\) at a level of at least \(c\cdot\alpha_{i}\), \((2)\)\(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) guarantees that the sellers total utility is at least \(c\) times that of that of the optimal allocation, and \((3)\)\(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) can be computed by calling the oracle Poly \(\left(\frac{1}{1-\delta}\right)\) times where the polynomial's degree and coefficients depend on \(c\)._

This \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) modifies the approximation \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) presented in Proposition 3 by introducing a discontinuous discounting technique. In \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\), we partition the first \(T_{0}\) rounds into buckets that use a common approximate discount factor such that the computational complexity of each bucket may be controlled in the same manner as Fact 3. A complete proof as well as a complete proof statement that relates the early stopping approximation with the discounting approximation that can be tuned to achieve an overall approximation level \(c\) can be found in Appendix A.8.

## 5 Experiments

Here, we present the results of a numerical experiment assessing the impact on utilities of varying the fairness constraints of each group. In particular, we implement the case where \(\delta=0.99\), \(n=1\), \(v_{1}^{t}\sim\text{Uniform}(0.5,1.5)\), and \(v_{2}^{t}\sim\text{Uniform}(0,1)\) for \(t\in[2]\) for \(T=2,4\).

For each value of \(T\), we consider combinations of fairness constraints on a discretized grid where \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) range over \((0,0.5)\) with increments of \(0.1\). For each pair \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\), we calculate the mean difference in utility between the optimal fair allocation at level \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\) and the unconstrained optimal allocation satisfying Assumption 2 (i.e., \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}=0\)), for the seller and buyers over 10,000 iterations of the mechanism. Note that, for these distributions, when \(T=2\) the average unconstrained allocation probabilities are \(0.69\) and \(0.31\) for groups one and two, respectively. The results are reported in Figures 2-3.

We see that the seller utility is decreasing in \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\) but only after the point at which the constraints bind. For group one, we see that, for a fixed \(\alpha_{1}\), utility is decreasing in \(\alpha_{2}\), since, to satisfy the fairness constraint, we re-allocate higher value regions to group two and allocate lower-value regions that would otherwise go unallocated to group one. In contrast, for group two, we see that, for a fixed \(\alpha_{2}\), utility is relatively constant in \(\alpha_{1}\) since the optimal allocation tends to reallocate to group one from the lower-value no-allocation region.

Appendix

In this appendix, we present proofs and details that are omitted from the body of the paper.

### Proof of Theorem 1

We first revisit the following well-known result for EPIC and IR mechanisms in the static scenario (see Chapters 9 and 13 of [30] for the proof):

**Proposition 5** ([28]).: _A mechanism \((\mathbf{x},\mathbf{p})\) is EPIC if and only if, for every \(i\) and \(k\), the allocation function \(x_{i,k}(v,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)})\) is weakly increasing in \(v\), and the payment function is given by_

\[p_{i,k}(v,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)})=v\;x_{i,k}(v,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)})-\int_{ \Sigma_{i}}^{v}x_{i,k}(z,\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)})dz+c(\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}), \tag{13}\]

_with \(c(\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)})=0\) for IR mechanisms. Moreover, the seller's expected utility for any EPIC and IR mechanism is given by_

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}}\left[\sum_{i\in[2],k\in[n]}\phi_{i}(v_{i,k})x _{i,k}(\mathbf{v})\right]. \tag{14}\]

Next, let \(\mathcal{S}\) be the set of \((\phi_{i}(v_{i,k}))_{i,k}\) for which the seller allocates the item to one of the groups in the optimal allocation \(\tilde{x}\), i.e.,

\[\mathcal{S}=\left\{(\phi_{i}(v_{i,k}))_{i,k}\Big{|}\exists i,k\; \text{s.t.}\;x_{i,k}(\mathbf{v})=1\right\}. \tag{15}\]

Recall that \(v_{i}=\max_{k}v_{i,k}\). We first establish that, given \(\mathcal{S}\), the boundary of the optimal allocation is in the form of \(\phi_{1}(v_{1})=\phi_{2}(v_{2})+\gamma\) for some \(\gamma\). Note that the set \(\mathcal{S}\) is measurable as the allocation function is measurable.

Notice that the probability of \(\mathcal{S}\) is at least \(\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}\). Since \(f_{1}(\cdot)\) and \(f_{2}(\cdot)\) are continuous, we can find an allocation rule that is confined to \(\mathcal{S}\), satisfies the fairness constraint, and its boundary takes the form \(\phi_{1}(v_{1})=\phi_{2}(v_{2})+\gamma\) for some \(\gamma\) (we call such allocations as _affine allocations_). That is, group one receives the object if and only if \(\phi_{1}(v_{1})\geq\phi_{2}(v_{2})+\gamma\) and \((\phi_{1}(v_{1}),\phi_{2}(v_{2}))\in\mathcal{S}\); similarly, group two receives the object if and only if \(\phi_{1}(v_{1})<\phi_{2}(v_{2})+\gamma\) and \((\phi_{1}(v_{1}),\phi_{2}(v_{2}))\in\mathcal{S}\). We further assume this allocation allocates the item to the buyer with highest value within each group. Denote this allocation by \(x^{*}\). If there are multiple allocation rules of this form, we select the one whose corresponding \(\gamma\) has the smallest absolute value. On can verify by inspection that such allocation is monotone, and hence, satisfies the EPIC condition with its corresponding payment identity. Without loss of generality, we may assume \(\gamma>0\), as the case for \(\gamma<0\) can be argued similarly.

If we had to allocate every pair in \(\mathcal{S}\) but there were no fairness constraints, the optimal allocation would have been by checking to the buyer with the highest value, which from groups' pointw of view would mean the boundary \(\phi_{1}(v_{1})\leqq\phi_{2}(v_{2})\). Let \(A^{*}\) be the region that \(x^{*}\) allocates differently from this unconstrained allocation over \(\mathcal{S}\), i.e.,

\[A^{*}=\left\{(\phi_{i}(v_{i,k}))_{i,k}\in\mathcal{S}\Big{|}\phi_ {1}(v_{1})\geq\phi_{2}(v_{2})\geq\phi_{1}(v_{1})-\gamma\right\}. \tag{16}\]

We define \(\tilde{A}\) similarly for the allocation \(\tilde{x}\) as the set of values for which we allocate the item suboptimally. Also, for any \(j\in[2]\), let \(Q_{j}\subset\mathcal{S}\) be the region that is allocated to group \(j\) in the optimal unconstrained allocation, i.e.,

\[Q_{j}=\left\{(\phi_{i}(v_{i,k}))_{i,k}\in\mathcal{S}\Big{|}\phi _{j}(v_{j})\geq\phi_{-j}(v_{-j})\right\}. \tag{17}\]

In particular, note that \(A^{*}\subseteq Q_{1}\). We next make the following claim.

**Claim 1**.: _The probability of \(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}\) is lower bounded by the probability of \(A^{*}\), i.e.,_

\[\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1})\geq\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(A ^{*}). \tag{18}\]

_Moreover, equality can only occur if \(\tilde{A}\subseteq Q_{1}\)._Proof.: To see why this is the case, notice that since \(\tilde{x}\) satisfies the fairness constraint, we should have

\[\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1})+\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(Q_{2})\geq\mathbb{P }_{\mathbf{v}}(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1})+\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(Q_{2}\backslash\tilde{A}) \geq\alpha_{2}. \tag{19}\]

Now, if (18) does not hold, then we would have

\[\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(A^{*})+\mathbb{P}_{\mathbf{v}}(Q_{2})>\alpha_{2}, \tag{20}\]

but then this would mean that we can lower the \(\gamma\) in allocation \(x^{*}\) which contradicts its definition. 

Notice that the loss of allocation \(x^{*}\) compared to the optimal unconstrained allocation is given by

\[\text{Loss}_{x^{*}}:=\int_{A^{*}}(\phi_{1}(\max_{k}v_{1,k})-\phi_{2}(\max_{k}v _{2,k}))dF(\mathbf{v}) \tag{21}\]

Let also \(\text{Loss}_{\tilde{x}}\) denote the loss of allocation \(\tilde{x}\) compared to the optimal unconstrained allocation. This loss is lower bounded by

\[\text{Loss}_{\tilde{x}}\geq\int_{\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}}(\phi_{1}(\max_{k}v_{1,k} )-\phi_{2}(\max_{k}v_{2,k}))dF(\mathbf{v}). \tag{22}\]

Notice that, since \(\tilde{x}\) is the optimal allocation, the right hand side of (22) should be lower than (21):

\[\int_{\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}}(\phi_{1}(\max_{k}v_{1,k})-\phi_{2}(\max_{k}v_{2,k} ))dF(\mathbf{v})\leq\int_{A^{*}}(\phi_{1}(\max_{k}v_{1,k})-\phi_{2}(\max_{k}v_{2,k} ))dF(\mathbf{v}). \tag{23}\]

We next claim that this implies that \(A^{*}=\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}\).

**Claim 2**.: _We have \(A^{*}=\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}\) (up to a measure-zero set)._

Proof.: To simplify the notation, let \(L(v_{1},v_{2})=\phi_{1}(v_{1})-\phi_{2}(v_{2})\). Suppose these two sets are not equal. This implies that there is some region \(\tilde{B}\) outside region \(A^{*}\) that is in region \(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}\) and some region \(B^{*}\) that is outside region \(\tilde{A}\cap Q_{1}\) but inside region \(A^{*}\). By Claim 1, we have:

\[\int_{\tilde{B}}dF(\mathbf{v})\geq\int_{B^{*}}dF(\mathbf{v}). \tag{24}\]

Next, by (23), we have

\[\int_{\tilde{B}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{v})\leq\int_{B^{*}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{v}) \tag{25}\]

Notice that \(L(v_{1},v_{2})\) is nonnegative over \(\tilde{B}\) and \(B^{*}\). Also, the fact that \(\tilde{B}\cap A^{*}\) is empty (along with \(\tilde{B}\subseteq Q_{1}\)) means that \(\sup_{B^{*}}L(v_{1},v_{2})\leq\gamma<\inf_{\tilde{B}}L(v_{1},v_{2})\). Next, notice that

\[\int_{B^{*}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{v})\leq\sup_{B^{*}}L(v_{1},v_{2})\int_{B^{*} }dF(\mathbf{v})\]

and

\[\int_{\tilde{B}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{v})\geq\inf_{\tilde{B}}L(v_{1},v_{2})\int _{\tilde{B}}dF(\mathbf{v}).\]

Combined with (24), these inequalities yield that

\[\int_{B^{*}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{v})\leq\int_{\tilde{B}}L(v_{1},v_{2})dF(\mathbf{ v}),\]

where the equality holds only if \(\tilde{B}\) and \(B^{*}\) are measure zero, which should be the case given (25). This shows that \(\tilde{x}\) and \(x^{*}\) are the same, up to a measure zero set. 

This claim along with the equality condition of Claim 1 shows that \(A^{*}\) and \(\tilde{A}\) are equal up to a measure-zero set. Hence, for a given \(\mathcal{S}\), the optimal allocation is an affine allocation.

Now, this result was for a given \(\mathcal{S}\). Using a similar argument, we can establish that the optimal set \(\mathcal{S}\) should be in the form of

\[\Big{\{}(\phi_{1}(v_{1}),\phi_{2}(v_{2}))\Big{|}\phi_{1}(v_{1})\geq-\eta_{1}\; \text{or}\;\phi_{2}(v_{2})\geq-\eta_{2}\Big{\}} \tag{26}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

The proof is similar to show that, if \(\eta_{1}>0\), i.e., there is insufficient total allocation in the optimal unconstrained allocation, we have \(\mathbb{P}(G_{1})=\alpha_{1}\). As before, clearly \(\mathbb{P}(G_{1})\geq\alpha_{1}\), otherwise the fairness constraint is not satisfied. Suppose, for sake of contradiction, that \(\mathbb{P}(G_{1})\geq\alpha_{1}\). Then there is some subset

\[\widehat{G}_{1}\subseteq\{(v_{1},v_{2})|-\eta_{1}\leq\phi_{1}(v_{1}),\leq 0, \phi_{2}(v_{2})\leq\phi_{1}(v_{1})-\gamma\} \tag{28}\]

with nonzero measure such that \(\mathbb{P}(G_{1}\setminus\widehat{G}_{2})\geq\alpha_{1}\). Notice that \(\widehat{G}_{1}\) is some subset of the orange region in Figure 0(b). Once again, let \(x\) be the original allocation and \(\widehat{x}\) be the modified allocation where we do not allocate region \(\widehat{G}_{2}\). The change in loss under the modified allocation is given by

\[\text{Loss}_{x}-\text{Loss}_{\widehat{x}}=\int_{\widehat{G}_{1}}(\phi_{1}( \max_{k}v_{1,k})-\phi_{2}(\max_{k}v_{2,k}))dF(\mathbf{v}). \tag{29}\]

Since \(\widehat{G}_{1}\) has nonzero measure and \(\phi_{2}(v_{2})\leq 0\) for all \((\max_{k}v_{1,k},\max_{k}v_{2,k})\in\widehat{G}_{1}\), it follows that \(\text{Loss}_{\widehat{x}}-\text{Loss}_{x}>0\). Once again, this contradicts the optimality of allocation \(x\), and it must be that \(\mathbb{P}(G_{1})=\alpha_{1}\).

Observing that the second claim follows from exchanging the roles of groups 1 and 2 in the preceding work concludes the proof. \(\blacksquare\)

### Proof of corollary 1

Both results follow from an application of the following claim.

**Claim 3**.: _Let \(f(v_{i,k}^{T})\) be some function of \(v_{i,k}^{T}\). Then_

\[\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})f(v_{i,k}^{T})\right]=\frac{1 }{n}\int_{G_{i}}f(v_{i,k}^{T})dF_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1},v_{2}) \tag{30}\]

First, by the law of total probability and observing that \(x_{i,k}^{T}=0\) if \(v_{i,k}^{T}<\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{T}\),

\[\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})f(v_{i,k}^{T}) \right]=\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})f(v_{i,k}^{T})\mid v _{i,k}^{T}=\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{T}\right]\mathbb{P}\left(v_{i,k}^{T}=\max_{k}v_{i, k}^{T}\right) \tag{31}\]Next, since \(v_{i,k}^{T}\stackrel{{ i.i.d.}}{{\sim}}F_{i}^{T}\), \(\mathbb{P}(v_{i,k}^{T}=\max_{k}v_{i,k})=\frac{1}{n}\). Also observe that \(x_{i,k}^{T}=0\) for \((v_{1},v_{2})\notin G_{i}\). Thus,

\[\begin{split}\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})f (v_{i,k}^{T})\right]&=\frac{1}{n}\mathbb{E}\left[f(v_{i,k}^{T}) \mathbbm{1}\{v_{i,k}^{T}=\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{T},(v_{1},v_{2})\in G_{i}\}\right]\\ &=\frac{1}{n}\int_{G_{i}}f(v_{i,k}^{T})dF_{\text{max}}^{T}(v_{1}, v_{2})\end{split} \tag{32}\]

Now, we use the preceding claim to evaluate the expected utility of a buyer in group \(i\) denoted \(\nu_{i}^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T})\). Note that

\[\nu_{i}^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T})=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^{T}(v_{i,k} ^{T};\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{ h}^{T})v_{i,k}^{T}-p_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})\right] \tag{33}\]

The expected payment of a buyer in group \(i\) can equivalently be expressed as

\[\mathbb{E}\left[p_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})\phi_{i}^{T}(v_{i,k}^{T})\right] \tag{34}\]

as shown in [30, Lemma 13.11]. Substitution of this result into yields

\[\nu_{i}^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T})=\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h} ^{T})\left(v_{i,k}^{T}-\phi_{i}^{T}(v_{i,k}^{T})\right)\right] \tag{35}\]

From here, applying the claim 3 to the function \(v_{i,k}^{T}-p_{i,k}^{T}(\mathbf{b}^{T},\mathbf{h}^{T})\) yields the desired result.

Next, we show the second part of the claim. By definition 14, we may express the expected utility of the seller in group \(i\) denoted \(\mu^{T}(R_{1}^{T},R_{2}^{T})\) as

\[\mathbb{E}\left[\phi_{1}(v_{1,k})x_{1,k}(\mathbf{v})+\phi_{2}(v_{2,k})x_{2,k}(\mathbf{ v})\right] \tag{36}\]

By linearity of expectation and an application of claim 3 to functions \(\phi_{1}(v_{1,k})\) and \(\phi_{2}(v_{2,k})\) yields the desired result. \(\blacksquare\)

### Proof of proposition 2

First, notice that the seller must allocate the item to a member of the group, otherwise the auction becomes infeasible. Therefore, this case reduces to a static Vickrey auction with no reserve price where the revenue-maximizing allocation and payments are characterized by [28] as follows. To optimize seller revenue, the seller allocates to the highest bidder who pays an amount equal to the second highest bid.

By definition, we may express the expected utility as

\[\nu_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\delta^{\tau -t}\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^{\tau}\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^{t} \right]+\delta\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\delta^{\tau-(t+1)}\mathcal{U }_{i,k}^{\tau}\right] \tag{37}\]

Since the seller allocates the item to a buyer in group \(i\) with probability 1 to maintain feasibility and by Fact 1,

\[\delta\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\delta^{\tau-(t+1)}\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^ {\tau}\right]=\delta\nu_{i}^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta) \tag{38}\]

From (35), the definition of virtual values, and the observation that this setting reduces to a Vickrey auction,

\[\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{t}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\left(v_{i,k}^{t}-\phi_{i}^{ t}(v_{i,k}^{t})\right)\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{1-F_{i}^{t}(v_{i,k}^{t})}{f_{i} ^{t}(v_{i,k}^{t})}\mathbbm{1}\left\{v_{i,k}^{t}=\max_{j}v_{i,j}^{t}\right\}\right] \tag{39}\]

Since \(v_{i,k}^{t}\) is distributed according to \(F_{i}^{t}(v_{i,k}^{t})\) for all \(k\in[n]\), \(\mathbb{P}\left(v_{i,k}^{t}=\max_{j}v_{i,j}^{t}\right)=(F_{i}^{t}(v))^{n-1}\). Therefore,

\[\mathbb{E}\left[x_{i,k}^{t}(\mathbf{b}^{t},\mathbf{h}^{t})\left(v_{i,k}^{t}-\phi_{i}^{ t}(v_{i,k}^{t})\right)\right]=\int(1-F_{i}^{t}(v))(F_{i}^{t}(v))^{n-1}dv \tag{40}\]

and the result follows.

Next, we evaluate the expected utility of buyer \(-i\) that does not receive the item. Since buyer \(-i\) does not receive the item with probability 1, their expected utility reduces to the discounted expected utility over future rounds, i.e.,

\[\nu_{-i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})=\delta\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T} \delta^{\tau-(t+1)}\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^{\tau}\right]. \tag{41}\]

The result follows by applying Fact 1 to see that

\[\delta\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t+1}^{T}\delta^{\tau-(t+1)}\mathcal{U}_{i,k}^ {\tau}\right]=\delta\nu_{-i}^{t+1}((R_{1}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{2}^{t}/\delta). \tag{42}\]

Last, we evaluate the seller's expected utility. By Definition 14 and since the good is allocated to the maximum valuation buyer in group \(i\) with probability 1,

\[\mu^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})=\mathbb{E}\left[\sum_{\tau=t}^{T}\delta^{\tau-t} \left[\sum_{i\in[2],k\in[n]}\phi_{i}^{\tau}(v_{i,k}^{\tau})x_{i,k}^{\tau}( \boldsymbol{v})\right]\right]=\mathbb{E}\left[\phi_{i}^{t}\left(\max_{k}v_{i, k}^{t}\right)\right]+\delta\mu^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta). \tag{43}\]

Recalling that \(\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{t}\sim F_{i}^{t}(v)^{n}\), we can express the first term as

\[\mathbb{E}\left[\phi_{i}^{t}\left(\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{t}\right)\right]=\int\phi_{i }^{t}(v)dF_{i}^{t}(v)^{n} \tag{44}\]

and the result follows. \(\blacksquare\)

#### a.4.1 Update of interim functions

Under the premise of Proposition 2, the interim functions are updates in the following manner:

\[\nu_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}) =\int(1-F_{i}^{t}(v))(F_{i}^{t}(v))^{n-1}dv+\delta\nu_{i}^{t+1}(( R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta), \tag{45a}\] \[\nu_{-i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}) =\delta\nu_{-i}^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta),\] (45b) \[\mu^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t}) =\int\phi_{i}^{t}(v)dF_{i}^{t}(v)^{n}+\delta\mu^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1 )/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta). \tag{45c}\]

### Example with negative net utility of not receiving an item

One might expect the net utility of not receiving the item to be nonnegative for each group, given that not receiving the item at the current time implies a higher chance of receiving it in future rounds. However, interestingly, this argument is not necessarily true; the expected utility of a buyer may decrease even as the fairness constraint on their group increases. Let us elaborate this matter by a simple example. Consider a scenario with \(T=2\), \(n=1\), and \(\delta=0.8\). Suppose the distributions of values are identical across both groups, i.e., \(F_{1}^{t}=F_{2}^{t}\) for \(t\in[2]\), while the values from the first round are significantly lower than those from the second round, i.e., \(\bar{v}_{i}^{1}\ll\underline{v}_{i}^{2}\). Initially, let \(\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=0.2\). In this scenario, each group has some positive probability of receiving the item in the second round. Now, let us increase \(\alpha_{1}\) to \(0.5\). It is straightforward to verify that the only feasible allocation is to give the item to the first group in the first round and to the second group in the second round. Given that the values in the first round are considerably lower, this allocation actually decreases the expected utility for the first group.

### Proof of theorem 2

Notice that the variable

\[\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x_{i,\ell}^{t}(\boldsymbol{v}^{t}). \tag{46}\]determines whether group \(i\) receives the item or not. Now, suppose buyer \((i,k)\) submits bid \(b\). Given Assumption 2, we can write the utility of buyer \((i,k)\) as:

\[x^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})v^{t}_{i,k}-p^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)} )-\delta(\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x^{t}_{i,\ell}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}))\Delta^{t}_{i} (R^{t}_{1},R^{t}_{2})+\delta\nu^{t+1}_{i}(R^{t}_{i}/\delta,(R^{t}_{-i}-1)/ \delta). \tag{47}\]

Notice that the last term \(\delta\nu^{t+1}_{i}(R^{t}_{i}/\delta,(R^{t}_{-i}-1)/\delta)\) is a constant, independent of the values and the bid. Hence, we can drop this constant from the buyer's decision making. Now, assuming \(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}\) is fixed, we can write the adjusted utility as

\[x^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})v^{t}_{i,k}-\tilde{p}^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t} _{-(i,k)}), \tag{48}\]

where

\[\tilde{p}^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}):=p^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})+ \delta(\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x^{t}_{i,\ell}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}))\Delta^{t}_{i}(R ^{t}_{1},R^{t}_{2}). \tag{49}\]

Using this representation, we can interpret round \(t\)-th auction as a one round auction. Hence, given proposition 5, for an allocation to be EPIC, \(x^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})\) should be (weakly) monotone in \(b\) and we also should have

\[\tilde{p}^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})=b\;x^{t}_{i,k}(b,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)} )-\int_{\underline{v}^{t}_{i}}^{b}x^{t}_{i,k}(z,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})dz+c_{i,k}( \mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}), \tag{50}\]

for some function \(c_{i,k}(\cdot)\) which is independent of \(v\). As a result, for any \(i\in[2]\) and \(k\in[n]\), the payment is given by

\[p^{t}_{i,k}(v,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})= \tag{51}\] \[v\;x^{t}_{i,k}(v,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})-\int_{\underline{v}^{t}_{i }}^{v}x^{t}_{i,k}(z,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})dz-\delta(\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x^{t}_{i, \ell}(v,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}))\Delta^{t}_{i}(R^{t}_{1},R^{t}_{2})+c_{i,k}(\mathbf{v} ^{t}_{-(i,k)}).\]

The seller wants to choose \(c_{i,k}(\cdot)\) as large as possible, but the IR constraint puts an upper bound on it. Substituting the payment (51) into (47), the buyer utility is given by

\[\int_{\underline{v}^{t}_{i}}^{v^{t}_{i,k}}x^{t}_{i,k}(z,\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})dz +\delta\nu^{t+1}_{i}(R^{t}_{i}/\delta,(R^{t}_{-i}-1)/\delta)-c_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{ t}_{-(i,k)}). \tag{52}\]

Now, to check the IR constraint, suppose buyer \((i,k)\) skips round \(t\), and denote the optimal allocation in that case by \(\tilde{\mathbf{x}}^{t}\). Hence, the expected utility of buyer \((i,k)\) from time \(t+1\) onwards is given by

\[\delta\nu^{t+1}_{i}(R^{t}_{i}/\delta,(R^{t}_{-i}-1)/\delta)-\delta(\sum_{\ell \neq k}\tilde{x}^{t}_{i,\ell}(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}))\Delta^{t}_{i}(R^{t}_{1},R^ {t}_{2}). \tag{53}\]

The IR constraint implies that the expectation of (52) minus (53) over \(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}\) should be nonnegative for any \(v^{t}_{i,k}\). Thus, we should have

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}}[c_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})]\leq\delta\Delta^ {t}_{i}(R^{t}_{1},R^{t}_{2})\;\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)}}\left[\sum_{\ell \neq k}\tilde{x}^{t}_{i,\ell}(\mathbf{v}^{t}_{-(i,k)})\right], \tag{54}\]

and so, the seller sets the function \(c_{i,k}(\cdot)\) to achieve the equality case. Note that the right hand side is only a function of \(i\). We denote it by \(c^{t}_{i}\). We next make the following claim regarding the expected payment of buyer \((i,k)\) to the seller in this case.

**Claim 4**.: _The expected payment of buyer \((i,k)\) to the seller at round \(t\) is given by_

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}^{t}}\left[\phi^{t}_{i}(v^{t}_{i,k})x^{t}_{i,k}(\mathbf{v}^{t})- \delta(\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x^{t}_{i,\ell}(\mathbf{v}^{t}))\Delta^{t}_{i}(R^{t}_{1},R ^{t}_{2})\right]+c^{t}_{i}. \tag{55}\]The proof of this claim follows from the classical derivation of payment in static mechanism design (see [30][Lemma 13.11] for instance) along with the characterization of payment in (51). As a consequence, the seller's utility at round \(t\) is given by

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}^{t}}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i,k }^{t})x_{i,k}^{t}(\mathbf{v}^{t})-\sum_{i=1}^{2}n\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x_{i,\ell}^{t}(\mathbf{v}^{t})\right]+nc_{1}^{t}+nc _{2}^{t}. \tag{56}\]

Therefore, the seller's expected utility for time \(t\) onwards is given by

\[\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}^{t}}\left[\sum_{i=1}^{2}\sum_{k=1}^{n}\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i, k}^{t})x_{i,k}^{t}(\mathbf{v}^{t})+\sum_{i=1}^{2}\delta\left(\mu^{t+1}((R_{i}^ {t}-1)/\delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta)-n\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\right) \sum_{\ell=1}^{n}x_{i,\ell}^{t}(\mathbf{v}^{t})\right]+nc_{1}^{t}+nc_{2}^{t}. \tag{57}\]

Notice that the seller wants to maximize (57). First, notice that, since \(\phi_{i}^{t}(\cdot)\) is increasing by Assumption 1, if we allocate the item to group \(i\), we would allocate it to the buyer with the highest value which we denote its value by \(v_{i}^{t}=\max_{k}v_{i,k}^{t}\).

Now, we need to determine whether the item is allocated to the buyer with the highest value in group one or to the buyer with the highest value in the second group. Given (57), it is straightforward to see that the item is allocated to group one if

\[\phi_{1}^{t}(v_{1}^{t})-\phi_{2}^{t}(v_{2}^{t})\geq \tag{58}\] \[n\delta\left(\Delta_{1}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})-\Delta_{2}^{t}(R _{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\right)+\delta\left(\mu^{t+1}((R_{2}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{1}^{t} /\delta)-\mu^{t+1}((R_{1}^{t}-1)/\delta,R_{2}^{t}/\delta)\right),\]

and otherwise it is allocated to the second group. Notice that this allocation is indeed monotone, and hence, along with the above payment, it is an EPIC and IR allocation. This gives us the set \(G_{i}^{t}\) in the theorem's statement. Finally, to derive the update of interim functions, notice that the expected utility of seller follows from (57). The expected utility of buyers can also be derived from Claim 4 similar to the proof of Corollary 1.

#### a.6.1 Characterization of \(\zeta_{i}^{t}\)

Recall that \(c_{i}^{t}\) is given by

\[c_{i}^{t}=\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})\zeta_{i}^{t} \tag{59}\]

where

\[\zeta_{i}^{t}=\mathbb{E}_{\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t}}\left[\sum_{\ell\neq k}\tilde {x}_{i,\ell}^{t}(\mathbf{v}_{-(i,k)}^{t})\right] \tag{60}\]

is the probability of group \(i\) winning the object when they participate with one fewer buyer. Notice that, an argument similar to the one we made above implies that in the case where we have \(n-1\) buyers from group \(i\) and \(n\) buyers from the other group, group \(i\) wins the item if \((\max_{\ell\neq k}v_{i,\ell}^{t},\max_{\ell}v_{(-i),\ell}^{t})\in\tilde{G}_{i}^ {t}\) with

\[\tilde{G}_{i}^{t}:=\Big{\{}(v_{1},v_{2})\;\Big{|}\;\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i})-\phi_{-i }^{t}(v_{-i})\geq(n-1)\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})-n\delta\Delta_ {-i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})+(-1)^{i}\delta\Delta_{0}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t} )\Big{\}}.\]

As a result, we have

\[\zeta_{i}^{t}=\int_{\tilde{G}_{i}^{t}}d(F_{i}^{t}(v_{i}))^{n-1}(F_{-i}^{t}(v_{ -i}))^{n}. \tag{61}\]

#### a.6.2 Update of interim functions

The expected utility of seller follows from (57). The expected utility of buyers can also be derived from Claim 4 similar to the proof of Corollary 1. Hence, we have

\[\nu_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})=\frac{1}{n}\int_{G_{i}^{t}}\frac{1-F_{i}^{t}(v_ {i})}{f_{i}^{t}(v_{i})}dF_{\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v_{2})+\delta\nu_{i}^{t+1}(R _{i}^{t}/\delta,(R_{-i}^{t}-1)/\delta)-\delta\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t })\zeta_{i}^{t}, \tag{62a}\] \[\mu^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})=\] (62b) \[\sum_{i=1}^{2}\Bigg{(}\int_{G_{i}^{t}}\phi_{i}^{t}(v_{i}^{t})\;dF_ {\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v_{2})+\delta\mathbb{P}(G_{i}^{t})\mu^{t+1}((R_{i}^{t}-1)/ \delta,R_{-i}^{t}/\delta)+\delta n\Delta_{i}^{t}(R_{1}^{t},R_{2}^{t})(\zeta_{i} ^{t}-\mathbb{P}(G_{i}^{t}))\Bigg{)},\]

where the probability measure \(\mathbb{P}(\cdot)\) is taken with respect to the distribution \(F_{\text{max}}^{t}(v_{1},v_{2}):=F_{1}^{t}(v_{1})^{n}F_{2}^{t}(v_{2})^{n}\).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:21]

Since \({x^{\prime}}^{t}_{i}={x^{*}}^{t}_{i}\) for \(i\in[T_{0}]\), by Claim 5, it suffices to show

\[\sum_{t=T_{0}+1}^{T}\delta^{t-1}{x^{\prime}}^{t}_{i}\geq(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon) \sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T-1}\delta^{t}-\varepsilon(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\sum_{t=0}^{ T-1}\delta^{t} \tag{68}\]

Now, since \(\delta\in(0,1)\) and \(T\leq T_{0}\), we can observe that

\[\delta^{T_{0}}\frac{1-\delta^{T}}{1-\delta}\geq\frac{\delta^{T_{0}}-\delta^{T}} {1-\delta}\]

Substituting \(\delta_{0}^{T}=\varepsilon\) and recognizing these expressions as geometric series yields

\[\varepsilon\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\delta^{t}\geq\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T-1}\delta^{t}.\]

Now, noticing that \(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon\geq 0\) and rearranging, we see that

\[0\geq(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\sum_{t=T_{0}}^{T-1}\delta^{t}-\varepsilon(\alpha _{i}-\varepsilon)\sum_{t=0}^{T-1}\delta^{t}.\]

We reach the desired result of Equation (68) by noting that \(\delta^{t-1}{x^{*}}^{t}_{i}\geq 0\) for all \(t\) and we have shown that, over \(T\) rounds, \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) achieves a fairness level of at least \((1-\varepsilon)(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\).

Next, we consider the computational guarantee of \(x^{\prime}\). Since the fair allocation algorithm is recursive, its computational complexity increases exponentially in the number of rounds. In the approximation, we conduct exactly \(T_{0}\) rounds of the fair allocation, therefore, the computational complexity can be bounded as follows:

\[\mathcal{O}\left(2^{T_{0}}\right)\leq\mathcal{O}\left(e^{T_{0}}\right)=\mathcal{ O}\left(\varepsilon^{1/\log(\delta)}\right)=\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{ \varepsilon}^{\frac{1}{\log(1/\delta)}}\right)\]

Finally, we consider seller utility guarantees of \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\). First, we note that, by Claim 5, the seller utility up to time \(T_{0}\) under \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) is at least that of \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) up to \(T_{0}\) because the set of allocations over which \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) is optimal over the first \(T_{0}\) rounds in terms of seller utility is a subset of those allocations over which \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) is optimal. Second, since, under \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) we perform an unconstrained second-price auction in the remaining \(T-T_{0}\) rounds, it follows that \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\), must also guarantee a seller utility that is at least that of the optimal fair allocation \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) over the second interval. Therefore, \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) guarantees a seller utility that is at least that of \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) over all \(T\) rounds. \(\blacksquare\)

### Proof of proposition 4

First, we give the full proposition statement:

**Proposition 6**.: _Suppose Assumptions 1-3 hold and that \(\delta<1\). Then, for any \(\varepsilon\in(0,\min_{i}(\alpha_{i})),\beta>1-\delta\), there exists an approximation to the optimal allocation \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) with the following properties:_

1. \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) _satisfies the fairness constraint over all rounds at a level of at least_ \((1-\varepsilon)(1-\beta)^{2}(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\)_._
2. \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) _guarantees that the sellers total utility is at least_ \((1-\beta)\) _of that of the optimal allocation._
3. \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) _can be computed by calling the oracle_ \(\mathcal{O}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}^{\frac{1}{\delta}\log\left(\frac{1}{ \varepsilon}\right)+1}\right)\) _times._

Note that \(\varepsilon,\beta\) can be chosen to achieve a given \(c\leq\delta^{2}\) such that the proof statement in the body holds.

Now, we proceed with the proof by first defining \(x^{\prime\prime}\) as follows: As in the approximation \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime}\) presented in proposition 3, we assume under \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) that the fair auction runs over \(T_{0}\) rounds (the same value \(T_{0}\) which we detail later) where we partition these \(T_{0}\) rounds into \(T_{0}/\ell\) buckets of \(\ell\) rounds (we later also define \(\ell\) in detail) and approximate the discount factor as being constant within each bucket. Then, within each bucket, we recursively calculate the fair allocation at level \((1-\beta)(1-\alpha_{i})\) with respect to the approximated discontinuous discounting scheme. For the remaining \(T-T_{0}\) rounds, we conduct a standard second-price auction.

In particular, as before, we take \(T_{0}\coloneqq\frac{\log(\varepsilon)}{\log(\delta)}\) and we choose \(\ell\) such that \(\delta^{\ell}\simeq 1-\beta\). Without loss of generality, we assume \(T_{0}/\ell,\ell\) are integers. In the \(k\)th bucket, we approximate the discount factor of each round in the bucket with \(\delta^{k-1}\) for \(k\in[T_{0}/\ell]\).

Now, we characterize the allocation under \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) in relation to the exact fair allocation \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) as defined in the proof of proposition 3 to show its fairness guarantee. First, observe the following relationship between the true discount factors and those of the discontinuous discounting scheme in \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\):

\[\sum_{t=0}^{T_{0}-1}\delta^{t}\geq(1-\beta)\sum_{k=1}^{T_{0}/\ell}\ell\cdot \delta^{t(k-1)}. \tag{69}\]

Therefore, by Claim 5 and our construction of the discontinuous discounting scheme, \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) satisfies the fairness constraint at the level \((1-\beta)(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\) with respect to the discontinuous discounting scheme over the first \(T_{0}\) rounds, i.e.,

\[\sum_{k=0}^{T_{0}/\ell-1}\delta^{\ell k}\sum_{t=k\ell+1}^{k\ell}{x_{i}^{*}}^{t }\geq\sum_{t=1}^{T_{0}}\delta^{t-1}{x_{i}^{*}}^{t}\geq(1-\beta)(\alpha_{i}- \varepsilon)\sum_{k=1}^{T_{0}/\ell}\ell\cdot\delta^{\ell(k-1)}.\]

From here, we characterize \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) as the allocation such that, in the first \(T_{0}\) rounds, we perform the fair allocation procedure that satisfies fairness constraint at a level \((1-\beta)(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\) with respect to the discontinuous discounting scheme and a standard second-price auction in the remaining \(T-T_{0}\) rounds. It follows that \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) satisfies

\[\sum_{t=0}^{T_{0}-1}\delta^{t}{x_{i}^{\prime\prime}}^{t}\geq(1-\beta)\sum_{k=0 }^{T_{0}/\ell-1}\delta^{\ell k}\sum_{t=k\ell+1}^{k\ell}{x_{i}^{\prime\prime}}^ {t}\geq(1-\beta)^{2}(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\sum_{t=0}^{T_{0}-1}\delta^{t}.\]

In other words, over the first \(T_{0}\) rounds, \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) satisfies the fairness constraint at a level of at least \((1-\beta)^{2}(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\) with respect to the original discounting scheme. By the same manner as the proof of proposition 3, it follows that, over \(T\) rounds, \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) guarantees fairness at the level at least \((1-\varepsilon)(1-\beta)^{2}(\alpha_{i}-\varepsilon)\). Finally, by (69) and the same logic as the proof of proposition 3, we conclude that the seller's utility is at least \((1-\beta)\) that of \(\mathbf{x}^{*}\) under \(\mathbf{x}^{\prime\prime}\) over \(T\) rounds. \(\blacksquare\)

### Experiment Details

Here, we provide the full results of the experimentation summarized in the body of the paper.6 For each combination of \(\alpha_{1}\), \(\alpha_{2}\) and each value of \(T=2,3,4,\) we compute 10,000 iterations of the seller-optimal allocation satisfying the fairness constraint at level \(\alpha_{i}\) for group \(i\in[2]\) over 2 rounds with discount factor \(\delta=0.99\). Also note that buyer values are distributed as follows: \(v_{1}^{t}\sim\text{Uniform}(0.5,1.5)\), and \(v_{2}^{t}\sim\text{Uniform}(0,1)\) for \(t\in[T],T=2,3,4\). It is useful to note that, in the seller-optimal unconstrained mechanism, groups 1 and 2 are allocated the item with probabilities \(0.69\) and \(0.31\), respectively. Our implementation maintains all key assumptions outlined in the presentation of the mechanism. We report the difference in mean utility of the seller, group 1, and group 2 that satisfies the fairness constraint specified by a particular \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}\) relative to the utility of the optimal unconstrained mechanism satisfying assumption 2 (i.e. the optimal fair mechanism at level \(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2}=0\)). Standard errors are reported for each value in Tables 1-6 and reflect the standard error of the mean which assumes sample independence.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The introduction and abstract accurately describe that the paper presents the optimal static mechanism for allocating an indivisible good among two groups that guarantees each group a minimum specified allocation probability, extends this result to the dynamic setting, and presents approximations for and experimentation of these optimal mechanisms. The introduction and abstract also identify the setup and key assumptions of these results. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Throughout the paper, modeling assumptions are stated clearly which make clear the limitations of our results. For instance, our results assume regularity of the value distributions (i.e., virtual value is increasing) as well as the independence of realized values where lifting these assumptions is the topic of future work. The computational complexity of the optimal mechanism that we present as well as the approximations that follow are presented clearly. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness.

* While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper clearly states or references the full set of assumptions of each result. A complete proof of each result is included in either the body of the paper or the appendix and a proof sketch is provided in the body of the paper when the full proof is included in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The paper provides the full details of the experimental procedure as well as the code to recreate the results of the experiment including all figures and tables. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. * If the contribution is not relevant, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:28]

7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We report standard errors of our experiments in the appendix along with relevant details and assumptions. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.) * The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors). * It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean. * It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified. * For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates). * If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provide hardware specifications, runtime, and memory for all experimentation in the appendix. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics [https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?](https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines?) Answer: [Yes] Justification: This work conforms, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics.

* If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics.
* The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We identify the broader societal impacts of our work in the introduction where we outline relevant applications and motivation for considering for fairness in resource allocation. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations. * The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster. * The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology. * If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: We release no such data or models. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets**Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [NA] Justification: We do not use existing assets. Guidelines:

* The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets.
* The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset.
* The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL.
* The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset.
* For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided.
* If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset.
* For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.
* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
13. **New Assets** Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The optimal allocation mechanism that we introduce is specified in full detail, as are the approximations to this mechanism. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets. * Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc. * The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used. * At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
14. **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects** Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve crowdsourcing not research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper. * According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.

15. **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects** Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: Our work does not involve crowsourcing not research with human subjects. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. * Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper. * We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution. * For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
