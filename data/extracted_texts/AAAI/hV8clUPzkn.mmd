###### Abstract

Keyword-based search engines often fail in retrieving information that aligns with user query intent, due to variations in keywords and phrasing in scientific literature. This paper introduces an encephalitis query-document dataset, characterized by its high semantic variability. Our dataset comprises thousands of query-document pairs. To represent the diverse linguistic expressions found in encephalitis research, we leveraged the advanced language understanding capabilities of GPT-4 to generate queries that, while conceptually aligned with the information in the documents, significantly differ in phrasing and terminology. This approach addresses a critical need in scientific literature searches - retrieving pertinent information that might be overlooked due to conventional keyword-based search limitations.

To evaluate the efficacy of our dataset, we trained a specialized transformer model capable of converting these query-document pairs into embeddings. Our results demonstrate a significant improvement in retrieving relevant encephalitis research papers, especially those that are not surfaced by traditional search engines like PubMed. This enhanced retrieval performance not only underscores the potential of embedding-based retrieval in medical literature search, but also opens up new avenues for comprehensive literature exploration. The implications of our findings extend beyond encephalitis studies, suggesting broader applicability for similar methodologies in other specialized fields of research.

## 1 Introduction

Encephalitis research, like many medical fields, suffers from information retrieval challenges, often due to the semantic gap in traditional search engines. The field of encephalitis research, akin to many areas within the medical sciences, is fraught with information retrieval (IR) challenges that significantly impede the progress of research and clinical understanding. Encephalitis, characterized by the inflammation of the brain, presents a wide spectrum of causes, manifestations, and treatments, making the search for accurate and relevant scientific literature a daunting task. Traditional search engines, often fall short when tasked with bridging the semantic gap inherent in scientific queries and the documents that contain their answers. This discrepancy arises from the diverse linguistic expressions authors may use to describe similar concepts, coupled with the highly specific and nuanced nature of medical terminology. Consequently, researchers and clinicians face substantial hurdles in accessing literature that precisely matches their inquiry, potentially overlooking critical insights that reside beyond the reach of keyword-based search algorithms.

In recent years, lots of research has been going towards embeddings based retrieval to address the limitations of keyword based searches . In this paper, we describe an approach of leveraging the language understanding capabilities of GPT-4 to create a semantically varied encephalitis query-document dataset.

## 2 Dataset and Training Methodology:

Our dataset, accessible on Hugging Face , includes 53.1k rows of PMC passages and PubMed abstracts, Each with several queries. The release dates of the papers spans January 2000 to July 2023. Utilizing the ChatGPT API, we created semantically varied queries for each text passage and abstract in our dataset, ensuring a wide representation of linguistic expressions.

The dataset was trained over using a contrastive loss function, with a batch size of 32, over 10 epochs. Each document in the dataset is associated with several queries, and one was selected at random to create each query-document pair. The base model used is the ncbi/MedCPIT-Article-Encoder transformer from the National Center for Biotechnology Information . The resultant retrieval model, hosted on Hugging Face , demonstrates improvements over traditional search methods.

A Google Colab demo , which downloads the models and papers then loads and sets up the search system, can be used by anyone to perform queries on 513k PMC passages and 47.7k PubMed abstracts, whose release dates range from January 2000 to December 2023.

## 3 Performance Evaluation and Case Studies

Our model's performance, evaluated against traditional PubMed searches, demonstrates its ability to retrieve relevant information that PubMed fails to retrieve. This includes instances where our model identified significant research papers and insights from queries where PubMed yielded zero results. Detailed examples of these comparative analyses are provided in the Appendix, illustrating the model's capacity in handling semantically varied queries.

## 4 Conclusion

Our model demonstrates a significant improvement over traditional keyword-based searches. By leveraging the semantic variance understanding of large language models for dataset creation, we offer an model for encoding and retrieving encephalitis research. Our approach not only improves access to encephalitis literature but also suggests a broader applicability for similar methodologies in other fields facing challenges in semantic variance and information retrieval.
