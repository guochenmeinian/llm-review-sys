###### Abstract

Though syllogistic reasoning is the most widespread and most well-known reasoning, its machine implementation is still an open problem. The widespread modus ponens formalization does not fully capture every reasoning steps that required to reach a syllogistic conclusion. This paper demonstrates that more information and knowledge discovery are necessary to complete a syllogistic reasoning. This paper also demonstrates how a knowledge discovery could be integrated into a syllogistic reasoning.

## Introduction

Syllogistic reasoning is a diverse reasoning family, which can be found in most of logical reasoning. The faculty of knowledge discovery plays a crucial role in syllogistic reasoning, but it is not demonstrated in most of formalizations. The reason is the knowledge discovery is something indemonstratable. This paper analyzes four typical syllogistic reasoning by causal analysis to show how the knowledge discovery participated in complete reasoning.

## A simple syllogistic reasoning

We say "A is B" and "B is C", then we conclude "A is C". Then the essential nature of syllogism is the formal cause (\(\)) of this demonstration, the formal cause introduces term (1) and (2), like:

\[&>&\\ &\]

The conclusion is:

\[\]

Obviously, the middle term is B. The substitution demonstration and transform is from (1)B to (2)B:

\[\]

It is a self-evident demonstration, because the middle-term transform "(1)B\(\ \ (2)\)B" is self-contained. All knowledge required are already exist in (1) and (2). Whilst, the (1) and (2) are introduced by a common formal cause.

However, this simple syllogism is not a scientific syllogism, also it does not involves knowledge discovery. A scientific syllogism must contains something indemonstrable, this indemonstrable is grasped by knowledge discovery.

## A widespread syllogism

By contrary, the widespread syllogism involves noetic knowledge and needs knowledge discovery, as it is not self-sufficient.

At first, we may designate a formal cause (syllogism\(\ >\)) for this syllogism, which initially only contains two terms (premises): (5) and (6).

\[&>&\\ &\\ &\]

To conclude term (7), there must exist an (extra) intellectual transform, which is a progression from universal to particular:

\[{``all men" (5) \

true. Whether it is true, it depends on the "genus". Because only the "genus" can decide (know) whether "every instance of the genus has" or "not has". If it is true then the (13) term could be returned, if not true then the (13) term does not exist. Also, the (13) is a first principle from knowledge discovery.

Similar to all above cases, the final conclusion (12) is a direct result of (10) and (13), but not (10) and (11). There is no direct middle term between (10) and (11).

## Conclusion

This paper provides a concise analysis regarding knowledge discovery in syllogistic reasoning. Though knowledge discovery is indemonstrable process for syllogistic reasoning, it is tractable through efficient cause. Also, it is able to be integrated into syllogistic reasoning as efficient premise. Knowledge discovery may be in diverse forms and implemented by various methods. When it is connected with syllogistic reasoning, this causal relationship is invariant.
