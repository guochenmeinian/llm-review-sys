from people who will never post in the ADHD subreddit vs. people who will post in the ADHD subreddit. In the Appendix, we expand on comorbid ADHD and anxiety, and using learned classifiers on mental health-related text.

## Data Collection

Text data was collected from the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits on Reddit. Although Reddit posts are not formal clinical diagnoses, Reddit data offers advantages such as being immediately and publicly available, including a timeframe to track historical data, and anonymous posts documenting vulnerable first-person experiences .

All posts were scraped from the Anxiety and ADHD subreddits from the dates February 16, 2020 to Nov 28, 2022.

### Data Preprocessing

The data was cleaned by removing empty or removed posts. The data was filtered to only contain posts from users that only ever posted in the Anxiety subreddit or who first posted on the Anxiety subreddit only then in the ADHD subreddit.

For users who started posting in the ADHD subreddit eventually, we only kept posts from the Anxiety subreddit that were posted 6 months or more before the first post in the ADHD subreddit. No posts from the ADHD subreddit were used.

In total, 47482 posts were downloaded from the ADHD and Anxiety subreddits. 33% were retained for the test set.

## Models

### Baseline Model

Our baseline models were regularized logistic regression and binomial Naive Bayes.

#### Transformer Model

We fine-tuned the pre-trained RoBERTa model from HuggingFace  with the RoBERTa tokenizer, the cross-entropy loss function, the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of \(1e-5\), and a dropout layer with \(p=0.3\).

## Results

### Baseline Results

With a baserate of 50%, the best logistic regression model achieved a correct classification rate of 54% and the best Naive Bayes model achieved a correct classification rate of 59%.

As seen, Logistic Regression models performed at 54% accuracy and Naive Bayes performed at \(58.6\%\) accuracy. Attributing to its performance, as seen in Figure 6, the majority of samples fell correctly into the true positive and true negative class.

### RoBERTa Results

With a test set baserate of 50%, the RoBERTa model achieved a correct classification rate of 76%.

### Discussion

Our results demonstrate that, for posts in the Anxiety subreddit, it is possible to predict which posts come from people who will later post in the ADHD subreddit as well from posts that come from people who will not, without using any information "from the future."

Further, we have shown that keyword-based methods, Naive Bayes and logistic regression, are not sufficient for this task, while it is possible to make progress with RoBERTa. This indicates that complex cues can be used to detect which posters will later post in the ADHD subreddit.

## Experiments with explainability

One application of our trained classifier is obtaining further insight into the relationship between anxiety disorders and ADHD.

To enable qualitative analysis, we have experimented with visualizing the reason that the RoBERTa classifier outputs "will post in ADHD" or "will not post in ADHD" for a given post. We visualize the difference in output caused by masking out each individual word and each individual phrase in the post.

Aggregate analysis will be available in the future.

## Conclusions

We present a novel task: predicting whether internet text that comes from a person discussing their anxiety comes from a person who in the future will also discuss ADHD. We demonstrate that this task is not solvable using keyword-based methods, while it progress can be made using RoBERTa.

The immediate application of our method is for obtaining qualitative insight into the connection between anxiety and ADHD by visualizing the reason that the RoBERTa classifier outputs "will post in ADHD" or "will not post in ADHD" for a given post.
