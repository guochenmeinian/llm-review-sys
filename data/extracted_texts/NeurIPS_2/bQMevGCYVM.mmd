###### Abstract

We introduce VideoLISA, a video-based multimodal large language model designed to tackle the problem of language-instructed reasoning segmentation in videos. Leveraging the reasoning capabilities and world knowledge of large language models, and augmented by the Segment Anything Model, VideoLISA generates temporally consistent segmentation masks in videos based on language instructions. Existing image-based methods, such as LISA, struggle with video tasks due to the additional temporal dimension, which requires temporal dynamic understanding and consistent segmentation across frames. VideoLISA addresses these challenges by integrating a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy into the video-LLM, which balances temporal context and spatial detail within computational constraints. Additionally, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach using a specially designed <TRK> token, enabling the model to segment and track objects across multiple frames. Extensive evaluations on diverse benchmarks, including our newly introduced ReasonVOS benchmark, demonstrate VideoLISA's superior performance in video object segmentation tasks involving complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking. While optimized for videos, VideoLISA also shows promising generalization to image segmentation, revealing its potential as a unified foundation model for language-instructed object segmentation. Code and model will be available at: [https://github.com/showlab/VideoLISA](https://github.com/showlab/VideoLISA).

## 1 Introduction

We live in a dynamic world. Localizing objects of interest in videos according to human intent is a crucial task for intelligent models and systems. Language, as a natural interface, serves as the primary reference for identifying target objects. However, language expressions vary widely across different scenarios, presenting varying levels of difficulty. While category names are straightforward references, detailed text descriptions from tasks like referring segmentation  introduce greater complexity. In real-world applications, these expressions can be more complex, involving intent understanding, reasoning, and world knowledge, making them more user-friendly yet significantly more challenging for models to understand and act upon.

Recent advancements in the image domain have shown progress in language-instructed reasoning for detection and segmentation tasks. Models leveraging multimodal large language models (MLLMs), such as those in DetGPT  and LISA , have demonstrated the ability to localize target objects by harnessing the implicit reasoning capabilities and world knowledge embedded in large language models (LLMs). However, these advancements have not seamlessly translated to video tasks, particularly video object segmentation (VOS). The primary challenge in VOS stems from the additional temporal dimension, which introduces complexities absent in static images. VOS requiresmodels to 1) on the input side, capture and comprehend the temporal dynamics present in the video; and 2) on the output side, predict temporally consistent segmentation masks across frames. These challenges render existing image-based methods inadequate for handling video tasks.

In this work, we introduce VideoLISA, a video-based MLLM designed to address language-instructed reasoning segmentation in videos. Our goal is to segment target objects throughout the entire video based on diverse language queries that necessitate scene understanding, temporal comprehension, and implicit reasoning. Drawing inspiration from previous works , we employ an LLM to inherit its complex reasoning capabilities and adopt the Segment Anything Model (SAM)  to produce segmentation masks. To overcome the unique challenges presented by video data, we propose two key innovations: a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy and a One-Token-Seg-All approach.

To equip the model with video temporal understanding ability, it is necessary to involve multiple frames. Processing visual features from all sampled frames in full feature resolution is computationally prohibitive due to the large number of tokens. In pursuit of efficiency, reducing the frame number would limit the perception of temporal dynamics while down-sampling frame features would lose visual details that are essential for dense prediction tasks exemplified by segmentation. Our intuition is that adjacent frames in videos usually share similar visual contents and features. Therefore, we leverage this inherent _temporal redundancy_ in videos and propose the Sparse Dense Sampling strategy. It uniformly samples a set of dense frames, preserving full-resolution features (_dense_ tokens), and down-samples the remaining interleaved frames to lower resolution (_sparse_ tokens). Dense tokens provide detailed visual information needed for accurate segmentation, while sparse tokens capture the temporal context, ensuring that the model remains aware of motion and changes over time. This balance allows the model to construct a coherent spatiotemporal narrative without excessive computational demands.

For achieving temporal consistency in segmentation, instead of handling separate representations for each frame, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach. Prior arts  reveal that one compact representation can potentially associate the same object across video frames. In this work, we design a special <TRK> token to segment and track target objects across multiple frames. Specifically, we incorporate the <TRK> token into the model's vocabulary and utilize its last hidden embedding in the LLM to prompt the mask decoder to produce segmentation masks. We improve the temporal consistency from two aspects. First, when generating the <TRK> token, the model'sees' the video content through the temporal module, which serves as the information foundation for cross-frame association. In addition, during training, the <TRK> token is intentionally trained to segment multiple frames simultaneously, preventing the model from learning shortcuts that focus only on spatial information of a certain frame. During inference, a single <TRK> token can segment and track objects across an entire video. The <TRK> token acts as a unified spatiotemporal representation, encapsulating object information across multiple frames and reducing the complexity of handling multiple prompts.

We evaluate our model on a comprehensive range of public benchmarks, including standard video/image referring segmentation, motion-guided video segmentation, and image reasoning segmentation. To further assess the model's capabilities in complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking, we introduce the ReasonVOS benchmark. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Although our model is particularly designed for videos, experiments show that it generalizes well on images, making it a potential foundation model for unified language instructed object segmentation. Our contributions are:

* Sparse Dense Sampling Strategy: We devise a sampling strategy for video-LLM training that achieves a balance between temporal context length and spatial visual detail under computational constraints. This strategy is shown to be effective for spatiotemporal dense prediction tasks, exemplified by video object segmentation.
* One-Token-Seg-All Approach: We design an effective approach for temporal consistent object segmentation in videos by utilizing a special <TRK> token. This strategy demonstrates robust performance in video object segmentation, leveraging the video-LLM learning module and a specially designed training objective.
* VideoLISA Model: We propose VideoLISA, a video-LLM that democratizes reasoning segmentation to videos. Additionally, we introduce the ReasonVOS benchmark, focusing on complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object movements. This benchmark, along with a range of public benchmarks, comprehensively validates our model's performance.

### Video Object Segmentation

In computer vision, video object segmentation is a well-studied task . Specifically, referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment the target object mentioned in a natural language expression in a video [59; 8; 63; 69; 35; 64; 49]. Compared with image segmentation, RVOS is more challenging since both the action and appearance of the referred object must be segmented in a video. Gavrilyuk et al. (2018) were the first to propose the RVOS task and the A2D-Sentences benchmark . This field continues to evolve with new benchmarks emerge such as Ref-DAVIS-17 , Ref-YouTube-VOS , and MeViS . Many previous studies have primarily adapted referring image segmentation approaches for frame-by-frame object segmentation. For example, URVOS  and RefVOS  utilize cross-modal attention for per-frame segmentation. Some recent works, such as ReferFormer  and MTTR , employ a DETR-like structure, which simplifies the referring pipeline and achieves impressive performance. R2VOS  enhances multi-modal alignment through text reconstruction. OnlineRefer  proposes an online model with explicit query propagation. SgMg  proposes a segment-and-optimize paradigm to solve the feature drift issue. Despite the impressive results achieved by these methods, several challenges remain. First, most existing methods are deficient in comprehending the motion information in videos and languages, as revealed by the recent MeViS  benchmark. Second, there are few studies on complex reasoning-based segmentation in the video domain, both methodologically and benchmark-wise.

### Multimodal Large Language Model

The remarkable advancements of large language models (LLMs) motivate the research community to extend the foundational capabilities of LLMs to the visual domain, leading to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) [70; 4]. The pioneering works of MLLMs, such as LLaVA , MiniGPT-4 , and InstructBLIP , exhibit impressive visual understanding capabilities, including image captioning [60; 3] and visual question answering. When extending into the video domain, a prominent issue is handling the temporal dimension. One straightforward approach is to concatenate the tokens from multiple frames , though the temporal length might be limited by computational resources. To address this, one line of work [47; 27; 26] explores pooling (merging) strategies to reduce the number of tokens, such as pooling along the spatial and temporal dimensions separately , token merging based on similarity , and pooling with different strengths at a slow-fast pace . Another line of work [34; 71; 36] utilizes the Q-former  architecture to extract abstracted features, which greatly reduces the number of tokens.

More recently, some studies have further integrated region-level image understanding and grounding abilities into MLLMs. Kosmos-2  and Shikra  directly quantize bounding boxes into discrete location tokens or numeric representations of positions. GPT4RoI  uses a simple pooling operation to extract features within boxes or masks as the region representations. Another line of work leverages the reasoning ability of MLLMs and resorts to off-the-shelf models for localization. For example, DetGPT  utilizes a pre-trained LLM and an open-vocabulary object detector to detect the target object based on human intent described in natural language. LISA  proposes the task of image reasoning segmentation and connects an MLLM and the Segment Anything (SAM)  model using a special token to produce fine-grained segmentation masks. Built based on LISA, PixelLM  exhibits unique advantages in handling multiple objects in the reasoning segmentation task. Although these works have achieved impressive performance in image tasks, they are still incapable of processing videos. For object segmentation in videos, very few studies have leveraged the reasoning ability of LLMs to overcome current limitations. PG-Video-LLaVA  utilizes off-the-shelf object detector and tracker to obtain the target objects first and then match it with the entities mentioned in the generated text. TrackGPT  makes a straightforward extension of LISA by iteratively updating the special token with video progresses. However, the absence of video learning module significantly limits its perception and reasoning of temporal dynamics.

## 3 Method

The task of language-instructed reasoning segmentation in videos can be formally defined as follows. Given a video \(_{}\) and a language expression \(_{}\), the model takes both as input and outputs the pixel-level segmentation masks \(\) for all frames. \(_{}\) is a free-form text that particularly emphasizes implicit intent reasoning, world knowledge, and video temporal dynamics.

### Architecture

Fig. 1 illustrates the model architecture. It consists of a visual tokenizer, an LLM, a vision encoder, and a promptable mask decoder. We omit the text tokenizer in the LLM for simplicity. The visual tokenizer and LLM are initialized from LLaVA . The vision encoder and mask decoder are initialized from SAM . Given a video, we first uniformly sample \(T_{}\) frames and encode them into visual tokens via the visual tokenizer, resulting in \(T_{} L\) tokens in total. Ideally, larger \(T_{}\) would be better for capturing temporal dynamics. However, it is prohibitive to let the LLM process such a large number of tokens. Thus, we develop the Sparse Dense Sampling strategy to reduce the number of tokens, which will be elaborated in Sec. 3.2. After that, the visual tokens are concatenated with text tokens and fed into the LLM.

To equip the LLM with segmentation capabilities, following previous work , we extend the vocabulary of the LLM with a special token <TRK>. During generation, this special token carries rich semantic information from the text prompt and video content, providing signals for decoding pixel-level segmentation masks. Specifically, we extract the last layer embedding corresponding to the <TRK> token and transform it into a prompt embedding with a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). At the same time, the vision encoder extracts per-frame features from the video. Finally, the prompt embedding and the visual features are processed by the mask decoder to produce the segmentation masks. Note that for one video, there is only one prompt embedding that is in charge of all the frames. The One-Token-Seg-All approach will be introduced in Sec. 3.3.

### Sparse Dense Sampling

Given the \(T_{} L\) tokens, we aim to reduce the number of tokens while preserving enough spatial details and temporal dynamics. Therefore, we further sample \(T_{}\) frames out of \(T_{}\) frames. The visual tokens of the \(T_{}\) frames are all preserved in full resolution, _i.e., dense_ tokens. Then, we apply global average pooling on the \(T_{}\) frames to reduce them to low resolution, _i.e., sparse_ tokens. In our implementation, each frame is represented by only one token. Finally, the total number of tokens is reduced to \(T_{}+T_{} L\), which is significantly smaller than \(T_{} L\). The rationale behind this strategy is the inherent temporal redundancy in video data. By exploiting this, we reduce the computational burden without losing critical information. The dense tokens provide visual details for their adjacent sparse frames, while the sparse tokens capture the temporal dynamics for the dense frames. In Sec. 2.2, we have discussed several popular temporal learning strategies in video-LLM. Although they exhibit remarkable performance in general video understanding tasks, our empirical studies (see Tab. 5) demonstrate that these popular strategies are not seamlessly transferable to video object segmentation. This is likely because they either lose spatial details or temporal information, both of which are essential in dense prediction tasks in videos.

Figure 1: Framework of our approach.

### One Token Seg All

As shown in Fig. 1, throughout the video, we use a single special <TRK> token for segmenting all the frames. We provide an in-depth analysis of the rationale behind this approach. In our model, the promptable segmentation model is initialized from SAM, in which the decoder takes the prompt embedding and visual features as inputs and outputs masks. Our intuition is that _segmenting one object in multiple frames can be regarded as segmenting multiple regions (instances) in one image grid._ From this perspective, SAM  itself already has the potential to segment objects across multiple frames, _if the prompt is properly given._ Previous works [21; 7; 20] have shown that one compact representation has the potential to associate the same entity across video frames. For example, from the perspective of object tracking , the prompt embedding can be regarded as a semantic kernel while the visual features are the context to be contrasted. This motivates us to explore whether one prompt embedding is capable of tracking under the promptable decoding paradigm of SAM.

To answer this question, one key problem is whether the prompt embedding contains enough semantic information to serve as the kernel. In SAM, its own prompt encoder mainly accepts visual prompts, such as points, boxes, and masks. In videos, the object moves dynamically. Our pilot study in Fig. 2 shows that visual prompts quickly fail in the presence of object motion. This is expected since these visual prompts heavily rely on the object's spatial location. We then explore the prompt embedding produced by an image reasoning segmentation model, LISA , which employs a LLM and is trained with segmentation data. It can be expected that its prompt embedding should contain more semantic information, at least significantly more than that of the visually instructed prompt. The second row of Fig. 2 validates this hypothesis by applying one prompt embedding to multiple frames. Compared to box prompts, the prompt embedding from LISA shows improved resilience to object movement, as demonstrated in the first three frames. However, when the object's motion becomes larger and a distractor object appears, the segmentation fails again, drifting to another object nearby.

We identify two primary factors that account for the failure. Firstly, the input of LISA model only has one frame, which contains very limited temporal information. Therefore, the generated prompt embedding lacks the information required for cross-frame association. Secondly, during the training of LISA, the prompt embedding is trained to segment only one frame. This potentially allows it to learn a shortcut that merely encompasses positional information, rather than learning the semantic information that generalizes across frames. In our work, the approach of using one token to segment multiple frames has been developed by addressing these issues accordingly. Firstly, the Sparse Dense Sampling-based temporal learning module provides spatiotemporal information of the video. The model'sees' the video content, which is the foundation of mask association. Furthermore, during training, we intentionally train the <TRK> token to segment multiple frames. This objective would enforce the token to learn more'semantic' information that can be used as the semantic kernel and segment the target object across frames. The last row of Fig. 2 presents the segmentation and tracking produced by the <TRK> token in our VideoLISA.

### Training and Inference

**Training Data.** The training data for our model mainly consists of two parts: 1) image segmentation and 2) video segmentation. For the image part, we follow the setting of LISA . For the video data, we employ video object segmentation (VOS) and referring video segmentation data (RVOS).

Figure 2: Exploration of One-Token-Seg-All approach.

During pre-processing, we fill the original category name or referring expression in the dataset into a template. For example: "USER: <VIDEO> Can you segment {description} in this scene? ASSISTANT: Sure, it is <TRK>.", where {description} is the placeholder to fill. For VOS data that contain videos with multi-class labels, we randomly choose one class and merge all the masks belonging to this class into one binary mask.

**Training Objective.** The model is trained end-to-end using the text generation loss \(_{}\) and segmentation loss \(_{}\). The segmentation loss consists of per-pixel binary cross-entropy (BCE) loss and DICE loss. The final loss is computed as the weighted sum of the three losses. For video training, we compute the segmentation loss on the sampled \(T_{}\) frames in parallel and average them.

**Inference.** During inference, given a video, \(T_{}\) and \(T_{}\) frames are sampled similarly to training, except that the \(T_{}\) frames are uniformly sampled from \(T_{}\) rather than randomly. After obtaining the <TRK> token from the LLM, we feed all the frames of the video into the mask decoder one by one, using the same <TRK> token to segment each frame, yielding a list of masks.

**Post optimization.** Among these frames, the \(T_{}\) frames are seen in full resolution by the model, making their segmentation masks more reliable and accurate. For the remaining frames, although the One-Token-Seg-All strategy exhibits impressive cross-frame segmentation performance, our empirical observations indicate it inevitably suffers from low mask quality, likely limited by the inherent capability of the SAM model. Thus, we employ post-optimization as an optional step to further enhance mask quality. Specifically, we take XMem++  as the post-optimization approach. Compared to XMem , which propagates one mask through the video, XMem++ distinguishes itself by taking multiple'reliable' masks as reference and inferring the masks of the remaining frames. This paradigm is naturally suitable for our method since the \(T_{}\) frames span uniformly across the video, providing long-range yet diverse masks as references.

## 4 Benchmark

The versatile abilities of our model can be evaluated using public benchmarks that assess various aspects. RVOS benchmarks  evaluate temporal-related abilities, involving referring expression comprehension, video temporal understanding, and temporal consistent segmentation. Complex reasoning abilities can be assessed by the image-based reasoning segmentation benchmark . However, there is still a lack of a benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the reasoning segmentation abilities of videos. Towards this goal, we have organized the _ReasonVOS_ benchmark. Specifically, we annotate language expressions based on the videos and mask annotations from existing datasets, including MOSE , MeViS , VIPSge , and BURST . The criteria for data collection and annotation processes are as follows. Each language expression should encompass at least one of the following aspects: 1) complex reasoning, 2) world knowledge, 3) temporal dynamics. For the video and mask selection, objects with explicit movement are highly prioritized to evaluate the temporal consistency of masks. As a result, we manually annotated 105 samples as initial seed data. Following previous practices , we use a LLM to rephrase the language expressions for augmentation and perform another round of human checking. The resulting ReasonVOS benchmark comprises 458 video-instruction-mask data samples. This benchmark is specifically designed for zero-shot evaluation purposes, as the reasoning ability is embedded in the LLM and can be triggered by existing image-based reasoning segmentation data.

## 5 Experiments

### Experimental Setting

**Datasets** Our model is trained on a variety of segmentation datasets. The image-based datasets include 1) semantic segmentation: ADE20K , COCO-Stuff , PACO-LVIS , and PASCAL-Part ; 2) referring segmentation: refCLEF, refCOCO, refCOCO+ , and refCOCOg ; 3) reason segmentation: 239 ReasonSeg samples from LISA . The video-based datasets we use include: 1) semantic VOS: YouTube-VOS ; 2) referring VOS: Refer-YouTube-VOS  and MeViS . The evaluation benchmarks will be elaborated in the corresponding experiment sections.

**Implementation Details** We implement our model with LLaVA-Phi-3-V , a multimodal LLM based on Phi-3  with 3.8B parameters. We adopt the vision encoder and mask decoder from SAM . We conduct joint training using both image and video datasets. For video data, we set \(T_{}=32\) and \(T_{}=4\) according to our GPU memory. For image data, we duplicate the images as pseudo video data. We freeze the visual tokenizer and vision encoder, train the LLM with LoRA  and train the mask decoder with full finetuning. We train our model using 64 NVIDIA 24G A10 GPUs with a distributed training script based on DeepSpeed . We use the AdamW  optimizer with the learning rate and weight decay set to 0.0003 and 0, respectively. We also adopt WarmupDecayLR as the learning rate scheduler, with the warmup iterations set to 100. The weights of the text generation loss (\(_{}\)) and the mask loss (\(_{}\)) are both set to 1.0. The weights of the BCE loss (\(_{}\)) and the DICE loss (\(_{}\)) are set to 2.0 and 0.5, respectively. The per-device batch size is set to 2. For ablation studies, the total number of iterations is \(3,000\) and each experiment takes around 10 hours. For the final model used for comparison, we scale up the training to \(6,000\) iterations, which takes 20 hours.

**Evaluation Metrics** For image-based evaluation, we adopt two metrics commonly used in previous works [28; 31]: gloU and cloU. gloU is defined by the average of all per-image Intersection-over-Unions (IoUs), while cloU is defined by the cumulative intersection over the cumulative union. For video-based evaluation, we follow previous practices [64; 63] and use region similarity (J), contour accuracy (F), and their average value (J&F).

### Evaluation on Video Tasks

#### 5.2.1 Referring Video Object Segmentation

We adopt two benchmarks of standard referring video object segmentation. Ref-Youtube-VOS is evaluated on the official challenge server 2. Ref-DAVIS-17 is evaluated by the official evaluation code 3. The evaluation results are shown in Tab. 1. Our method demonstrates competitive performance on both benchmarks, achieving comparable or superior results to existing methods. For Refer-DAVIS-17, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming all the other methods by a considerable margin. In Refer-YouTube-VOS, our method performs well compared to traditional RVOS methods, achieving a high rank. State-of-the-art methods, such as SgMg , achieve remarkable performance, thanks to its dedicated video backbones, such as Video-Swin . However, among LLM-based methods with reasoning ability, our model, despite having only 3.8B parameters, outperforms other methods with much larger LLMs, such as LISA-13B and TrackGPT-13B.

#### 5.2.2 Motion-guided Video Object Segmentation

We further evaluate our model on motion-guided VOS using the MeViS  benchmark. Consistent with previous studies [14; 24], we evaluate our model's performance on the validation set of the MeViS benchmark. The results in Tab. 2 demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in this benchmark, outperforming previous methods by a large margin. We attribute this performance

### Ablation Studies

We conduct ablation studies on various design choices of our model. The detailed experiment results are provided in the appendix. Here, we summarize the main takeaways for each study.

**Ablation of temporal learning module.** In this study of Tab. 5, we compare our Sparse Dense Sampling strategy with various design choices, including LISA  finetuned on videos, Q-Former  architecture inherited from LLaMA-VID , one straightforward solution that directly concatenate visual tokens from multiple frames (\(n\)-frame), a strategy that pools along spatial and temporal dimension separately (ST Pooling), a strategy that pools each frame with different strengths in a slow-fast pace. The comparison of the experiment results shows that our Sparse Dense Sampling strategy outperforms other video-LLM training (sampling) strategies. In addition to demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, this study also reveals the unique properties of the VOS task. On the one hand, it requires detailed visual information for accurate segmentation, which makes the pooling-based strategies yield inferior results. On the other hand, temporal information is also necessary for the model to comprehend motions and behaviors, as validated by the comparison between \(n\)-frame and ours.

**Ablation of temporal association module.** The main takeaway of this part, as shown in Table 5, lies in the comparison between our method and extensions of image-based LISA. Specifically, we upgrade LISA to fit the VOS task by 1) (baseline) using one <SEG> token from the first frame to segment subsequent frames, 2) marrying LISA with an off-the-shelf tracking model. With the help of the tracker, LISA performs clearly better than the baseline, while still performs worse than our method. The main issue comes from that without perception of the video, the model is incapable of processing queries that are concerned with the full video content and temporal dynamic. We further quantify the effect of the One-Token-Seg-All approach by contrasting it with a strawman setting, One-Token-Seg-One. The comparison clearly validates the effect and necessity of the One-Token-Seg-All approach.

## 6 Limitation and Future Work

Despite the remarkable performance shown on various benchmarks, our model still has limitations. We discuss them in this section to inspire future work. First, our model exhibits deficiencies in computational efficiency. Although we have already reduced the size of LLM to 3.8B, which is much smaller than previous models (7B, 13B), it still incurs a relatively high computational cost compared to previous work on video object segmentation. In other words, introducing a MLLM brings remarkable understanding and reasoning ability to the model, while also inducing computational costs. Exploring methods to achieve a trade-off between these aspects presents an interesting avenue for future research. Second, we observe that state-of-the-art approaches to video object segmentation often employ dedicated video backbones to enhance performance. Intuitively, using vision encoder pre-trained on videos would be beneficial for temporal-related tasks, such as object tracking. However, integrating a video backbone while ensuring compatibility with LLM and SAM decoder is non-trivial. In this work, we focus on empowering video segmentation tasks with reasoning capabilities based on LLM. Exploring the integration of a video backbone represents a potential avenue for future research. Lastly, after re-purposing the MLLM into an expert model on video reasoning segmentation, we observe that the model exhibits significant performance degradation in text generation capability, _i.e.,_ chat. We notice that this is a common limitation among reasoning segmentation models. LISA model even shows a much worse performance. Developing segmentation capability while preserving the chat capability is not trivial as it involves various aspects, such as data curation, training strategy, etc.

Conclusion

In this work, we propose VideoLISA, a video-based LLM designed for language instructed reasoning segmentation in videos. It leverages the reasoning capabilities of LLM and employs SAM to produce segmentation masks. To address the unique challenges in marrying LLM with video object segmentation, we propose two key innovations. Firstly, a Sparse Dense Sampling strategy is designed to enable LLM to capture and understand temporal dynamics in videos. By leveraging the inherent temporal redundancy property of videos, this strategy achieves a delicate balance between preserving visual details and temporal context, making it favorable for video object segmentation tasks. Secondly, we propose a One-Token-Seg-All approach to achieve temporally consistent segmentation masks in the promptable mask decoding paradigm. Based on a dedicated investigation of the potential and challenges associated with using a single unified prompt to segment video frames, we enhance this capability from both input information foundation and training objective perspectives. Extensive ablation studies have investigated the function and rationale of the design choices of two modules. Equipped with the two designs above, our VideoLISA model shows impressive capabilities in video object segmentation, particularly emphasizing complex reasoning, temporal understanding, and object tracking, as validated by our newly organized ReasonVOS benchmark. Furthermore, it demonstrates notable performance on image segmentation tasks, positioning it as a potential unified model for language-instructed object segmentation.
