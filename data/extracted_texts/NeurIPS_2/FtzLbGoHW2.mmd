###### Abstract

Gloss-free sign language translation (SLT) aims to develop well-performing SLT systems with no requirement for the costly gloss annotations, but currently still lags behind gloss-based approaches significantly. In this paper, we identify **a representation density problem** that could be a bottleneck in restricting the performance of gloss-free SLT. Specifically, the representation density problem describes that the visual representations of semantically distinct sign gestures tend to be closely packed together in feature space, which makes gloss-free methods struggle with distinguishing different sign gestures and suffer from a sharp performance drop. To address the representation density problem, we introduce a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, which encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative feature representation in a self-supervised manner. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed SignCL can significantly reduce the representation density and improve performance across various translation frameworks. Specifically, SignCL achieves a significant improvement in BLEU score for the Sign Language Transformer and GFSLT-VLP on the CSL-Daily dataset by 39% and 46%, respectively, without any increase of model parameters. Compared to Sign2GPT, a state-of-the-art method based on large-scale pre-trained vision and language models, SignCL achieves better performance with only 35% of its parameters. Implementation and Checkpoints are available at [https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL](https://github.com/JinhuiYE/SignCL).

## 1 Introduction

Sign languages are the primary form of communication for millions of deaf individuals. Sign language translation (SLT) aims to convert sign language into fluent spoken language sentences, which is a challenging task as it needs to extract information from continuous video and translate it into discrete text tokens. Most prior studies promoted the SLT by utilizing intermediate representations, namely gloss annotations, either directly or indirectly . Gloss annotations are beneficial as they provide a simplified representation and sequential ordering of each gesture within continuous sign videos, which aids in representation learning for visual encoders. However, the creation of sign language translation datasets with gloss annotations is both resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Recently, there has been a shift towards gloss-free sign language translation methods, which do not rely on gloss annotations to train SLT models. These methods usually rely on general datasets ,general pretraining strategy , or general large-scale foundation models  to promote gloss-free SLT. However, there is a substantial gap between the sign language domain and the general domain . Models trained with general strategies or datasets often fail to capture the subtle differences in semantically distinct gestures, which are crucial for accurately understanding a specific sign language. Therefore, the performance of gloss-free methods still significantly lags behind that of gloss-based approaches.

In this paper, we identify **a representation density problem** in sign language translation: the visual representations of sign gestures with distinct semantics are likely to be close in representation space. This problem is attributed to the nature of sign language, a form of visual language that utilizes intricate hand gestures, facial expressions, and body movements to convey the signer's message . For example, in Figure 1, the signer performs sign gestures for opposite meanings, "RECIPROCATE" and "REVENGE", with similar visual information (i.e., only subtle differences in facial movements). The visual encoder in SLT models will encode similar visual information to visual representations in adjacent representation space, even though they have distinct semantics. Without explicit gloss annotations, SLT models struggle to learn semantic boundaries in continuous sign videos and capture distinguishing visual representations for different sign gestures. As a result, the representation density problem poses a significant challenge for the SLT models in distinguishing between various sign gestures, leading to sharp performance drops. (Section 3.2).

Further, we investigate various popular sign feature extraction methods, including gloss-based  and gloss-free , to systematically study the representation density problem. As shown in Figure 2, our investigation reveals that the representation density problem is prevalent across sign feature extraction methods. Specifically, due to the lack of gloss annotations, the representation density problem appears to be more serious in gloss-free methods. Then, we conduct extensive SLT experiments and observe that SLT models using gloss-free sign features as input consistently suffer a drop in performance in both sign language recognition and translation tasks compared to those using gloss-based sign features (Section 3.3). Therefore, we demonstrate that the representation density problem can be a bottleneck in restricting the improvement of gloss-free sign language translation.

More importantly, we propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy named SignCL to address the representation density problem. Specifically, SignCL draws the visual representations of sign gestures with identical semantics closer together and pushes those with different semantics farther apart. Experimental results show that SignCL can learn more distinctive feature representations and lead to significant improvements in terms of BLEU score on various well-known SLT frameworks (Section 5). To summarize, the main contributions of this work are as follows:

* To the best of our knowledge, our work identifies the representation density problem in sign language translation for the first time. This problem is consistent across various sign feature extraction methods for SLT, including gloss-based and gloss-free methods.
* Experimental results empirically reveal that an increase in representation density leads to a significant performance drop in the accuracy of sign language recognition and translation. We find that the representation density problem poses a significant challenge for the gloss-free SLT.

Figure 1: An example of the representation density problem in sign language translation. The two images show the sign gestures for “RECIPROCATE” (blue dot) and “REVENGE” (orange dot). Although the two have opposite meanings, their visual representations are densely clustered together, as shown in the t-SNE visualization. The various colors in the visualization indicate sign gestures with different meanings.

* We propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, namely SignCL, to address the representation density problem. Our experiments demonstrate that SignCL can significantly enhance various well-known SLT frameworks. Specifically, SignCL yields a 39% BLEU score improvement for the Sign Language Transformer  and a 46% BLEU increase for GFSLT-VLP  on the CSL-Daily dataset.

### Sign Language Translation

Sign Language Translation (SLT) methods can be broadly categorized into gloss-based and gloss-free approaches. For gloss-based methods, an essential factor is to directly or indirectly employ sign gloss annotations to improve sign video encoder performance [3; 48; 53; 8; 49; 6]. These methods often employ Connectionist Temporal Classification  (CTC) loss to perform sign language recognition . Joint-SLT  firstly introduces a multitask encoder-decoder framework with a CTClass to soft-match sign representations and gloss sequences. STMC-T  introducing intra-cue and inter-cue CTC loss to model multi-cue sequence information. Despite their effectiveness, creating SLT datasets with gloss annotations is resource-intensive and time-consuming. Gloss-free methods have emerged as a promising alternative, as they do not rely on gloss annotations during training, making them more generalizable. And recently, a growing body of literature has promoted the gloss-free SLT, such as GASLT  proposed local gloss attention to mimic gloss assistant, GFSLT  adapted CLIP to do visual-language pretraining, and Sign2GPT  promoted performance by making use of large-scale pre-trained vision and language models. Nonetheless, the performance of gloss-free methods still significantly lags behind that of gloss-based approaches.

### Contrastive Learning

Contrastive Learning [21; 55; 30], a popular unsupervised learning algorithm, aims to learn effective representations by pulling positive pairs closer together and pushing negative pairs farther apart. This approach has been widely utilized in both Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision . In Sign Language Translation (SLT), Jin and Zhao  utilize Contrastive Learning to create a Signer-Independent SLT model, using videos demonstrating signs from different signers as positive samples. Additionally, Gan et al.  proposes a visual-level contrastive learning method with various image augmentation strategies. ConSLT  do contrastive learning for effective token representation learning in text decoder. Zhou et al.  and Cheng et al.  employ contrastive learning techniques to align video and text representations in SLT. In this paper, we are the first one to address the representation density problem, focusing particularly on visual gesture duration as a central aspect.

### Representation Density

Representation Density is often a focal point in classification tasks, also known as category density [1; 43; 37; 31; 32; 51; 29; 12]. This concept pertains to the compactness and clarity of feature representations across different categories. In the context of sign language, various methods have been developed to address the subtle nuances of sign actions. TSPNet  proposes a temporal hierarchical attention network to learn segmented representations. HST-GNN  utilizes a hierarchical spatio-temporal graph neural network to learn graph representations from multiple perspectives. GLE-Net  employs global contextual relationships and fine-grained cues to distinguish non-manual-aware features in isolated Sign Language Recognition. These methods are beneficial for addressing the subtleties of sign language movements. However, integrating them into existing state-of-the-art frameworks presents significant challenges, often resulting in performance disparities when compared to the SOTA. This paper is the first to propose the concept of representation density within this field and introduces SignCL, which enhances the current mainstream transformer-based frameworks.

## 3 Representation Density Problem

This section investigates and identifies the representation density problem within existing sign feature extraction techniques, and examines whether representation density bottlenecks sign language recognition and translation performance.

### Preliminaries

Existing Sign Feature Extraction TechniquesExisting sign feature extraction methods can be divided into two categories: 1) gloss-based (e.g., Sign Recognition Pretrained  and Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation ) and 2) gloss-free (e.g., I3D Pretraining  and Visual-Language Pretraining ). These methods were chosen for their representativeness in SLT and their well-documented open-source sign features.

* **Sign Recognition Pretrained (SRP)**: This approach leverages the sign language recognition datasets to train sign language recognition models and uses it as the feature extractor for the SLT task. Notably, the features released by Camgoz et al.  have been widely adopted as input features in a range of works .
* **Self-Mutual Knowledge Distillation (SMKD)**: This approach enhances SRP by enforcing the visual and contextual modules to focus on short-term and long-term information . SMKD feature extraction has been shown to substantially enhance SLT translation performance compared to SRP .
* **I3D Pretraining (I3D)**: This method employs I3D models as the backbone to pre-train the feature extractor, initially trained on the Kinetics dataset  and subsequently fine-tuned on extensive web SLR datasets, such as WSLR .
* **Visual-Language Pretraining (VLP)**: This method entirely forgoes gloss annotations and leverages a general visual-language pretraining strategy to align sign video representation with text. Embodied by GFSLT-VLP , this approach offers a more general solution that utilizes a broader range of sign language resources without the constraints of gloss annotations.

Representation Density MetricsDrawing inspiration from Fisher's Discriminant Ratio (FDR) , a typical measure used to evaluate the discriminative power of features in the classification, we combine the average Inter-Gloss Distance and Intra-Gloss Distance into Sign Density Ratio (SDR, see Eqn. 1), which reflects the degree of representation density for each gloss \(G_{i}\). This is given by the formula:

\[SDR(G_{i})=_{G_{i}}}{avg.D^{inter}_{G_{i}}}=)}{Mean _{j i}(D(G_{i},G_{j}))}. \]

Here, \(D(G_{i},G_{j})\) represents the Inter-Gloss Distance between two glosses \(G_{i}\) and \(G_{j}\), and avg. \(avg.D^{inter}_{G_{i}}\) reflects the average distance of \(G_{i}\) to all other glosses. The Intra-Gloss Distance \(D^{intra}_{G_{i}}\) evaluates the average distance within a single gloss \(G_{i}\). These distances are given by the following formulas:

\[D(G_{i},G_{j})=||G_{j}|}_{x G_{i},y G_{j}}d(x,y); \]

\[D(G_{i})=|(|G_{i}|-1)}_{x,y G_{i},x y}d(x,y); \]

Where, \(|G_{i}|\) and \(|G_{j}|\) denote the number of instances in glosses \(G_{i}\) and \(G_{j}\) respectively, and \(d(x,y)\) represents the distance measure between the embeddings of instances \(x\) and \(y\), i.e., euclidean distance.

The average Sign Density Ratio (SDR) of all glosses, denoted as \(SDR=(SDR(G_{i}))\), is calculated to evaluate the overall representation density of the dataset comprehensively.

Sign-Gloss AlignmentTo calculate the Sign Density Ratio (SDR), we need to determine the mapping relationship between input frames and gloss categories. Following previous works , we employ the CTC classifier as a sign-gloss forced aligner to establish the mapping between each gloss and its corresponding sign frames. The aligner provides the start position \(l_{v}\) and end position \(r_{v}\) within the video frame sequence for each corresponding gloss \(g_{v}\). To optimize alignment performance on the test set, we merge the training and test datasets for comprehensive training and engage two volunteers to select the best frame \(f_{v}\) from the range [\(l_{v}\):\(r_{v}\)] to align with each gloss \(g_{v}\). Extensive details on the training procedure and the aligner's performance metrics are documented in Appendix 9.

### Demonstrating Representation Density Problem

Experiment SetupsWe primarily use the PHOENIX-2014T benchmark  to investigate the representation density problem in existing sign feature extraction techniques. This benchmark was selected due to its rich collection of open-source sign features contributed by various research efforts. We obtained the sign features by either downloading the officially released versions or reproducing the feature extraction process. Then, we employed t-SNE  to visualize the feature distribution of these semantically distinct sign gestures to investigate representation density.

Results and FindingsThrough empirical analysis of various visualized open-source sign features, we have identified a widespread representation density problem across different sign feature extraction methods. As depicted in Figure 2, all evaluated methods display a Sign Density Ratio exceeding 50%, with inevitable overlap of feature representation. Notably, gloss-free methods that do not utilize gloss annotations as additional supervision (e.g., I3D and VLP) exhibit even more severe representation density compared to gloss-based methods. This is evident as sign gestures representing different semantics, indicated by different colors, significantly overlap, resulting in translation ambiguity during inference. Specifically, the Sign Density Ratio (SDR) of VLP is 92.59%, which is significantly higher than the SDR of SMKD at 66.23%.

Figure 3: Comparative analysis of representation density and its impact on sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT). The left panel (a) shows the correlation between representation density and SLR accuracy across different sign feature types and sign gesture groups. Binning in this context is based on sorting by gloss density within a group, where higher bins indicate higher density. The right panel (b) illustrates the performance drops in SLT caused by the representation density problem. This figure assesses both the recognition and translation accuracies, reflecting how denser representations impact these metrics.

The addition of +SignCL denotes our proposed method that integrates a contrastive learning strategy into the VLP method (see Section 4). Different colors represent sign gestures with distinct semantics. Points in gray represent other sign categories not listed. Better viewed by zooming in.

### Demonstrating Performance Drop

This section investigates the impact of representation density on sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) systems.

General SetupsThis part employs the widely utilized Sign Language Transformer  (NSLT) as the foundational model for our evaluations. The choice is because its capability to perform both SLT and SLR tasks, as well as take SLR and SLT at the same time (joint-SLT). Additionally, the NSLT framework is well-established within sign language research and benefits from comprehensive documentation and support in open-source sign feature sets and baseline results. The NSLT relies on sign features derived using a pretrained sign feature extractor. This section studies all types of sign features introduced in Section 3.2 to investigate the representation density problem. We use the Sign Density Ratio (SDR, see Eqn. 1) to measure the representation density within each type of input feature. We measure SLR and SLT performance by the recognition accuracy and the BLEU-4  score (B@4), respectively.

Task SetupsWe set up tasks to examine whether representation density bottlenecks sign language recognition and translation performance.

* **Sign Language Recognition**: To evaluate the ability of the extracted sign features to distinguish between different semantic gestures, we use the NSLT  to perform sign language recognition (SLR) tasks with various types of sign features  as model input. Due to the limited number of samples for each gesture in the dev set, we rank the sign glosses based on their density using SDR\((G_{i})\) under SMKD features (see Eqn. 1). These glosses are then divided into nine groups (bins), each containing approximately 60 glosses. The average SDR\((G_{i})\) and recognition accuracy for each bin represents the overall density and mean accuracy of the glosses within that bin, respectively.
* **Sign Language Translation**: This evaluation aims to demonstrate the impact of representation density on translation tasks. We evaluate various sign features as inputs to the Sign Language Transformer, including SRP, SMKD, I3D, VLP, and VLP+SignCL. These inputs are tested across different translation frameworks, such as NSLT , Joint-SLT , and NSLT+SignCL. NSLT means use NSLT to perform SLT without CTC loss (gloss-free) and the NSLT+SignCL configuration integrates the proposed contrastive learning strategy into the encoder of NSLT  models, as detailed in Section 4.

Results and FindingsAs depicted in Figure 3, the following observations were made regarding the impact of representation density on both recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT):

* **Performance suffers from representation density.** We consistently observed a negative relationship between representation density and performance across all feature types and tasks. Higher representation density leads to worse accuracy in SLR and lower BLEU scores in SLT. Specifically, an increase in the representation density ratio by 26% can result in a 39% performance drop in NSLT.
* **Gloss-free methods suffer from worse representation density.** Gloss-free based feature extractions, which do not use any gloss annotations for assistance (e.g., VLP), typically exhibit higher representation density scores than gloss-based approach (e.g., SDR(VLP)=92.59% > SDR(SMKD)=66.23%). Using gloss-free features results in worse recognition and translation performance compared to gloss-based feature extractions (e.g., VLP vs. SMKD).
* **Contrastive learning boosts performance by reducing representation density.** When contrastive learning is applied to augment gloss-free based feature representation learning, i.e., VLP+SignCL for feature extraction or NSLT+SignCL for downstream finetuning, there is a consistent reduction in feature representation density accompanied by a significant improvement in both of the SLR accuracy and the SLT performance (see detail can be found in Section 4).

## 4 Contrastive Learning for Gloss-free Sign Langauge Translation

Contrastive Learning , a popular self-supervised learning algorithm, aims to learn effective representations by pulling positive pairs closer together and pushing negative pairs farther apart. Inthis section, we introduce a simple but efficient sign contrastive learning strategy, namelySignCL, which addresses the challenge of the representation density problem in gloss-free sign language translation.

### Sign Contrastive Learning

The key factor in contrastive learning is how to sample positive and negative training pairs. As illustrated in the framework shown in Figure 3(a), the sampling strategy of SignCL is as follows: if two frames are close enough (e.g., adjacent), they are considered to belong to the same sign gesture and are treated as positive samples. Conversely, if two frames are far apart by double the margin (e.g., \(|f_{ed}-f_{st}|>20\) frames), they are considered to be associated with different semantics and are treated as negative samples. Statistically, the average duration of each gesture in sign video is nine frames , and according to the speech-to-gesture Zipf's Law , each gloss represents approximately 2.3 spoken words. Therefore, we set the margin as \((10,}{} 2.3)\).

\[(f_{st},f_{ed}^{+}):&|f_{ed}^{+}-f_{st}| 1 \\ (f_{st},f_{ed}^{+}):&|f_{ed}^{-}-f_{st}|>2*margin; \]

\[_{SignCL}=_{st=1}^{N}[(f_{st},f_{ed}^ {+})+(0,m-(f_{st},f_{ed}^{-}))]; \]

Where \(d\) is the distance function, i.e., Euclidean distance for frame features \((f_{st},f_{ed})\), and \(N\) is the total number of frames in one sign video, \(N=\). The margin parameter \(m\) is used to prevent the features of the negative pair from being too far away. We empirically set \(m=64\) based on the average Inter-Gloss Distance (see Eqn. 2) of gloss-based sign features (e.g., SMKD).

### Integrating Contrastive Learning into Sign Language Translation Tranining

As illustrated in Figures 3(b) and 3(c), \(SignCL\) can be integrated into both the sign feature extraction pretraining stage (e.g., Visual-Language Pretraining ) and the downstream task finetuning stage (e.g., GFSLT-VLP ). The optimization objective for these approaches is the weighted sum of \(_{}\) and the original objective loss (e.g., VLP Loss for pretraining and SLT loss for finetuning ), defined as:

\[=*_{}+_{MLE}; \]

Where \(L_{MLE}\) is the original objective loss in the pertaining or finetuning.

## 5 Experiments

In this Section, we conduct experiments to demonstrate the efficiency of proposed SignCL in reducing representation density and boosting gloss-free sign language translation performance. Specifically, we apply SignCL to the Sign Language Transformer  to facilitate a direct comparison with prior empirical analyses of the representation density problem in Section 3.3. Additionally, we integrate SignCL into the GFSLT-VLP  framework, a robust new gloss-free baseline that improves SLT through pretraining and finetuning.

Figure 4: Overview of the SignCL in gloss-free sign language translation: (a) Sign contrastive learning sampling strategy, (b) Showcases the integration of SignCL in the pretraining stage, and (c) ) Displays the application of SignCL during the finetuning stage.

### Experiments on Sign Language Transformer

In Section 3, we investigate the representation density problem using the Sign Language Transformer (SLT)  and the PHOENIX-2014T  and CSL-Daliy  Dataset. These benchmarks are chosen for their established relevance in sign language translation research, including gloss-based and gloss-free based. Here, we first conduct experiments on the same framework and dataset to facilitate direct comparison with the prior empirical analyses.

**Experiment Settings:** In this experiment, we introduce SignCL as additional supervision information in the encoder of SLT under gloss-free settings. This enhanced model is referred to as +SignCL.

**Results and Findings:** The integration of SignCL into the SLT has significantly improved translation performance across all test conditions by reducing the representation density, as shown in Table 1. Notably, SignCL encourages SLT to learn a more distinct feature distribution, reducing the Sign Density Ratio (SDR) significantly, e.g., 66.23 to 62.18 and 92.59 to 81.30.

Figures 2(a) and 2(b) show experiments on SLR and SLT tasks using features with varying SDRs as inputs to SLT. The representation density reduction leads to observable improvements in both recognition accuracy (red line vs. purple line in Figure 2(a)) and translation BLEU score (purple point vs. red point in Figure 2(b)). Further details and additional experiment results on the CSL-Daily dataset are provided in Appendix A.4.3.

Table 1 presents a comparative analysis of representation density and performance on the PHOENIX-2014T dataset. The inclusion of SignCL during VLP feature extraction or SLT training processes significantly enhances performance metrics. WERs (Word Error Rates) in the gloss-free set, derived from an independent SLR task, are specifically used to probe the quality of sign features and do not participate in the SLT training process. This analysis underscores the significant enhancements brought by SignCL in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness in SLT frameworks.

### Experiments on Gloss-free Sign Language Translation

Gloss-free sign language translation, which does not rely on gloss annotations, has become a trend as it makes the approach more generalizable. In the realm of gloss-free sign language translation, GFSLT-VLP  stands out as a strong new baseline. It incorporates CLIP  and MBART  for model pretraining and finetuning. In this set of experiments, we use GFSLT-VLP as the baseline model and integrate the proposed SignCL into the framework to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both pretraining and finetuning settings.

**Experiment Settings:** This set of experiments is conducted using the PHOENIX-2014T  and CSL-Daily  datasets. We reproduce GFSLT-VLP using the official code and integrate SignCL into both the pretraining and finetuning stages. All models and training details are consistent with

    &  &  \\  & \(SDR\) & WER\(\) & B@4\(\) & \(SDR\) & WER\(\) & B@4\(\) \\    \\  Joint-SLT  / Self-Mutual KD  & 66.23 & 25.38 & 22.79 & 48.34 & 29.52 & 11.61 \\ + SignCL into Feature Extraction & 62.18 & 24.76 & 23.23 & - & - & - \\ + SignCL into Finetuning & 66.23 & 25.12 & 22.92 & - & - & - \\ + SignCL into both & **62.18** & **24.58** & **23.46** & - & - & - \\   \\  SLT  / VLP Pretrained  & 92.59 & 69.72 & 10.73 & 76.55 & _85.78_ & 1.82 \\ + SignCL into Feature Extraction & 81.30 & _63.33_ & 12.04 & 68.39 & _80.71_ & 2.15 \\ + SignCL into Finetuning & 92.59 & - & 12.14 & 76.55 & - & 2.19 \\ + SignCL into both & **81.30** & - & **13.51** & **68.39** & - & **2.53** \\   

Table 1: Comparative analysis of representation density and performance on the PHOENIX-2014T dataset. “+SignCL” indicates the inclusion of the proposed contrastive learning strategy during VLP (Video Language Processing) feature extraction or SLT (Sign Language Translation) training processes. WERs (Word Error Rates) in the gloss-free set are derived from an independent SLR (Sign Language Recognition) task, used specifically for probing the quality of sign features. These WERs do not participate in the SLT training process.

those used in GFSLT-VLP , with the sole exception being the incorporation of SignCL, weighted by \(=0.01\), as illustrated in Figure 2 and Equation 6. Further details are provided in Appendix A.1.

Results and Findings:Tables 2 and 3 compare our proposed methods with existing gloss-free sign language translation approaches. The results demonstrate that integrating the proposed SignCL strategy into the GFSLT-VLP framework consistently reduces representation density and significantly boosts translation performance, whether SignCL is applied during pretraining, finetuning, or both stages. Specifically, compared to the baseline model GFSLT-VLP , our approach achieves a substantial improvement of 45.58% (+5.06) in the BLEU-4 score on the CSL-Daily dataset, without any increase in the number of parameters. Additionally, despite having significantly fewer parameters (\(\)600M vs. \(\)1.7B), our approach achieves better performance than Sign2GPT , which leverages large-scale pretrained vision and language models for sign language translation.

### Qualitative Analysis

To understand our SignCL approach in scenarios of addressing representation density, we present a case from the CSL-Daily dataset in Figure 5. As shown, the way to display sign gestures for "\(\)" (laptop) and "\(\)" (piano) differ subtly. As indicated by the t-SNE results, the representations of these two semantically different gestures are closely packed together in the feature space, causing the baseline GFSLT-VLP model to incorrectly translate "\(\)" (piano) as "\(\)" (laptop). In contrast, our proposed SignCL effectively separates the representations of "\(\)" (laptop) and "\(\)" (piano) in the feature space, enabling the accurate translation of "\(\)" (piano).

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we identify a crucial representation density problem in gloss-free sign language translation. Our systematic investigation reveals that this problem persists across various existing sign feature extraction methods and causes sharp performance drops in both sign language recognition and translation, particularly in gloss-free methods. To address this problem, we propose a simple but effective contrastive learning strategy, termed SignCL. Our experiments demonstrate that SignCL encourages gloss-free models to learn more discriminative features and significantly reduces representation density. Furthermore, our experiments show that SignCL improves translation performance across various frameworks and datasets by a significant margin, achieving a new state-of-the-art in gloss-free sign language translation. We illustrate the effectiveness of SignCL through detailed examples in our qualitative analysis. Finally, we provide several ablation studies for a better understanding of SignCL and discuss the limitations and potential societal impacts of this work in the Appendix A.

## 7 Limitations

Our work, while promising, has several limitations that should be considered:

**Boundary Cases:** We assume that adjacent frames output the same sign gestures, while distant frames belong to different sign gestures. This assumption might not hold in special sign language videos with extensive repetitive gestures. In extreme cases, SignCL might affect feature convergence.

**Semantic Similarity**: SignCL does not account for the semantic similarity between sign gestures, which can result in increased feature distances between semantically similar gestures. This could potentially affect the learning of linguistic features.

Despite acknowledging these limitations, our experiments demonstrate that our approach works effectively in most cases. We will address these issues in future work to further enhance the robustness and applicability of our method.
