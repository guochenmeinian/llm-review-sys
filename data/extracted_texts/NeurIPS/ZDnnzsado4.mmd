###### Abstract

In an effort to catalog insect biodiversity, we propose a new large dataset of hand-labelled insect images, the BIOSCAN-1M Insect Dataset. Each record is taxonomically classified by an expert, and also has associated genetic information including raw nucleotide barcode sequences and assigned barcode index numbers, which are genetically-based proxies for species classification. This paper presents a curated million-image dataset, primarily to train computer-vision models capable of providing image-based taxonomic assessment, however, the dataset also presents compelling characteristics, the study of which would be of interest to the broader machine learning community. Driven by the biological nature inherent to the dataset, a characteristic long-tailed class-imbalance distribution is exhibited. Furthermore, taxonomic labelling is a hierarchical classification scheme, presenting a highly fine-grained classification problem at lower levels. Beyond spurring interest in biodiversity research within the machine learning community, progress on creating an image-based taxonomic classifier will also further the ultimate goal of all BIOSCAN research: to lay the foundation for a comprehensive survey of global biodiversity. This paper introduces the dataset and explores the classification task through the implementation and analysis of a baseline classifier. The code repository of the BIOSCAN-1M-Insect dataset is available at https://github.com/zahrag/BIOSCAN-1M

## 1 Introduction

Global change is restructuring ecosystems on a planetary scale, creating an increasingly urgent need to track impacts on biodiversity. Such tracking is exceptionally challenging because life is highly diverse: the biosphere comprises more than 10 million multicellular species . Until recently, this complexity has meant that an Earth observation system for biodiversity was inconceivable, however the increased power of DNA sequencing and the recognition that living organisms can be discriminated by short stretches of DNA have revealed a way forward, which has become the central focus of the International Barcode of Life (iBOL) Consortium.

Discriminating organisms by DNA sequences [22; 6] can revolutionize our understanding of biodiversity, not only by providing a reliable species proxy for known and unknown species, but also by revealing their interactions and assessing their responses to changes in the ecosystem. This is essential to mitigate a looming mass extinction, where an _eighth of all species_ may become extinct by 2100 unless there is a significant change in human behaviour [10; 11].

The BIOSCAN project , lead by iBOL, has the following three main goals:

1. Species discovery.
2. Studying the interactions between species.
3. Tracking and modelling species dynamics over geography and time.

To that end, BIOSCAN collects samples of multicellular life from around the world. Each sample is individually imaged, genetically sequenced and barcoded , and then classified by expert taxonomists. Of particular interest to the BIOSCAN project are _insets_, which constitute a great proportion of the Earth's species and many of which remain unknown. Indeed, it is estimated that 5.5 M insect species exist worldwide, of which only roughly one million have been identified . The rate of insect collection within the BIOSCAN project is increasing as the project progresses, such that 3 M insect specimens will be collected in 2023 and 10 M by 2028.

Using high-resolution photographs, human taxonomists can accurately classify insects from within their domain of expertise. However, human annotation cannot scale to the volume of samples needed to measure and track global biodiversity. Moreover, many taxonomists with highly specialized knowledge are leaving the practice and won't be replaced. Thus, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to process visual and textual information collected by the BIOSCAN project is crucial to the success of a planet-scale observation system. Classification of the insect images to their taxonomic group ranking is especially useful in regions of the world where the facilities required to perform genetic barcoding are not available. Indeed, even beyond this project, there are opportunities for computer vision to transform entomology .

This article has two main contributions.

1. The publication of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect image dataset, containing approximately 1.1 M high-quality microscope images, each of which is annotated by the insect's taxonomic ranking and accompanied by its raw DNA sequences and Barcode Index Number (BIN) , an example of which is shown in Figure 1.
2. The design and implementation of a deep model, classifying BIOSCAN-1M Insect images into specific taxonomic ranking groups, to serve as a baseline for future work utilizing this dataset.

## 2 Background and Related work

This section provides background on taxonomic classification, the use of genetic barcoding, and several challenges in the field of machine learning associated with our dataset.

Figure 1: BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset records contain high-quality microscope images of insects and labels including the taxonomic classification, raw DNA sequences, and Barcode Index Number (BIN). Pictured here is a mosquito of the subfamily _Culicinae_, the most populous subfamily of mosquitoes with species found around the world.

### Taxonomic Classification

In biology, taxonomic classification is the study of hierarchically categorizing lifeforms based on shared characteristics. In particular, Linnean taxonomy [7; 20; 32] forms the basis for the modern (generally accepted) system of taxonomy, of which the main hierarchical ranks are domain, kingdom, phylum, class, order, family, genus, and species, as shown in Figure 3. All insect life is part of the class _Insecta_.

Conventionally, expert taxonomists classify organisms based on their appearance and behaviour . However, this approach is susceptible to both misclassification and lacks consensus throughout the community of taxonomists, since it is difficult to prove with certainty that a given classification is absolutely _correct_. This shortcoming of traditional taxonomy has prompted the use of classification heuristics, based on fairly concrete evidence in the form of genetic codes, that are sensitive to species identity.

Table 1 presents a comprehensive overview of both the number of unique categories and the degree to which the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset is labelled at each taxonomic rank. According to the table, a substantial number of samples lack labels at more specific taxonomic ranks. This limitation underscores the challenge of incomplete taxonomic labeling within the dataset. However, the ongoing efforts of expert curation are continuously improving this aspect, and future versions of the dataset are expected to include a more comprehensive taxonomic classification for a larger number of samples.

Based on the statistical analysis of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, it is evident that there are 3,441 distinct categories at the genus level and 8,355 at the species level. However, the amount of data to train such fine-grained classifiers is limited, with 254,096 samples classified by experts at the genus level and only 84,397 samples at the species level. This substantial class-number-to-data-size imbalance poses a notable challenge when training models for fine-grained classification, specifically at the genus and species level.

### Genetic Barcoding and Barcode Index Numbers

DNA barcoding [22; 6] employs large-scale screening of one or a few reference genes for assigning unknown individuals to species, as well as aiding in the discovery of new species . Barcoding is commonly used in several fields including taxonomy, ecology, conservation biology, diet analysis and food safety [49; 53]. It is faster and more accurate than traditional methods, which rely on the judgment of experts .

Barcoding is based on the use of a short, standardized segment of mitochondrial DNA, typically a portion of the _mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene_, which is nearly always unique for different species. Once the DNA sequence is obtained, it can be compared to a reference library of known sequences to identify the species.

The concept of genetic barcoding can be taken a step further by mapping barcodes to clusters of organisms (characterized by their barcodes) with a _highly_ similar genetic code, known as an

  
**Taxonomic Level** & **Categories** & **Labelled Samples** & **Labelled (\%)** \\  Phylum & 1 & 1,128,313 & 100.0 \\ Class & 1 & 1,128,313 & 100.0 \\ Order & 16 & 1,128,313 & 100.0 \\ Family & 491 & 1,112,968 & 98.6 \\ Subfamily & 760 & 265,492 & 23.5 \\ Tribe & 535 & 60,477 & 5.4 \\ Genus & 3,441 & 254,096 & 22.5 \\ Species & 8,355 & 84,397 & 7.5 \\ 
**Barcode Index Number (BIN)** & 90,918 & 1,128,313 & 100.0 \\   

Table 1: An overview of the number of unique categories and number / proportion of expert-labelled samples within the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset at each taxonomic rank. Additionally, in the bottom row, the corresponding information is given in relation to Barcode Index Number (BIN), presented as a genetic alternative to taxonomic labels (species proxy). Observe that all samples have an associated BIN, and there are roughly \(10\) more unique BINs than species labels.

Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) [52; 5]. OTUs act as a proxy for species based on the high degree of genetic similarity exhibited by their members. To enable indexing, each OTU is assigned a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), commonly referred to as the Barcode Index Number (BIN) , which offers a unique representation such that genetically identical taxa will be assigned the same BIN, and each BIN is registered in the Barcode Of Life Data system (BOLD) . BINs additionally provide an alternative to the use of Linnean names, offering a genetics-based classification of organisms.

BOLD, the Barcode of Life Data System , is a pivotal resource in biodiversity science. It facilitates DNA barcode acquisition, storage, validation, and analysis, integrating molecular, morphological, and distributional data. BOLD hosts 17 million specimen records and 14 million barcodes, spanning over a million species worldwide. It plays a central role in species identification, genetic diversity exploration, and evolutionary studies. Launched in 2005, BOLD aims to identify all eukaryotic species and offers integrated analytical tools, comprehensive data management, and secure collaboration.

### Machine Learning Challenges

As will be demonstrated in Section 3, the dataset exhibits two key characteristics corresponding to open problems in the field of machine learning.

**Class imbalance.** The degree to which the expected quantity of instances varies between classes is known as the class imbalance. In the context of a closed dataset, the class imbalance describes the disparity in number of examples among classes [27; 30]. As we describe in Section 3, and Figure 2 the published dataset exhibits a long-tailed class distribution whereby the distribution of class sizes closely follows a power-law, indicating that there is a substantial class imbalance. This represents a challenge due to the disproportionate amounts of available training data for majority vs. minority classes.

**Hierarchical classification.** Classification problems involving data with labels that are inherently hierarchical present a unique challenge in comparison to simpler "flat" classification problems . The outputs of hierarchical classification algorithms are defined over tree-like class taxonomies, where the relationship between parent and child nodes is given by the asymmetric "is-a" relationship. A basic example of this is the relationship that "all dogs are canines, but not all canines are dogs", whereby "dogs" would be a child node of the parent node "canines", which itself may be a child of "mammals". The dataset published here perfectly matches this paradigm and may be used to study novel approaches for handling the hierarchical classification problem. Note that the baselines we adopt in this paper do not pursue a hierarchical strategy but instead classify to fixed levels of the taxonomy: order and family. Hierarchical strategies are a topic of present and future work.

Figure 2: Class distribution and class imbalance in the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset. We focus on the 16 most densely populated orders (top) and the 40 most densely populated families (bottom).

### Biological Datasets

Image-based insect classification  most often finds use in agricultural settings, where Integrated Pest Management (IPM) systems are used to identify and count harmful insect pests . In combination with this, holistic systems capable of also identifying plant diseases through computer vision are a popular area of research .

Recently, DNA sequences have been analyzed  using tools from the field of Natural Language Processing , and in particular, through the application of bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) . Indeed, BERT-based models have been used to taxonomically classify genetic sequences . Other recent work has used DNA barcodes as "side information" to perform zero-shot species-level recognition from images, albeit at a much smaller scale than the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset .

Perhaps the best known and largest biological dataset is iNaturalist , the 2021 version of which contains 2.7 M images from over 10,000 different species of plants, animals, and fungi, specifically with 2,526 species of insects with 663 k annotated insect images. Many insect-specific image datasets focus on insect as pests found in agricultural settings ; the most prominent of which, the IP102  dataset, contains roughly 75 k insect images, covering 102 species of common crop insect pests. 19 k of these are annotated with bounding boxes for object detection. In the space of plants, the PlantNet-300K  dataset has 306 k images labeled by species and was constructed by sampling the larger PlantNet database . Table 2 highlights key biological datasets across a variety of domains and indicates the degree of class imbalance , \(\), which is defined as the ratio of the number of samples in the largest to the smallest class.

The BIOSCAN-Order and BIOSCAN-Diptera datasets, introduced in Section 4, refer to subsets of the full BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset for use in order- and family-level classification, respectively. Observe that while there is significant variety in the imbalance factor among datasets, the imbalance of BIOSCAN-Order is _orders of magnitude_ greater than that of all the other datasets. The PI@ntNet-300K  dataset also has remarkably high class imbalance, exceeding that of the BIOSCAN-Diptera dataset. While a high imbalance ratio was expected of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset based on the dataset's biological nature, the metric is _highly_ sensitive due to its dependence on only the two most extreme classes.

The iNaturalist dataset encompasses a greater number of insect species than any pre-existing dataset. We measured the number of genera (plural of genus) and species that were common across both datasets. Of the 2,526 insect species in iNaturalist and 8,355 species annotated in BIOSCAN-1M Insect, only 153 genera and 62 species appeared in both datasets. This indicates the species in BIOSCAN-1M Insect predominantly do not appear in iNaturalist. Furthermore, based on the number of unique BINs present in the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, it can be assumed that the dataset in fact encompasses almost 91 k distinct (possibly as yet unnamed) insect species, a far greater quantity than that of iNaturalist.

## 3 Dataset

This section describes the information made available through the publication of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, and details the procedures which generated the information.

### BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset resources

The BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset provides four main sources of information about insect specimens. Each sample in the dataset consists of a biological taxonomic annotation, DNA barcode sequence, Barcode Index Number (BIN), and a RGB image of a single specimen. In the following sections, this information is described in detail.

#### 3.1.1 Biological taxonomy

The BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset specifies biological taxonomic rank following the Linnean taxonomy as described in Section 2.1. In addition to the main groups shown in Figure 3, the dataset also provides the subfamily and subspecies ranks. The subfamily rank is an auxiliary (intermediate) taxonomic rank, the next below family but more inclusive than genus. Subspecies is a taxonomic rank below species, and it is used for populations that live in different areas and vary in size, shape, or other physical characteristics, but that can successfully interbreed. Finally, we also provide "Name"to indicate the lowest (most specific) known rank label. For instance, if there exists a species name of an organism, "Name" will show that, but if the organism only has Family level ID, then "Name" will show that ID. Each sample has a name and there are in total 10,952 unique names labelled in the dataset.

Not all data samples have labels for all taxonomic ranks recognized in the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset. As an example, the family group of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset is indexed by 494 distinct families, however, there are 16,067 data samples that are not associated with any of these families, since they were not classified by human taxonomists. As a consequence, there are many data samples that are not classified into finer-level groups like subfamily, tribe, genus, species, or subspecies. The lack of precise annotation at all ranks is one of the major challenges of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset when performing classification tasks.

#### 3.1.2 DNA Barcode and Indexing

Section 2.2 described the concept of genetic barcoding and the generation of Barcode Index Numbers (BINs). The BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset contains genetic barcodes and BINs for all samples. This information is represented as the raw nucleotide barcode sequence, under the Nuccraw field, and the Barcode Index Number (BIN), denoted by uri. Independently, the field processid is a unique number assigned by BOLD to each record, and sampleid is an identifier given by the collector.

#### 3.1.3 RGB images

The BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset offers a wealth of information through its collection of insect images. The dataset contains high-resolution (2880x2160 pixel) RGB images in JPEG format; Figure 4 displays a selection of images representing insects from 16 most densely populated orders.

We have released multiple packages of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset aimed at different purposes. These packages are organized into 113 chunks, each containing 10 k images. The packages include:

* Original JPEG Images stored in 113 zip files (2.3 TB).

  
**Name / Citation** & **Domain** & **Images** & **Categories** & **Taxonomic Rank** & **Imbalance, \(\)** \\  iNaturalist (2021)  & All & 2,686 k & 10,000 & Species & 1.97 \\ iNaturalist-Insect  & Insects & 663 k & 2,526 & Species & 1.97 \\ PI\#ntNet-300K  & Plants & 306 k & 1,000 & Species & 3,604.00 \\ Urban Trees  & Trees & 80 k & 18 & Species & 7.51 \\ IP102  & Insects & 75 k & 102 & Species & 13.63 \\ Na Birds  & Birds & 48 k & 400 & Species & 15.00 \\ LeafSnap  & Plants & 31 k & 184 & Species & 8.00 \\ Pest24  & Insects & 25 k & 24 & Common name / species & 493.95 \\ Flowers 102  & Flowers & 8 k & 102 & Genus & 1.00 \\

Table 2: Summary of biological fine-grained and long-tailed datasets. Note that “iNaturalist-Insect” describes the subset of iNaturalist (2021 version) images that comprises insects. *For the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, we report the number of unique Barcode Index Numbers (BINs) instead of the number of unique Linnean taxonomic species. The BIN is a mitochondrial DNA-based identifier which provides a species-like proxy of an organism and can be used as an alternative to Linnean taxonomy (see Section 2.2).

* Cropped images organized into 113 zip files (151 GB).
* Resized original images which have a size of 256 px on their smaller side (26 GB).
* Resized cropped images having a size of 256 px on their smaller side (7 GB).

Additionally, we also provide the dataset in HDF5 archive format for both the resized original and cropped images.

### BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset generation

The BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset consists of specimens mostly collected from three countries (Costa Rica, Canada, and South Africa) using Malaise traps. RGB images of the organisms were taken with a Keyence VHX-7000 microscope. Images are organized by workflow units: 96-well microplates of which 96 are used in a single sequencing run (9,120 samples at a time).

DNA barcodes of the organisms were generated using a high-throughput approach utilizing the Pacific Biosystems Sequel platform, which employs Single-molecule, real-time (SMRT) sequencing to generate long-read length DNA and cDNA. The taxonomic classifications were created by matching the generated barcodes to a reference library on the Barcode of Life Data System (BOLD) at the Centre for Biodiversity Genomics in Canada.

Figure 4: Examples of original insect images from 16 orders of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset. The numbers below each image identify the number of images in each class, and clearly illustrate the degree of class imbalance in the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset. “Siphonaptera”, “Strepsiptera” and “Zoraptera” are removed from classification experiments due to an insufficient number of samples.

We provide a comprehensive metadata file alongside the RGB images, which includes taxonomic annotations, DNA barcode sequences, and data sample indexes and labels. The metadata file also contains image names and IDs to locate the corresponding images within the dataset packages. Additionally, it identifies the images associated with the training, validation, and test splits.

## 4 Experiments

By employing stratified class-based sampling, we methodically curated three subsets of varying sizes from the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset. Subsequently, we carried out two distinct sets of classification experiments, yielding a total of six datasets. The three subsets, namely Small, Medium, and Large, each comprising approximately 50 k, 200 k, and 1 M data samples, respectively. The initial set of experiments primarily revolves around classifying insect images into their 16 most densely populated taxonomic orders. Subsequently, the second set of experiments delves even deeper, focusing on classifying samples within the Order Diptera into their 40 most densely populated families.

### Subset sampling and split mechanism

To create subsets of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, we followed a systematic two-step process. Initially, we sampled a subset exclusively from the Diptera Order, specifically selecting the 40 families with the highest number of members. This led to the creation of the BIOSCAN-Diptera dataset. Subsequently, we divided the BIOSCAN-Diptera dataset into separate train, validation, and test sets. Finally, we used these split sets of the BIOSCAN-Diptera dataset as a basis to construct the corresponding train, validation, and test sets for the BIOSCAN-Order dataset. Our methodology involved the use of stratified class-based sampling to preserve the class distribution consistently across all subsets, ensuring the integrity of our experiments.

The Small and Medium subsets are generated by sampling 50 k and 200 k data samples, respectively, from the train, validation, and test sets of the BIOSCAN-Order and BIOSCAN-Diptera datasets. In all of our classification experiments, we used class-based stratified sampling to split the dataset into train, validation and test sets. To this end, 70% of the samples of each class are randomly selected as training, 10% as validation, and 20% as test samples, as shown in Table 3.

The extreme class imbalances, which are an inherent characteristic of the BIOSCAN-1M Insect dataset, are addressed to some extent by having all classes represented in the train, validation and test sets. Classes with no samples for either split set are omitted. In the insect order-level classification (Figure 4), we have sufficient data samples for 16 out of 19 orders in the train, validation, and test sets. For the Diptera family-level classification, we focus on the 40 most populous families within Diptera.

### Data preprocessing

To improve computational efficiency, we crop and resize the images to be 256 px on the smaller dimension. Preliminary experiments with ResNet-50 comparing original images with images that are cropped show that cropping can help model learning to converge more rapidly and lead to slightly better performance. Reducing the resolution to 256 px helps to reduce the size of the large dataset from 2.3 TB down to 26 GB for the original uncropped images, and from 151 GB down to 7 GB for cropped images. We choose to run experiments on the cropped and resized images due to the small size which allows for efficient data loading from disk.

The BIOSCAN-1M image datasets have insects with varying size, pose, color and shape. Due to these variations, cropping is not a simple task. We develop our cropping tool by fine-tuning a DETR 

  
**Dataset** & **Total** & **Train** & **Validation** & **Test** & **Categories** \\  BIOSCAN-Order & 1,128,308 & 789,813 & 112,835 & 225,660 & 16 \\ BIOSCAN-Diptera & 891,338 & 623,937 & 89,135 & 178,266 & 40 \\ BIOSCAN-Order/Diptera Medium & 200,000 & 140,000 & 20,000 & 40,000 & 16/40 \\ BIOSCAN-Order/Diptera Small & 50,000 & 35,000 & 5000 & 10,000 & 16/40 \\

model with ResNet-50  backbone (pretrained on MSCOCO ) on a small set of 2,000 insect images annotated using the Toronto Annotation Tool Suite . In DETR, the CNN-based feature extractor extracts a set of image features that are fed into a transformer-based encoder-detector. The detector takes a set of learned positional embeddings as object queries and uses them to attend to the encoder outputs. Each of the output decoder embeddings is then passed to a shared FFN which predicts whether there is an "insect" or "no object" and regresses the bounding box. The DETR model is further trained for 10 epochs with the AdamW optimizer with learning rate of 0.0001, weight decay of 0.0001 and a batch size of 8.

To crop the image, we apply our fine-tuned DETR model and take the predicted bounding box with the highest confidence score. The finalized cropping is determined as the predicted bounding box, extended equally in width and height by \(0.4\) of the maximum dimension.

### Classification model

To run classification experiments, we fine-tuned two different pre-trained models to extract deep visual features of insects from their RGB images. Our pre-trained models are ResNet-50  and a transformer based model, ViT-Base-Patch16-224 . During training, we take random 224x224 crops from the image as input, while during validation we take the center crop. To train our model, we used two loss functions, the Cross-Entropy (CE) as a baseline and the Focal loss, which is more suitable for datasets having class imbalances [36; 8; 13].

## 5 Results

The detailed hyperparameters used for our experiments are shown in Table 4. For conducting the experiments, we leveraged the computational resources provided by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada's Narval and Beluga clusters. To ensure efficient processing. Each experiment was performed using a single node equipped with 1 GPU, 10 CPUs per task, and a memory allocation of 128GB.

We conducted a set of 24 trials, each executed with 3 distinct seeds. These trials were carried out to tackle classification tasks involving Insect-Order and Diptera-Family utilizing three dataset variations: Large, Medium, and Small. Our design encompassed the creation of 4 distinct models, integrating two distinct loss functions (Cross-Entropy and Focal) and two different pretrained backbones (ResNet-50 and ViT-B/16).

The combination of these diverse components led to the calculation of average performance across a range of seed values. Subsequently, the model that exhibited the highest average performance on the validation set was selected for further evaluation during inference, as depicted in Table 5. It's worth noting that models employing the ViT-B/16 backbone and Cross-Entropy loss function demonstrated superior performance across most of the experiments on the validation set, leading to their selection for inference using test data. For the Small and Medium datasets, the models underwent 100 epochs of training, while for the Large dataset, a lesser number of epochs were applied, as convergence was achieved on the validation set.

We evaluate the performance of our classification models using top-K accuracy, which extracts the K-predicted classes with the largest probabilities for each input sample and compares them with the ground-truth class label of the sample. If the ground-truth label is among the top-K predictions then the model counts it as a correct classification. The total counts are then divided by the total number of input samples to yield an average. We report test results of the best model from validation

## 6 Conclusion

We have described a set of six novel BIOSCAN datasets, on which we conducted image-based classification experiments using the taxonomic annotations of the insects. Looking ahead, iBOL's ongoing efforts will lead to further advancements in several aspects. The rate of insect sample collection is already increasing, resulting in a dataset that is not only larger in terms of the number of records but also more comprehensive, with additional taxa at lower taxonomic levels such as genera and species. Moreover, the dataset will expand to encompass diverse life forms beyond insects. Thus, while the current dataset is already the largest publicly available insect image dataset, it represents just the beginning of what lies ahead.
