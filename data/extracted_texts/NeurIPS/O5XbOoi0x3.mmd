###### Abstract

Recently, a series of diffusion-aware distillation algorithms have emerged to alleviate the computational overhead associated with the multi-step inference process of Diffusion Models (DMs). Current distillation techniques often dichotomize into two distinct aspects: i) ODE Trajectory Preservation; and ii) ODE Trajectory Reformulation. However, these approaches suffer from severe performance degradation or domain shifts. To address these limitations, we propose **Hyper-SD**, a

novel framework that synergistically amalgamates the advantages of ODE Trajectory Preservation and Reformulation, while maintaining near-lossless performance during step compression. Firstly, we introduce Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation to progressively perform consistent distillation within pre-defined time-step segments, which facilitates the preservation of the original ODE trajectory from a higher-order perspective. Secondly, we incorporate human feedback learning to boost the performance of the model in a low-step regime and mitigate the performance loss incurred by the distillation process. Thirdly, we integrate score distillation to further improve the low-step generation capability of the model and offer the first attempt to leverage a unified LoRA to support the inference process at all steps. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate that Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance from 1 to 8 inference steps for both SDXL and SD1.5. For example, Hyper-SDXL surpasses SDXL-Lightning by _+0.68_ in CLIP Score and _+0.51_ in Aes Score in the 1-step inference.

## 1 Introduction

Diffusion models (DMs) have gained significant prominence in the field of Generative AI [9; 25; 20; 24], but they are burdened by the computational requirements[36; 12] associated with multi-step inference procedures [27; 10]. To overcome these challenges and fully exploit the capabilities of DMs, several distillation methods have been proposed [27; 32; 46; 10; 16; 29; 14; 40; 28], which can be categorized into two main groups: trajectory-preserving distillation and trajectory-reformulating distillation.

Trajectory-preserving distillation techniques are designed to maintain the original trajectory of an ordinary differential equation (ODE) [27; 46]. The primary objective of these methods is to enable student models to make further predictions on the flow and reduce the overall number of inference steps. These techniques prioritize the preservation of similarity between the outputs of the distilled model and the original model. Adversarial losses can also be employed to enhance the accuracy of supervised guidance in the distillation process . However, it is important to note that, despite their benefits, trajectory-preserved distillation approaches may suffer from a decrease in generation quality due to inevitable errors in model fitting.

Trajectory-reformulating methods directly utilize the endpoint of the ODE flow or real images as the primary source of supervision, disregarding the intermediate steps of the trajectory [16; 29; 28]. By reconstructing more efficient trajectories, these methods can also reduce the number of inference steps. Trajectory-reformulating approaches enable the exploration of the model's potential within a limited number of steps, liberating it from the constraints of the original trajectory. However, it can lead to inconsistencies between the accelerated model and the original model's output domain, often resulting in undesired effects.

To navigate these hurdles and harness the full potential of DMs, we present an advanced framework that adeptly combines trajectory-preserving and trajectory-reformulating distillation techniques. Firstly, we proposed trajectory segmented consistency distillation (TSCD), which divides the time steps into segments and enforces consistency within each segment while gradually reducing the number of segments to achieve all-time consistency. This approach addresses the issue of suboptimal consistency model performance caused by insufficient model fitting capability and accumulated errors in inference. Secondly, we leverage human feedback learning techniques [37; 44; 23] to optimize the accelerated model, modifying the ODE trajectories to better suit few-step inference. This results in significant performance improvements, even surpassing the capabilities of the original model in some scenarios. Thirdly, we enhanced the one-step generation performance using score distillation [35; 40], achieving the idealized all-time consistent model via a unified LoRA.

In summary, our main contributions are summarized as follows: **1) Accelerate**: we propose TSCD that achieves a more fine-grained and high-order consistency distillation approach for the original score-based model. **2) Boost**: we incorpoate human feedback learning to further enhance model performance in low-steps regime. **3) Unify**: we provide a unified LORA as the all-time consistency model and support inference at all NTEs. **4) Performance**: Hyper-SD achieves SOTA performance in low-steps inference for both SDXL and SD1.5.

Preliminaries

For completeness, the preliminaries on diffusion model are provided in Appendix A.

### Diffusion Model Distillation

As mentioned in Sec. 1, current techniques for distilling Diffusion Models (DMs) can be broadly categorized into two approaches: one that preserves the Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory [27; 32; 46; 10], and another that reformulates it [29; 14; 40; 28].

Here, we provide a concise overview of some representative categories of methods. For clarity, we define the teacher model as \(f_{tea}\), the student model as \(f_{stu}\), noise as \(\), prompt condition as \(c\), off-the-shelf ODE Solver as \((,,)\), the total training timesteps as \(T\), the num of inference timesteps as \(N\), the noised trajectory point as \(x_{t}\) and the skipping-step as \(s\), where \(t_{0}<t_{1}<t_{N-1}=T\), \(t_{n}-t_{n-1}=s\), \(n\) uniformly distributed over \(\{1,2,,N-1\}\).

**Progressive Distillation.** Progressive Distillation (PD)  trains the student model \(f_{stu}\) approximate the subsequent flow locations determined by the teacher model \(f_{tea}\) over a sequence of steps.

Considering a 2-step PD for illustration, the target prediction \(_{t_{n-2}}\) by \(f_{tea}\) is obtained through the following calculations:

\[_{t_{n-1}}=(x_{t_{n}},f_{tea}(x_{t_{n}},t_{n},c),t_{n-1}),\] (1) \[_{t_{n-2}}=(_{t_{n-1}},f_{tea}(_{t_{n-1} },t_{n-1},c),t_{n-2}),\] (2)

And the training loss is

\[_{PD}=\|_{t_{n-2}}-(x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{ n},c),t_{n-2})\|_{2}^{2}\] (3)

**Consistency Distillation.** Consistency Distillation (CD)  directly maps \(x_{t_{n}}\) along the ODE trajectory to its endpoint \(x_{0}\). The training loss is defined as :

\[_{CD}=\|(x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{n},c),0)-(_ {t_{n-1}},f_{stu}^{-}(_{t_{n-1}},t_{n-1},c),0)\|_{2}^{2}\] (4)

where \(f_{stu}^{-}\) is the exponential moving average(EMA) of \(f_{stu}\) and \(_{t_{n-1}}\) is the next flow location estimated by \(f_{tea}\) with the same function as Eq. (1).

The Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM)  was introduced to minimize accumulated estimation errors and discretization inaccuracies prevalent in multi-step consistency model sampling. Diverging from targeting the endpoint \(x_{0}\), CTM targets any intermediate point \(x_{t_{end}}\) within the range \(0 t_{end} t_{n-1}\), thus redefining the loss function as:

\[_{CTM}=\|(x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{n},c),t_{end})-( _{t_{n-1}},f_{stu}^{-}(_{t_{n-1}},t_{n-1},c),t_{end})\|_{2}^{2}\] (5)

**Adversarial Diffusion Distillation.** In contrast to PD and CD, Adversarial Distillation (ADD), proposed in SDXL-Turbo  and SD3-Turbo , bypasses the ODE trajectory and directly focuses on the original state \(x_{0}\) using adversarial objective. The generative and discriminative loss components are computed as follows:

\[_{ADD}^{G}=-[D((x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{ n},c),0))]\] (6)

\[_{ADD}^{D}=[D((x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{ n},c),0))]-[D(x_{0})]\] (7)

where \(D\) denotes the discriminator, tasked with differentiating between \(x_{0}\) and \((x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{n},c),0)\). The target \(x_{0}\) can be sampled from real or synthesized data.

**Score Distillation Sampling.** Score distillation sampling(SDS) was integrated into diffusion distillation in SDXL-Turbo and Diffusion Matching Distillation(DMD). SDXL-Turbo utilizes \(f_{tea}\) to estimate the score to the real distribution, while DMD further introduced a fake distribution simulator \(f_{fake}\) to calibrate the score direction and uses the output distribution of the original model as the real distribution, thus achieving one-step inference.

Leveraging the DMD approach, the gradient of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the real and fake distributions is approximated by the equation:

\[ D_{KL}=}_{z(0,I) \\ x=f_{stu}(z)}[-(f_{real}(x)-f_{fake}(x)) f_{stu}(z)],\] (8)

where \(z\) is a random latent variable sampled from a standard normal distribution. This methodology enables the one-step diffusion model to refine its generative process, minimizing the KL divergence to produce images that are progressively closer to the teacher model's distribution.

### Human Feedback Learning

ReFL [37; 13; 44] has been proven to be an effective method to learn from human feedback designed for diffusion models. It primarily includes two stages: (1) reward model training and (2) preference fine-tuning. In the first stage, given the human preference data pair, \(x_{w}\) (preferred generation) and \(x_{l}\) (unpreferred one), a reward model \(r_{}\) is trained via the loss:

\[()_{rm}=-_{(c,x_{w},x_{l})}[log( (r_{}(c,x_{w})-r_{}(c,x_{l})))]\] (9)

where \(\) denotes the collected feedback data, \(()\) represents the sigmoid function, and \(c\) corresponds to the text prompt. The reward model \(r_{}\) is optimized to produce reward scores that align with human preferences. In the second stage, ReFL starts with an input prompt \(c\), and a randomly initialized latent \(x_{T}=z\). The latent is then iteratively denoised until reaching a randomly selected timestep \(t_{n}[t_{left},t_{right}]\), when a denoised image \(x^{}_{0}\) is directly predicted from \(x_{t_{n}}\). The \(t_{left}\) and \(t_{right}\) are predefined boundaries. The reward model is then applied to this denoised image, generating the expected preference score \(r_{}(c,x^{}_{0})\), which is used to fine-tuned the diffusion model:

\[()_{refl}=_{c p(c)}_{x^{}_{0}  p(x^{}_{0}|c)}[-r(x^{}_{0},c)]\] (10)

## 3 Method

In this study, we have integrated both the ODE-preserve and ODE-reformulate distillation techniques into a unified framework, yielding significant advancements in accelerating diffusion models. In Sec. 3.1, we propose an innovative approach to consistency distillation that employs a time-steps segmentation strategy, thereby facilitating trajectory segmented consistency distillation. In Sec. 3.2, we incorporate human feedback learning techniques to further enhance the performance of accelerated diffusion models. In Sec. 3.3, we achieve all-time consistency including one-step by utilizing the score-based distribution matching distillation.

### Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation

Both Consistency Distillation (CD)  and Consistency Trajectory Model (CTM)  aim to transform a diffusion model into a consistency model across the entire timestep range \([0,T]\) through single-stage distillation. However, these distilled models often fall short of optimality due to limitations in model fitting capacity. Drawing inspiration from the soft consistency target introduced in CTM, we refine the training process by dividing the entire time-steps range \([0,T]\) into \(k\) segments and performing segment-wise consistent model distillation progressively.

In the first stage, we set \(k=8\) and use the original diffusion model to initiate \(f_{stu}\) and \(f_{tea}\). The starting timesteps \(t_{n}\) are uniformly and randomly sampled from \(\{t_{1},t_{2},,t_{N-1}\}\). We then sample ending timesteps \(t_{end}[t_{b},t_{n-1}]\), where \(t_{b}\) is computed as:

\[t_{b}=}{} ,\] (11)

and the training loss is calculated as:

\[L_{TSCD}=d((x_{t_{n}},f_{stu}(x_{t_{n}},t_{n},c),t_{end}),(_{t _{n-1}},f^{-}_{stu}(_{t_{n-1}},t_{n-1},c),t_{end}))\] (12)

where \(_{t_{n-1}}\) refers to Eq. (1), and \(f^{-}_{stu}\) denotes the Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of \(f_{stu}\).

Subsequently, we resume the model weights from the previous stage and continue to train \(f_{stu}\), progressively reducing \(k\) to \(\). It is noteworthy that \(k=1\) corresponds to the standard CTM training protocol. For the distance metric \(d\), we employ a hybrid of adversarial loss, as proposed in sdxl-lightning, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss. Empirically, we observe that MSE Loss is more effective when the predictions and target values are proximate (e.g., for \(k=8,4\)), whereas adversarial loss proves more precise as the divergence between predictions and targets increases (e.g., for \(k=2,1\)). Accordingly, we dynamically increase the weight of the adversarial loss and diminish that of the MSE loss across the training stages. Additionally, we have integrated a noise perturbation mechanism  to reinforce training stability. Take the two-stage Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation (TSCD) process as an example. As shown in Fig. 2, the first stage executesindependent consistency distillations within the time segments \([0,]\) and \([,T]\). Based on the previous two-segment consistency distillation results, a global consistency trajectory distillation is then performed.

The TSCD method offers two principal advantages: Firstly, fine-grained segment distillation reduces model fitting complexity and minimizes errors, thus mitigating degradation in generation quality. Secondly, it ensures the preservation of the original ODE trajectory. Models from each training stage can be utilized for inference at corresponding steps while closely mirroring the original model's generation quality. We illustrate the complete procedure of Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation in Appendix B. It is worth noting that, by utilizing Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA) technology, we train TSCD models as plug-and-play plugins that can be used instantly.

### Human Feedback Learning

In addition to the distillation, we propose to incorporate feedback learning further to boost the performance of the accelerated diffusion models. In particular, we improve the generation quality of the accelerated models by exploiting the feedback drawn from both human aesthetic preferences and existing visual perceptual models. For the feedback on aesthetics, we utilize the LAION aesthetic predictor and the aesthetic preference reward model provided by ImageNet to steer the model toward the higher aesthetic generation as:

\[()_{aes}=_{c p(c)}_{x^{}_ {0} p(x^{}_{0}|c)}[(_{d}-r_{d}(x^{}_{0},c))]\] (13)

where \(r_{d}\) is the aesthetic reward model, including the aesthetic predictor of the LAION dataset and ImageNet model, \(c\) is the textual prompt and \(_{d}\) together with ReLU function works as a hinge loss.

Beyond the feedback from aesthetic preference, we notice that the existing visual perceptual model embedded in rich prior knowledge about the reasonable image can also serve as a good feedback provider. Empirically, we found that the instance segmentation model can guide the model to generate entities with reasonable structure. To be specific, instead of starting from a random initialized latent, we first diffuse the noise on an image \(x_{0}\) in the latent space to \(x_{t}\) according to Eq. (16), and then, we execute denoise iteratively until a specific timestep \(d_{t}\) and directly predict a \(x^{{}^{}}_{0}\) similar to . Subsequently, we leverage perceptual instance segmentation models to evaluate the performance of structure generation by examining the perceptual discrepancies between the ground truth image instance annotation and the predicted results on the denoised image as:

\[()_{percep}=}{}\ _{instance}((m_{I}(x^{{}^{}}_{0})),GT(x_{0}))\] (14)

where \(m_{I}\) is the instance segmentation model(e.g. SOLO ). The instance segmentation model can capture the structure defect of the generated image more accurately and provide a more targeted feedback signal. It is noteworthy that besides the instance segmentation model, other perceptual models are also applicable and we are actively investigating the utilization of advanced large visual perception models(e.g. SAM) to provide enhanced feedback learning. Such perceptual models can work as complementary feedback for the subjective aesthetic focusing more on the objective

Figure 2: An illustration of the two-stage Trajectory Segmented Consistency Distillation. The first stage involves consistency distillation in two separate time segments: \([0,]\) and \([,T]\) to obtain the two segments consistency ODE. Then, this ODE trajectory is adopted to train a global consistency model in the subsequent stage.

generation quality. Therefore, we optimize the diffusion models with the feedback signal as:

\[()_{feedback}=()_{acs}+()_{ percep}\] (15)

Human feedback learning can improve model performance but may unintentionally alter the output domain, which is not always desirable. Therefore, we also trained human feedback learning knowledge as a plugin using LoRA technology. By employing the LoRA merge technique with the TSCD LoRAs discussed in Section3.1, we can achieve a flexible balance between generation quality and output domain similarity.

### One-step Generation Enhancement

One-step generation within the consistency model framework is not ideal due to the inherent limitations of consistency loss. As analyzed in Fig. 3, the consistency distilled model demonstrates superior accuracy in guiding towards the trajectory endpoint \(x_{0}\) at position \(x_{t}\). Therefore, score distillation is a suitable and efficient way to boost the one-step generation of our TSCD models.

Specifically, we advance one-step generation with an optimized Distribution Matching Distillation (DMD) technique . DMD enhances the model's output by leveraging two distinct score functions: \(f_{real}(x)\) from the teacher model's distribution and \(f_{fake}(x)\) from the fake model. We incorporate a Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss alongside the score-based distillation to promote training stability. The human feedback learning technique mentioned in Sec. 3.2 is also integrated, fine-tuning our models to efficiently produce images of exceptional fidelity.

After enhancing the one-step inference capability of the TSCD model, we can obtain an ideal global consistency model. Employing the TCD scheduler, the enhanced model can perform inference from 1 to 8 steps. Our approach eliminates the need for model conversion to x0-prediction, enabling the implementation of the one-step LoRA plugin. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our **one-step LoRA** in Sec 4.3. Additionally, smaller time-step inputs can enhance the credibility of the one-step diffusion model in predicting the noise . Therefore, we also employed this technique to train a dedicated model for single-step generation.

## 4 Experiments

### Implementation Details

**Dataset.** We use a subset of the LAION  and COYO  datasets following SDXL-lightning  during the training procedure of Sec 3.1 and Sec 3.3. For the Human Feedback Learning in Sec 3.2, we utilized the COCO2017 train split dataset with instance annotations and captions for structure optimization.

**Training Setting.** For TSCD in Sec 3.1, we progressively reduced the time-steps segments number as \(8 4 2 1\) in four stages, employing 512 batch size and learning rate \(1e-6\). We take the SOLO  as the instance segmentation model to achieve feedback learning in Sec 3.2. Our training per stage costs around 200 A100 GPU hours. We trained LoRA instead of UNet for all the distillation stages for convenience, and the corresponding LoRA is loaded to process the human feedback learning optimization in Sec 3.2. For one-step enhancement in Sec 3.3, we trained the unified all-timesteps consistency LoRA with time-step inputs \(T=999\) and the dedicated model for single-step generation with \(T=800\).

**Baseline Models.** We conduct our experiments on the stable-diffusion-v1-5 (SD15)  and stable-diffusion-xl-v1.0-base (SDXL) . To demonstrate the superiority of our method in acceleration, we compared our method with various existing acceleration schemes as shown in Tab. 1.

**Evaluation Metrics.** We use the aesthetic predictor pre-trained on the LAION dataset and CLIP score(ViT-B/32) to evaluate the visual appeal of the generated image and the text-to-image alignment. We further include some recently proposed metrics, such as ImageNet score , and Pickscore  to offer a more comprehensive evaluation of the model performance. In addition to these, due to the inherently subjective nature of image generation evaluation, we conduct an extensive user study to evaluate the performance more accurately.

### Main Results

**Quantitative Comparison.** We quantitatively compare our method with both the baseline and diffusion-based distillation approaches in terms of objective metrics. The evaluation is performed on COCO-5k  dataset with both SD15 (512px) and SDXL (1024px) architectures. As shown in Tab. 2, our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art across all metrics on both resolutions. In particular, compared to the two baseline models, we achieve better aesthetics (including AesScore, ImageReward and PickScore) with only LoRA and fewer steps. As for the CLIPScore that evaluates image-text matching, we outperform other methods by +0.1 faithfully and are also closest to the baseline model, which demonstrates the effectiveness of our human feedback learning.

**Qualitative Comparison.** We present comprehensive visual comparison with recent approaches, including LCM , TCD , PeRFLow , Turbo  and Lightning . Our observations can be summarized as follows. **(1)** Thanks to the fact that SDXL has almost 2.6B parameters, the model is able to synthesis decent images in 4 steps after different distillation algorithms. Our method further utilizes its huge model capacity to compress the number of steps required for high-quality outcomes to 1 step only, and far outperforms other methods in terms of style (a), aesthetics (b-c) and image-text matching (d) as indicated in Fig. 4. **(2)** On the contrary, limited by the capacity of SD15 model, the images generated by other approaches tend to exhibit severe quality degradation. While our Hyper-SD consistently yields better results across different types of user prompts, including photographic (a), realistic (b-c) and artstyles (d) as depicted in Appendix C.1. **(3)** To further release the potential of our methodology, we also conduct experiments on the fully fine-tuning of SDXL model following previous works [14; 29]. As shown in Appendix C.2, our 1-Step UNet again demonstrates superior generation quality that far exceeds the rest of the opponents. Both in terms of colorization (a-b) and details (c-d), our images are more presentable and attractive when it comes to the real-world application scenarios.

**User Study.** To verify the effectiveness of our proposed Hyper-SD, we conduct an extensive user study across various settings and approaches. As presented in Fig. 5, our method (red in left) obtains significantly more user preferences than others (blue in right). Specifically, our Hyper-SD15 has achieved more than a two-thirds advantage against the same architectures. The only exception is that SD21-Turbo  was able to get significantly closer to our generation quality in one-step inference by means of a larger training dataset of SD21 model as well as fully fine-tuning. Notably, we found that we obtained a higher preference with less inference steps compared to both the baseline SD15 and SDXL models, which once again confirms the validity of our human feedback learning. Moreover, our 1-Step UNet shows a higher preference than LoRA against the same UNet-based approaches (i.e. SDXL-Turbo  and SDXL-Lightning ), which is also consistent with the analyses of previous quantitative and qualitative comparisons. This demonstrates the excellent scalability of our method when more parameters are fine-tuned.

### Ablation Study

In Tab. 3, we provide ablation studies on TSCD and human feedback with quantitative evaluation.

**Effect of TSCD.** Without the utilization of human feedback, the results show that our proposed TSCD outperforms the baseline TCD  significantly when inference step is lower, while the performance approaches the same as the step increases. This demonstrates the effectiveness of our progressive strategy that alleviates the training difficulties when the step is extremely low.

**Effect of Human Feedback.** To verify the benefit of incorporating reward models, we also conduct experiments ablating on human feedback learning of different steps. As shown in Tab. 3, the

Figure 9: Our unified LoRAs are compatible with ControlNet. The examples are conditioned on either scribble or canny images.

### Compatibility with Base Model

Figure 10: Our LoRAs with different steps can be applied to different base models and consistently generate high-quality images.

More ablation studies against TCD

To prove the effectiveness of TSCD against TCD, we conduct extra experiments on TCD+RLHF and TCD+DMD in Tab. 5. The results show that our TSCD demonstrates superior performance consistently over different training settings, which prove the robustness of TSCD with reduced training difficulty and less accumulation errors.

## Appendix E Discussion and Limitation

Hyper-SD demonstrates promising results in generating high-quality images with few inference steps and could benefit various downstream tasks such as semi-supervised learning [43; 41], domain adaptation [31; 17], retrieval [42; 18], etc. However, there are several avenues for further improvement:

**Classifier Free Guidance**: the CFG properties of diffusion models allow for improving model performance and mitigating explicit content, such as pornography, by adjusting negative prompts. However, most diffusion acceleration methods [32; 46; 29; 14; 40; 28] including ours, eliminated the CFG characteristics, restricting the utilization of negative cues and imposing usability limitations. Therefore, in future work, we aim to retain the functionality of negative cues while accelerating the model, enhancing both generation effectiveness and security.

**Customized Human Feedback Optimization**: this work employed the generic reward models for feedback learning. Future work will focus on customized feedback learning strategies designed specifically for accelerated models to enhance their performance.

**Diffusion Transformer Architecture**: Recent studies have demonstrated the significant potential of DIT in image generation, we will focus on the DIT architecture to explore superior few-steps generative diffusion models in our future work.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: In both the abstract and the introduction we break down the contributions of this paper. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: The limitation of this paper is well discussed in Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: The formulation of our proposed TSCD algorithm is presented in Algorithm 1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Implementation details can be found in Sec. 4.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code** Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material?Answer: [Yes] Justification: All checkpoints and code to reproduce our results would be publicly available in our project page. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Implementation details can be found in Sec. 4.1. All checkpoints and code to reproduce our results would be publicly available in our project page. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [No] Justification: The evaluation metrics adopted in this paper do not measure accuracy but text-to-image alignment and aesthetics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions). * The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Implementation details can be found in Sec. 4.1. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper definitely do not violate any Code Of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: Please refer to Appendix E. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: This paper poses no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licensees for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All assets used in this paper are explicitly mentioned. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: All checkpoints and code to reproduce our results would be publicly available in our project page. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [No] Justification: This paper involved a user study for image quality evaluation in Sec 4.2. The full text of the instructions given to participants consists of only one sentence: "Given the two images below, which one do you prefer?" Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [No] Justification: This paper does not have potential risks incurred by study participants. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
