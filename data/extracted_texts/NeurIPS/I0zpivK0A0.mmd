###### Abstract

Since the inception of our planet, the meteorological environment, as reflected through spatio-temporal data, has always been a fundamental factor influencing human life, socio-economic progress, and ecological conservation. A comprehensive exploration of this data is thus imperative to gain a deeper understanding and more accurate forecasting of these environmental shifts. Despite the success of deep learning techniques within the realm of spatio-temporal data and earth science, existing public datasets are best with limitations in terms of spatial scale, temporal coverage, and reliance on limited time series data. These constraints hinder their optimal utilization in practical applications. To address these issues, we introduce Terra, a multimodal spatio-temporal dataset spanning the earth. This dataset encompasses hourly time series data from 6,480,000 grid areas worldwide over the past 45 years, while also incorporating multimodal spatial supplementary information including geo-images and explanatory text. Through a detailed data analysis and evaluation of existing deep learning models within earth sciences, utilizing our constructed dataset. we aim to provide valuable opportunities for enhancing future research in spatio-temporal data mining, thereby advancing towards more spatio-temporal general intelligence. Our source code and data can be accessed at https://github.com/CityMind-Lab/NeurIPS24-Terra.

## 1 Introduction

With the rapid development of remote sensing satellite systems , radar monitoring devices , and various advanced geographical observation technologies, spatio-temporal data , particularly those pertaining to the Earth's environment and climate, are becoming increasingly available. Analyzing and mining valuable knowledge from such spatio-temporal data is crucial for many real-world applications, including environmental monitoring , disaster management , urban planning , and climate change assessment . In the era of sensory artificial intelligence, an array of methods has been devised, ranging from conventional time series and spatial statistical analysis tools  to cutting-edge spatio-temporal deep learning models , for the analysis and utilization of domain-specific data. Despite remarkable achievements, there remains a huge gap between mainstream spatio-temporal data mining research  and the recent shift towards artificial general intelligence research , where the latter aims to address various challenges in a unified manner, while the generalizability and scalability challenge still lies in the former.

What causes this gap, or in other words, what measures can be taken to further advance research in spatio-temporal general intelligence? From historical experience, comprehensive, large-scale, high-quality datasets are crucial for the progress of any research community in any field. For instance, the ImageNet dataset , which has historically driven the development of the Computer Vision community, and the Common Crawl dataset , which is currently fostering growth in themodel with billions parameters has led to remarkable breakthroughs in the generalization ability of vision and language models across various tasks [20; 63]. However, most of the work on spatio-temporal data mining focuses on developing advanced models , while neglecting the urgent need for comprehensive datasets themselves. Thus, there is an immediate necessity for a high-quality spatio-temporal dataset with sufficient breadth, granularity, capacity, and multimodal integration, allowing researchers to explore different methods at various scales and to move towards more general spatio-temporal intelligence.

To address these challenges, we introduce Terra, a public, large-scale, fine-grained, and multimodal dataset across spatio-temporal domains. The name is derived from the earth goddess in ancient Roman mythology. As shown in Figure 1, Terra rasterizes the Earth, integrates various data sources, and includes over 6820 billion hourly Earth meteorological observation time series data collected globally within raster grids from 1979 to 2024, as well as spatial multimodal geographic information supplements for all regions within global raster grids, including text descriptions and geographic images, aiming to advance spatio-temporal data analysis and spatial intelligence research. Specifically, Terra distinguishes itself significantly from previous spatio-temporal datasets with its comprehensive spatio-temporal coverage, outstanding quality, and diverse data modalities.

In summary, we condense its outstanding characteristics into three contributions: _(1) Large scale_, encompassing over 45 years of sequential observational information in terms of temporal range and global-level geographic information in terms of spatial range, ensuring the robustness, generalization, and reliability of models through large-scale data properties. _(2) Fine granularity_, supporting up to 3 hourly time granularity and up to 0.1\({}^{}\) resolution spatial grid records, ensuring the practical feasibility of real-world application scenarios through fine-grained data properties. _(3) Multi Modality_, unlike previous datasets that only consisted solely of spatio-temporal observation records without exogenous data, we further provide a variety of multimodal supplementary data, including rich text and image data, enabling the exploration of large language and vision models in this field, thereby enhancing the interpretability of models.

## 2 Background

In this section, we review relevant works in spatio-temporal data mining, focusing on its challenges, various applications, and the limitations of existing datasets that support research in this field. It is worth noting that we particularly emphasize data types related to earth sciences. Other types of spatio-temporal data, such as vision-based video data , are beyond the scope of this paper.

### Challenges and Applications of Spatio-Temporal Data Mining

Spatio-temporal data mining represents an interdisciplinary fusion of various fields such as spatio-temporal databases, machine learning, statistics, geography, meteorology, and information theory . Specifically, spatio-temporal data refer to types of geographic entity data that exist at different scales

Figure 1: Overview of Terra and its application in spatio-temporal data intelligence.

with spatio-temporal associations. These include spatial relationships, both metric (_e.g._, distance) and non-metric (_e.g._, topology, flow, and shape), temporal relationships (_e.g._, before or after), and spatio-temporal relationships (_e.g._, correlation and heterogeneity) that are explicitly or implicitly present in the data. In recent years, deep learning models such as recurrent neural networks , convolutional neural networks , and graph neural networks  achieve remarkable success in capturing the temporal and spatial dependencies in spatio-temporal data. These efforts lead to significant advances in various fields. For example, they have broad applications in environmental and climate areas (_e.g._, precipitation forecasting  and air quality inference ), urban planning (_e.g._, traffic flow prediction  and anomaly detection ), and human mobility (_e.g._, travel recommendations  and personalized marketing ). However, applying deep models to spatio-temporal data is often more challenging. Firstly, spatio-temporal data are usually embedded in continuous space, different from the discrete space common in vision and language data. Secondly, spatio-temporal data often have high auto-correlation, contrasting with the traditional i.i.d. assumption of data samples. Lastly, spatio-temporal data have different scales of spatial and temporal resolution, and models trained on limited data often lack generalizability. Recently, with the success of foundational models [52; 18] (_e.g._, large language models [11; 42] and diffusion models [67; 87]), researchers are exploring the construction of spatio-temporal foundational models to revolutionize this field. The aim is to achieve zero-shot inference and robust generalizability across different spatio-temporal tasks. For instance, in meteorological forecasting, Pangu  and GraphCast  provide unprecedented forecasting capabilities through pre-training on massive climate data. In urban computing , some studies [50; 51] combine the capabilities of large models to pioneer the development of foundational models for traffic. All these advancements enable researchers to uncover valuable insights into spatio-temporal patterns, continuously optimize the Earth's environmental systems, promote human economic and social development, and contribute to extensive interdisciplinary research.

### Limitations of Existing Spatio-Temporal Datasets

Table 1 presents a comparison between the proposed Terra and other popular or latest spatio-temporal datasets. We next detail the improvements of Terra over others from five aspects.

* **Incomplete Analytical Perspectives:** Widely adopted datasets such as GeoLife , and more recent ones like GEO-Bench  and CityScape , have significantly contributed to spatial analysis research, including location recommendation and urban region analysis. At the same time, researchers have also performed various temporal analyses on time-series data like GluonTS , including tasks like prediction, imputation, and anomaly detection. However, these datasets are often only able to focus on singular spatial or temporal analyses. _In contrast, Terra offers comprehensive possibilities for spatio-temporal analysis from both perspectives._

    &  &  &  &  &  &  \\   & & & & Spatial & Temporal & & Time Series & Text & Image \\  Geolife  & 2010 & ✓ & 24M+ & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ \\  GluonTS  & 2020 & ✓ & 16M & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ \\  NYC  & 2019 & ✓ & 22M+ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ \\  PEMS  & 2020 & ✓ & 42M+ & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ \\  SEVIR  & 2020 & ✓ & \(\) & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ & ✓ \\  ML4Road  & 2024 & ✓ & 9M+ & \(\) & \(\) & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ \\  BioMassters  & 2024 & ✓ & 79M+ & ✗ & \(\) & ✓ & ✗ & ✓ & ✗ \\  ClimateSet  & 2024 & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & \(\) & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ \\  ClinSim  & 2024 & ✓ & 5.7B+ & ✓ & ✓ & \(\) & ✓ & ✓ & ✗ \\  Digital Typhoon  & 2024 & ✓ & 49B+ & \(\) & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & \(\) & ✗ \\  Mesogeos  & 2024 & ✓ & 1344B+ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & \(\) & \(\) \\  GEO-Bench  & 2024 & ✓ & \(\) & ✓� & ✗ & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ \\  CityScape  & 2024 & ✗ & 65K+ & ✗ & ✓ & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ \\  ChatEarthNet  & 2024 & ✓ & \(\) & ✓� & ✓� & ✗ & ✗ & ✓ & ✓ \\  Terra (ours) & 2024 & ✓ & 6820B+ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ & ✓ \\   

Table 1: Comparisons between Terra and other spatio-temporal datasets. Here, ✓ represents meeting a better standard, � represents not meeting it, and \(\) represents partially meeting or being convertible to meet it. Due to the difficulty of counting sizes from multiple data sources, we mark it with \(\).

* **Restricted Access Opportunities:** Early spatial-temporal datasets often focused on human mobility (_e.g._, Geolife  and NYC ) and intelligent transportation (_e.g._, PEMS  and ML4Road ). However, these datasets typically involve privacy concerns and are held by a few companies or organizations with proprietary or restrictive access policies, resulting in restricted access to small datasets. Therefore, recent benchmarks has shifted towards spatio-temporal data in freely accessible fields such as Earth Sciences, leading to the emergence of numerous datasets such as BioMasters , ChatEarthNet , _etc. Similarly, Terra also benefits from this shift, allowing free access to these massive spatio-temporal data._
* **Limited Spatio-Temporal Coverage:** Due to the labor and financial costs associated with data collection, existing datasets are often confined to specific cities or regions. Early examples, including NYC  and PEMS , generally cover only a few months of data for a single city or region. Recent earth science datasets, like SEVIR , Mesogeos  and Digital Typhoon , have significantly increased in scale but still struggle to achieve global coverage over several decades. This limitation results in insufficient geographic representation, impeding generalizability to other regions, and inadequate temporal representation, failing to capture seasonal or annual trends. _In contrast, Terra offers global spatial coverage and over 45 years of temporal coverage._
* **Limited Spatio-Temporal Resolution:** Although some recent spatial-temporal datasets have reached considerable scales, they still fail to provide sufficiently granular spatial-temporal resolution. For instance, ClimateSet  only offers monthly climate records. These low sampling rates and resolutions further diminish their practical utility. _In contrast, Terra provides resolutions up to 0.1\({}^{}\) spatially and 3-hour intervals temporally._
* **Limited Multimodal Supplement:** Existing datasets often provide only basic spatial-temporal sequences, such as ClimSim , lacking rich multimodal supplementary information like text or images. This deficiency hinders comprehensive analysis and fails to meet the requirements for multimodal or advanced model design. _In contrast, Terra provides global-scale visual and textual information, serving as potential components for building foundational spatial-temporal models.

## 3 Dataset Details

In this section, we formally introduce our proposed Terra dataset. As shown in Figure 2, our dataset consists of three modalities, each containing different types of data. We describe in detail the collection and processing methods of different modality data below to deepen the understanding of Terra. For more data introduction, analysis, statistics, visualization, and statement, see Appendix A.

Figure 2: Different modality components of Terra. We provide the data with three temporal scales (3 hourly / daily / monthly), and three spatial scale (0.1\({}^{}\) / 0.5\({}^{}\) / 1\({}^{}\)).

**Time Series Modality.** We obtain the time-series modality data for Terra from the _Global Water (GloH2O) Measurement Project_. Specifically, we combine the past observation records from two products: Multi-Source Weather (MSWX) and Multi-Source Weighted-Ensemble Precipitation (MSWEP). MSWX is an operational high-resolution (3 hours, 0.1\({}^{}\)), bias-corrected meteorological product, covering the global range from 1979 to 5 days before real-time. This product includes 10 meteorological variables: precipitation (mm/3h), air temperature (\({}^{}\)C), daily minimum and maximum temperatures (\({}^{}\)C), surface pressure (Pa), relative and specific humidity (% and g/g), wind speed (m/s), and downward shortwave and longwave radiation (W/m\({}^{2}\)). As shown on the left side of Figure 2, we exclude the daily minimum and maximum temperatures due to their limited resolution. MSWEP, a global precipitation product, spans from 1979 to 3 hours before real-time with a resolution of 3 hours and 0.1\({}^{}\). Unlike MSWX, MSWEP uniquely combines gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data to provide the highest quality precipitation estimates at each location. Since MSWEP includes satellite data, its precipitation estimates may be more accurate than those of MSWX in regions with dense measurements and convection-dominated areas. Therefore, we replace MSWX precipitation records with MSWEP values. We select a time span covering 45 years from [01/01/1979 to 01/01/2024), equivalent to 540 months or 16,436 days. As a result, we obtain the largest dataset with a resolution of 0.1\({}^{}\), 3 hours, and a total of 6.82e+12 numerical records. Based on this, we further resample and combine the data at spatial resolutions of 0.5\({}^{}\) and 1\({}^{}\) and temporal resolutions of daily and monthly. This process yields a total of 9 variant, with the number of records for each dataset shown in Figure 3.

**Text Modality.** We first obtain the geographic text data within each raster region, mainly including climate, mean elevation, land vegetation, and the countries included. Specifically, We crawl the climate metadata from _Koppen climate classification project_, which reveal variations and changes of climate over the period 1901-2010. Given the slow pace of climate change, we utilize this data to represent current climate values. Climate types are represented by a two or three-letter combination, where the first letter denotes the major type (_e_.\(g\)., tropical, dry, snow), and the second letter or third letter specifies subcategories (_e_.\(g\)., fully humid, desert). Global elevation values are queried from _ETOPO2v2_, which combines topography, bathymetry, and shoreline data from both regional and global sources, enabling detailed, high-resolution renderings of the Earth's geophysical characteristics. We take the average of all data points within the indexed region, referred to as the mean elevation of the current indexed region. We also crawl Land Cover data from the _C3S Global Land Cover Product_, which classifies land cover into 38 categories (_e_.\(g\)., cropland_raifield and tree_broadleaved_deciduous_closed). we use data for 2022 year. For the land cover and climate type, we calculate the proportion within each region and provide it in percentage form. Regarding the country's affiliation, we referred to data from the world-geo-json repository . Although these meta texts partially reflect the region's geographical characteristics, they lack comprehensive analysis and inference of potential spatial features (_e_.\(g\)., how land cover types influence the area's climate and rainfall patterns). Recently, large language models (LLMs) have become essential for enhancing spatio-temporal data due to their integrated geographical knowledge, compressed through pre-training on extensive corpora . Consequently, we employ the state-of-the-art open-source language

model LLaMA3  to generate supplementary textual information. Given the open challenge of hallucinations in LLMs , resulting inaccuracies can introduce noise into downstream tasks. To mitigate this problem, we designed a spatial prompt engineering, as shown in Figure 4. This technique suggests querying factual meta text-related to country, climate, land vegetation, and mean elevation characteristics as auxiliary prompts. This approach aims to provide LLMs with comprehensive information, facilitating more accurate extraction of surface environmental data. Figure 5 presents statistics and visual insights of the selected LLM text modality data. We also discuss the necessity of our prompting technique and compare different LLM choices in Appendix A.3.

**Image Modality.** We further adopt the Mercator projection  to map the Earth into grids at different spatial resolutions and crawl relevant geographic image information for each grid cell. Specifically, we first access geographic datasets provided by remote machines of GMT  and utilize the PyGMT  toolkit to draw geo-images according to specified longitude and latitude regions. In particular, we select common geographic images including Earth Geoid (coinciding with the mean sea level and extending into the interior of continents), Earth Free-Air Anomaly Errors (normalizing observed values and height correction, converting gravity values to gravity anomalies referenced to the same latitude geoid), Earth Magnetic Anomaly (obtained by subtracting the global magnetic field from the Earth's core main magnetic field and its induced magnetic field after subtracting the variable magnetic field, resulting in lithospheric magnetic field), Earth Mask (referring to surface water-land geographical features), Earth Relief (containing observed topography and terrain inferred through height gravity), Earth Vertical Gravity Gradient (referring to the vertical derivative of gravity for detecting geological structures and positions of small geological bodies). All these converted geo-images are commonly used for exploring Earth sciences and summarizing regional geographic information. Additionally, satellite remote sensing images are usually another excellent visual descriptive imagery of geographic information, apart from the aforementioned types, and can also be obtained for each grid under corresponding image information using ArcGIS .

**Discussion.** Despite our best efforts to obtain rich spatio-temporal data from multiple sources, several unavoidable issues still persist: Firstly, our image and text modalities still do not support a spatial resolution of 0.1\({}^{}\) due to the enormous time and monetary costs associated with this scale. Secondly, as we utilize LLM models to generate text data, the inevitable obsolescence of the latest LLM capabilities exists. Finally, the acquired satellite remote sensing images may have outdated and unstable redistribution restrictions. For the first issue, we hope to continually invest time and monetary resources to highlight higher-resolution text and image modal data in future versions. Regarding the second issue, we first empirically studied the suitability of existing generated text (see Appendix A.3) and look forward to regularly update and utilize the latest and best open-source LLM to generate new text data, selectively replacing existing text. For the third issue, we also suggest exploring alternative satellite image products from other open-source communities, such as Sentinel-2 , for updates.

**Potential Applications Summary.** We summarize a range of potential application scenarios for our proposed Terra dataset, encompassing but not limited to those enumerated in the Table 2. Spanning remote sensing, urban indicator prediction, time series forecasting, and beyond, the diverse modalities and extensive volume of the Terra dataset present limitless application possibilities. We aspire for the community to leverage Terra to foster significant advancements in spatial-temporal data mining.

## 4 Use Cases

To further demonstrate the practicality and versatility of our dataset, we have selected its use in two key tasks: spatio-temporal analysis and spatial analysis. These tasks are classical examples in spatio-temporal data mining, with the former providing insights into joint modeling of spatial and temporal, and the latter supporting common applications in spatial modeling. Through these simple application cases, our goal is to illustrate the versatility and usability of Terra.

### Spatio-Temporal Analysis Task

**Problem Definition.** Each record in a grid is a multivariate time series \(x^{T C}\), capturing dynamic observations of \(C\) measurement features over \(T\) time steps. Here, \(N\) regions with spatially correlated locations constitute a spatial-otemporal tensor \(X^{N T C}\). Spatio-temporal forecasting predicts signals \(X^{N T^{f} C}\) for \(T^{f}\) future time steps across \(N\) variables, utilizing \(T^{h}\) steps historical time series \(X^{N T^{h} C}\) (and an optional spatial correlation graph \(\) among recorded regions).

**Setup.** Here, we choose precipitation prediction as a representative example. We extract spatio-temporal precipitation sequences from time-series modality data with a temporal resolution of 1 day and spatial resolution of 1\({}^{}\), covering a temporal span of 26 years and global spatial extent, forming the _Global_ dataset. Subsequently, we construct five smaller country datasets representing five continents by selecting representative countries: the United Kingdom (_UK_), the United States (_USA_), China (_CN_), South Africa (_SA_), and Australia (_AUS_). For all datasets, we partition the dataset into training, validation and test sets as 6:2:2. Then, we select four categories of popular methods as baselines, including time-series models (**TimesNet**, **FEDformer**, **PatchTST**, **DLinear**), spatio-temporal prediction models (**STAEformer**, **STID**, **GWNet**, **STGCN**), precipitation-specific prediction model **ConvLSTM**, and historical mean method **HI**. For different methods, in order to adapt to the task, we make appropriate feature, structure and hyperparameter adjustments to achieve the best results. We conduct three prediction scenarios: predicting precipitation for the next 7, 15, and 30 days based on the historical 30-day precipitation sequences, using mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) to evaluate prediction performance. All experiments are conducted three times, and the mean values are reported. For more detailed information about the experimental setup, please refer to Appendix A.

**Result Analysis.** Table 3 presents the MAE and RMSE test results for specific horizons of 7, 15, and 30 days, along with the average performance across all prediction horizons. The simple method **HI** performs the worst as it completely ignores temporal dependency and spatial correlation, relying solely on the last lagged value from historical records. Additionally, the state-of-the-art **TimesNet** model in time-series prediction and advanced spatio-temporal prediction model **STID** achieve the best and second-best performance, respectively. This could be attributed to their incorporation of embedding information of time and

**SatCLIP** could be offered more pertinent semantic information for downstream environment-related tasks. Conversely, **CSP** focuses on pretraining location encoders for specific applications, which diminishes its adaptability to new downstream tasks. Overall, these results corroborate the suitability and practical utility of our Terra dataset for environment-related spatial variable prediction, thereby reinforcing its potential for advancing research in spatial-temporal data mining.

#### 4.2.2 Vision-Language based Spatial Variable Prediction

**Problem Definition.** To demonstrate the multimodal nature of the Terra, we follow the recent paradigm of spatial variable prediction based on vision-language pre-training , which provides a comprehensive geographic vision of a region through satellite images, and provides an overview of the region's inherent knowledge through text descriptions, thereby enhancing spatial variable prediction. Formally, vision-language based spatial prediction aims to predict \(L\) spatial indicators of \(N\) locations, denoted as \(Y^{N L}\), given visual and textual pairs \(X^{N(I,T)}\) of \(N\) locations.

**Setup.** We follow the same experimental setup as in Sec. 4.2.1. However, in the context of vision-language pre-training, making predictions on a global scale poses significant challenges in terms of computational resources. Thus, similar to Sec. 4.1, we select three representative countries(_USA_, _CN_, _AUS_) for experiments. We select two representative VLP models in the spatio-temporal domain, **UrbanVLP** and **UrbanCLIP**, as well as the classic general baseline **CLIP**. Similarly, the dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets in a 7:1:2 ratio, and the performance metrics used for comparison are: coefficient of determination (\(R^{2}\)) and mean squared error (MSE).

**Result Analysis:** Table 5 illustrates the performance of three spatial variable predictions on three countries. Overall, these models demonstrated similar performance to those presented in . The distinct performance of different models effectively highlights the consistency of our dataset. Specifically, the performance trends for each metric vary across the three countries. For example, the USA exhibits relatively poor performance in precipitation prediction, possibly due to its status as the country with the most diverse climate types in the world, which affects precipitation patterns. Conversely, Australia's suboptimal performance in temperature prediction may be attributed to its unusual geographic situation, being surrounded by oceans while having an inland desert climate. Additionally, due to being trained on data from a limited number of countries, the performance is slightly inferior to location-based models, which use pretrained encoders on global-scale datasets.

## 5 Conclusions

This work introduces the Terra, a multimodal spatio-temporal dataset. Terra is a comprehensive dataset encompassing various meteorological data spanning the earth, covering 6,480,000 grid regions over the past 45 years. It includes spatio-temporal observations along with multimodal spatial information such as geo-images and explanatory texts. Based on a thorough introduction of the data and analysis of experimental results, we highlight the significant impact of the Terra dataset on advancing spatio-temporal data mining research and its potential for progressing towards spatio-temporal general intelligence.
