###### Abstract

Many critical decisions, such as personalized medical diagnoses and product pricing, are made based on insights gained from designing, observing, and analyzing a series of experiments. This highlights the crucial role of experimental design, which goes beyond merely collecting information on system parameters as in traditional _Bayesian experimental design_ (BED), but also plays a key part in facilitating _downstream decision-making_. Most recent BED methods use an amortized policy network to rapidly design experiments. However, the information gathered through these methods is suboptimal for down-the-line decision-making, as the experiments are not inherently designed with downstream objectives in mind. In this paper, we present an amortized decision-aware BED framework that prioritizes maximizing downstream decision utility. We introduce a novel architecture, the Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP), capable of instantly proposing the next experimental design, whilst inferring the downstream decision, thus effectively amortizing both tasks within a unified workflow. We demonstrate the performance of our method across several tasks, showing that it can deliver informative designs and facilitate accurate decision-making.

## 1 Introduction

In a wide array of disciplines, from clinical trials (Cheng and Shen, 2005) to medical imaging (Burger et al., 2021), a fundamental challenge is the design of experiments to infer the distribution of some unobservable, unknown properties of the systems under study. _Bayesian Experimental Design_ (BED) (Lindley, 1956; Chaloner and Verdinelli, 1995; Ryan et al., 2016; Rainforth et al., 2024) is a powerful framework in this context, guiding and optimizing experimental design by maximizing the expected amount of information about parameters gained from experiments, see Fig. 1(a). However, the ultimate goal in many tasks extends beyond parameter inference to inform a _downstream decision-making_ task by leveraging our understanding of these parameters. For example, in personalized medical diagnostics, a model is built based on historical data to facilitate an optimal treatment for a new patient (Bica et al., 2021). This data typically comprises patient covariates, administered treatments, and observed outcomes. Since the query of such data tends to be expensive due to, e.g., privacy issues, we need to actively design queries to optimize resource utilization. Here, when the goal is to improve decisions, the strategy of experimental designs should not focus solely on inferring the parameters of the model, but rather on guiding the final decision-making for the new patient, to ensure that each query contributes maximally to the diagnostic decision.

Traditional BED methods (Rainforth et al., 2018; Foster et al., 2019, 2020; Kleinegesse and Gutmann, 2020) do not take down-the-line decision-making tasks into account during the experimental design phase. As a result, inference and decision-making processes are carried out separately, which is suboptimal for decision-making in scenarios where experiments can be adaptively designed. _Loss-calibrated inference_, which was originally introduced by Lacoste-Julien et al. (Lacoste-Julien et al., 2011) for variational approximations in Bayesian inference, provides a concept that adjusts the inference process to capture posterior regions critical for decision-making tasks. Rather than focusing on parameter estimation, the idea is to directly maximize the expected downstream utility, recognizing that accurate decision-making can proceed without exact knowledge of the posterior as not all regions of the posterior contribute equally to the downstream task. Inspired by this concept, we could consider integrating decision-making directly into the experimental design process to align the proposed designs more closely with the ultimate decision-making task.

To pick the next optimal design, standard BED methods require estimating and optimizing the expected information gain (EIG) over the design space, which can be extremely time-consuming. This limitation has led to the development of _amortized_ BED (Foster et al., 2021; Ivanova et al., 2021; Blau et al., 2022, 2023), a _policy-based_ method which leverages a neural network policy trained on simulated experimental trajectories to quickly generate designs, as illustrated in Fig. 1(b). Given an experiment history, these policy-based methods determine the next experimental design through a single forward pass, significantly speeding up the design process. Another significant advantage of amortized BED methods is their capacity to extract and utilize unstructured domain knowledge embedded in historical data. Unlike traditional methods, which never reuse the information from past data, amortized methods can integrate this knowledge to refine and improve design strategies for new experiments. In our problem setting, the benefits of amortization are also valuable where decisions must be made swiftly, such as when determining optimal treatment for patients in urgent settings.

In this paper, we propose an amortized decision-making-aware BED framework, see Fig. 1(c). We identify two key aspects where previous amortized BED methods fall short when applied to downstream decision-making tasks. First, the training objective of the existing methods does not consider downstream decision tasks. Therefore, we introduce the concept of _Decision Utility Gain_ (DUG) to guide experimental design to better align with the downstream objective. DUG is designed to measure the improvement in the _maximum_ expected utility derived from the new experiment. Second, to obtain the optimal decision, we still need to explicitly approximate the predictive distribution of the outcomes to estimate the utility. Current amortized methods learn this distribution only implicitly and therefore require extra computation for the decision-making process. To address this, we propose

a novel _Transformer neural decision process_ (TNDP) architecture with dual output heads: one acting as a policy network to propose new designs, and another to approximate the predictive distribution to support the downstream decision-making. This setup allows an iterative approach where the system autonomously proposes informative experimental designs and makes optimal final decisions. Finally, since our ultimate goal is to make optimal decisions at the final stage, which may involve multiple experiments, it is crucial that our experimental designs are not myopic or overly greedy by only maximizing next-step decision utility. Therefore, we develop a non-myopic objective function that ensures decisions are made with a comprehensive consideration of future outcomes.

Contributions.In summary, the contributions of our work include:

* We propose the concept of _decision utility gain_ (DUG) for guiding the next experimental design with a direct focus on optimizing down-the-line decision-making tasks.
* _Transformer neural decision process_ (TNDP)
- designed to amortize the experimental designs directly for downstream decision-making.
* We empirically show the effectiveness of TNDP across a variety of experimental design tasks involving decision-making, where it significantly outperforms other methods that do not consider downstream decisions.

## 2 Preliminaries

### Bayesian experimental design

BED (Lindley, 1956; Ryan et al., 2016; Rainforth et al., 2024) is a powerful statistical framework that optimizes the experimental design process. The primary goal of BED is to sequentially select a set of experimental designs \(\) and gather outcomes \(y\), to maximize the amount of information obtained about the parameters of interest, denoted as \(\). Essentially, BED seeks to minimize the entropy of the posterior distribution of \(\) or, equivalently, to maximize the information that the experimental outcomes provide about \(\).

At the heart of BED lies the concept of _Expected Information Gain_ (EIG), which quantifies the value of different experimental designs based on how much they are expected to reduce uncertainty about \(\), measured in terms of expected entropy (\(H[]\)) reduction:

\[()=_{p(y|)}[H[p()]-H[p( |,y)]].\] (1)

The optimal design is then defined as \(^{*}=_{}()\). In practice, calculating EIG is a computationally challenging task because it involves integrations over \(p(y|)\) and \(p(|,y)\), which are both intractable. In recent years, various methods have been proposed to make the computation of the EIG feasible in practical scenarios, such as nested Monte Carlo estimators (Rainforth et al., 2018) and variational approximations (Foster et al., 2019). However, even with these advancements, the computational load remains significant, hindering feasibility in tasks that demand rapid designs. This limitation has pushed forward the development of amortized BED methods, which significantly reduce computational demands during the deployment stage.

### Amortized BED

Amortized BED methods represent a significant shift from traditional experimental optimization techniques. Instead of optimizing for each experimental design separately, Foster et al. (2021) developed a parameterized policy \(\), which directly maps the experimental history \(h_{1:t}=\{(_{1},y_{1}),...,(_{t},y_{t})\}\) to the next design \(_{t+1}=(h_{1:t})\). To train such a policy network, Foster et al. (2021) proposed using sequential Prior Contrastive Estimation (sPCE) to optimize the lower bound of the total EIG across the entire \(T\)-step experiments trajectory:

\[sPCE(,L)=_{p(_{0:L})p(h_{1:T}|_{0},)}[ |_{0},)}{_{t=0}^{L}p(h_{1:T}|_{ t},)}],\] (2)

where \(_{1:L}\) are contrastive samples drawn from the prior distribution. Although the training of such a policy network is computationally expensive, once trained, the network can act as an oracle to quickly propose the next design through a single forward pass, thus amortizing the initial training cost over numerous deployments.

### Bayesian decision theory

_Bayesian decision theory_(Berger, 2013) provides an axiomatic framework for decision-making under uncertainty, systematically incorporating probabilistic beliefs about unknown parameters into decision-making processes. It introduces a task-specific utility function \(u(,a)\), which quantifies the value of the outcomes from different decisions \(a\) when the system is in state \(\). The optimal decision is then determined by maximizing the expected utility, which integrates the utility function over the unknown system parameters, given the available knowledge \(h_{1:t}\):

\[a^{*}=*{arg\,max}_{a A}_{p(|h_{1:t})}[u(,a)].\] (3)

In many scenarios, outcomes are stochastic and it is more typical to make decisions based on their _predictive distribution_\(p(y|,h_{1:t})=_{p(|h_{1:t})}[p(y|,,h_{1:t})]\), such as in clinical trials where the optimal treatment is chosen based on predicted patient responses rather than solely on underlying biological mechanisms. A similar setup can be found in (Kusmicrezky et al., 2019; Vadera et al., 2021). As we switch the belief about the state of the system to the outcomes and to keep as much information as possible, we need to evaluate the effect of \(\) on all points of the design space. Thus, instead of the posterior over the latent state \(\), we represent our belief directly as \(p(y_{}|h_{1:t})\{p(y|,h_{1:t})\}_{}\), i.e. a joint predictive (posterior) distribution of outcomes over all possible designs given the current information \(h_{1:t}\).1 The utility is then expressed as \(u(y_{},a)\), which relies on the decision \(a\) and all possible predicted outcomes \(y_{}\). It is a natural extension of the traditional definition of utility by marginalizing out the posterior distribution of \(\). The rule of making the optimal decision is reformulated in terms of the predictive distribution as:

\[a^{*}=*{arg\,max}_{a A}_{p(y_{}|h_{1:t})}[u(y_{ },a)].\] (4)

Traditional methods usually separate the inference and decision-making steps, which are optimal when the true posterior or the predictive distribution can be computed exactly. However, in most cases the posteriors are not directly accessible, and we often resort to using approximate distributions. This necessity results in a suboptimal decision-making process as the approximate posteriors often focus on representing the full posterior yet fail to ensure high accuracy in regions crucial for decision-making. _Loss-calibrated inference_(Lacoste-Julien et al., 2011) emerges as an effective solution to address this problem. It calibrates the inference by focusing on utility rather than mere accuracy of the approximation, thereby ensuring a more targeted posterior estimation. This method has been applied to improving Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods (Abbasnejad et al., 2015), Bayesian neural networks (Cobb et al., 2018) and expectation propagation (Morais and Pillow, 2022).

## 3 Decision-aware BED

### Problem setup

Our objective is to optimize the experimental design process for down-the-line decision-making. In this paper, we consider scenarios in which we design a series of experiments \(\) and observe corresponding outcomes \(y\) to inform a final decision-making step. We assume we have a fixed experimental budget with \(T\) query steps. For decision-making, we consider a set of possible decisions, denoted as \(a\), with the objective of identifying an optimal decision \(a^{*}\) that maximizes a predefined prediction-based utility function \(u(y_{},a)\).

### Decision Utility Gain

Our method focuses on designing the experiments to directly improve the quality of the final decision-making. To quantify the effectiveness of each experimental design in terms of decision-making, we introduce _Decision Utility Gain_ (DUG), which is defined as the difference in the expected utility of the best decision, with the new information obtained from the current experimental design, versus the best decision with the information obtained from previous experiments.

**Definition 3.1**.: Given a historical experimental trajectory \(h_{1:t-1}\), the _Decision Utility Gain_ (DUG) for a given design \(_{t}\) and its corresponding outcome \(y_{t}\) at step \(t\) is defined as follows:

\[(_{t},y_{t})= _{a A}_{p(y_{}|h_{1:t-1}\{(_{t},y_{t}) \})}[u(y_{},a)]-_{a A}_{p(y_{}|h_{1:t-1})} [u(y_{},a)].\] (5)

DUG measures the improvement in the _maximum_ expected utility from observing a new experimental design, differing in this from standard marginal utility gain (see e.g., Garnett, 2023). The optimal design is the one that provides the largest increase in maximal expected utility. Shifting from parameter-centric to utility-centric evaluation, we directly evaluate the design's influence on the decision utility, bypassing the need to reduce the uncertainty of unknown latent parameters.

At the time we choose the design \(_{t}\), the outcome remains uncertain. Therefore, we should consider the _Expected Decision Utility Gain_ (EDUG) with respect to the marginal distribution of the outcomes to select the next design.

**Definition 3.2**.: The _Expected Decision Utility Gain_ (EDUG) for a design \(_{t}\), given the historical experimental trajectory \(h_{1:t-1}\), is defined as:

\[(_{t})=_{p(y_{t}|_{t},h_{1:t-1})}[( _{t},y_{t})].\] (6)

With EDUG, we can guide the experimental design without calculating the posterior distribution. If we knew the true predictive distribution, we could always determine the one-step lookahead optimal design by maximizing EDUG across the design space with \(^{*}=_{}()\). However, in practice, the true predictive distributions are often unknown, making the optimization of EDUG exceptionally challenging. This difficulty arises due to the inherent bi-level optimization problem and the need to evaluate two layers of expectations, both over the unknown predictive distribution.

To avoid the expensive computational cost of optimizing EDUG, we propose leveraging a policy network, inspired by Foster et al. (2021), that directly maps historical data to the next design. This approach sidesteps the continuous need to optimize EDUG by learning a design strategy over many simulated experiment trajectories during the training phase. It can dramatically reduce computational demands at deployment, allowing for more efficient real-time decisions.

## 4 Amortizing decision-aware BED

A fully amortized BED framework for decision-making requires not only amortizing the experimental design but also the predictive distribution to approximate the expected utility. Moreover, _permutation invariance_ is often assumed in sequential BED (Foster et al., 2021)2, meaning that the sequence of experiments does not influence the cumulative information gained. Conditional neural processes (CNPs) (Garnelo et al., 2018; Nguyen and Grover, 2022; Huang et al., 2023b) provide a suitable basis for developing our framework due to their design, which not only respects the permutation invariance of the inputs by treating them as an unordered set but also amortizes modeling of the predictive distributions. See Appendix A for a brief introduction to CNPs and TNPs.

### Transformer Neural Decision Processes

The architecture of our model, termed _Transformer Neural Decision Process_ (TNDP), is a novel architecture building upon the Transformer neural process (TNP) (Nguyen and Grover, 2022). It aims to amortize both the experimental design and the predictive distributions for the subsequent decision-making process. The data architecture of our system comprises four parts \(D=\{D^{},D^{},D^{},\}\):

* A **context set**\(D^{}=h_{1:t}=\{(_{i}^{},y_{i}^{})\}_{i=1}^{t}\) contains all past \(t\)-step designs and outcomes.
* A **prediction set**\(D^{}=\{(_{i}^{},y_{i}^{})\}_{i=1}^{n_{ {p}}}\) consists of \(n_{}\) design-outcome pairs used for approximating \(p(y_{}|h_{1:t})\), which is closely related to the training objective of the CNPs. The output from this head can then be used to estimate the expected utility.
* A **query set**\(D^{}=\{_{i}^{}\}_{i=1}^{n_{}}\) consists of \(n_{}\) candidate experimental designs being considered for the next step. In scenarios where the design space \(\) is continuous, we randomly sample a set of query points for each iteration during training. In the deployment phase, optimal experimental designs can be obtained by optimizing the model's output.

* **Global information**\(=[t,]\) where \(t\) represents the current step in the experimental sequence, and \(\) encapsulates task-related information, which could include contextual data relevant to the decision-making process. We will further explain the choice of \(\) in Section 6.

TNDP comprises four main components: the data embedder block \(f_{}\), the Transformer block \(f_{}\), the prediction head \(f_{}\), and the query head \(f_{}\). Each component plays a distinct role in the overall decision-aware BED process. The full architecture is shown in Fig. 2(a).

At first, each set of \(D\) is processed by the **data embedder block**\(f_{}\) to map to an aligned embedding space. These embeddings are then concatenated to form a unified representation \(=(^{},^{},^{},^{})\). Please refer to Appendix B for a detailed explanation of how we embed the data. After the initial embedding, the **Transformer block**\(f_{}\) processes \(\) using self-attention mechanisms to produce a single attention matrix, which is subsequently processed by an attention mask (see Fig. 2(b)) that allows for selective interactions between different data components, ensuring that each part contributes appropriately to the final output. To explain, each design from the prediction set \(D^{}\) is configured to attend to itself, the global information, and the historical data, reflecting the dependence of the predictions on the historical data and the independence from other designs. Similarly, each \(^{}\) in the query set \(D^{}\) is also restricted to attend only to itself, the global information, and the historical data. This setup preserves the independence of each candidate design, ensuring that the evaluation of one design neither influences nor is influenced by others. The output of \(f_{}\) is then split according to the specific needs of the query and prediction head \(=[^{},^{}]=f_{}()\).

The primary role of the **prediction head**\(f_{}\) is to approximate \(p(y_{}|h_{1:t})\) with a family of parameterized distributions \(q(y_{}|_{t})\), where \(_{t}=f_{}(_{t}^{})\) is the output of \(f_{}\) at the step \(t\). The training of \(f_{}\) is by minimizing the negative log-likelihood of the predicted probabilities:

\[^{}=-_{t=1}^{T}_{i=1}^{n_{}} q(y_{i}^ {}|_{i,t})=-_{t=1}^{T}_{i=1}^{n_{}} (y_{i}^{}|_{i,t},_{i,t}^{2}),\] (7)

where \(_{i,t}\) represents the output of design \(_{i}^{}\) at step \(t\). Here we choose a Gaussian likelihood with \(\) and \(\) representing the predicted mean and standard deviation split from \(\).

The **query head**\(f_{}\) processes the transformed embeddings \(^{}\) from the Transformer block to generate a policy distribution over possible experimental designs. Specifically, it converts the embeddings into a probability distribution used to select the next experimental design. The outputs of the query head, \(=f_{}(^{})\), are mapped to a probability distribution via a Softmax function:

\[(_{j,t}^{}|h_{1:t-1})=_{j,t})}}{_{i=0}^{ n_{}}(_{i,t})},\] (8)

Figure 2: **Illustration of TNDP.** (a) An overview of TNDP architecture with input consisting of 2 observed design-outcome pairs from \(D^{}\), 2 designs from \(D^{}\) for prediction, and 2 candidate designs from \(D^{}\) for query. (b) The corresponding attention mask. The colored squares indicate that the elements on the left can attend to the elements on the top in the self-attention layer of \(f_{}\).

where \(_{j,t}\) represents the \(t\)-step's output for the candidate design \(_{j}^{}\).

To design a reward signal that guides \(f_{}\) in proposing informative designs, we first define a single-step immediate reward based on DUG (Eq. (5)), replacing the true predictive distribution with our approximated distribution:

\[r_{t}(_{t}^{})=_{a A}_{q(y|_{t}|}[ u(y_{},a)]-_{a A}_{q(y|_{t-1})}[u(y_{ },a)].\] (9)

This reward quantifies how the experimental design influences our decision-making by estimating the improvement in expected utility that results from incorporating new experimental outcomes. However, this objective remains myopic, as it does not account for the future or the final decision-making. To address this, we employ the REINFORCE algorithm (Williams, 1992), which allows us to consider the impact of the current design on future rewards. The final loss of \(f_{}\) can be written as the negative expected reward for the complete experimental trajectory:

\[^{}=-_{t=1}^{T}R_{t}(_{t}^{}|h_{ 1:t-1}),\] (10)

where \(R_{t}=_{k=t}^{T}^{k-t}r_{k}(_{k}^{})\) represents the non-myopic discounted reward. The discount factor \(\) is used to decrease the importance of rewards received at later time step. \(_{t}^{}\) is obtained through sampling from the policy distribution \(_{t}^{}(|h_{1:t-1})\).

The update of \(f_{}\) depends critically on the accuracy with which \(f_{}\) approximates the predictive distribution. Ultimately, the effectiveness of decision-making relies on the informativeness of the designs proposed by \(f_{}\), ensuring that every step in the experimental trajectory is optimally aligned with the overarching goal of maximizing the decision utility. The full algorithm of our method is shown in Appendix C.

## 5 Related work

Lindley (1972) proposes the first decision-theoretic BED framework, later reiterated by Chaloner and Verdinelli (1995). However, their utility is defined based on individual designs, while our utility is formulated in terms of a stochastic process and is designed for the final decision-making task after multiple rounds of experimental design. Recently, several other BED frameworks that focus on different downstream properties have been proposed. Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) (Neiswanger et al., 2021) develops a BED framework that optimizes experiments based on downstream properties of interest. BAX introduces a new metric that queries the next experiment by maximizing the mutual information between the property and the outcome. CO-BED (Ivanova et al., 2023) introduces a contextual optimization method within the BED framework, where the design phase incorporates information-theoretic objectives specifically targeted at optimizing contextual rewards. Neiswanger et al. (2022) presents an information-based acquisition function for Bayesian optimization which explicitly considers the downstream task. Zhong et al. (2024) proposes a goal-oriented BED framework for nonlinear models using MCMC to optimize the EIG on predictive quantities of interest. Filstroff et al. (2024) presents a framework for active learning that queries data to reduce the uncertainty on the posterior distribution of the optimal downstream decision.

In recent years, various amortized BED methods have emerged. Foster et al. (2021) is the first to introduce this framework; subsequent work extends it to scenarios with unknown likelihood (Ivanova et al., 2021) and improved performance using reinforcement learning (Blau et al., 2022; Lim et al., 2022). The latest research proposes a semi-amortized framework that periodically updates the policy during the experiment to improve adaptability (Ivanova et al., 2024). Maraval et al. (2024) proposes a fully amortized Bayesian optimization (BO) framework that employs a similar TNP architecture, while their work focuses specifically on BO objectives, our approach addresses general downstream decision-making tasks. Additionally, our framework introduces a novel coupled training objective between query and prediction heads, providing a more integrated architecture for decision-making.

Our proposed architecture is based on pre-trained Transformer models. Transformer-based neural processes (Muller et al., 2021; Nguyen and Grover, 2022; Chang et al., 2024) serve as the foundational structure for our approach, but they have not considered experimental design. Decision Transformers (Chen et al., 2021; Zheng et al., 2022) can be used for sequentially designing experiments. However, we additionally amortize the predictive distribution, making the learning process more challenging.

## 6 Experiments

In this section, we evaluate our proposed framework on several tasks. Our experimental approach is detailed in Appendix B. In Appendix F.3, we provide additional ablation studies of TNDP to show the effectiveness of our query head and the non-myopic objective function. The code to reproduce our experiments is available at https://github.com/huangdaolang/amortized-decision-aware-bed.

### Toy example: synthetic regression

We begin with an illustrative example to show how our TNDP works. We consider a 1D synthetic regression task where the goal is to perform regression at a specific test point \(x^{*}\) on an unknown function. To accurately predict this point, we need to sequentially design some new points to query. This example can be viewed as a prediction-oriented active learning (AL) task (Smith et al., 2023).

The design space \(=\) is the domain of \(x\), and \(y\) is the corresponding noisy observations of the function. Let \(()\) denote the set of combinations of distributions that can be output by TNDP, we can then define decision space to be \(=()\). The downstream decision is to output a predictive distribution for \(y^{*}\) given a test point \(x^{*}\), and the utility function \(u(y_{},a)= q(y^{*}|x^{*},h_{1:t})\) is the log probability of \(y\) under the predicted distribution, given the queried historical data \(h_{t}\).

During training, we sample functions from Gaussian Processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) with squared exponential kernels of varying output variances and lengthscales and randomly sample a point as the test point \(x^{*}\). We set the global contextual information \(\) as the test point \(x^{*}\). For illustration purposes, we consider only the case where \(T=1\). Additional details for the data generation can be found in Appendix E.

**Results.** From Fig. 3(a), we can observe that the values of \(\) concentrate near \(x^{*}\), meaning our query head \(f_{}\) tends to query points close to \(x^{*}\) to maximize the DUG. This is an intuitive example demonstrating that our TNDP can adjust its design strategy based on the downstream task.

### Decision-aware active learning

We now show another application of our method in a case of decision-aware AL studied by Filstroff et al. (2024). In this experiment, the model will be used for downstream decision-making after performing AL, i.e., we will use the learned information to take an action towards a specific target. A practical application of this problem is personalized medical diagnosis introduced in Section 1, where a doctor needs to query historical patient data to decide on a treatment for a new patient.

We use the same problem setup as in Filstroff et al. (2024). The decision space consists of \(N_{d}\) available decisions, \(a\{1,...,N_{d}\}\). The design space \(=\) is composed of the patient's

Figure 3: **Results of synthetic regression and decision-aware active learning. (a) The top figure represents the true function and the initial known points. The red line indicates the location of \(x^{*}\). The blue star marks the next query point, sampled from the policy’s predicted distribution shown in the bottom figure. (b) Mean and standard error of the proportion of correct decisions on 100 test points w.r.t. the acquisition steps. Our TNDP significantly outperforms other methods.**covariates \(x\) and the decisions \(a\) they receive. The outcome \(y\) is the treatment effect after the patient receives the decision, which is influenced by real-world unknown parameters \(\) such as medical conditions. For historical data, each patient is associated with only one decision. The utility function \(u(y_{},a)=(^{*},a^{*})\) is a binary accuracy score that measures whether we can make the correct decision for a new patient \(x^{*}\) based on the queried history, where \(^{*}\) is the predicted Bayesian optimal decision and \(a^{*}\) the true optimal decision. Here, \(u(y_{},a)=1\) if and only if \(^{*}=a^{*}\).

In our experiment, we use the synthetic dataset from Filstroff et al. (2024), the details of the data generating process can be found in Appendix F. We set \(N_{d}=4\) and use independent GPs to generate different outcomes. Each data point is randomly assigned a decision, and the outcome is the corresponding \(y\) value from the associated GP. We randomly select a test point \(x^{*}\) and determine the optimal decision \(a^{*}\) based on the GP that provides the maximum \(y\) value at \(x^{*}\). We set global contextual information \(\) as the covariates of the test point \(x^{*}\).

We compare TNDP with other non-amortized AL methods: random sampling (GP-RS), uncertainty sampling (GP-US), decision uncertainty sampling (GP-DUS), targeted information (GP-TEIG) introduced by Sundin et al. (2018), and decision EIG (GP-DEIG) proposed by Filstroff et al. (2024). A detailed description of each method can be found in Appendix F. Each method is tested on 100 different \(x^{*}\) points, and the average utility, i.e., the proportion of correct decisions, is calculated.

**Results.** The results are shown in Fig. 3(b), where we can see that TNDP achieves significantly better average accuracy than other methods. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study of TNDP in Appendix F.3 to verify the effectiveness of \(f_{}\). We further analyze the deployment running time to show the advantage of amortization, see Appendix D.1.

### Top-\(k\) hyperparameter optimization

In traditional optimization tasks, we typically only aim to find a single point that maximizes the underlying function \(f\). However, instead of identifying a single optimal point, there are scenarios where we wish to estimate a set of top-\(k\) distinct optima. For example, this is the case in robust optimization, where selecting multiple points can safeguard against variations in data or model performance.

In this experiment, we choose hyperparameter optimization (HPO) as our task and conduct experiments on the HPO-B datasets (Arango et al., 2021). The design space \(\) is a finite set defined over the hyperparameter space and the outcome \(y\) is the accuracy of a given configuration on a specific dataset. Our decision is to find \(k\) hyperparameter sets, denoted as \(a=(a_{1},...,a_{k}) A^{k}\), with \(a_{i} a_{j}\). The utility function is then defined as \(u(y_{},a)=_{i=1}^{k}y_{a_{i}}\), where \(y_{a_{i}}\) is the accuracy corresponding to the hyperparameter configuration \(a_{i}\). In this experiment, the global contextual information \(=\).

We compare our methods with five different BO methods: random sampling (RS), Upper Confidence Bound (UCB), Expected Improvement (EI), Probability of Improvement (PI), and an amortized method PFNs4BO (Muller et al., 2023), which is a transformer-based model designed for hyperparameter optimization. We set \(k=3\) and \(T=50\), starting with an initial dataset of 5 points. Our experiments are conducted on four search spaces selected from the HPO-B benchmark. All results

are evaluated on a predefined test set, ensuring that TNDP does not encounter these test sets during training. For more details, see Appendix G.

**Results.** From the experimental results (Fig. 4), our method demonstrates superior performance across all four meta-datasets, particularly during the first 10 queries, achieving clearly better utility gains. This indicates that our TNDP can effectively identify high-performing hyperparameter configurations early in the optimization process.

Finally, we included a real-world experiment on retrosynthesis planning. Specifically, our task is to assist chemists in identifying the top-\(k\) synthetic routes for a novel molecule, as selecting the most practical routes from many random routes generated by the retrosynthesis software can be troublesome. The detailed description of the task and the results are shown in Appendix G.3.

### Limitations & future work

We recognize that the training of the query head inherently poses a reinforcement learning (RL) (Li, 2017) problem. Currently, we employ a basic REINFORCE algorithm, which can result in unstable training, particularly for tasks with sparse reward signals. For more complex problems in the future, we could deploy advanced RL methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017); the trade-offs include the introduction of additional hyperparameters and increased computational cost. Like all amortized approaches, our method requires a large amount of data and upfront training time to develop a reliable model. Besides, our architecture is based on the Transformer, which suffers from quadratic complexity with respect to the input sequence length. This can become a bottleneck when the query set is very large. Future work could focus on designing more sample-efficient methods to reduce the data and training requirements. Our TNDP follows the common practice in the neural processes literature (Garnelo et al., 2018) of using independent Gaussian likelihoods. If modeling correlations between points is crucial for the downstream task, we can replace the output with a joint multivariate normal distribution (Markou et al., 2022) or predict the output autoregressively (Bruinsma et al., 2023). Following most BED approaches, our work assumes that the model is well-specified. However, model misspecification or shifts in the utility function during deployment could impact the performance of the amortized model (Rainforth et al., 2024). Future work could address the challenge of robust experimental design under model misspecification (Huang et al., 2023). Another limitation is that our system is currently constrained to accepting designs of the same dimensionality. Future work could focus on developing dimension-agnostic methods to expand the scope of amortization. Lastly, our model is trained on a fixed-step length, assuming a finite horizon for the experimental design process. Future research could explore the design of systems that can handle infinite horizon cases, potentially improving the applicability of TNDP to a broader range of real-world problems.

### Conclusions

In this paper, we proposed an amortized framework for decision-aware Bayesian experimental design (BED). We introduced the concept of _Decision Utility Gain_ (DUG) to guide experimental design more effectively toward optimizing decision outcomes. Towards amortization, we developed a novel _Transformer Neural Decision Process_ (TNDP) architecture with dual output heads: one for proposing new experimental designs and another for approximating the predictive distribution to facilitate optimal decision-making. Our experimental results demonstrated that TNDP significantly outperforms traditional BED methods across a variety of tasks. By integrating decision-making considerations directly into the experimental design process, TNDP not only accelerates the design of experiments but also improves the quality of the decisions derived from these experiments.
