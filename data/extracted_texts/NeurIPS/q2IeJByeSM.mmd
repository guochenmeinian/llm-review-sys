###### Abstract

RNA plays a pivotal role in translating genetic instructions into functional outcomes, underscoring its importance in biological processes and disease mechanisms. Despite the emergence of numerous deep learning approaches for RNA, particularly universal RNA language models, there remains a significant lack of standardized benchmarks to assess the effectiveness of these methods. In this study, we introduce the first comprehensive RNA benchmark BEACON (**BE**nchm**Ark for **CO**mprehensive **RNA** Task and Language Models). First, BEACON comprises 13 distinct tasks derived from extensive previous work covering structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications, enabling a comprehensive assessment of the performance of methods on various RNA understanding tasks. Second, we examine a range of models, including traditional approaches like CNNs, as well as advanced RNA foundation models based on language models, offering valuable insights into the task-specific performances of these models. Third, we investigate the vital RNA language model components from the tokenizer and positional encoding aspects. Notably, our findings emphasize the superiority of single nucleotide tokenization and the effectiveness of Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) over traditional positional encoding methods. Based on these insights, a simple yet strong baseline called BEACON-B is proposed, which can achieve outstanding performance with limited data and computational resources. The datasets and source code of our benchmark are available at https://github.com/terry-r123/RNABenchmark.

## 1 Introduction

RNA plays a vital role in numerous biological processes, including protein synthesis, enzymatic activities, and gene regulations . Unlike its more famous counterpart DNA, RNA is not restricted to information storage but actively participates in translating genetic instructions into functional proteins, modulating gene expression through various mechanisms, and regulating cellular responses to internal and external stimuli . As a dynamic intermediary between DNA and protein, RNA governs crucial biological processes, making it a focal point of research in molecular biology and biomedicine. Consequently, understanding the diverse functions of RNA is crucial to unraveling the complexities of cellular processes and deciphering the underlying mechanisms of diseases.

Despite its critical importance, understanding the functional roles of RNA poses significant challenges. Inspired by the success of machine learning in various fields, there have been extensive research efforts in recent years to apply machine learning approaches to RNA tasks. Initially, traditionalmachine learning algorithms such as support vector machine and random forest paved the way for predictive modeling in RNA studies [58; 101; 63]. The evolution of deep learning, especially through Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has enabled more nuanced analyses of RNA sequences and structures [89; 9; 53]. More recently, pre-trained language models (LM) have revolutionized RNA research, facilitating more accurate predictions of RNA function and interactions [13; 18; 119]. These advancements significantly deepen our understanding of RNA's regulatory roles in cellular processes.

According to the central dogma of molecular biology , genetic information flows unidirectionally from DNA to RNA and then to protein, or directly from RNA to protein. While established benchmarks for DNA [41; 68] and protein [78; 117] have significantly aided research in these areas, RNA, a crucial component of the central dogma, lacks such standardized benchmarks. Therefore existing RNA models are often evaluated using disparate individual datasets, making it difficult to conduct fair comparisons between different methods and hindering the development of the field.

To address this gap, we present the first comprehensive RNA benchmark called BEA-CON (**BE**nchm**r**k for **CO**mprehensive RNA Task and Language Models). As shown in Fig. 1, BEACON contains a curated collection of 13 important RNA-related tasks derived from a comprehensive review of RNA-related research papers [24; 53; 19], containing 967k sequences with lengths ranging from 23 to 1182. These tasks cover sequence-level and nucleotide-level analyses across three main fields: **Structural Analysis** focuses on deciphering RNA's secondary structures and three-dimensional configurations, essential for its interactions with other molecules and for therapeutic design. **Functional Studies** investigate RNA's roles in gene regulation and its implications for disease, which are vital for protein translation and treatment of disease. **Engineering Applications** explore RNA's potential in synthetic biology to enhance its utility in biotechnology and medicine, exploring how RNA can be utilized to solve complex biological challenges.

In addition, we evaluate a diverse range of models using our benchmark, including traditional models like CNNs, ResNets, and LSTMs, as well as advanced RNA foundation models like RNA-FM  and UTR-LM . Surprisingly, ResNet and LSTM are proved to be strong baselines, managing to outperform language models on several tasks. Additionally, pretrained RNA language models surpassed previous task-specific state-of-the-art (SOTA) performances on 8 out of the 13 tasks,

demonstrating significant potential. Next, we explore the impact of various components in RNA language models for the community, with a particular focus on tokenization methods and positional encodings. We conclude some experimental findings, based on which we further propose a robust yet efficient baseline, BEACON-B, that incorporates Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi) and single nucleotide tokenization, providing an extremely fast and easy-to-use open-source pre-training model for the community.

Overall, our contributions can be summarized as follows:

* We establish the first comprehensive benchmark for RNA research with 13 diverse tasks, covering structure, function, and engineering aspects.
* We conduct a thorough evaluation of pre-trained RNA language models, providing insights into their strengths and limitations across different tasks.
* We investigate the component impacts of RNA language models in depth, and propose BEACON-B, a simple yet strong baseline, that benefits subsequent research in the field.

## 2 Related Works

**RNA tasks.** RNA research is categorized into three primary areas: structure, function, and engineering. Structural tasks, such as predicting secondary structures  and contact maps , aim to understand RNA configurations. Functional tasks focus on the biological roles of RNA, including splice site prediction  and non-coding RNA function classification . Engineering tasks involve designing RNA molecules with specific properties for applications in synthetic biology, such as discriminating programmable RNA switches .

**Deep learning methods in RNA tasks.** Deep learning has been pivotal in addressing these tasks. For structural predictions, U-Net  has been employed to model secondary structures . In functional studies, methods like SpliceAI utilize dilated convolutions for effective splice detection . For engineering challenges, LSTMs have been used to design programmable RNA switches, demonstrating their versatility in handling complex sequence data . The development of foundational RNA models like RNA-FM , RNA-BERT , RNA-MSM , SpliceBERT , UTR-LM  and 3UTRBERT  represents a significant advancement, capable of tackling multiple RNA-related tasks by leveraging advanced language modeling techniques. These models promise a broader understanding of RNA biology. However, they often lack thorough evaluations across different tasks, highlighting a gap in the systematic assessment of their capabilities. For instance, UTR-LM  only focuses on 5' UTR function-related tasks. This limitation underscores the need for robust, cross-disciplinary evaluation approaches to fully explore and utilize the potential of these models in RNA research.

**Benchmarks in molecular biology.** While AI for RNA research is a relatively new field and lacks comprehensive benchmarks, numerous benchmarks have been established for DNA [41; 23; 69] and protein [78; 117; 74; 38] studies. Gresovatel. proposed Genomic Benchmarks , which includes a collection of genomic sequence classification tasks. Marin et al. constructed BEND , a comprehensive benchmark for DNA, encompassing tasks such as gene finding, enhancer annotation, histone modification, CpG methylation, etc. Notin et al. introduced ProteinGym , a benchmark specifically designed for protein fitness prediction and design, while Gao et al. proposed ProteinBench , focusing on protein design. Additionally, Xu et al. developed PEER , a comprehensive protein benchmark involving function, localization, structure, etc. As AI for RNA research develops, some preliminary benchmarks in RNA have emerged. RnaBench  is the benchmark for computational RNA modeling, though it only involves tasks related to RNA secondary structure and RNA design. Many real-life applications, such as RNA-based therapeutics, require a comprehensive understanding of the functions of ncRNA and mRNA . To address this gap, we developed BEACON, a comprehensive benchmark for RNA that covers a wide range of tasks covering structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications.

## 3 Benchmark Tasks

BEACON comprises 13 tasks designed to evaluate RNA models comprehensively, covering structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications. The following sections provide detailed information, including data statistics, evaluation metrics, and data sources as shown in Table 1.

### Structure Prediction

**Secondary Structure Prediction (SSP)** identifies paired regions (stems) and unpaired regions (loops, bulges, junctions) within RNA molecules. The target matrix is \(y^{l l}\) indicating whether each nucleotide pair forms a base pair as part of the RNA's secondary structure. We adopt the bpRNA-1m database , which contains detailed annotations of over 100,000 single-molecule RNA structures. The evaluation metric is the F1 score.

_Impact:_ Accurate secondary structure prediction is pivotal for elucidating the structural and functional dynamics of RNA. By precisely mapping these structures, researchers gain insights into functional regions and interaction sites, contributing significantly to areas such as drug discovery and genetic research.

**Contact Map Prediction (CMP)** identifies pairs of nucleotides in RNA that are in close proximity in their three-dimensional structures. Each nucleotide pair is associated with a binary label \(y\{0,1\}\) indicating whether they contact (within a distance threshold of 8 A). Following , we utilize a dataset derived from non-redundant RNA 3D structures documented by , and evaluate predictions using the Top-L precision metric.

_Impact:_ Accurately identifying nucleotide interactions is pivotal for inferring the tertiary structure of RNA molecules. These predictions enhance our understanding of RNA folding and function, contributing to advancements in RNA-based therapeutics and biotechnology.

**Distance Map Prediction (DMP)** estimates the physical distances between pairs of nucleotides within an RNA molecule. The target distance matrix \(y^{l l}\) records the distance between every pair of nucleotides within the sequence. The same dataset as the contact map prediction task is used, with \(R^{2}\) serving as the evaluation metric.

_Impact:_ Inter-nucleotide distance prediction offers detailed spatial information, facilitating the construction of accurate three-dimensional models by providing distance restraints.

**Structural Score Imputation (SSI)** predicts missing structural information within RNA molecules, with each nucleotide assigned with an experimentally derived structural score \(y R\). The dataset  is derived from icSHAPE sequencing data of the HEK293 cell line, with 30% of nucleotides randomly masked as null in the training set, and downsampling leading to missing values in 3,095 fragments in the testing set. The evaluation metric is \(R^{2}\).

_Impact:_ Accurate structural score imputation provides enhanced and comprehensive structural information, crucial for the development of RNA-based therapeutics and diagnostics. Improved structural data enable precise targeting of RNA molecules in disease treatment, potentially leading to more effective interventions.

### Function Prediction

**Splice Site Prediction (SPL)** classifies each base within a sequence into one of three categories: acceptor (a), donor (d), or neither (n), with the categorical label \(y\{0,1,2\}\). The task uses Jaganathan's dataset  with Top-k accuracy as the evaluation metric.

_Impact:_ Splice site prediction is crucial for studying gene expression and regulation within biological systems. Accurate prediction of splice sites helps determine the precise locations within the genome where splicing occurs, enabling the detection of non-coding genomic variations that could impact protein synthesis, particularly those resulting in cryptic splicing.

**APA Isoform Prediction (APA)** predicts the usage ratio of the proximal polyadenlation site (PAS) in the 3' untranslated region (3' UTR) for each variant, recorded in target \(y\). We filter 228k sequences from over 3 million APA reporter gene data from Bogard's dataset , this regression task assesses the proportion of proximal APA isoforms. The evaluation metric is the \(R^{2}\) value.

_Impact:_ APA is a common gene expression regulation mechanism that generates different RNA transcripts and protein isoforms by modulating RNA 3' UTR processing . This regulatory method can affect gene expression levels and functions, playing a crucial role in cellular biological processes and development.

**Non-coding RNA Function Classification (ncRNA)** classifies ncRNA molecules into categories like microRNAs (miRNAs), long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and small interfering RNAs (siRNA).

Each molecule is assigned a categorical label \(y\{0,1,...,12\}\) to denote its function. The dataset [3; 34] comprises contributions from GENCODE, circBase, and Rfam, encompassing various ncRNAs. Accuracy (ACC) at the sequence level is the evaluation metric.

_Impact:_ Classifying ncRNA functions is crucial for understanding their diverse roles in gene regulation and cellular processes. Accurate classification enhances our knowledge of regulatory networks and aids in elucidating disease mechanisms. This contributes to identifying new biomarkers and therapeutic targets, advancing molecular biology research, and improving disease diagnosis and treatment.

**Modification Prediction (Modif)** predicts twelve widely occurring types of RNA modifications from a given RNA sequence, indicated by a categorical label \(y\{0,1,...,11\}\). We adopt Song's dataset that contains 20 epi-transcriptome profiles for 12 different types of RNA modifications obtained from 15 base-resolution technologies, where over 300,000 sites were collected and divided into training, validation, and test sets. We use AUC as the metric.

_Impact:_ Post-transcriptional RNA modifications enhance the structural and functional diversity of RNA molecules, impacting all stages of RNA life . Due to the complex and diverse characteristics of RNA sequences, different modifications may correspond to distinct sequence features. Accurately identifying RNA modification sites is crucial for understanding the functions and regulatory mechanisms of various RNAs.

**Mean Ribosome Loading (MRL)** predicts the MRL value for a given sequence, with target \(y\) representing the level of mRNA translation activity into proteins. Data from Reid's dataset  of 91,519 5' UTR sequences and their variants are used to calculate the MRL for each sequence. The model's performance is evaluated using the \(R^{2}\) value.

_Impact:_ MRL refers to the average ribosome load on a specific mRNA sequence under given conditions, indicating the translation efficiency of ribosomes on that mRNA. Modulating the features and structures of the 5' UTR sequence can influence ribosome loading on mRNA, thereby regulating protein expression levels [62; 10].

### Engineering Prediction

**Vaccine Degradation Prediction (VDP)** forecasts the stability and shelf life of vaccines under different environmental conditions. For each nucleotide, the three properties are recorded in target \(y^{3}\). We use data from the "Stanford OpenVaccine"  competition on Kaggle and the RNA design platform Eterna, which includes detailed measurements for 6,043 diverse RNA constructs. The evaluation metric is the Mean Columnwise Root Mean Squared Error (MCRMSE).

_Impact:_ Accurate predictions of vaccine degradation under different environmental conditions are crucial for optimizing storage and transportation protocols, ensuring vaccines remain potent until administration. Enhanced degradation predictions are particularly beneficial for distributing

vaccines in challenging environments, such as resource-limited settings, by providing guidelines to maintain vaccine stability and efficacy.

**Programmable RNA Switches (PRS)** involves identifying synthetic RNA molecules that can alter their conformation and function in response to specific signals. The target \(y^{3}\) records the ON, OFF and ON/OFF states activity given an RNA sequence. The dataset, analyzed by Angenent-Mari , includes 91,534 toehold switches in vivo, covering 23 viral genomes and 906 human transcription factors, with GFP signal intensity measurements indicating ON and OFF states activity levels . The \(R^{2}\) metric evaluates the effectiveness of these switches.

_Impact:_ Programmable RNA switches provide precise control of gene expression and cellular functions, serving as powerful tools for investigating biological processes [99; 72]. In therapeutic applications, these switches hold promise for developing targeted and personalized treatments by responding to disease-specific signals, offering innovative approaches to medical intervention.

**CRISPR On-Target Prediction (CRI-On)** evaluates the efficiency of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs) directed by Cas proteins in gene editing within specific target sites. Each sgRNA's knockout efficacy is quantified and presented as target \(y\). The dataset  comprises approximately 15,000 sgRNAs targeting 1,071 genes across four different cell lines, with performance evaluated using the Weighted Spearman correlation coefficient.

_Impact:_ CRISPR-Cas technology has transformed genetic engineering with significant enhancements in genome editing accuracy and safety. Effective on-target predictions are essential for designing sgRNAs that precisely modify genetic sequences without affecting unintended regions, thus improving therapeutic outcomes and research accuracy [116; 47].

**CRISPR Off-Target Prediction (CRI-Off)** assesses the likelihood and frequency of CRISPR-induced mutations at unintended genomic locations. The efficacy of sgRNA specificity is quantified using a target \(y\), capturing the frequency of off-target cleavage. The evaluation dataset  contains data for about 160,000 potential off-target sites across 30 sgRNAs in various cell types, with the Weighted Spearman correlation coefficient serving as the metric.

_Impact:_ Precision in off-target predictions is critical for advancing CRISPR technology by reducing unintended genetic modifications, which can lead to harmful effects. Accurate off-target analysis helps refine sgRNA designs, enhancing the safety and efficacy of CRISPR applications in clinical settings and research.

## 4 Models

We consider three types of baseline models in our benchmark, including naive supervised models, pre-trained language models, and the proposed BEACON-B. We give the details in the following part and summarize them in Table 2.

**Naive Supervised Models.** We utilize three widely-used sequence encoders: CNN , ResNet , and LSTM . We mainly follow the design choices described in , employing 2 layers for CNN, 8 resblocks for ResNet, and 3 Bi-LSTM layers for LSTM, with 5.4M, 11M, and 26.7M parameters, respectively.

**Pre-trained Language Models.** We evaluate the performance of several language models, including RNA-FM , RNABERT , RNA-MSM , SpliceBERT , 3UTRBERT , and UTR-LM . These models vary significantly in size, ranging from 0.48M to 99.52M parameters, and are pre-trained on diverse RNA data sources including ncRNA, pre-mRNA, mRNA-3'UTR, and mRNA-5'UTR. For consistency, we choose to fine-tune them using identical settings.

**Baseline RNA LM and BEACON-B.** We conduct ablation studies on two key aspects of RNA LM: 1) tokenization methods including Single Nucleotide (Single), Byte-Pair Encodings (BPE) [92; 125], Overlapping K-mer (K-mer, we use 6mer for experiments) [119; 54] and Non-overlapping K-mer (Non-overlap)  2) positional encodings including Absolute Positional Encodings (APE) , Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi)  and Rotary Positional Encodings (RoPE) . The findings indicate that single nucleotide tokenization outperforms both K-mer, BPE, and Non-overlap, and ALiBi shows advantages over both RoPE and APE. Consequently, we propose a robust yet efficient BEACON baseline (BEACON-B) that incorporates single nucleotide tokenization and ALiBi as positional encodings, based on the BERT backbone.

## 5 Results

### Training Setups

To ensure a fair comparison, we fully fine-tune all the BERT-like RNA foundation models including RNA-FM, RNABERT, RNA-MSM, SpliceBERT, 3UTRBERT, UTR-LM and BEACON-B under the same training settings. For simple supervised methods (CNN, ResNet and LSTM) and baseline RNA LM, we train them from scratch using similar training settings. For each model, we search for its learning rate from 1e-5 to 5e-3. All experiments are repeated with three random seeds, and we report the average performance alongside sample standard deviations. More details are in Appendix A.1.

### Task Pipeline

Our approach incorporates three pipelines for different types of tasks in the BEACON. In nucleotide-level tasks, due to the complexity of outputs in structural tasks, we further categorize the tasks of Secondary Structure, Contact Map, and Distance Map into a more detailed nucleotide-nucleotide level prediction.

**Sequence Level Prediction** For sequence-level tasks, we apply an attentive weighted sum of all nucleotides for naive supervised models and use the [CLS] token from language models. Both representations are processed through an MLP layer to derive the sequence-level predictions.

**Nucleotide Level Prediction** For tasks requiring resolution at the nucleotide level, individual representations for each nucleotide are processed through a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to generate nucleotide-level predictions. Specifically, the representation for a nucleotide are calculated by averaging the representations of all tokens that cover it, as illustrated in Appendix Fig. 2.

**Nucleotide-Nucleotide Relation Prediction** To analyze relationships between nucleotides, we compute a self outer product of the nucleotide representations to form a matrix that cotains the pairwise interactions between nucleotides. This matrix is then passed through a simple Resnet to get the final output.

### Benchmark Results

In Table 3, we report the benchmark results for popular and opensource methods, including literature SOTAs, naive supervised models and existing RNA language models.

**ResNet and LSTM are strong naive supervised models.** ResNet, which has only been trained on downstream tasks, can outperform most if not all language models on some tasks. LSTM outperforms the other Naive supervised Models on 9 out of 13 tasks, and the performance is better by a large margin on many tasks.

**Pre-trained RNA language models have good potential for RNA understanding.** It outperforms the previous task-specific SOTA on 8 out of 13 tasks, demonstrating that the additional unsupervised pre-training brings a lot of gains. However, there is still a long way to go on individual tasks, such as contact map prediction and distance map prediction in the structural task, vaccine degradation rate prediction in the engineering task, and CRISPR on- and off-target prediction. Of course, the previous SOTA method used additional features such as secondary structure, but it shows that there is still a lot of room for improvement in the RNA language model.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

Thus, using the single nucleotide tokenizer is sufficient, and future work should focus on designing interpretable tokenizers based on single nucleotide units [107; 120; 66].

**ALBi is better for RNA sequences understanding.** For tasks involving shorter sequences, the specific advantages of RoPE or other complex encoding schemes may not be fully realized. RoPE, which is highly effective in long sequences due to its rotational component that maintains relative positioning across long distances, might not provide significant benefits over simpler methods like ALBi in shorter sequences. Moreover, ALiBi linearly biases the attention scores based on relative positions, which helps the model better generalize across different sequence lengths.

### BEACON-B: an Efficient Baseline for RNA Language Models

Based on the above analysis of the different components of the RNA language model, combined with the Table 4, we use the single nucleotide tokenizer, ALiBi as the positional encoding, and pre-train on filtered human ncRNA sequences from RNACentral . We propose the low-resource and cost-effective BEACON-B (pre-trained on 1026 length seqs) and BEACON-B512 (pre-trained on 512 length seqs and FlashAttn ) as a baseline to provide an extremely fast and easy to use open-source pre-training model for subsequent researchers.

Although with very small GPU days (days * GPUs) as the cost of pre-training, BEACON-B can even outperform SOTA pre-trained RNA LMs on some tasks such as **contact map prediction** and **distance map prediction**. Compared with other models that also report pre-training resources, BEACON-B and BEACON-B512 can match or even surpass existing RNA language models in one-to-one comparisons on **almost half of the tasks** listed in Table 3 and Table 5, despite being pre-trained with significantly fewer resources. This demonstrates that the insights we obtain from the important components in analysing the RNA language model are vital and that biological motifs and configurations on limited RNA data can be fully explored by utilising such a combination of components in a good way.

## 6 Conclusions

**Summary.** In this work, we present BEACON, the first comprehensive RNA benchmark, which encompasses 13 diverse tasks spanning structural analysis, functional studies, and engineering applications. BEACON aims to address the critical gap in standardized evaluation for RNA models. We assess various models, from traditional approaches like CNNs to advanced RNA foundation models, providing insights into their task-specific performances. Additionally, we analysis the vital components of RNA LM from tokenization and positional encoding. Building upon this, we propose BEACON-B, an efficient baseline that incorporates single nucleotide tokenization and ALiBi. BEACON's standardized evaluation framework and the insights provided into RNA modeling components are expected to significantly advance RNA research, facilitating the development of more sophisticated models and enhancing our understanding of RNA's diverse roles in biology.

**Limitation & future work.** Despite the comprehensiveness of BEACON, it has some limitations for future work. While BEACON includes 13 diverse RNA-related tasks, it may not cover all aspects of RNA biology, necessitating the inclusion of additional tasks and datasets in future versions. The influence of pre-training datasets and hyperparameters on model performance also needs further systematic exploration to optimize configurations for specific RNA tasks. Although BEACON-B serves as an efficient baseline, there is potential for developing more advanced models that leverage RNA's unique structural characteristics. Additionally, BEACON  primarily evaluates predictive accuracy, suggesting the need to incorporate metrics like interpretability, computational efficiency, and robustness for a more holistic assessment. Addressing these limitations and exploring new directions will not only advance RNA research but also deepen our understanding of its indispensable roles in genetic regulation, disease pathogenesis, and therapeutic development.
