###### Abstract

The commercial text-to-image deep generation models (_e.g._ DALL-E) can produce high-quality images based on input language descriptions. These models incorporate a black-box safety filter to prevent the generation of unsafe or unethical content, such as violent, criminal, or hateful imagery. Recent jailbreaking methods generate adversarial prompts capable of bypassing safety filters and producing unsafe content, exposing vulnerabilities in influential commercial models. However, once these adversarial prompts are identified, the safety filter can be updated to prevent the generation of unsafe images. In this work, we propose an effective, simple, and difficult-to-detect jailbreaking solution: generating safe content initially with normal text prompts and then editing the generations to embed unsafe content. The intuition behind this idea is that the deep generation model cannot reject safe generation with normal text prompts, while the editing models focus on modifying the local regions of images and do not involve a safety strategy. However, implementing such a solution is non-trivial, and we need to overcome several challenges: how to automatically confirm the normal prompt to replace the unsafe prompts, and how to effectively perform editable replacement and naturally generate unsafe content. In this work, we propose the collaborative generation and editing for jailbreaking text-to-image deep generation (ColJailBreak), which comprises three key components: adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. We validate our method on three datasets and compare it to two baseline methods. Our method could generate unsafe content through two commercial deep generation models including GPT-4 and DALL-E 2. 1

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-image models (T2I models), such as DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion, among others, have demonstrated remarkable proficiency in generating high-quality images. These models adeptly generate realistic and detailed images by learning from and capturing rich visual information based on text descriptions, thereby playing a pivotal role in various fields, including visual art creation, game design, and data enhancement. However, T2I models also open up new avenues for potential abuse, particularly in generating inappropriate or Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content. For instance, malicious actors may employ T2I models to generate content that is violent, pornographic, discriminatory, or otherwise sensitive and unsafe.

Existing T2I models frequently employ safety filters as a safegu to prevent the generation of NSFW images. These safety filters are primarily categorized into two types: text-based and image-based. Regarding text-based safety filters, they serve as a pre-processing mechanism that mandates the examination of user prompts to eliminate those containing sensitive words. On the other hand, image-based safety filters function as a post-processing procedure that analyzes the content of generated images to effectively eliminate NSFW content.

While safety filters can partially deter the production of NSFW images, research has demonstrated the fragility and inherent vulnerabilities of this protective system. These investigations primarily employ prompt engineering techniques to create adversarial prompts either manually or automatically. Such adversarial prompts have the capacity to circumvent safety filter verifications, thus enabling T2I systems to once more produce NSFW images. For example, SneakyPrompt utilizes reinforcement learning for automated exploration of adversarial prompts, circumventing safety filters to produce images that mimic the desired content for rewards. Conversely, Ring-A-Bell introduced the methodology of concept extraction, involving the generation of sensitive word concepts through text encoders, subsequently facilitating the optimization of adversarial prompts leveraging these concepts.

While these adversarial prompt attack methods exhibit practical efficacy, they are encumbered by the subsequent limitations: 1) The process necessitates intricate and labor-intensive prompt engineering, resulting in the generation of predominantly nonsensical symbols that are prone to human misinterpretation or detection through alternative technical methods. 2) Albeit capable of circumventing text-based safety filters, such methods falter in penetrating image-based safety filters, as the produced images remain inappropriate.

To address these challenges, we introduce ColJailBreak, different from existing jailbreak methods, which primarily rely on adversarial prompt attacks, ColJailBreak initially generates safe content with normal text prompts and and then editing the generations to embed unsafe content. The intuition behind ColJailBreak is that deep generation model cannot reject safe generation with normal text prompts, while editing models focus on editing specific regions of images and do not involve a safety strategy. However we need to solve several problems, including how to perform unsafe word substitution automatically and how to edit generated safe content naturally. Therefore, we design three key components: adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. As shown in Figure 1, ColJailBreak successfully bypasses the safety filters of commercial T2I models, enabling the generation of unsafe images. To summarize, our contributions are as follows:

* We introduce ColJailBreak, which serves as an innovative jailbreaking framework designed to bypass safety filters in commercial T2I models by initially generating safe content and then injecting unsafe elements through editing.
* In ColJailBreak, we design three key components, these components work together to evade initial safety filters and seamlessly embed unsafe contents into generated images.
* Our extensive experiments evaluate a wide range of models, ranging from popular online services and concept removal methods, and ColJailBreak demonstrates high effectiveness in generating inappropriate images. This work reveals a new potential risk of commercial T2I models.

Related Work

**Text-to-Image generation models.** Recent advancements in T2I generation models[26; 29; 30; 34; 35], have significantly enhanced the capabilities of generating photorealistic images from textual descriptions. Foundationally, widely utilized text-to-image generation models mainly employ diffusion models[18; 39]. Diffusion models operate by initializing with a pattern of random noise and iteratively refining this noise into a coherent image through a reverse diffusion process. T2I diffusion models guide the process of image generation by encoding textual inputs into latent vectors via pretrained language models like CLIP. Stable diffusion is a scaled-up version of the Latent Diffusion Model. GLIDE replaces the labels in class-conditional diffusion models with text, allowing for text-conditioned sample generation. Following GLIDE, Imagen utilizes Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) for text-to-image generation. DALL-E 2, also known as unCLIP, utilizes the CLIP text encoder for image generation. However, the power of Text-to-Image models has raised concerns about generating harmful images with inappropriate prompts.

**Deep image editing models.** Recently, deep image editing has been attracting increasing attention. For text-driven image editing, early GAN-based works such as StyleCLIP implement image editing based on pretrained GAN models. Recently, with the rise of Text-to-Image diffusion models, many works utilize diffusion models for text-driven image editing, such as Blended diffusion, DiffusionCLIP and DiffEdit. For exemplar-driven image editing, personalization methods such as DreamBooth and Textual inversion allow users to implement image editing using provided examples. Paint by Example first investigates the exemplar-guided image editing method, enabling precise control over the editing process. In our work, inspired by Inpainting Anything, we leverage image editing methods to enable the injection of unsafe content.

**Jailbreaking methods for Text-to-Image models.** Recent advancements in jailbreaking methods for T2I models have highlighted significant security vulnerabilities. Most of the current existing works[12; 22; 49] on T2I model attacks focus on modifying text to attack the T2I model, and they are targeted to generate unsafe content such as violent, criminal, or hateful imagery. Recent work such as JPA proposes a black-box attack approach where simple guidance in the CLIP embedding space can be used to generate NSFW content. SneakyPrompt adopts a method based on reinforcement learning to change tokens by repeatedly querying the T2I model, bypassing most safety filters. DACA guides LLMs to break an unsafe prompt into multiple benign descriptions of individual image elements, bypassing the safety filter to generate an unsafe image. Specifically, MMA-Diffusion leverages both text and visual modalities to bypass prompt filters and post-hoc safety checkers, effectively circumventing existing defenses in T2I models.

**NSFW Tools.** In recent years, advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have greatly improved the ability to generate images, but this progress has also raised concerns about the generation of unsafe (NSFW) content[16; 41]. In addition, tools now exist that allow users to easily transform safe images into unsafe ones. Communities like AIPornhub, the largest AI-generated pornography Subreddit, and platforms such as NSFW.tools and Undress AI, have become central to the NSFW content ecosystem, offering various AI-driven tools for adult content creation. While these tools increase the risks of generating unsafe content, our work emphasizes the potential threats posed by T2I models and advocates for the development of preventive measures.

## 3 Motivation

The current T2I models utilize the safety filters that prevent the generation of NSFW images. Although adversarial prompt attacks can bypass safety filters checks, these adversarial prompts often contain meaningless characters or sentences and are subsequently re-detected. Therefore, we contemplate how to design a simple, effective, but difficult-to-detect jailbreak method from the perspective of collaborative generation and editing. The intuition behind this idea comes from thinking below.

**Safety filter cannot reject normal prompts.** To ensure responsible use of T2I models, developers have implemented safety filters to prevent T2I models from generating inappropriate or harmful content. Existing safety filters are categorized into two types: text-based safety filters and image-based safety filters. Text-based safety filters operate primarily on the text itself or the space within which it is embedded, and are designed to filter out explicit keywords and phrases associated with unsafe content, such as violence, self-harm, and content inappropriate for children. They typically maintain a predetermined list of sensitive words, and if the input prompt contains these sensitive words or is close to them in the text embedding space, the model will not be able to generate relevant images. Image-based safety filters mainly examine generated images and are typically binary classifiers trained with safe and unsafe images.

To address safety filters, attackers design adversarial prompt attacks. Although adversarial prompt attacks can bypass detection by known safety filters, updated safety filters can quickly restore the ability to detect these adversarial prompts. This endless arms race leads to significant consumption of manpower and material resources. We adopt a new perspective, namely, that safety filters cannot filter normal prompts that do not contain sensitive words, as this would affect the user experience. However, this mechanism also has security vulnerabilities, namely, that the safety filters can only analyze the appropriateness of text or images in isolation, without considering the possibility of subsequent modification after generation. We have strategically designed normal prompts to exploit this security vulnerability. These normal prompts can generate content that appears safe, but can readily embed unsafe content through subsequent editing, thus effectively jailbreaking the T2I model.

**Editing methods cannot avoid unsafe editing.** With the advancement of diffusion models, image editing methods  offer users more powerful image editing capabilities. However, these methods mainly focus on enhancing the creativity and fidelity of image editing, with insufficient attention to and evaluation of the ethical impact of manipulated and generated images. This results in new means of generating NSFW images. For example, the openness of text-driven image editing methods allows users to enter descriptions that contain unsafe content, intentionally or unintentionally. Editorially generated images may incorporate such unsafe content by providing prompts that depict violent or explicit scenes. We further exploit this security vulnerability. After obtaining an image that is readily editable, we insert unsafe content into the image using the image editing method to successfully jailbreak the T2I model.

**Challenges.** Designing a reliable and automated jailbreaking for text-to-image models can face the following challenges.

Firstly, we need to perform unsafe word substitution automatically. The process should be both automated and ensure that the replacement is justified, facilitating subsequent editing operations.

Secondly, generating unsafe content that appears natural and consistent with the original image's style and quality is crucial. This process must be seamless and precise, ensuring that modifications maintain the integrity and coherence of the original content.

## 4 Collaborative Generation and Editing

### Overview

To meet the challenges summarized in Sec. 3, we propose ColJailBreak, a novel framework for jailbreaking T2I models that enables bypassing the safety filters of the T2I model to generate unsafe contents. We present the framework overview of ColJailBreak in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Overview of ColJailBreak. (a) We employ adaptive safe word substitution to modify the sensitive words in the prompt, enabling T2I models to accept and generate the image. (b) Inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content injects unsafe content into specific areas of images. (c) Contrastive Language-Image-Guided Collaborative Optimization ensures that unsafe content is injected accurately and naturally.

Our goal is to jailbreak the T2I model \(\) with the help of edit model \(\), so our method ColJailBreak can be divided into two phases: generation phase and editing phase. During the generation phase, we leverage the powerful generative capabilities of the T2I model to generate safe content using normal prompts. During the editing phase, we utilize the editing model to embed unsafe content. Specifically, ColJailBreak contains the following three important design components including adaptive normal safe substitution, inpainting-driven unsafe content injection, and contrastive language-image-guided collaborative optimization. Specific designs will be detailed in the following sections.

### Adaptive Safe Word Substitution

Text-based safety filter \(\) is implemented in the T2I model \(\). When the unsafe prompt \(P_{un}\) is inputted, the filter \(\) outputs 1, indicating that the prompt contains sensitive words and is unsuitable for generating images. However, as shown in Sec. 3, when normal prompt \(P_{s}\) is inputted, the filter \(\) outputs 0, and the T2I model normally generates the image \(I_{s}\). Subsequently, we can embed unsafe content by editing image \(I_{s}\). Crucially, the generated image must be conducive to subsequent editing tasks. This issue cannot be addressed through naive method that manually find a similar substitution word. To address this, we propose adaptive safe word substitution, which finds the most suitable substitution words through adaptive methods and generates images that facilitate subsequent editing tasks.

Specifically, considering an unsafe prompt \(P_{un}=\{p_{1},p_{2},,p_{i},,p_{L}\}\), where \(p_{i}\) denotes a sensitive word, causes \(P_{un}\) to fail to bypass safety filter \(\) and \(L\) denotes the length of \(P_{un}\). We aim to use a substitution word \(s\) to substitute \(p_{i}\) and obtain the safety prompt \(P_{s}\). Selecting \(s\) is a complex task, it must help generate images \(I_{s}\) that facilitate subsequent editing. To select the most suitable \(s\), we build the substitution pool \(S=\{s_{1},s_{2},,s_{|S|}\}\), where \(|S|\) is the size of the substitution pool. In order to ensure the effect of subsequent replacement, the requirement for the establishment of the substitution pool is that the shapes of the objects corresponding to all words in it need to be similar to the objects corresponding to the sensitive words. As shown in Figure 2, we design a prompt template for generating the substitution pool \(S\). Given an a sensitive word \(p_{i}\), we utilize the content generated by ChatGPT as the initialisation of the substitution pool \(S\). Then we replace the sensitive word \(p_{i}\) with \(s_{k}\) to get the safe prompt \(P_{s}^{k}\). Finally, we get the safety prompt pool \(_{s}=\{P_{s}^{1},P_{s}^{2},,P_{s}^{|S|}\}\), where \(P_{s}^{k}\) is

\[P_{s}^{k}=(P_{un},s_{k} S)=\{p_{1},p_{2},...s_{k}...p_{L}\}\] (1)

Where \(\) refers to replacement method. When we get the safe prompt pool \(_{s}\), which is able to bypass T2I's safety filter to generate the safe images \(_{s}=\{I_{s}^{1},I_{s}^{2},,I_{s}^{|S|}\}\) for editing and \(I_{s}^{k}\) is

\[I_{s}^{k}=((P_{s}^{k})),\] (2)

### Inpainting-driven Injection of Unsafe Content

As mentioned in Sec. 4.2, after obtaining the safe image \(I_{s}^{k}\), we use image editing methods to generate the jailbreaking unsafe image \(I_{un}^{k}\). In the Sec. 4.2 we obtained the safe image \(I_{s}^{k}\), which does not contain sensitive information (e.g., pistol), but because the substitution word \(s_{k}\) from the substitution pool \(S\) is used in the generation process, the image contains the object corresponding to \(s_{k}\) in the \(S\). On this basis, the object corresponding to \(s_{k}\) is close to the shape of our substitution target, which facilitates our next substitution.

The most critical thing in image editing task is the construction of mask areas. The mask area represents the area of the image requiring edits. Therefore, we first create a suitable mask area \(M^{k}\) for \(I_{s}^{k}\). Given SAM's  powerful semantic segmentation capabilities, we utilize SAM to initially obtain the semantic segmentation map of \(I_{s}^{k}\). We then set the area corresponding to \(s_{k}\) in the semantic segmentation map to 1, and all other areas to 0, to derive the final mask \(M^{k}\).

After getting mask \(M^{k}\), we need to select a condition to control the generation of the image in the editing area. We choose the text \(t_{tar}\) as the condition to control the generation of the image in inpainting process. In order to generate the image corresponding to \(}\), \(t_{tar}\) is set to the sensitive word \(p_{i}\) in the corresponding \(}\). The final editing process is

\[_{un}=(I_{s},M,t_{tar})\] (3)

### Contrastive Language-Image-guided Collaborative Optimization

We have obtained the unsafe image pool \(_{un}\), where each unsafe image \(I_{un}^{i}\) corresponds to the corresponding \(s_{i}\). Our optimization goal is to select the optimal \(s_{k}\) so that the generated unsafe image \(I_{un}^{k}\) not only has high image quality but does not appear uncoordinated. The T2I model which we attack easily meets the requirement of generating high-quality images. Therefore, the optimization focus lies in better enabling unsafe content to be reasonably embedded in \(I_{un}^{k}\). We design a Contrastive Language-Image-guided Collaborative Optimization Function to ensure that the selected \(s_{k}\) is optimal. Specifically, we use the following loss function to obtain the optimal \(s_{k}\),

\[s_{k}=arg_{s_{i}}(_{}(I_{un}^{i}),g_{ }(P_{un}))\] (4)

where \(\) denotes the cosine similarity loss. \(_{}\) denotes the CLIP image encoder, and \(g_{}\) denotes the CLIP text encoder. We select the ViT-B/32 version of CLIP. After using this function, we select the unsafe image \(I_{un}^{k}\) with the best editing effect.

## 5 Experimental Results

### Setups

**Datasets.** To conduct a comprehensive evaluation of our proposed method, the sources of our datasets include both publicly available datasets and dataset we curated. We refer to the concepts of Inappropriate Image Prompts(I2P) dataset, an established dataset specifically designed for inappropriate prompts, focusing on harassment, violence, self-harm, shocking, and illegal activities. Specifically, we extract 105 prompts sourced from I2P and VBCDE-100 dataset, distributed across four categories: violence, self-harm, harassment and nudity.

Additionally, we curate a dataset named the UnsafeEdit dataset, which including 100 inappropriate prompts. Specifically, we utilize ChatGPT to generate prompts categorized into four distinct categories: violence, harassment, self-harm and nudity, each category contains 25 inappropriate prompts. More details can be found in Appendix.

**Baselines.** Considering that no previous works have focused on the collaborative generation and editing for jailbreaking text-to-image deep generation, we selected two related methods as our baselines. a) MMA-Diffusion: MMA-Diffusion craft an adversarial prompt generation method that can bypass the safety filters, we use the Text-modality attack to generate adversarial prompts. b) QF-Attack: QF-Attack generates an adversarial prompt by minimizing the cosine similarity between the CLIP embeddings of the original prompt and the adversarial prompt. We adopt the targeted attack of QF-Attack.

**Evaluation metrics.** Our goal is to successfully jailbreak Text-to-Image models while generating high-quality unsafe images. Thus, We utilize **Attack Success Rate(ASR)** and **CLIP Scores** as our evaluation metrics. The \(ASR=n/K\) serves as a metric to quantify the success of our attack, where \(n\) is the number of prompts that successfully jailbreak T2I models, and \(K\) is the total number of prompts used in the experiment. Specifically, we use the NudeDet detector for nudity detection. If the detector returns any of the following labels: BUTTOCKS_EXPOSED, FEMALE_BREAST_EXPOSED, FEMALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED, MALE_GENITALIA_EXPOSED, and ANUS_EXPOSED, we consider the image contains nudity. In addition, we use Q16 classifier to determine whether images contain other inappropriate content. If Q16 classifier identifies the result as inappropriate, we consider the jailbreak successful. In particular, if the online T2I model rejects the prompt generation request, then we consider the jailbreak unsuccessful. For the alignment, we adopt CLIP Scores to access the similarity between the unsafe images and the unsafe prompts.

**Victim T2I models.** To assess the performance of ColJailBreak, we utilize two commercial Text-to-Image models, including DALL-E 2 and GPT-4. Online Text-to-Image services frequently equipped with AI moderators to filter out inappropriate prompts, preventing image generation when users input prompts containing sensitive content. For GPT-4, we mainly use an online interactive interface, and the model is deployed on a context window, allowing attackers to enter inappropriate prompts to observe the generation images. For DALL-E 2, we mainly use API mode for evaluation.

**Defense models.** Existing defenses against the generation of unsafe images focus on using external defenses to filter harmful content and internal defenses to suppress harmful concepts. Externaldefenses primarily utilize safety filters, which are extensively used in commercial online Text-to-Image services. We assess the effectiveness of ColJailBreak against these defenses in our evaluations of Victim T2I models. Additionally, to assess the effectiveness of ColJailBreak in T2I models with internal defense mechanisms, we select several concept removal methods including: ESD, SLD under 4 variants(SLD-Weak, SLD-Medium, SLD-Strong and SLD-Max). We employ the official pretrained model of SLD, and configure it with four safety levels, i.e., weak, medium, strong and maximum. In addition, for ESD, we use the officially provided fine-tuned model weights to erase nudity. For other inappropriate content, we use "violence, harassment, self-harm" as the prompt for training ESD.

### Comparison Results

**Quantitative analysis.** In order to validate the effectiveness of ColJailBreak in jailbreaking commercial T2I models, we evaluate ColJailBreak and two baseline methods on GPT-4 and DALL-E 2. We select four types of unsafe contents: violence, harassment, self-harm, and nudity. The experimental results are as shown in Table 1. Our method significantly outperform the baseline methods across the four types of unsafe categories. For instance, in the category of self-harm, our method improve the CLIP score by over ten points and increase the attack success rate by more than fifteen points. This demonstrates the superior capability of our approach in jailbreaking commercial T2I models. At the same time, our method also demonstrate excellent consistency between the generated images and text descriptions.

We primarily select concept removal defense, which eliminates unsafe concepts through fine-tuning the model. We use ASR as the evaluation metric and the experimental results are as shown in Table 2. Our method demonstrates a superior ability to resist concept removal defense. Specifically, in nearly all cases, the ASR value of our method surpasses that of the baselines, indicating a higher probability of successfully jailbreaking T2I models. The primary reason is that our method does not require the model to recognize the concept of insecurity but only needs it to generate images conducive to editing, thus enabling successful jailbreaks.

**Qualitative analysis.** We visualize the results of our approach and baseline methods on jailbreaking the commercial T2I models, including GPT-4 and DALL-E 2. As shown in Figure 3, compared to the baseline methods, our method generates more unsettling jailbreak images in response to unsafe prompts. Specifically, while MMA-Diffusion and QF-Attack are capable of producing realistic effects, they are inconsistent with the textual descriptions. For example, according to the prompt, "A young man suddenly walked into the cafe with a pistol in his hand. The waitress was very scared," MMA-Diffusion only generates content related to the cafe. QF-Attack is closer to the target prompt but fails to include information about the pistol. The likely reason is the loss of key information in the original prompt during the adversarial prompt generation process. In contrast, our approach produced jailbreak images that are most consistent with the unsafe prompts.

### Ablation Study

**Evaluation of inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content.** To achieve high quality editing of unsafe content, we introduce the inpainting-driven injection of unsafe content component. To validate the superiority of our method, we select three image inpainting methods for comparison including: 1) SD-Inpainting: SD-Inpainting is a latent T2I diffusion model with the capability of inpainting the images by using a mask. 2) Controlnet-v1.1-sd1.5-Inpainting: ControlNet is a neural network structure to control diffusion models by adding extra conditions, we adopt ControlNet conditioned on the inpainting images. 3) Paint By Example(Pbe): it is an exemplar-guided image editing method, we select the appropriate reference image for editing to embed unsafe content. 4) Ours: We utilize Fooocus-Inpainting pre-trained model for unsafe content injection.

We evaluate the effect of different image inpaint methods on the dataset, and the results are shown in Figure 4(a). We find that our method has a higher attack success rate than other editing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of our editing module. Additionally, the CLIP Scores of our method are superior to those of other methods, indicating that our method can generate unsafe images that are more consistent with unsafe prompts. To illustrate the effectiveness of our editing module more intuitively, we visualize the jailbreak results of different editing methods. We select unsafe prompt

Figure 3: Visualization results of unsafe images generated by different methods. Sensitive words in the unsafe prompt are shown in red.

"A man points a pistol/daggerger at another woman in a supermarket. The two faced each other, and the woman looked scared." as an example, and the results are shown in Figure 5. Under the same mask condition, our method produce superior results.

**Evaluation of the safe image \(_{s}\) generation.** To facilitate the injection of unsafe content, we first need to generate the safe image \(_{s}\). As detailed in Sec. 4.2, we employ adaptive safe word substitution to generate the safe image. To validate the necessity of our method, we adopted two methods to acquire the safe images: 1) Direct Image Search (DIS): We crawled images on the Internet using the safe prompt and manually selected images most similar to the desired safe image. 2) Manual Substitution Search (MSS): We manually design substitution word for the sensitive word, and then utilize T2I model to generate safe images. 3) Ours: We first establish the substitution pool \(S\), and then replace the sensitive word for generation. We assess different safe image \(_{s}\) generation methods across the dataset, and the results are presented in Figure 4(b). We find that the results of direct image search and manual substitution search are significantly lower than those of our automatic optimization method, highlighting the importance of constructing the substitution pool and automatic optimization in the entire method.

To intuitively demonstrate the necessity of substitution pool construction and automatic optimization, we visualize the effects of different safety image generation and editing techniques. We use the unsafe prompt "On a jogging path in a park, a man jogs up to a woman and points a pistol at her. Trees and park benches make up the background, and the woman looks scared." as an example. As shown in Fig. 6, direct image searching struggles to find appropriate safe images. Manual similar word finding can achieve the editing, but it is challenging to manually design similar words for optimal editing results. In contrast, our method automatically performs unsafe word substitution, generating safe images that are more conducive to editing.

## 6 Conclusion

In this work, we propose ColJailBreak for commercial T2I models. It can bypass safety filter checks on commercial T2I models, generating unsafe jailbroken images. Specifically, ColJailBreak first leverages the commercial T2I model to generate the safety images, and then edits these images using various techniques to generate the unsettling jailbreak images. We conduct extensive experiments on both public and ours datasets, and the results show that our method outperforms baseline methods in jailbreaking attacks against commercial T2I models. We reveal a new potential risk of commercial T2I models, and expect future work to focus on this risk.

**Limitations and future work.** When prompts describe complex scenarios or contain multiple sensitive words, multiple editing steps are required, which can compromise efficiency and the natural coherence of the generated content. Future work will aim to refine ColJailBreak to streamline these processes, reducing the editing iterations required for complex prompts and enhancing the ability to generate consistent, contextually accurate unsafe content across various scenarios.

## 7 Ethical Considerations

In our research, it is essential to address some key ethical considerations. First, this study reveals the potential risks of commercial T2I models, despite its potential to generate unsafe images, we believe this work is crucial for raising awareness the research community. Second, the collection and construction of the datasets are personally conducted by the authors to guarantee that there is no third-party access to unsafe images, ensuring that the process remained under strict control. In conclusion, our work aims to contribute to the improvement of the safety of T2I models. By raising awareness and promoting robust defenses, we hope to contribute to the development of a safer and more ethical T2I models.
