###### Abstract

Biological systems possess remarkable sound source localization (SSL) capabilities that are critical for survival in complex environments. This ability arises from the collaboration between the auditory periphery, which encodes sound as precisely timed spikes, and the auditory cortex, which performs spike-based computations. Inspired by these biological mechanisms, we propose a novel neuromorphic SSL framework that integrates spike-based neural encoding and computation. The framework employs Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons with a phase-locking coding (RF-PLC) method to achieve energy-efficient audio processing. The RF-PLC method leverages the resonance properties of RF neurons to efficiently convert audio signals to time-frequency representation and encode interaural time difference (ITD) cues into discriminative spike patterns. In addition, biological adaptations like frequency band selectivity and short-term memory effectively filter out many environmental noises, enhancing SSL capabilities in real-world settings. Inspired by these adaptations, we propose a spike-driven multi-auditory attention (MAA) module that significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of the proposed SSL framework. Extensive experimentation demonstrates that our SSL framework achieves state-of-the-art accuracy in SSL tasks. Furthermore, it shows exceptional noise robustness and maintains high accuracy even at very low signal-to-noise ratios. By mimicking biological hearing, this neuromorphic approach contributes to the development of high-performance and explainable artificial intelligence systems capable of superior performance in real-world environments.

## 1 Introduction

Sound source localization (SSL)  is a critical skill for mammals that enables them to identify and locate external auditory stimuli. This skill plays a vital role in survival behaviors like prey detection and predator evasion. Over decades of scientific exploration , SSL has evolved from a purely biological concept to a sophisticated technology with a wide range of applications across various fields . Today, SSL methods are finding increasing use in areas like security monitoring , robotic navigation , and autonomous driving .

Early SSL approaches rely on hand-crafted analysis of speech signals from multiple receivers. While offering a basic ability to localize sound sources, these methods suffer from limitations in accuracy and robustness. The emergence of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and their success in various domains lead researchers to explore their application in SSL tasks, achieving significant performance improvements . However, DNN-based approaches face two key challenges. Firstly, DNNsachieving high SSL accuracy often require substantial computational resources, leading to increased energy consumption. Secondly, DNNs struggle to learn the intricate relationships between localization behaviors and noisy environmental constraints. These limitations hinder the development of portable, edge-based SSL models  for real-world environments.

Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) [14; 20; 34], inspired by brain neural architectures, have gained significant attention for their energy-efficient simulation of neural systems. Spiking neurons  simulate the information transmission mechanism of biological neurons, computing only upon the arrival of input spikes and remaining silent otherwise . Such an event-driven mechanism results in sparser information transmission [60; 61], hence reducing computational costs [6; 69]. Therefore, the SNN-based SSL models enable a more energy-efficient emulation of biological SSL processes. Pan et al.  propose a SNN-based SSL model that achieves localization in real audio signals. Chen et al. improve the model's performance through a hybrid encoding method, achieving competitive results with less energy consumption. Although these examples achieve edge-friendly SSL ability, limitations still exist in neural encoding efficiency and robustness under noisy conditions.

In terms of neural encoding, most methods still rely on Fourier Transform (FT) [27; 55] to encode ITD  present in the received audio signals into spike trains for processing by back-end SSL model. However, FT operations involve many multiply-accumulate (MAC) computations and require significant computational resources  which hinders our goal of developing energy-efficient SSL models. In terms of robustness, the superior localization ability in biology not only relies on ITD cues but also on various auditory mechanisms [22; 54], such as frequency preferences, short-term memory, etc. Frequency preference significantly mitigates the impact of complex environments on localization accuracy [31; 62], and auditory short-term memory effectively filters out irrelevant noise [49; 50], focusing on important auditory signals. However, most SNN-based solutions [3; 32] primarily focus on ITD cues, with little attention to multiple auditory mechanisms. Therefore, investigating more energy-efficient and robust SNN-based SSL models remains a pressing challenge to address.

In this paper, we propose a novel SNN-based SSL framework, which primarily comprises an ITD encoding front-end method and a biomimetic localization back-end model. As illustrated in Fig.1, we introduce a phase-locking coding (RF-PLC) method using Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons [8; 38] and detection neurons . It simulates the frequency band decomposition function of the basilar membrane and captures ITD cues, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce a novel back-end SSL model based on multi-auditory attention (MAA) that integrates frequency preferences and short-term

memory characteristics. This approach significantly improves both the accuracy and robustness of localization. Extensive experiment on the HRTF , Single Words , and SLoClas  datasets demonstrates that our SNN-based model achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, evaluation in noisy environments reveals the model's enhanced adaptability to real-world conditions. The work introduces the following key contributions:

* **Spike-based ITD encoding**: The RF-PLC method leverages the resonance properties of RF neurons to perform energy-efficient auditory time-frequency transformations, avoiding the high resource costs of FT operations. Additionally, it utilizes a phase-locking loop and ITD detection neurons to encode auditory ITD cues into spike patterns directly, ensuring the fully spike-driven nature of the entire SSL framework.
* **Biologically inspired attention**: The MAA module incorporates knowledge of biological auditory frequency preferences and short-term memory characteristics. Frequency preferences effectively mask the ITD information of irrelevant frequency bands and spatial regions, while short-term memory focuses on the interaction of information across adjacent time steps. This combination enhances the robustness of the SNN model in noisy environments.
* **State-of-the-art performance with reduced complexity**: By integrating these methods, we present a SNN-based SSL framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance while reducing energy consumption to existing works. Additionally, extensive experimentation demonstrates that our system exhibits superior robustness in noisy environments.

## 2 Related Work

### ITD Cues for SSL Tasks

To develop biologically inspired models for SSL tasks, researchers have drawn upon the auditory localization mechanisms observed in mammals [23; 25]. The cues of ITD are recognized as critical for these models [29; 44; 46; 47]. ITD refers to the temporal disparity in sound arrival between the ears. Specifically, when a sound source is closer to the listener's right side, audio reaches the right ear sooner than the left. The Jeffress model  and BiSoLaNN  encode ITD cues into spike trains and corroborate their biological credibility through experiments on barn owls . But these approaches primarily focus on the localization of pure tones, which significantly differs from the time-varying audio signal in daily life. Substantially, some researchers [7; 40] have utilized complex FT operations to obtain the phase information of audio signals. However, FT operations require substantial computational resources and pose significant challenges when implementing systems on edge devices with limited computational capabilities. Therefore, the exploration of low-power ITD encoding methods become a pressing direction to pursue.

### Biological Adaptation in Auditory System

In the field of auditory science, frequency preference and short-term memory characteristics are essential for understanding auditory processing. Numerous studies [21; 52; 63] have demonstrated that biological auditory systems exhibit heightened sensitivity to specific frequency ranges, such as 20-20 000 Hz in humans, with other species like bats and blue whales adapted to different ranges. Further research  has revealed tonotopic maps and variations in frequency tuning across regions, underscoring the importance of frequency selectivity in hearing. Electrophysiological experiments  confirmed that inner hair cells on the basilar membrane of the cochlea exhibit significant differences in response to various frequency bands.

These studies underscore the irreplaceable role of frequency band preference in auditory decision-making. Additionally, compared to visual short-term memory, auditory short-term memory [2; 28] has a shorter retention span. Nonetheless, it is essential for real-time integration and coherent environmental perception. Simultaneously, some researchers  propose that neurofeedback training targeting auditory short-term memory can significantly enhance selective attention to auditory signals in noisy environments. Moreover, Zhong et al.  suggested that auditory short-term memory can highlight sound source characteristics under reverberant conditions, reducing interference from other sources. However, current SSL methods mainly focus on ITD cues, neglecting these well-established biological mechanisms. Therefore, the effective integration of diverse auditory attention mechanisms within SSL tasks to enhance robustness remains a significant ongoing challenge.

Method

In this section, we introduce our spike-based SSL framework, which includes a front-end ITD encoding method and a back-end localization model. For the front-end ITD encoding, we propose the energy-efficient RF-PLC method, which uses RF neurons to capture ITD cues and detection neurons to convert these encoded cues into spike patterns. For the back-end localization model, we take inspiration from biological adaptation and propose the MAA mechanism to enhance the model's localization performance and robustness.

### RF Phase-locking Coding: A Direct Font-end ITD Encoding Method

Due to the physical separation of the ears, sound waves arrive at each ear with slightly different timing. It leads to differences in the initial phase information between the two audio channels. Pan et al.  propose a Multi-Tones Phase Coding (MTPC) method that utilizes this information to exploit ITD cues. However, this approach relies on computationally expensive FT operations and introduces an additional phase transformation step during processing. To overcome these limitations, we propose the RF-PLC method, leveraging RF neurons' resonance filtering and periodic decay properties. This approach effectively eliminates the need for energy-intensive FT and phase transformation processes. Subsequently, a set of detection neurons with varying delays is employed to efficiently encode the ITD cues from different microphones into spike patterns.

The first step of our model processes the raw audio to capture ITD cues. We segment the audio into \(y_{l}\) based on the smallest durations by the human ear. These segments are then encoded by specialized RF neurons  tuned to different frequency bands. The dynamics of these RF neurons can be described as follows:

\[_{}[t]= e^{ t} _{}[t-1]+I[t],\] (1)

where \(\) represents the resonant frequency of the neuron, indicating the number of radians it progresses per second. \(\) serves as the dampening factor, which causes the oscillation to decay exponentially. \( t\) represents the sampling rate, which is set to 1. \(I[t]\) denotes the audio input. \(_{}[t]\) can be reformulated as \(x+y\). A detailed process can be found in Appendix. A. The real component \(x\) of \(_{}\) reflects the current-like behavior of the neuron, capturing the dynamics of voltage-gated and synaptic currents. The imaginary component \(y\) of \(_{}[t]\) serves as a voltage-like variable.

Based on Eq. 1, we depict the spiking behavior of the RF neuron in Fig. 2(a) and summarize its characteristics in two aspects. Firstly, the complex form of the RF neuron's dynamics enables it to capture the phase information in a specific frequency band \(\), termed resonance filtering. Secondly, the dampening factor \(\) allows it to exhibit periodic decay characteristics when there is no input.

By leveraging RF neurons' resonance filtering and periodic decay properties, we encode input signals into ITD cues efficiently and effectively. To better describe the RF-PLC process, we decompose the

Figure 2: Properties of spiking neuron models. (a) Responses of the LIF and RF neurons to an identical input spike train. We can observe distinct patterns in both membrane voltage accumulation and spiking behavior between the two neuron models. (b) The frequency-selective properties of RF neurons. RF neurons with a resonant frequency of 10 Hz (\(=10\)) have a significantly stronger response at 10 Hz compared to the response at 40 Hz.

dynamics of the RF neurons into two stages: a silent stage and a spike stage. The silent stage is utilized to decompose audio information into distinct frequency components and store this data in the state of the RF. The spike stage then oscillates phase information, effectively converting it into ITD cues through phase-locking mechanisms. These stages can be described as follows:

\[_{}[t]=e^{ t}_ {}[t-1]+I[t],&,\\  e^{ t}_{}[t-1],&. \] (2)

In the silent stage, RF neurons with distinct \(\) values selectively respond to specific resonant frequencies. As illustrated in Fig.2(b), when the frequency \(_{1}\) of the audio input \(I[t]\) closely matches the RF neuron's resonant frequency \(\), a significant increase in its membrane potential occurs. Conversely, misalignment between these frequencies leads to a slower accumulation of membrane potential. This characteristic offers an energy-efficient alternative to the computationally expensive FT operations. The result of the silent stage can be interpreted as analogous to the initial phase information of each pure sinusoidal component within the audio signal.

In the spike stage, we introduce a PLC method that ensures the RF neuron fires a spike only at a specific phase. Specifically, the spike firing time \(t_{}\) is defined as the special state when the real part of the RF neuron state reaches zero and the imaginary part reaches its maximum (\(_{}[t_{}]=0+_{}\)). This precise spike timing can be directly utilized as an ITD cue, with details validated in Appendix B. Notably, the periodic decay characteristic of RF neurons guarantees that only one spike is generated using our PLC method, ensuring the efficiency of ITD encoding.

As illustrated in Fig.3(a), we provide a schematic representation for obtaining ITD cues from input audio. During the silent stage, RF neurons receive audio signals and convert them into phase information of pure tones at different frequencies. During the spike stage, the PLC method leverages this phase information to determine whether the RF neuron fires a spike. The precise spike timing of the RF neuron serves as the ITD cue. Compared to traditional FT-based methods that rely on multiple network layers, our RF-PLC significantly reduces computational costs and offers a more biologically plausible representation of ITD cues.

The final step of the RF-PLC method involves detection neurons that convert spike times (also, ITD cues) into spike patterns. As illustrated in Fig.3(b), a series of detection neurons are used in each band, with each neuron tuned to a specific delay preference (from \(_{1}\) to \(_{n}\)). These detection neurons then encode the overall ITD cues for the audio signal. Interestingly, similar symmetrical detection structures have been observed in mammalian auditory pathways , which support the biological plausibility of our approach.

Figure 3: The proposed the RF-PLC method. (a) ITD cues capture: during the silent stage, RF neurons replace FT by responding to input signals. In the spike stage, the RF neurons’ first oscillatory peak time is encoded as their spike firing time through a phase-locking loop. (b) The coincidence detection network: detection neurons directly encode ITD cues by analyzing the spike timings of multiple RF neurons from two receivers and generating spikes after a specific time delay.

### MAA: Multi-auditory Attention Mechanism for Back-end SNN-based SSL Model

After encoding audio signals into spike patterns, we construct a back-end SNN-based model to process this encoded information for SSL tasks. The SNN-based SSL model is built based on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron due to its computation efficiency. The LIF model receives the resultant current and accumulates membrane potential which is used to compare with the threshold to determine whether to generate the spike. Its dynamic can be described as follows:

\[U[t+1]=H[t]+X[t+1],\] (3)

\[S[t+1]=(U[t+1]-V_{th}),\] (4)

\[H[t+1]=V_{reset}S[t+1]+ U[t+1](1-S[t+1]).\] (5)

At each time step \(t+1\), the spatial input current \(X[t+1]\) is obtained through convolution and linear layers. This current integrates with the previous temporal input \(H[t]\) to update the membrane potential \(U[t+1]\). The Heaviside step function \(()\) determines whether the binary spike \(S[t+1]\) is generated by comparing the membrane voltage with the threshold \(V_{th}\).

If there is spike emission, \(H[t]\) is reset to the resting potential \(V_{reset}\); otherwise, \(U[t+1]\) decays with a time constant \(\) and directly feeds into \(H[t+1]\). We denote the LIF spiking neuron layer as \(()\), which takes \(X[t+1]\) as input and produces the spike tensor \(S[t+1]\) as output. Existing back-end SNN-based SSL models only rely on simple convolutional and fully connected layers for localization, without considering biological adaptation mechanisms such as frequency band selectivity and short-term memory. This leaves substantial room for improvement in localization performance. Therefore, we draw on these biological mechanisms to propose the computationally efficient MAA.

In the field of SNNs, there have been some studies on attention mechanisms . However, these methods almost rely heavily on squeeze-and-excitation operations, which introduce additional MAC operations. Therefore, we propose a novel spike-driven MAA mechanism that comprises a frequency-spatial joint attention module and a short-term memory structure. The former enhances networks' focus on critical ITD cues within key frequency bands. The latter strengthens the model's memory for wise decisions across timeframes. Notably, our MAA module is tailored for SSL tasks and achieves the best trade-off between performance and efficiency.

#### 3.2.1 Frequency-Spatial Joint Attention

To enhance adaptive learning and selection of preferred frequency in our SNN-based SSL model, we propose a spike-driven FSJA module. For each time step, the output of the RF-PLC method is

Figure 4: Comparing MAA with spiking attention methods. (a) In SNNs, CA/SA uses MAC-based broadcasting operations. (b) TA  efficiently focuses on temporal sequences but struggles with streaming data. (c) FSJA adopts a binary attention map as an alternative to MAC-based broadcasting, enhancing computational sparsity and masking noise (white blocks). (d) ST-M incorporates ITD cues within a streaming context, significantly reducing the model’s computational resource.

defined as \(X[t]^{C}\), where \(\) and \(\) respectively represent the number of RF and detection neurons, and \(C\) denotes the microphone array. The FSJA module can be expressed as follows:

\[=(}{ _{i=1}^{}_{j=1}^{}}X_{i,j}[t]),_{FS} ()=(( )),=_{FS}() X[t],\] (6)

where ConvBN is convolution operations with a \(3 3\) kernel and batch normalization. The matrix \(\) is defined as the average of \(X[t]\) across the \(\) dimension and \(\) dimension and the spike results after passing through the LIF neuron. Due to the attention map of FSJA module is in binary spike form, it effectively concentrates on spike information at specific frequency and spatial dimensions.

To further demonstrate the difference between our FSJA module and previous SNN-based attention methods across frequency and spatial dimensions, we show the difference between them. As shown in Fig. 4(a), the existing SNN-based attention module relies on full-precision values. Although the broadcast operation is a spike-driven computational paradigm, it introduces additional MAC operations for the next layer. As shown in Fig. 4(c), it effectively avoids MAC-based broadcasting operations which substantially improves energy efficiency. Additionally, our method effectively masks the ITD information of irrelevant frequency bands and spatial regions, substantially boosting the SSL model's robustness in noisy environments.

#### 3.2.2 Short-term Memory Structure

The auditory short-term memory characteristic enables sustained perception of SSL processing, yet few studies have focused on this aspect. Although the membrane potential accumulation of spiking neurons partially reflects this mechanism, its simplified mathematical expression is insufficient for describing short-term memory adequately. Therefore, we develop an innovative ST-M structure that emphasizes the interaction of information across adjacent time steps to enhance the neuronal memory capacity. The structure can be represented as:

\[ In[t]&=( (X[t])),\\ [t]&=( ([t-1])+(1-)In[t]), \] (7)

where \(In[t]\) represents the preliminary feature extraction of the input \(X[t]\), and \([t]\) denotes the enhanced memory unit, with \(\) serving as the hyperparameter that balances adjacent time steps. Our ST-M architecture is asynchronous, processing information frame-by-frame rather than employing time-dimension attention, thereby significantly reducing the computational resources required by the network and facilitating the direct processing of streaming audio information. Additionally, by balancing the memory residual at time \(t-1\) with the input information at time \(t\), our approach facilitates memory interaction between adjacent time steps. This processing paradigm that relies on input from adjacent time steps pays more attention to short-term memory, thereby granting our model improved localization robustness in dynamic environments.

To avoid the MAC operations present in \(([t-1])\), we integrate \(\) into the firing threshold of \(\), which can be expressed by the following formula:

\[[t]=^{}(([t-1])+In[t]).\] (8)

Here, \(^{}\) denotes a layer of spiking neurons with a threshold of \(V_{th}/\). Due to \([t]\) and \(X[t]\) being binary spikes and ConvBN can be fused during inference, Eq. 8 contains no MAC operations which ensure low power consumption in inference. Compared with attention in the temporal dimension, the ST-M structure demonstrates asynchronous inference and low-power computational characteristics. As shown in Fig. 4(b) and Fig. 4(d), TA methods require the processing of all temporal information and rely on full-precision attention representation, whereas our ST-M structure utilizes only the spike information from adjacent time steps and features spike-driven computation. This ensures the model can perform inference in a low-power manner.

Combining the FSJA and ST-M modules, we propose a spike-driven MAA mechanism, with its insertion location detailed in the Appendix. D. The proposed MAA mechanism leverages the FSJA module to effectively filter noise, and the ST-M module to strengthen the model's memory for wise decisions across timeframes. As a result, our biologically inspired MAA significantly improves the localization accuracy and robustness of our SNN-based back-end network model.

Experiments

In this section, we evaluate our proposed spike-based SSL framework performance on three datasets: the HRTF , Single Words , and SLoClas dataset . Moreover, we examine its energy efficiency and robustness through extensive ablation studies and noise addition experiments on the SLoClas dataset.

### Comparison with SOTA Models

The HRTF dataset and Single Word are examined utilizing 2-channel audio at a singular frequency, with a minimum angular resolution of 10\({}^{}\). In contrast, the SLoClas dataset comprises 4-channel audio in real-world scenarios, with a higher resolution of 5\({}^{}\). Consequently, the SLoClas dataset presents a higher level of challenge and more closely resembles real-world scenarios. We report in detail the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and the classification accuracy (Acc.) , defined as shows:

\[(^{})&= _{i=1}^{N}|}-|,\\ (\%)&=_{i=1}^{N}(| }-|<),\] (9)

where \(}\) represents the estimated azimuth angle, and \(_{i}\) denotes the ground truth azimuth angle of the sample i. MAE quantifies the deviation between predicted and true angles, where a lower value means superior performance. Moreover, Acc quantifies the similarity between predicted angles and actual output angles. The \(\) is set differently across datasets to align with their specific characteristics: For the HRTF and Single Word datasets, \(\) is set at 5\({}^{}\), while for the SLoClas dataset, it is set to 2.5\({}^{}\). In this manner, \(\) is rounded to the nearest increment corresponding to the minimum localization resolution when calculating classification accuracy.

As shown in Table 1, our model achieves SOTA accuracy among similarly sized models but also significantly reduces MAE metrics. Specifically, our model achieves an accuracy of 99.84% and 99.63% on the HRTF datasets and Single Words, respectively. Additionally, on the challenging SLoClas dataset, our model achieves a MAE of 0.33\({}^{}\) and an accuracy of approximately 96.4%, while the number of the model parameter is only 1.64M. It represents a nearly 50% improvement in the MAE metric compared to the current SOTA performance of SNN-based models. The localization precision of our model is also competitive compared to other recently introduced ANN models.

### Ablation Study

To assess the efficiency of the proposed RF-PLC method and MAA module, we conduct a series of ablation studies. Specifically, we compare our ITD extraction approach in the RF-PLC method with the established FT-based method used in previous work . As depicted in Fig.5(a), our method achieves an accuracy nearly identical to that of the conventional approaches, with an error rate of only 1%. Furthermore, prior research has demonstrated that RF neurons exhibit significantly lower energy consumption compared to FT operations, particularly when implemented on neuromorphic hardware [17; 18; 45]. These findings validate the effectiveness of our RF-PLC method in achieving a highly efficient and accurate ITD encoding scheme.

The effectiveness of the MAA module is demonstrated in the model's localization performance. As shown in Table. 2, both the FSJA module and ST-M structure components individually enhance the performance of the back-end SSL model, and their combination yields even superior results. In addition, compared to attention mechanisms such as TA and TCJA, our attention method employs a fully spike-driven computational paradigm. This characteristic allows our MAA method to maintain an energy consumption of 9.58uJ, representing an increase of 8.49% compared to the work. Moreover, Fig.5(b) illustrates the binary nature of the MAA attention map. This design effectively avoids the energy-intensive broadcasting operations typically associated with MAC units. Details on the energy consumption calculations are provided in Appendix. D and Appendix. E. This capability substantially improves the model's robustness, which is discussed in the following section.

### Robustness Experiments

To assess the robustness of our proposed spike-based SSL framework, we evaluate the distribution of MAE under varying signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. It is a metric used to measure the level of noise present in the input signal. It can be defined as follows:

    &  &  &  &  \\   & & & & MAE ( \({}^{}\) ) & Acc ( \% ) \\  Baseline  & \(\) & 1.61M & 8.83 & 1.23\({}^{}\) & 93.95\% \\  TA  & \(\) & 1.62M & 15.37 & 0.65\({}^{}\)\(\)0.05\({}^{}\) & 93.37\% \(\)1.2\(\%\) \\ TCJA  & \(\) & 1.68M & 15.34 & 0.47\({}^{}\)\(\)0.03\({}^{}\) & 93.45\% \(\)1.0\(\%\) \\  ST-M & \(\) & 1.62M & 8.99 & 0.45\({}^{}\)\(\)0.03\({}^{}\) & 95.67\% \(\)0.5\(\%\) \\ FSJA & \(\) & 1.63M & 9.42 & 0.49\({}^{}\)\(\)0.02\({}^{}\) & 95.95\% \(\)0.6\(\%\) \\ MAA & \(\) & 1.64M & 9.58 & **0.33\({}^{}\)\(\)**0.02\({}^{}\) & **96.40\% \(\)**0.3\(\%\) \\

\[=10_{10}(}}{P_{}}),\] (10)

where \(P_{}\) represents the power of the signal and \(P_{}\) denotes the power of the noise. A lower SNR indicates a higher proportion of noise. Specifically, we incorporate noise from the NOISEX-92 database into audio recordings from different microphone channels. Detailed information about the noise addition process and the experimental setup is described in the Appendix.C.

As shown in Fig.6(a), we visualize the encoding results of the RF-PLC method under various SNR conditions to better understand the input form of our back-end model. In addition, we also present the distribution of recognition over 360\({}^{}\). As shown in Fig.6(b) and Fig.6(c), the MTPC method is more likely to predict certain angles, especially in terms of information in the noise direction; however, our method is not significantly affected by noise information. It indicates that our model exhibits higher stability. As SNR increases, our method demonstrates higher recognition accuracy. This indicates that our model effectively suppresses noise in specific frequency bands, thereby preventing significant variations in recognition results due to increased noise. The results provide strong evidence of the model's superior generalization and robustness when applied to complex real-world scenarios.

## 5 Conclusion

Inspired by the efficiency of biological auditory systems, this work proposes a novel spike-based SSL framework. The core components are the RF-PLC method and the MAA module. The RF-PLC method leverages the resonance properties of RF neurons to bypass computationally expensive FT operations. It utilizes a phase-locking loop and ITD detection neurons to efficiently encode ITD cues from the audio signal into spike trains. Furthermore, the study incorporates insights from auditory biology, including frequency preferences and short-term memory characteristics. By designing a fully spike-driven MAA module, our SNN-based SSL model effectively filters irrelevant environmental noise in the frequency domain while temporally focusing on specific auditory content. This approach achieves superior performance, robustness, and interpretability, significantly advancing the field of neuromorphic SSL research. It establishes a new benchmark for the development of SSL techniques. Future work will investigate the deployment of this model on neuromorphic hardware platforms.
