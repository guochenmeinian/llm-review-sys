###### Abstract

We address the issue of physical implausibility in multi-view neural reconstruction. While implicit representations have gained popularity in multi-view 3D reconstruction, previous work struggles to yield physically plausible results, limiting their utility in domains requiring rigorous physical accuracy. This lack of plausibility stems from the absence of physics modeling in existing methods and their inability to recover intricate geometrical structures. In this paper, we introduce PhyRecon, the first approach to leverage both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation to learn implicit surface representations. PhyRecon features a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator built on neural implicit representations. Central to this design is an efficient transformation between SDF-based implicit representations and explicit surface points via our proposed Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), enabling differentiable learning with both rendering and physical losses. Additionally, PhyRecon models both rendering and physical uncertainty to identify and compensate for inconsistent and inaccurate monocular geometric priors. The physical uncertainty further facilitates physics-guided pixel sampling to enhance the learning of slender structures. By integrating these techniques, our model supports differentiable joint modeling of appearance, geometry, and physics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PhyRecon significantly improves the reconstruction quality. Our results also exhibit superior physical stability in physical simulators, with at least a 40% improvement across all datasets, paving the way for future physics-based applications.

## 1 Introduction

3D scene reconstruction is fundamental in computer vision, with applications spanning graphics, robotics, and more. Building on neural implicit representations , previous methods  have utilized multi-view images and monocular cues to recover fine-grained 3D geometry via volume rendering . However, these approaches have overlooked physical plausibility, limiting their applicability in physics-intensive tasks such as embodied AI  and robotics .

The inability to achieve physically plausible reconstruction arises primarily from the _lack of physics modeling_. Existing methods based on neural implicit representation rely solely on rendering supervision, lacking explicit incorporation of physical constraints, such as those from physical simulators. This oversight compromises their ability to optimize 3D shapes for stability, as the models are not informed by the physics that would ensure realistic and stable structures in the real world.

Additionally, these methods often _ignore thin structures_, focusing instead on optimizing the substantial parts of objects within images. This limitation is due to overly-smoothed and averaged optimizationresults from problematic geometric priors, including multi-modal inconsistency (_e.g._, depth-normal), multi-view inconsistency, and inaccurate predictions deviating from the true underlying 3D geometry. As a result, they struggle to capture the slender structures crucial for object stability, leading to reconstructions that lack the fine details necessary for accurate physical simulation.

To address these limitations, we present PhyRecon, the first effort to integrate differentiable rendering and differentiable physical simulations for learning implicit surface representations. Specifically, we propose a differentiable particle-based physical simulator and an efficient algorithm, Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC), for differentiable transformation between SDF-based implicit representations and explicit surface points. The simulator facilitates accurate computation of 3D rigid body dynamics subjected to forces of gravity, contact, and friction, providing intricate details about the current shapes of the objects. Our differentiable pipeline efficiently implements and optimizes the implicit surface representation by coherently integrating feedback from rendering and physical losses.

Moreover, to enhance the reconstruction of intricate structures and address geometric prior inconsistencies, we propose a joint uncertainty model describing both rendering and physical uncertainty. The rendering uncertainty identifies and mitigates inconsistencies arising from multi-view geometric priors, while the physical uncertainty reflects the dynamic trajectory of 3D contact points in the physical simulator, offering precise and interpretable monitoring of regions lacking physical support. Utilizing these uncertainties, we adaptively adjust the per-pixel depth, normal, and instance mask losses to avoid erroneous priors in surface reconstruction. Observing that intricate geometries occupying fewer pixels are less likely to be sampled, we propose a physics-guided pixel sampling based on physical uncertainty to help recover slender structures.

We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets including ScanNet  and ScanNet++ , and the synthetic dataset Replica . Results demonstrate that our method significantly surpasses all state-of-the-art methods in both reconstruction quality and physical plausibility. Through ablative studies, we highlight the effectiveness of physical loss and uncertainty modeling. Remarkably, our approach achieves significant advancements in stability, registering at least a 40% improvement across all examined datasets, as assessed using the physical simulator Isaac Gym .

In summary, our main contributions are three-fold:

1. We introduce the first method that seamlessly bridges neural scene reconstruction and physics simulation through a differentiable particle-based physical simulator and the proposed SP-MC that efficiently transforms implicit representations into explicit surface points. Our method enables differentiable optimization with both rendering and physical losses.

Figure 1: **Illustration of PhyRecon.** We leverage both differentiable physics simulation and differentiable rendering to learn implicit surface representation. Results from previous methods  fail to remain stable in physical simulators or recover intricate geometries, while PhyRecon achieves significant improvements in both reconstruction quality and physical plausibility.

2. We propose a novel method that jointly models rendering and physical uncertainties for 3D reconstruction. By dynamically adjusting the per-pixel rendering loss and physics-guided pixel sampling, our model significantly improves the reconstruction of thin structures.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model significantly enhances reconstruction quality and physical plausibility, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Our results exhibit substantial stability improvements, signaling broader potential for physics-demanding applications.

## 2 Related Work

Neural Implicit Surface ReconstructionWith the increasing popularity of neural implicit representations [48; 79; 35; 6; 49; 7; 40] in 3D reconstruction, recent studies [50; 64; 75] have bridged the volume density in Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) [45; 80] with the iso-surface representation, _e.g._, occupancy  or signed distance function (SDF)  to enable reconstruction from 2D images. Furthermore, advanced methods [68; 29; 69; 32] achieve compositional scene reconstruction by decomposing the latent 3D representation into the background and foreground objects. Despite achieving plausible object disentanglement, these methods fail to yield physically plausible reconstruction results, primarily due to the absence of physics constraints in existing neural implicit reconstruction pipelines. This paper addresses this limitation by incorporating both appearance and physical cues, thereby enabling surface learning with both rendering and physical losses.

Incorporating Priors into Neural Surface ReconstructionVarious priors, such as Manhattan-world assumptions [20; 18], monocular geometric priors (_i.e._, normal  and depth  from off-the-shelf model [55; 12; 2]) and diffusion priors [70; 34], have been employed to improve optimization and robustness in surface reconstruction, especially in texture-less regions of indoor scenes. However, these priors primarily involve geometry and appearance, neglecting physics priors despite their critical role in assessing object shapes and achieving stability. This paper proposes to incorporate physical priors through a differentiable simulator, with physical loss to penalize object movement and a joint uncertainty modeling of both rendering and physics. Rendering uncertainty filters multi-view inconsistencies in the monocular geometric priors, akin to prior work [41; 73; 51; 71]. The physical uncertainty employs the 3D contact points from the simulator to offer accurate insights into areas lacking physical support, which helps modulate the rendering losses and guides pixel sampling.

Physics in Scene UnderstandingThere has been an increasing interest in incorporating physics commonsense in the scene understanding community, spanning various topics such as object generation [47; 14; 61; 44; 43], object decomposition [36; 82; 5], material simulation [23; 31; 72; 81], scene synthesis [54; 74], and human motion generation [57; 59; 22; 78; 66; 21; 4; 8; 25; 65; 24]. In the context of scene reconstruction, previous work primarily focuses on applying collision loss on 3D bounding boxes to adjust their translations and rotations [11; 3], and penalize the penetration between objects [79; 69]. Ma _et al._ controls objects within a differentiable physical environment and integrates differentiable rendering to improve the generalizability of object control in unknown rendering configurations. In this paper, we propose to incorporate physics information into the neural implicit surface representation through a differentiable simulator, significantly enhancing both the richness of the physical information and the granularity of the optimization. The simulator not only furnishes detailed object trajectories but also yields detailed information about the object shapes in the form of 3D contact points. With physical loss directly backpropagated to the implicit shape representation, our approach leads to a refined optimization of object shapes and physical stability.

## 3 Method

Given an input set of \(N\) posed RGB images \(=\{I_{1},,I_{N}\}\) and corresponding instance masks \(=\{S_{1},,S_{N}\}\), our objective is to reconstruct each object and the background in the scene. Fig. 2 presents an overview of our proposed PhyRecon.

### Background

Volume Rendering of SDF-based Implicit SurfacesWe utilize neural implicit surfaces with SDF to represent 3D geometry for implicit reconstruction. The SDF provides a continuous function that yields the distance \(s()\) to the closest surface for a given point \(\), with the sign indicating whether the point lies inside (negative) or outside (positive) the surface. We implement the SDF function as a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network \(f()\), and similarly, the appearance function as \(g()\).

For each camera ray \(=(,)\) with \(\) as the ray origin and \(\) as the viewing direction, \(n\) points \(\{_{i}=+t_{i} i=0,1,,n-1\}\) are sampled, where \(t_{i}\) is the distance from the sample point to the camera center. We predict the signed distance \(s(_{i})\) and the color \(_{i}\) for each point along the ray, and the normal \(_{i}\) is the analytical gradient of the \(s(_{i})\). The predicted color \(}()\), depth \(()\), and normal \(}()\) for the ray \(\) are computed with the unbiased rendering method following NeuS :

\[}()=_{i=0}^{n-1}T_{i}_{i}_{i},( )=_{i=0}^{n-1}T_{i}_{i}t_{i},}()=_{ i=0}^{n-1}T_{i}_{i}_{i},\] (1)

where \(T_{i}\) is the discrete accumulated transmittance and \(_{i}\) is the discrete opacity value, defined as:

\[T_{i}=_{j=0}^{i-1}(1-_{j}),_{i}=((s(_{i}))-_{u}(s(_{i+1}))}{_{u}(s(_{i}))},0),\] (2)

where \(_{u}(x)=(1+e^{-ux})^{-1}\) and \(u\) is a learnable parameter.

Object-compositional Scene ReconstructionFollowing previous work [68; 69; 32], we consider the compositional reconstruction of \(k\) objects utilizing their corresponding masks, and we treat the background as an object. More specifically, for a scene with \(k\) objects, we predict \(k\) SDFs at each point \(\), and the \(j\)-th (\(1 j k\)) SDF represents the geometry of the \(j\)-th object. Without loss of generality, we set \(j=1\) as the background object and others as the foreground objects. In subsequent sections of the paper, we denote the \(j\)-th object SDF at point \(\) as \(s_{j}()\). The scene SDF \(s()\) is the minimum of the object SDFs, _i.e._, \(s()= s_{j}(),j=1,2,,k\), which is used for sampling points along the ray and volume rendering in Eqs. (1) and (2). See more details in the Appx. A.

### Differentiable Physics Simulation in Neural Scene Reconstruction

To jointly optimize the neural implicit representations with rendering and physical losses, we propose a particle-based physical simulator and a highly efficient method to transition implicit SDF, which is adept at modeling visual appearances, to explicit representations conducive to physics simulation.

Surface Points Marching Cubes (SP-MC)Existing methods [13; 43] fall short of attaining a satisfactory balance between efficiency and precision in extracting surface points from the SDF-based implicit representation. Thus, we develop a novel algorithm, SP-MC, with differentiable and efficient parallel operations and surface point refinement leveraging the SDF network \(f()\).

Figure 2: **Overview of PhyRecon. We incorporate explicit physical constraints in the neural scene reconstruction through a differentiable particle-based physical simulator and a differentiable transformation (_i.e._, SP-MC) between implicit surfaces and explicit surface points in Sec. 3.2. To learn intricate 3D structures, we introduce rendering and physical uncertainty in Sec. 3.3 to address the inconsistencies in the geometric priors and guide the pixel sampling.**

Fig. 3 illustrates the SP-MC algorithm. Formally, let \(^{N N N}\) denote a signed distance grid of size \(N\) obtained using \(f()\), where \(()\) denotes the signed distance of the vertex \(\) to its closest surface. SP-MC first locates the zero-crossing vertices \(\), where a sign change occurs from the neighboring vertices in signed distances, by shifting the SDF grid along the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) axis, respectively. For example, shifting along the \(x\) axis means \(^{x}(i,j,k)=(i+1,j,k)\). Then each vertex \(\) can be found through the element-wise multiplication of \(\) and the shifted grids \(^{d\{x,y,z\}}\), together with its sign-flipping neighbor vertex denoted as \(^{}\). The coarse surface points \(_{}\) are determined along the grid edge via linear interpolation:

\[_{}=\{+()}{()- {S}(^{})}(^{}-) \}.\] (3)

Finally, \(_{}\) are refined using their surface normals and signed distances by querying \(f()\):

\[_{}=\{-f() f() _{}\}.\] (4)

Benefiting from all operations that are friendly for parallel computation, SP-MC is capable of extracting object surface points faster than the Kaolin  algorithm with less GPU memory consumption. In the meantime, it also achieves unbiased estimation of the surface points compared with direct thresholding the signed distance field , which is crucial for learning fine structures. For detailed algorithm and quantitative computational comparisons, please refer to the Appx. B.

Particle-based Physical SimulatorTo incorporate physics constraints into the neural implicit reconstruction, we develop a fully differentiable particle-based simulator implemented with Diff-Taichi . Our simulator is designed for realistic simulations between rigid bodies, which are depicted as a collection of spherical particles of uniform size. The simulator captures the body's dynamics through translation and rotation, anchored to a reference coordinate system. The body state at any time is given by its position, orientation, linear and angular velocities. The total mass and the moment of inertia are intrinsic physical properties of the rigid body, reflecting its resistance to external forces and torques. During forward dynamics, the states are updated through time using explicit Euler time integration. Besides gravity, the changes in the rigid body state are induced by contact and friction forces, which are resolved using an impulse-based method. For more implementation details, please refer to the Appx. C.

The simulator is used to track the trajectory and contact state of the object's surface points \(_{}\) until reaching stability or maximum simulation steps. Utilizing the trajectories and contact states, we present our simple yet effective physical loss: \(_{phy}=_{_{}}\|^{}- ^{0}\|_{2},\) where the initial position of each point \(\) is denoted as \(^{0}\) and its first contact position with the supporting plane as \(^{}\). Our physical loss intuitively penalizes the object's movement and is only applied to the contact points \(_{}\) instead of all the surface points. If the physical loss is homogeneously applied to all the surface points, it will contradict the rendering cues when the object is unstable, leading to degenerated results. The contact points \(_{}\), on the other hand, indicate the areas of object instability. As shown in the experiment section, our design leads to stable 3D geometry under the coordination between the appearance and physics constraints.

Figure 3: **Illustration of SP-MC**. (a-b) We first shift the SDF grids, and (c) localize the zero-crossing vertices \(\) (blue). (d) The coarse surface points \(_{}\) (black) are derived through linear interpolation and (e) the fine-grained points \(_{}\) (purple) are obtained by querying the SDF network \(f()\).

### Joint Uncertainty Modeling

Apart from incorporating explicit physical constraints, we propose a joint uncertainty modeling approach, encompassing both rendering and physical uncertainty, to mitigate the inconsistencies and improve the reconstruction of thin structures, which is crucial for object stability.

Rendering UncertaintyThe rendering uncertainty is designed to address the issue of multi-view and multi-modal inconsistencies in monocular geometry priors, including depth uncertainty and normal uncertainty. We model the depth uncertainty \(u_{d}\) and normal uncertainty \(u_{n}\) of a 3D point as view-dependent representations , which we utilize the appearance network \(g()\) to predict along with the color \(\) for a 3D point \(\):

\[g:(^{3},^{3},^{3}, ^{256})(^{3},u_{d}, u_{n}),\] (5)

where \(\) is the normal at \(\), \(\) is the viewing direction, and \(\) is a geometry latent feature output from the SDF network \(f()\).

The depth uncertainty \(_{d}()\) and normal uncertainty \(_{n}()\) of ray \(\) are computed using \(u_{d}\) and \(u_{n}\) through volume rendering, similar to Eq. (1). Subsequently, we modulate the \(L_{2}\) depth loss \(_{D}()\) and \(L_{1}\) normal loss \(_{N}()\) based on the rendering uncertainty:

\[_{D_{U}}()=(|_{d}()|+1)+_{D }()}{|_{d}()|},_{N_{U}}()=(|_{n}()|+1)+_{N}()}{|_{n}()|}.\] (6)

Intuitively, the uncertainty-aware rendering loss can assign higher uncertainty to the pixels with larger loss, thus filtering the inconsistent monocular priors when the prediction from one viewpoint differs from others. Fig. 6 depicts how higher uncertainty precisely localizes inconsistent monocular priors.

Physical UncertaintyWe introduce physical uncertainty to capture object instability from physics simulations. Specifically, we represent the physical uncertainty field with a dense grid \(_{u phy}^{N N N}\). The physical uncertainty \(u_{phy}()\) for any 3D point \(\) is obtained through trilinear interpolation. \(_{u phy}\) is initialized to zero and updated after each simulation trial using the 3D contact points \(_{}\). For each contact point, we track its trajectory from \(^{0}\) to \(^{}\), forming the uncertain point set \(_{}\). We design a loss function \(_{u phy}\) to update \(_{u phy}\):

\[_{u phy}=-_{_{}}u_{phy}(),\] (7)

where \(>0\) represents the increasing rate for \(_{u phy}\). Thus, areas with high physical uncertainty indicate that the object lacks support and requires the development of supporting structures. The physical uncertainty \(_{phy}()\) of the pixel corresponding to ray \(\) is computed via volume rendering.

Finally, we present the rendering losses re-weighted by both rendering and physical uncertainty:

\[_{D}=_{}_{D_{U}}()}{ _{phy}()+1},_{N}=_{} {_{N_{U}}()}{_{phy}()+1},_{S}= _{}_{S}()}{_{phy}() +1}.\] (8)

The segmentation loss \(_{S}()\) is weighted by physical uncertainty only since we use view-consistent instance masks following prior work . We detach \(_{phy}()\) in the above losses, ensuring the physical uncertainty field \(_{u phy}\) reflects accurate physical information from the simulator.

Physics-Guided Pixel SamplingA critical observation is that intricate object structures occupy only a minor portion of the image, leading to a lower probability of being sampled despite their significance in preserving object stability. Effectively pinpointing these fine geometries is perceptually challenging, yet physical uncertainty precisely outlines the areas where the object lacks support and requires special attention for optimization. Hence, we introduce a physics-guided pixel sampling strategy to enhance the learning of detailed 3D structures. Using physical uncertainty, we calculate the sampling probability of each pixel in the entire image by: \(p()=_{phy}()}{_{}_{phy}( )}\).

### Training Details

In summary, our overall loss function is: \(=_{RGB}+_{D}+_{N}+_{S}+ _{phy}+_{u phy}+_{reg},\) where the loss weights are omitted for simplicity. Following prior work , we introduce\(_{reg}\) to regularize the unobservable regions for background and foreground objects, as well as the implicit shapes through an eikonal term.

To ensure robust optimization and coordination among various components, we empirically divide the training into three stages. In the first stage, we exclusively leverage the rendering losses with rendering uncertainties. In the second stage, we introduce our physical simulator to incorporate physical uncertainty into rendering losses and enable physics-guided pixel sampling. Finally, we integrate the physical loss using a learning curriculum that gradually increases the physical loss weight. The staged training allows the simulator to pinpoint more accurate contact points, essential for effective optimization of shape through the physical loss. For further details about the loss, training, and implementation details, please refer to Appx. A.

## 4 Experiments

We assess the effectiveness of PhyRecon by evaluating scene and object reconstruction quality, as well as object stability. We present additional results in Appx. D and limitations in Appx. E.

### Settings

DatasetsWe conduct experiments on both the synthetic dataset Replica  and real datasets ScanNet  and ScanNet++ . We use 8 scenes from Replica following the setting of MonoSDF  and ObjectSDF++ . For ScanNet, we use the 7 scenes following RICO . Additionally, we conduct experiments on 7 scenes from the more recent real-world dataset ScanNet++ with higher-quality images and more accurate camera poses. More data preparation details are in Appx. D.1.

Baselines and MetricsWe choose MonoSDF , RICO , and ObjectSDF++  as the baseline models. For reconstruction, we measure the Chamfer Distance (CD), the F-score (F-score),

Figure 4: **Qualitative results of indoor scene reconstruction. Examples from ScanNet++ , ScanNet , and Replica  demonstrate that our model produces higher quality reconstructions compared to the baselines. Our results contain finer details for slender structures (_e.g._, chair legs and objects on the table) and plausible support relations, which are highlighted in the zoom-in boxes.**

and Normal Consistency (NC) following MonoSDF . These metrics are evaluated for both scene and object reconstruction across all datasets. As MonoSDF is designed to reconstruct the whole scene, we only evaluate its scene reconstruction quality. To evaluate the physical plausibility of the reconstructed objects, we report the Stability Ratio (SR), defined as the ratio of the number of physically stable objects against the total number of objects in the scene. The assessment is conducted using dropping simulation via the Isaac Gym simulator  to avoid bias in favor of our method. We provide more details on our evaluation procedure in Appx. D.2.

### Results

Tab. 1 and Fig. 4 present the quantitative and qualitative results of the neural scene reconstruction. In Fig. 5, we visualize the trajectory for the reconstructed object during dropping simulation in Isaac Gym . Fig. 6 showcases visualizations of several critical components in our methods, including the sampling strategy, volume renderings of the geometric cues, and the uncertainty maps. Our method significantly outperforms all baselines, and we summarize the key observations as follows.

Physical StabilityFrom the results in Tab. 1, our method realizes significant improvements in object stability, outperforming all baselines by at least 40% across all datasets. This signifies _a significant

Table 1: **Quantitative results of 3D reconstruction. Our model reaches the best reconstruction quality across all datasets and significantly improves on physical stability.**

Figure 5: **Object trajectory during simulation. Our method enhances the physical plausibility of the reconstruction results, which can remain stable during dropping simulation in Isaac Gym.**

stride towards achieving physically plausible scene reconstruction_ from multi-view images. The notable stability improvement is attributed to two essential factors: 1) the integration of physical loss and physical uncertainty ensures the reconstructed structure closely aligns with the ground floor, as evident in the examples from Figs. 4 and 5 and 2) enhanced learning of intricate structures, facilitated by joint uncertainty modeling and physics-guided pixel sampling. Results from RICO  and ObjectSDF++  in Fig. 5 fail to capture all the chair legs, leading to inherent instability.

Reconstruction QualityNote that the improvement of the physical plausibility does not come under the sacrifice of reconstruction quality. From the results in Tab. 1, our method surpasses all the state-of-the-art methods across three datasets in all the reconstruction metrics. As also shown in Fig. 4, while the baseline methods are capable of reconstructing substantial parts of objects, _e.g._, sofa or tabletop, they struggle with the intricate structures of objects. In contrast, our model achieves much more detailed reconstruction, _e.g._, the vase and lamp on the tables, shown in the zoom-in views.

Joint Uncertainty ModelingLastly, we discuss the intermediate results of our joint uncertainty modeling exemplified on the ScanNet dataset. As shown in Fig. 6, the physical uncertainty adeptly pinpoints the regions critical for remaining stability, such as the chair legs and table base. The physics-guided pixel sampling, informed by the physical uncertainty map, prioritizes intricate structures over the random sampling strategy. Moreover, it modulates rendering losses, particularly useful for instance mask loss where chair legs are absent in the ground-truth instance mask. Meanwhile, the depth and normal uncertainty maps identify inconsistencies in the geometric prior, _e.g._, miss detections in the normal prior and the overly sharp depth prior. Collectively, they contribute to the physically plausible and detailed reconstructed mesh, surpassing the ground truth.

### Ablation Study

We conduct ablative studies on the physical loss (\(PL\)), rendering uncertainty (\(RU\)), physical uncertainty (\(PU\)), and physics-guided pixel sampling (\(PS\)). Tab. 2 and Fig. 7 illustrate quantitative and qualitative comparisons, respectively. Key findings are as follows:

Table 2: **Ablation results on ScanNet++ dataset.**

Figure 6: **Joint uncertainty modeling. The physical uncertainty pinpoints the regions critical for stability, efficiently guiding the pixel sampling. The rendering uncertainties can alleviate the impact of inconsistent geometry cues, leading to a better-reconstructed mesh than the GT.**

1. Physical loss significantly improves 3D object stability. However, due to the insufficient regularization of thin structures and imprecise contact points in the simulation, adding physical loss alone will overshadow the rendering losses, leading to degenerated object shapes to sustain stability.
2. Rendering uncertainty, physical uncertainty, and physic-guided pixel sampling collectively contribute to enhancing the reconstruction quality, particularly on thin structures. However, despite the advancements, the reconstructed results still struggle to maintain physical plausibility without direct physical supervision during the optimization.
3. When all components are introduced, the enhanced reconstruction of thin structures leads to more meaningful contact points in simulation, thus enabling effective joint optimization with physical loss. This not only improves the objects' stability but also preserves their reasonable shapes, leading to robust reconstruction with both physical plausibility and fine details simultaneously.

### Failure Cases

We present and diagnose representative failure examples. Fig. 8 (a) demonstrates that in regions scarcely observed in the input images, optimizing with the physical loss may lead to degenerated object shapes, _e.g._, bulges, to maintain physical stability. This is due to insufficient supervision from the rendering losses. Fig. 8 (b) illustrates that objects may be divided into several disconnected parts, which also appear stable in the simulation. This is a common limitation of the current neural reconstruction pipeline and may be addressed by incorporating topological regularization to penalize disconnected parts of the object or further enhance the physical simulator.

## 5 Conclusion

In conclusion, this paper introduces PhyRecon as the first approach to leverage both differentiable rendering and differentiable physics simulation for learning implicit surface representations. Our framework features a novel differentiable particle-based physical simulator and joint uncertainty modeling, facilitating efficient optimization with both rendering and physical losses. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of PhyRecon, showcasing its significant outperformance of all state-of-the-art methods in terms of both reconstruction quality and physics stability, underscoring its potential for future physics-demanding applications.
