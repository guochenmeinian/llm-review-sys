###### Abstract

While Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has proven beneficial for efficiently fine-tuning large models, LoRA fine-tuned text-to-image diffusion models lack diversity in the generated images, as the model tends to copy data from the observed training samples. This effect becomes more pronounced at higher values of adapter strength and for adapters with higher ranks which are fine-tuned on smaller datasets. To address these challenges, we present FouRA, a novel low-rank method that learns projections in the Fourier domain along with learning a flexible input-dependent adapter rank selection strategy. Through extensive experiments and analysis, we show that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality. We demonstrate that FouRA enhances the generalization of fine-tuned models thanks to its adaptive rank selection. We further show that the learned projections in the frequency domain are decorrelated and prove effective when merging multiple adapters. While FouRA is motivated for vision tasks, we also demonstrate its merits for language tasks on commonsense reasoning and GLUE benchmarks.

## 1 Introduction

Parameter-Efficient FineTuning (PEFT)  methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation  provide a promising solution to quickly adapt large foundation models, including large vision models (LVMs) and large language models (LLMs) to new tasks . The LoRA module has an elegant design, allowing quick adaptation to new styles or concepts without changing the underlying base model, thus effectively retaining previous knowledge and preventing catastrophic forgetting.

Figure 1: **Distribution collapse with LoRA. Visual results generated by the Realistic Vision 3.0 model trained with LoRA and FouRA, for "_Blue Fire_" and “_Origami_" style adapters **across four seeds**. While LoRA images suffer from distribution collapse and lack diversity, we observe diverse images generated by FouRA.

While LoRAs are highly effective in quickly adapt to new styles, they exhibit multiple challenges, with the rank of LoRA modules being a highly sensitive parameter. As LoRA is built for adapting to new tasks using a small training set, it tends to overfit to the distribution of small training set when the rank is high. Recent works [39; 40] observed that when diffusion models overfit to a small training set, they demonstrate a tendency to repeatedly "copy" few samples from the training set. LoRAs trained on smaller data therefore tend to generate data copying artifacts, also known as distribution collapse. The generated images lack diversity, and the phenomenon is very similar to mode collapse observed in GANs. We illustrate this tendency in Fig. 1, specially at high values of adapter strength \(\) across different seeds. Additionally, as the rank reduces, the strength of the adapter reduces, and LoRA has a reduced ability to generate diverse images due to underfitting. Hence, the rank is a very sensitive parameter.

Gating mechanisms have been proposed  to produce a dynamic rank at every layer, to provide flexibility to the adapter in LLM tasks. However, we argue that dynamic rank reduction is still not flexible for vision tasks as the rank is computed during training and does not vary at inference. We observe that text-to-image diffusion models greatly benefit from a rank adaptation mechanism which can also vary during inference, along the diffusion time steps. Furthermore, while all the previous works apply low-rank adaptation in the feature space, we argue that there is a transform domain over which fine-tuning low-rank adaptation modules generates much richer representations. We provide theoretical and analytical evidence to show that low-rank adaptation in the frequency domain produces a highly compact representation, effectively reducing the generalization error. Hence, this can potentially push the adaptive rank selection mechanism to generalize better, not only reducing the risk of underfitting when rank reduces, but also overfitting at higher ranks. Additionally, there have been attempts to merge multiple LoRA concepts and/or styles as a linear weighted combination of multiple LoRAs . Recent works [45; 12; 23] empirically show that this approach is prone to noisy and inaccurate outputs, and propose **joint** finetuning the adapters with learnable gates in the low rank subspace. However, we argue that jointly training multiple LoRA modules is highly restrictive and equally tedious for practical use-cases requiring flexibility in combining multiple different LoRAs. Our developed approach of gating in frequency domain enables flexible mixing of multiple adapters.

In this paper, we propose FouRA (Fourier Low Rank Adaptation), a PEFT technique to address the aforementioned challenges of LoRA. We transform the input features to the frequency domain, and apply both the down-projection (to a lower rank) and the up-projection (back to the higher rank) in this frequency domain. During inference, we fold the adapter strength \(\) into the low rank subspace. FouRA learns an adaptive mask inside the low-rank subspace to dynamically drop certain frequency transformed basis, effectively varying the rank for each layer. The adaptive mask selection is input dependant, and varies during the diffusion process. Through rigorous analysis, we show that FouRA provides clear benefits over LoRA (and other adaptive gating methods), and generates high quality diverse images. We show for lower ranks increasing the effect of adapter weights in FouRA does not deteriorate the representation power of original model. Additionally, we show that FouRA provides a rich disentangled orthogonal basis to Low Rank Adapters in the frequency domain, making it beneficial for merging multiple styles. Our contributions are summarized as:

* We introduce FouRA, the first low-rank adapter module that performs the low rank transforms in the frequency domain along pixel or channel dimensions of the feature space.
* We propose an adaptive learnable masking strategy in the frequency domain that flexibly varies the effective rank for every FouRA layer in the network, thus enabling the model to generalize well, even when the size of training set is very small.
* We demonstrate that FouRA successfully provides a decorrelated orthonormal basis to Low Rank Adapters in the frequency domain, making it highly beneficial for merging two styles or concepts, without the need for joint training.
* Through extensive experiments and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate how FouRA consistently produces a diverse set of aesthetically improved images compared to LoRA, and is equally effective for LLM tasks.

## 2 Related Work

**Text-to-Image Diffusion Models:** Multiple diffusion based image generative models have been proposed recently [33; 31; 6], [32; 29; 36; 30]. These models exhibit excellent text-to-image generation ability and can be adapted to new styles using LoRA .

**Fourier Transforms in Generative Literature:** Recent work  shows that the latents of the denoising models trained on sufficient data lie on adaptive basis with oscillating patterns. Other works have shown that we can use fourier operators for non parametric regression tasks and cast self attention as a kernel regression problem.  shows that it offers smoother representations over the input and better captures the correlations between query and keys.  has shown that Fourier spectral filters operate in the continuous domain and work well in representing images as continuous functions. Further convolutions in spatial domain can be represented as multiplications in the Fourier space thus spectral filters can act as global convolution operator. A concurrent work on language models  has proposed parameter-efficient fine-tuning in the Fourier Domain.

Many works have analysed the eigen spread of signal transformed to harmonic basis. , analysed the effect of applying these transforms on a signal sampled from a Markovian process and show that Fourier transforms decorrelates such as signal in least mean square setting.

**Low Rank Adaptation:** LoRAs  suffer from a tradeoff between fidelity and diversity of generated images.  tried to alleviate this problem by sparse regularization. SVDiff  explicitly only updates the singular values while retaining the subspaces. In a high rank setting this method is acceptable. However, in FouRA we are learning in a low rank subspace. Other works like AdaLORA ,  applied to language models, further parameterized the weight matrices using SVD and jointly optimized for eigen vectors and the singular values through importance scoring metric. O-lora  computes orthogonal gradient spaces between different tasks letting the model sequentially adapt to new tasks without catastrophic forgetting.  applies proximal gradient gating in the loss function to learn important subspaces and mask out the remaining ones. While all these papers directly operate by constraining the subspace of the weight matrices, we show in our paper that the Fourier domain implicitly enforces these properties without any constraints in the optimization. We show that applying gating in the frequency domain provides a more compact representation with stable generalization error bounds. In addition results in lower effective rank for each layer. We also show that the learnt spaces across different adapters also have decorrelated basis. MoLE , ZipLoRA and Mix of Show [12; 50] explore various strategies to merge LoRAs. This is done using either supervised or self-supervised objectives for jointly training weights corresponding to both adapters. As the number of adapters grow, we argue that the two-stage method to merge adapters is not flexible and quite tedious. FouRA on the other hand does not require any fine-tuning, and is truly a training-free approach to merge multiple adapters.

**Disentangled spaces for editing** have explored diffusion models for disentangled interpretable latent representation. While LoRAs have been proposed for personalization,  proposed a way to do fine-grained editing of images while still preserving the features of the original image. They identify semantic directions and traverse on the latent space on these directions. Concept sliders have been applied to real applications such as fixing distortions in diffusion generated images. We show in our work that our method identifies more compact disentangled representations over LoRA, thus providing more performance improvements over fine-grained edits.

## 3 Proposed Approach

### Formulation of Low Rank Adaptation

We illustrate the base LoRA module in Fig. 2. Consider the original set of pre-trained weights \(}^{k_{1} k_{2}}\) where \(k_{1}\) and \(k_{2}\) represent the input and output embedding dimensions respectively. LoRA modules consist of the down layer \(^{k_{1} r}\) and the up layer \(^{r k_{2}}\), projecting the input features to and from the low-rank subspace of rank \(r\). Consider an input feature \(}^{d k_{1}}\), where \(d\) is the number of input tokens, the output after the low-rank adaptation \(}^{d k_{2}}\) is given as \(}=}+}=} }+}\). Here, \(}\) and \(}\) are the outputs from the original and low-rank branches respectively, and \(\) is a scalar to blend the two branches. We denote the learned adapter matrices as \(}=\) as in .

### Low Rank Adaptation in the Frequency Domain

The projection to and from a low-rank subspace is prone to information loss. To mitigate this, we propose to transform the inputs to a domain which contains an inherently compact representation, i.e. the frequency domain. We are motivated by the fact that transforming to the frequency domainpreserves valuable information, due to its inherent de-correlation capabilities [11; 16]. We validate this further by analyzing the effects of the frequency transform on the model weights in Sec. 4.1.

Given the pre-trained weight matrix \(}\), we apply the low rank transforms \(\) and \(\) in the frequency domain. Inspired by , we fold the blending parameter \(\) inside the low-rank subspace, effectively acting as a scaling factor in the frequency domain. We apply the frequency transforms as follows.

\[}=}+}=}}+^{-1}((}))\] (1)

Here, \(()\) and \(^{-1}()\) are the normalized forward and inverse frequency transforms respectively.

### Frequency Transforms

We investigate the properties of Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) in the low rank space. We apply 1D DFT to the embedding dimension \(k_{1}(0,K)\) before the subspace decomposition. Given input \(z_{in}^{d k_{1}}\) to the adapter branch, we expand \(\) in Eq. (5) as,

\[}}(f)=(})_{d k_{1}}=}}_{k=0}^{k_{1}-1}e^{-jk}{k_{1}}} }(k),f_{r}: r(0,1...k_{1}-1).\] (2)

Where \(f_{r}\) is the frequency of the basis represented by DFT. As we do not apply any padding, the dimension of the transform preserves the dimension of \(}\). In our experiments, we apply the 1-D transform on the embedding dimension \(k_{1}\) for each token on both self and cross attention layers.

To motivate the idea of generalizing FouRA across tasks such as targeted editing , where disentangled latent space is required to gain control over generated images, we further explored Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with compact subspaces (eigen spread), which leads to less overfitting. We later show in App. B.1 and Fig. 4 that the subspaces of FouRA are more uncorrelated from each other. We observe that for certain tasks, DCT provides a smoother representation as the implicit window is twice that of DFT signals. For a given a finite length signal \(}^{d k_{1}}\), we compute DCT as follows. We first construct a double length even signal by

\[}(d,k_{1})=}(d,k_{1}),&0 k_{1}  K\\ }(d,2K-k_{1}-1),&K k_{1} 2K-1,\] (3)

The DCT is then computed as the DFT of \(}\).

### Adaptive Rank Gating Method

LoRA methods pre-define the rank for all layers. Recent method  has an adaptive rank during training, which is however fixed at inference time, thus lacking flexibility. In our approach, we propose a learned adaptive gating mechanism, which can vary each layers rank during training and inference, dependent upon the inputs. We introduce our learnable gating mechanism \(()\) inside the low-rank subspace within the frequency domain. Consider the low-rank representation denoted as \(}(}) ^{d r}\), our gating operation is defined as,

\[(})=1,&(( }))==1\\ 0,&\] (4)

Figure 2: **LoRA v/s FouRA.** For FouRA, we transform feature maps to frequency domain, where we learn up and down adapter projections along-with our proposed adaptive rank gating module.

Here, \(()\) and \(()\) represent entropy and sigmoid functions respectively, \(\) represents the weights of a learnable multi-layer perceptron (MLP), \(\) is a function to learn a weighting for every singular value in the low-rank subspace. The FouRA output, illustrated in Fig. 3, is then given by,

\[}=}+}=z_{in}}+ ^{-1}((}) (}))\] (5)

The learned FouRA adapter weights are \(}=^{-1}(( })())\), as per notation in Sec. 3.1.

We conduct further analysis of our proposed gating function in Sec. 4.2, analyzing its behaviour across diffusion time-steps and various resolutions. Further, we demonstrate its efficacy over both fixed LoRA and recent Adaptive Rank selection methods which are fixed at inference (SoRA ).

### Combining multiple adapters

Merging of LoRA adapters has multiple practical use-cases . The method we use to merge two adapters varies according to the task.

**Text-to-Image Style Transfer:** Following the standard method, we merge two FouRA style based adapters using a linear combination of the outputs of adapter \( W_{1}.}\) and \( W_{2}.}\) during inference.

**Image editing using Concept Sliders:** Similar to , we perform concept slider evaluations for text based editing using FouRA in Sec. 5.3. Given \(n\) concept sliders, we define \(c_{n,j}\) concept for \(n^{th}\) slider (e.g "very old") and \(_{n,i}\) as the negative concept (e.g " very young"). We composite the adapters in the epsilon \(\) space, with composed score function \(\), and sample from the factorized distribution \(p(/(_{i},c_{j}))\)

\[()=_{}()+_{n}w_{n}( _{}(,c_{n,j})-_{}(,c_{n,i}))\] (6)

For merging of two styles, as well as composition of two concept adapters across different strengths \(\), we notice that the feature spaces of FouRA adapters are less entangled as compared to LoRA. Further analysis is present in Appendix B.4 and B.2.

## 4 Theoretical Analysis

### Frequency Domain Fine Tuning

Frequency domain transforms decorrelate input representations, minimize spectral redundancy , and are effective in compression since they concentrate most of the energy in a few coefficients . Learning in the spectral domain is shown to enable faster convergence and sparser weight matrices . Motivated by these advantages, we propose to fine-tune adapters in the frequency domain.

Singular Value Distribution Analysis:Consider a weight matrix \(\). The singular value decomposition of this matrix is represented as \(}\), where \(^{k_{1} k_{1}},^{k_{2}  k_{2}}\) are orthonormal matrices and \(^{k_{1} k_{2}}\) is a matrix, containing the singular values of \(\), \(_{i} i\{^{min(k_{1},k_{2})}\}\). Considering an \(r\) rank approximation of \(\), we denote the singular values as \(\{_{1},_{2}..._{r}\}\), arranged in descending order, and the corresponding diagonal matrix as \(}\). The \(r\)-rank approximation of \(\) is hence computed as \(LR_{r}()=}}\).

Figure 4: Singular value spread for FouRA v/s LoRA.

Figure 3: **Operational diagram of FouRA**. Illustrating the components of Eq. 5.

**Lemma 4.1**.: _Considering two adapters \(}\) and \(}\) and their corresponding sets of singular values \(\{_{1,i}\}\) and \(\{_{2,i}\}\). The adapter \(}\), will admit \(r\) rank approximation with lower error than \(}\) if \(_{1,i}<_{2,i}\) for all \(i r\)._

We provide a proof for the above lemma in Appendix B.1. We empirically analyze the distribution of singular values for \(r\) rank approximations of \(}\) and \(}\) (without adaptive masking) for the last layer of our trained UNet model in Fig. 4. FouRA has a more compact spread of singular values as compared to LoRA. Hence, using Lemma 4.1, we can say that the accumulated error for a LoRA adapter with a low-rank approximation will be greater than the a FouRA adapter with the same rank.

### Gated Frequency Domain Fine Tuning

Motivated by observations in [3; 25], our proposed rank gating mechanism intends to vary the effective rank of each low-rank adapter in the network. We describe effective rank per layer as the number of singular values which are not masked out by the learned gating function. Using observations from [7; 25], we propose the following Lemma:

**Lemma 4.2**.: _Consider an adapter \(\) with a rank higher than the required rank to fit a training data distribution. The upper-bound of generalization error \(\) for fine-tuning this adapter reduces as the effective rank of the adapter reduces. After reducing to a certain value of effective rank, the upper-bound of generalization error will increase as rank reduces further._

**Corollary 4.2.1**.: _Additionally, the generalization bound is more stable when the singular value distribution of adapter weights \(\) is more compact._

We provide a proof in Appendix B.2. The effectiveness of variable rank selection can be justified using Lemma 4.2. As LoRA rank reduces, the model tends to underfit. However, increasing the rank above the required rank to fit a training distribution leads to overfitting, which reduces the models performance. Dynamically determining the effective rank in every layer produces promising results, as it provides a learnable trade-off between generalization and overfitting.

In Fig. 5, we plot FouRA average effective ranks for a denoising UNet over 20 iterations of the reverse diffusion process. Our analysis reveals that the effective rank learnt for high-resolution layers is higher than low-resolution layers. Furthermore, the effective rank reduces as the denoising process continues. This essentially means that noisy inputs require more singular values to update. We further observe in Fig. 9 that our proposed adaptive masking (which varies in inference time) significantly outperforms methods such as SoRA (which freezes its masks after training).

Furthermore, from Corollary 4.2.1 and a consequence of the property observed in Fig. 4, as FouRA obtains compact spread of singular values, we can determine that the generalization bound is more stable in the frequency domain for lower effective ranks, as compared to the feature space. We verify this in Fig. 9 as FouRA outperforms SoRA and LoRA with our proposed adaptive masking. The **data copying artifacts** observed for LoRA model in Fig. 1 are a consequence of overfitting. This was observed by recent works targeting Digital Forgery [39; 40]. As FouRA significantly reduces the generalization error, it can generate a diverse set of images. Additionally, we also observe in App. E.1.1 that FouRA is able to generalize better on unseen concepts, as compared to LoRA.

Figure 5: **Average Effective Rank of FouRA. Figure a. and b. shows plots for the average effective rank for various layers of the FouRA U-Net (Darker lines correspond to higher resolutions) and Figure c. compares the average effective rank of FouRA to SoRA. FouRA’s effective rank reduces with the feature resolution, and it also reduces as the diffusion process proceeds, owing to lesser changes required towards the end.**

### Subspace Learning

In App. B, we provide a subspace perspective to verify empirically and theoretically that FouRA learns subspaces which are more decorrelated from the base model weights, as compared to LoRA. A higher emphasis on the set of learnt subsapces enables FouRA to learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting. Additionally, we attribute the strong merging capabilities of different FouRA adapters to their disentangled and decorrelated subspaces learned by respective FouRAs.

## 5 Experiments

### Experimental setup

**Datasets:** For style transfer, we evaluate FouRA on four datasets collected from public domains, including _Bluefire_, _Paintings_, _3D_ and _Origami_ styles, see Appendix C.1.3 for details. Our results are averaged over 30 random seeds, and a total of 1530 images. For evaluations on composite sliders, similar to , we train 3 sliders _"Age"_, _"Hair" _"Surprised'_ and composite experiments combining both _"Age"_ and _"Hair"_. While our approach is motivated for vision tasks, we also evaluate FouRA on language tasks and assess the performance of our adapter on MNLI, CoLA, SST2, STSB, MRPC and QNLI tasks from the GLUE benchmarks. We also evaluate on Commonsense Reasoning benchmarks BoolQ, PIQA, SIQA, HellaSwag, WinoGrande, ARC and OBQA. See App. C.1 for details.

**Models:** For text-to-image generation experiments, we employ Stable Diffusion-v1.5 , using both the base model weights and RealisticVision-v3.0 checkpoints for style transfer tasks. For concept editing, we train on Stable Diffusion-v1.5  base weights. We use DeBERTAv3-Base  for General Language Understanding tasks and Llama3-8B  for Commonsense Reasoning tasks. See App. C for additional implementation details.

**Metrics:** For quantifying the quality of images generated by FouRA and LoRA finetuned diffusion models, we report HPSv2.1  and LPIPS diversity  scores. The HPSv2 metric evaluates the measure of the image quality, and alignment with the prompt/style. LPIPS diversity score captures the diversity within all possible pairs of generated images across seeds. We provide an in-depth analysis of these metrics in Appendix D. For the image editing task, we compare edited images using LPIPS similarity (compared to the base image). For language models, we report on the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmarks , see details in App. C.2. On commonsense reasoning tasks, we report Accuracy.

### Text-to-Image Stylized Generation

In Fig. 6, we show visual results of LoRA and FouRA on the _Paintings_ and _Bluefire_ style tasks. FouRA is able to generate high quality images as compared to LoRA over a range of adapter strengths \(\). We observe that LoRA suffers from artifacts at high values of \(\) in case of the Paintings adapter. Tab. 2 compares LPIPS Diversity and HPSv2 scores for all models, showing that FouRA significantly outperforms LoRA on both the metrics. Our analysis in App. D shows that this gap in LPIPS-diversity and HPS scores is quite significant, specially for higher \(\) values, FouRA shows significant gains compared to LoRA. This is likely because at lower \(\) values, the adapter effect would be reduced and

Figure 6: **FouRA v/s LoRA: The prompt on the left is “a football in a field” and on the right is “man in a mythical forest”. While staying more faithful to the adapter style, FouRA outputs look aesthetically better than LoRA, which have obvious artifacts at high values of \(\). Additional results are in Appendix E.**thus both images look more realistic. These results demonstrate that FouRA images are both diverse (even at high adapter strengths) as well as aesthetically coherent. See App. E for more experiments.

**Multi-Adapter:** Fig. 7 shows images for style transfer merging for various prompts (e.g., bird, car, fox) for three styles: _Paintings_, _Bluefire_ and _3D_. We also provide the outputs of the linear combination of LoRA and FouRA for both these tasks. We see that merged LoRA images sometimes lose one of the concepts (e.g., the blue fire is lost for Panda and Dog) or have severe artifacts (e.g., the fox with multiple tails and the bird without a head). In comparison, FouRA images for merged adapters preserve the concepts and do not display any distortions. This property of FouRA is a direct consequence of our analysis in App. B.3 and is also evident from the HPSv2 reported in Tab. 1, where for higher adapter strengths, FouRA shows gains upto 3% over LoRA.

### Text-to-Image Concept Editing

We establish the performance of our approach on nuanced editing tasks for specific target images by training FouRA using the disentangled objective proposed in concept sliders . We train LoRA and FouRA modules using pairs of prompts describing the editing concepts. Fig. 8 shows results of editing the _Age_ and _Hair_ concepts. As observed, although the Age adapters are trained using a disentangled objective, LoRA changes the gender of the subject, and produces artifacts at high scales. FouRA is elegantly able to age them while retaining their original features. Similarly, the _Hair_ FouRA produces a smoother representation. We provide quantitative evaluations in App. 5.3, and observe that at higher strengths, FouRA consistently outperforms LoRA in terms of the LPIPS score.

**Composite Sliders:** We qualitatively evaluate the composite _'hair'_ and _'age'_ adapter between LoRA and FouRA in Appendix 5.3. We show the results on two target prompts "A female Indian person" and

"A male white person" respectively. Overall, we observe that FouRA does a better job at compositing both sliders, as it produces a smooth transition between the concepts. In comparison, LoRA distorts the subjects faces at high adapter scales, and interferes with other facial features. We also show that the LPIPS diversity is much lower for generated images between different strength for FouRA F.4 at higher scales of the adapter.

### Commonsense Reasoning Tasks

While our design choices for FouRA are primarily motivated for vision tasks, we evaluate its efficacy on eight commonsense reasoning tasks using the split from  in Tab. 3. We trained LoRA and FouRA adapters over a LLaMA3-SB  model. Our analysis shows that employing FouRA at rank 16 and 32 both outperform LoRA at the rank 32 setting.

### Computational Analysis

Table 4 provides the computational analysis for FouRA, as compared to LoRA. We provide the #parameters during inference along with the training time for FouRA. Along with this, we show the HPS-v2.1 scores on the _Blue Fire_ validation set. Additionally, we provide the results for a FouRA variant with a fixed gating strategy during inference. FouRA layers with inference-adaptive masking produce an overhead of 0.02% more than LoRA, as compared to base model weights. However, FouRA with frozen masking can essentially reduce the computational overhead by a factor of 2, and still retain a higher performance than the base LoRA.

### Ablation Studies

#### Individual gain of every component

We show individual contributions from FouRA modules in Table 5. We fix rank=64 and \(\)=0.8, and provide results on the paintings validation set. As evident from LPIPS-Diversity and HPS scores, the adaptive mask selection strategy performs better than the dynamic fixed mask selection strategy. For the case without frequency transform, Inference-Adaptive masking improves the HPS score from 28.2 to 28.7. When accompanied with Frequency transform, the HPS increases from 30.3 for frozen dynamic masking to 30.6 for inference-adaptive masking.

### Varying the Adaptive Rank Selection Strategy in Text-to-Image Stylized Generation

Fig. 9 shows the HPS-v2.1 curves obtained for evaluating LoRA, SoRA  and FouRA on the Paintings validation set for different adapter strength \(\). Additionally, we also show the performance of our inference-adaptive rank selection method directly on LoRA. All the numbers are for base rank=64 adapters. As observed, SoRA outperforms LoRA at higher ranks. However, our inference-adaptive rank selection strategy improves performance over SoRA, indicating that in vision models, varying the effective-rank across time steps of the diffusion process is ideal. FouRA outperforms all methods, indicating the benefits of training our proposed rank selection strategy in the frequency domain.

### Varying the Rank in Text-to-Image Stylized Generation

In Fig. 10, we investigate the impact of FouRA over varying values of input rank, and compare with LoRA. We observe that rank is a highly sensitive parameter for LoRA. However, the HPS scores across ranks for FouRA are higher than the highest HPS score achieved at any rank by LoRA, highlighting the effect of gating in frequency domain. This helps FouRA to avoid underfitting as the rank reduces and overfitting as it increases. Furthermore, FouRA generates a diverse set of images across all ranks.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed FouRA, a parameter efficient fine-tuning method within the frequency domain. Through extensive experiments and rigorous analysis, we showed that FouRA successfully solves the problems related to data copying and distribution collapse while significantly improving the generated image quality over LoRA. We also present an intensive study on the impact of compact representation of Low rank subspaces in transformed domain. Further, we showed that FouRA can leverage our proposed adaptive mask ranking approach and further push the generalization capabilities of PEFT models without under-fitting. Additionally, we demonstrated the efficacy of FouRA in merging two concepts, as the frequency domain acts as a decorrelated subspace for multiple adapters. Assessing the performance of FouRA, we feel encouraged to think that frequency domain fine-tuning of adapters will potentially be a popular research direction in the coming years.
