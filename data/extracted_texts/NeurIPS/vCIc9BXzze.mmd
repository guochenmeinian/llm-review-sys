###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, surpassing human experts in various benchmark tests and playing a vital role in various industry sectors. Despite their effectiveness, a notable drawback of LLMs is their inconsistent moral behavior, which raises ethical concerns. This work delves into symmetric moral consistency in large language models and demonstrates that modern LLMs lack sufficient consistency ability in moral scenarios. Our extensive investigation of twelve popular LLMs reveals that their assessed consistency scores are influenced by position bias and selection bias rather than their intrinsic abilities. We propose a new framework **tSMC**, which gauges the effects of these biases and effectively mitigates the bias impact based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence to pinpoint LLMs' mitigated Symmetric Moral Consistency. We find that the ability of LLMs to maintain consistency varies across different moral scenarios. Specifically, LLMs show more consistency in scenarios with clear moral answers compared to those where no choice is morally perfect. The average consistency score of 12 LLMs ranges from \(60.7\%\) in high-ambiguity moral scenarios to \(84.8\%\) in low-ambiguity moral scenarios.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) are gaining popularity in society due to their exceptional ability to perform various downstream tasks efficiently and effectively. Some models have surpassed human experts in benchmark tests . Despite their impressive performance, previous research has raised concerns about their responses in moral scenarios , such as moral dilemmas  where two or more conflicting moral imperatives but none of which overrides the other. Research has shown potential risks with LLMs when supporting unethical or harmful behavior, which may lead users to engage in harmful actions they would not have otherwise taken . Additionally, researchers have expressed concerns about the potential confusion and uncertainty that LLMs could cause , which could hurt users' trust. Given these considerations, it is essential to accurately assess the behavior of LLMs in ethical scenarios to ensure the ethical development and positive impact of LLMs and mitigate their potential harm to humans.

Symmetric consistency, a type of logical consistency , implies that for a model \(M\) and options \(x\) and \(y\) of a problem, \(M(x,y)=M(y,x)\), ensuring invariance to input text swaps. This characteristic iscrucial in moral scenarios, as input order can easily change, and different answers could reflect distinct moral preferences . Inconsistent moral guidance from LLMs can influence users' decisions, leading to unforeseen outcomes . Previous work has revealed the semantic consistency of LLMs when applied to ethical situations and has highlighted the inadequacies of LLMs in symmetric moral consistency . Symmetric moral consistency is more easily identified in structure and commonly encountered in practice. Our research in the following sections shows that LLMs commonly exhibit a significant impact of both position bias  and selection bias  on symmetric moral consistency, irrespective of the model type or parameter size. This suggests that previous work may not accurately capture the true consistency of these models [9; 14].

### Motivation and Problem: a Case Study of GPT-3.5-turbo

**Definition**: Symmetric moral consistency in LLMs refers to their capacity to select identical responses to ethical-related questions involving two potential actions, even after interchanging specific components and rephrasing the wording. The **mitigated symmetric moral consistency** discussed in this paper refers to the symmetric moral consistency measured after mitigating the position bias and selection bias of LLMs. This attribute is crucial for ensuring that LLMs exhibit reliable and unbiased moral reasoning ability. LLMs can better support applications in ethical decision-making and policy formulation by maintaining consistent moral judgments across varied formulations of the same moral scenario.

**Metric**: Assume that \(e\) is one prompt format and \(e_{N}\) is a perturbed version (e.g., swap the option ID of \(e\)); we expect model \(M\) to generate the same predictions for \(e\) and \(e_{N}\). The consistency score \(\) on dataset \(\) can be observed as follows:

\[=|}_{e}(M(e)=M(e_{N})).\] (1)

We adopt the same metric as Jang et al. [9; 14] to investigate LLMs' symmetric moral consistency. In particular, for tasks with option IDs, we assess whether the answer IDs in the model output remain identical after swapping the text. For tasks involving only option contents, we examine whether the model's responses are uniform across different settings, ensuring that the same option is selected in each experiment. In examining a moral scenario, we evaluate the symmetric moral consistency of LLMs through three methods: **Context Swap (CS), Option Swap (OS), and Full Swap (FS), which involve swapping context, option ID, and the entire sentence**.

Figure 1 illustrates the prompt template utilized for assessing GPT-3.5-turbo; additional templates for diverse models and tasks are provided in Appendix A. We conduct experiments to investigate potential biases affecting the symmetric moral consistency of GPT-3.5-turbo. We evaluate the three distinct experimental settings by measuring their average consistency scores (Avg) and standard deviations (Std). By assigning option IDs as **AB** and **CD** respectively, we try to assess whether GPT-3.5-turbo exhibits a discernible preference for specific IDs. Subsequently, by eliminating the option IDs and prompting the model to repeat preferred options, we aim to mitigate the influence of selection bias. Furthermore, we observe whether the consistency scores and deviations fluctuate throughout conventional few-shot and Chain-of-Thought (CoT) experiments [15; 16]. Our goal is to assess the consistency levels of these models in high-ambiguity and low-ambiguity moral scenarios to highlight the potential negative impacts of current models.

As shown in Table 1, the results from the **AB** and **CD** groups reveal a notable dissimilarity. Specifically, the CD group demonstrates markedly lower deviation levels across both scenarios, with

    &  &  \\  & Std & Avg & Std & Avg \\ 
**AB** & 14.1 & 53.9 & 22.7 & 78.3 \\
**AB-fewshot** & 5.4 & 78.9 & 1.7 & 97.7 \\
**AB-cot** & 5.5 & 59.4 & 2.7 & 83.8 \\ 
**CD** & **0.4** & 68.8 & 3.2 & 43.0 \\
**CD-fewshot** & 2.2 & 74.3 & 2.0 & 97.0 \\
**CD-cot** & 5.1 & 71.0 & **0.9** & 87.3 \\ 
**Remove_ID** & / & 71.6 & / & 96.9 \\
**Remove_ID-fewshot** & / & **86.5** & / & **99.4** \\
**Remove_ID-cot** & / & 70.7 & / & 91.3 \\   

Table 1: Comparison of GPT-3.5-turbo based on standard deviation (Std) and average symmetric consistency metric value (Avg). **We find that biases result in significant deviations in the performance of LLMs, and current techniques can mitigate but not fully resolve these issues.**superior performance in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. Removing the IDs leads to a discernible enhancement in the model's consistency score. However, the CD group's consistency score in low-ambiguity moral scenarios is unexpectedly inferior to that of the AB group, contrary to our initial expectations. Remarkably, both few-shot and CoT experiments substantially improve the model's average consistency scores while reducing deviation. From these experimental findings, **it is evident that biases exert a negative influence on the symmetric moral consistency of** GPT-3.5-turbo, **particularly apparent in the prevalent AB single-choice question format, where biases and their consequences are magnified.** We also measure LLMs' symmetric consistency on the MMLU high_school_us_history subject , which similarly reflects fluctuating performance under various experimental settings. This observation suggests that our findings can generalize to a broader range of scenarios. Detailed results can be found in Appendix D.

three parts and swap different prompt sections in each setting. We leverage the MoralChoice dataset , comprising scenarios with varying levels of ambiguity: low-ambiguity moral scenarios with clear preferences and high-ambiguity moral scenarios lacking definitive answers. In high-ambiguity moral scenarios, where neither answer is correct, it is crucial to ensure that LLMs exhibit consistent behavior across various prompt designs while encountering the exact scenarios. We aim to observe consistent results across different settings, indicating a stable preference for LLMs. On the right side, the graphs display the consistency scores of LLMs and the fluctuations in each condition compared to the standard assessment. The diverse results suggest inadequate stability in the consistency abilities of LLMs.

Our contributions can be summarized as follows:

* To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to unveil the bias impact on LLMs' symmetric moral consistency. We propose a new framework to assess the impact of position bias and selection bias on LLMs' symmetric moral consistency under three settings (Context Swap, Option Swap, and Full Swap) and then evaluate the symmetric moral consistency after mitigating the bias impact based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Here, we refer to the framework as **tSMC** (mitigated Symmetric Moral Consistency).
* We conduct extensive experiments on 12 LLMs, including 10 open-source and 2 proprietary closed-source models, and identify the presence of both position bias and selection bias in various LLMs, contributing to inaccuracies in measured consistency. These experiment results highlight the effectiveness and significance of our framework **tSMC** that could assess LLM's mitigated symmetric moral consistency. The key findings are: 1. Position bias and selection bias significantly impact the consistency performance of LLMs, leading to substantial fluctuations in measurement results across CS, OS, and FS settings. For instance, Llama-2-13b exhibits an almost 80% performance gap between OS and FS settings in high-ambiguity moral scenarios, illustrating the ineffectiveness of directly measuring symmetric consistency. 2. LLMs exhibit greater consistency in low-ambiguity moral scenarios than in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. Interestingly, the consistency performance of LLMs shows a low correlation with model parameter size. For example, Llama-2-7b has better consistency performance than Llama-2-70b, as shown in Figure 3(a). 3. Confidence scores reflect the model's certainty in its responses, and LLMs exhibit higher confidence scores in low-ambiguity moral scenarios than in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. Surprisingly, though Phi-2 exhibits high consistency performance, it shows notably low confidence distributions in both moral scenarios.

## 2 Related Work

Morality and Ethics in LLMsThere is a growing interest in evaluating the ethical competencies of LLMs [18; 19]. MoCa  evaluated whether LLMs make casual and moral judgments that align with humans. Scherrer et al.  evaluated moral beliefs encoded in LLMs and observed that specific models exhibit similar preferences. Tanmay et al.  measured the moral reasoning ability of LLMs using the Defining Issues Test. Abdulha et al.  and Fraser et al.  assessed LLMs with moral questionnaires based on Moral Theories [22; 23]. We evaluate the symmetric consistency of LLMs in moral scenarios and reveal the shortcomings of LLMs in this task.

Consistency in LLMsConsistency refers to the expectation of receiving identical answers for the same question presented in different formats. Elazar et al.  evaluated the consistency of PLMs, such as Bert . Jang et al. [9; 14] assessed several forms of consistency in LLMs, such as ChatGPT, including semantic and logical consistency. Most research evaluated symmetric consistency in Natural Language Inference (NLI) tasks [26; 27], but these experiments cannot reflect the ability of LLMs in real scenarios. Bonagiri et al.  assessed the semantic moral consistency of LLMs and introduced an entropy measure based on the Rule of Thumbs (RoT). Jang et al. [9; 14] investigated a range of consistency measures, while our research specifically examines symmetric consistency in moral scenarios. Although their assessment of symmetric consistency corresponds to our **Context Swap** experimental design, we extend the analysis by introducing **Option Swap** and **Full Swap** experiments. These additional experiments aim to address the potential influences of position and

where \(C_{mitig}\) denotes the mitigated symmetric moral consistency of LLM, \(_{s}\) denotes the consistency measured in the setting \(s\). \(D_{total}\) denotes the sum of the effects of position bias \(D_{pos}\) and selection bias \(D_{select}\) under different settings, and it is derived from the analysis of bias impact under three settings. \(\) is a hyper-parameter and we set \(\) to \(0.1\) in our experiment.

DatasetWe use the _MoralChoice_ Dataset  to evaluate the symmetric moral consistency of LLMs. This dataset is initially designed to extract moral beliefs encoded in LLMs. It contains 680 high-ambiguity moral scenarios questions and 687 low-ambiguity moral scenarios questions. Each question offers two **actions**, which are options like "_I refuse to assist in suicide_" and "_I assist in suicide_." For the low-ambiguity moral scenarios, there will be an action option consistent with human values and common sense. For the high-ambiguity moral scenarios, neither action is preferred. Examples selected from this dataset are illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 8.

ModelsOur analysis covers twelve decoder-only transformer models, comprising ten open-source and two commercial models. These models include Phi-2, Gemma-2/7B, Llama-2-7/13/70B, Llama-3-8/70B, Mistral-7B, and Mistral-8x7B. Except for Phi-2, all models have undergone instruction tuning . For commercial models, we evaluate GPT-3.5-turbo and Gemini-1.0-pro through API services. The link of each model can be found in Appendix E.

EvaluationWe follow the mainstream LLM evaluation frameworks like the HuggingFace LLM Leaderboard and the original MMLU implementation . Specifically, we evaluate the likelihood of option ID tokens presented in the query for open-source LLMs, selecting the option with the highest probability as the response on A100 80G GPUs. We set the decoding temperature to 0 for commercial LLMs and assess their responses accordingly .

### Consistency Scores and Fluctuations of LLMs

Table 2 presents the consistency scores of LLMs and the corresponding variations compared to the standard experiment setup in low-ambiguity and high-ambiguity moral scenarios separately. The results are in Appendix B when option IDs are CD. LLMs demonstrate greater consistency in moral reasoning in low-ambiguity situations compared to high-ambiguity ones, a finding aligned with the results of Scherrer et al. , where "better" refers specifically to consistency rather than moral superiority. This is because, in low-ambiguity moral scenarios, there are action options that align with human values and common sense. However, both actions exhibit notable deficiencies in high-ambiguity moral scenarios, making it challenging for LLMs to make morally correct choices.

Furthermore, examining the fluctuations in consistency scores indicates that LLMs are significantly impacted by biases, which distort their symmetric moral consistency scores. This fluctuation is particularly pronounced in high-ambiguity situations, suggesting that LLMs are more susceptible to biases and tend to select specific answers when unsure about their choices, regardless of their actual beliefs. For example, Mistral-7B demonstrates minimal fluctuation in low-ambiguity moral scenarios but considerably higher fluctuation in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. This variability could be due to the uncertainty that LLMs encounter in these circumstances, causing them to possibly choose random answers depending on the order of input or the specific option ID, as evidenced by the noticeable decrease in consistency scores. Notably, larger models do not necessarily perform better in this context. For instance, while Llama-2-7b and Llama-2-70b are trained on the same data, the 7b model demonstrates superior symmetric moral consistency scores in both scenarios. In contrast, Llama-2-70b exhibits markedly low consistency scores in low-ambiguity moral scenarios but significantly high consistency scores in high-ambiguity moral scenarios when the entire sentence is swapped rather than under the standard experimental conditions. This suggests a strong selection bias toward the swapped sentence condition. Additionally, despite Llama-3-8b being trained on seven times more data than Llama-2-7b, it does not exhibit improved performance but instead encounters more pronounced fluctuation issues. Furthermore, Mistral-8x7B and Gemini-1.0-pro exhibit minimal fluctuations in both scenarios.

### LLMs' Biases in Different Scenarios

In this subsection, we measure and analyze the relative position bias \(D_{pos}\) and the relative selection bias \(D_{selective}\) of various LLMs. Figure 3 shows the measured results with AB as option IDs; the corresponding results for CD are available in Appendix B. First, the most intuitive manifestation is that the bias of LLMs is more concentrated in low-ambiguity moral scenarios and more dispersed in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. This indicates that in cases with clear tendencies towards answers, LLMs rarely lose their level of moral alignment due to bias. In particular, Mixtral-8x7B, Gemini-1.0-pro, and the Llama3 series show almost zero bias in low-ambiguity moral scenarios. This suggests that the credibility of the consistency scores exhibited by these models is very high. We set the threshold for both selection and position biases at 0.1. When models fall within the gray area delineated by the two dotted lines in Figure 3, we consider there to be no significant effect on the model's consistency score. Conversely, if models lie outside this gray area, we regard the biases significantly impacting the model's consistency score.

Nevertheless, in high-ambiguity moral scenarios, some models that perform well even in low-ambiguity moral scenarios show higher bias, such as Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B, whose biases in high-ambiguity moral scenarios are much higher than those in low-ambiguity moral scenarios. It is worth noting that the bias of some models is consistently high, such as Gemma-2b, Llama-2-13b, and Llama-2-70b, where their bias in high-ambiguity moral scenarios has reached the maximum value. Their bias in low-ambiguity moral scenarios is also beyond the threshold we set. This indicates that the answers of these models largely fail to reflect their level of consistency, and they choose answers from a specific row or option ID. Furthermore, it can be seen that models showing low-level bias in high-ambiguity moral scenarios (in the gray area we defined), such as Phi-2, Mixtral-8x7B, and Gemini-1.0-pro, almost show no bias in low-ambiguity moral scenarios. This means that their assessed consistency scores accurately reflect their moral consistency. More importantly, these models exhibit high moral consistency and adhere to high ethical standards.

Moreover, Llama-2-13b and Llama-2-70b exhibit both high and similar position bias and selection bias values simultaneously. Sharing the same training data, they consistently demonstrate biases in both scenarios. This suggests that these **biases might be inherent to the pre-training data or post-training methods and could potentially be mitigated through specific techniques, such as pre-training on more diverse datasets or instruction tuning to refine the models' responses based on targeted feedback and bias reduction strategies. However, the precise reasons for these similar biases remain unclear, highlighting the need for future in-depth investigation.**

### LLMs' Mitigated Symmetric Moral Consistency

After applying Equation 4 to the observed data, we calculate the mitigated symmetric moral consistency of LLMs, with results depicted in Figure 3(a). Most models demonstrate robust consistency in low-ambiguity moral scenarios, indicating the alignment with human values and common sense. However, their consistency diminishes in high-ambiguity moral scenarios, suggesting that existing LLMs struggle to maintain consistent viewpoints when faced with morally ambiguous situations. This inconsistency raises concerns about the models' ability to unbold stable beliefs, potentially affecting user perception and underscoring the need for further research. Figure 3(b) and Figure 15 illustrate the mitigation effectiveness of the _tSMC_ framework under different \(\) settings in high- and low-ambiguity moral scenarios, respectively, compared to Context Swap. Notably, models such as 2/7b and Llama-2-7/13/70b exhibit low consistency scores even when a favored answer is present. The similar architectures and training data shared within model families suggest that specific techniques and structures can significantly influence their moral consistency.

Figure 3: The scatter diagram compares **selection bias** and **position bias** in LLMs across low and high ambiguity moral scenarios. The x-axis and y-axis represent the KL divergence of position bias and selection bias, respectively. A lower value suggests less impact. **In the gray area surrounded by the dotted lines, biases are considered to have little effect on the model’s consistency scores.**

### LLMs' Confidence Score

By evaluating the probability of actions in open-source LLMs and selecting the most probable one, we can determine the confidence levels of the chosen option ID within the models. Figure 5 and Figure 6 illustrate confidence distribution in different scenarios for open-source LLMs with option IDs AB.

In low-ambiguity moral scenarios, LLMs show a strong sense of certainty in their outcomes, as evidenced by a distribution that leans heavily towards 1 and is tightly concentrated. Conversely, when faced with high ambiguity, the models exhibit uncertainty, with probabilities clustering around 0.6, suggesting a lack of confidence in their choices (the minimum value for all models is 0.5, as we solely consider the winning option). Specifically, Llama-3-8b and Mistral-7B demonstrate uncertainty when confronted with ambiguous options but exhibit confidence when a clear preference exists. In contrast, Gemma-2b and Mistral-8x7B consistently exhibit high confidence irrespective of the scenarios.

We observe that Phi-2 shows a notably low confidence in high-ambiguity moral scenarios. Surprisingly, this tendency persists in low-ambiguity moral scenarios and is close to a Gaussian distribution. As shown in Table 2 from prior experiments, Phi-2 consistently yields high consistency scores under different experimental settings. This indicates that while Phi-2 is adept at evaluating moral consistency, unlike Mistral-8x7B, it seems hesitant in its judgments.

Figure 5: Chosen action’s confidence score distribution for open-source LLMs in **low-ambiguity moral scenarios** when option IDs are **AB**. **Confidence is generally higher in low-ambiguity moral scenarios than in high-ambiguity moral scenarios.**

Figure 6: Chosen action’s confidence score distribution for open-source LLMs in **high-ambiguity moral scenarios** when option IDs are **AB**. **LLMs that exhibit high confidence in low-ambiguity moral scenarios also maintain their confidence levels in high-ambiguity moral scenarios.**Figure 7 illustrates the correlation between moral consistency and confidence scores. These results demonstrate that confidence and consistency scores measure distinct aspects of model performance. **Confidence scores reflect the model's certainty in its responses, while consistency scores indicate the model's ability to provide coherent judgments across scenarios.** Figures 13 and 14 in Appendix B present the confidence scores of open-source models when option IDs are C and D. The models' confidence distributions remain nearly identical when A and B are employed as option IDs, with marginally higher confidence scores observed in the A-B scenario. This suggests a slightly stronger preference for models between options A and B, although it does not significantly impact the overall distribution.

## 4 Conclusion

In this paper, we have proposed a simple yet effective assessment framework **tSMC** to uncover the impact of position and selection biases on LLMs' symmetric moral consistency and assess the mitigated symmetric moral consistency of LLMs. Our study has revealed that most models exhibit higher consistency scores in low-ambiguity moral scenarios where preferences are clear, as opposed to high-ambiguity moral scenarios. This indicates that LLMs may not consistently adhere to moral principles, particularly in challenging situations such as moral dilemmas. These findings are also reflected in their confidence levels. Furthermore, specific models struggle to maintain consistency concerning biases, leading to inconsistent decision-making across different contexts, highlighting the need for further research to address these issues.

While our study provides valuable insights, there are certain limitations to acknowledge. Our assessment primarily utilizes a Multiple Choice Question Answering (MCQA) approach. Although this method is widely used in benchmark evaluations, it may not fully capture the complexity and variability of real-world usage scenarios. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we will incorporate various evaluation methods, thereby ensuring a more comprehensive analysis in the future. Our framework **tSMC** has demonstrated efficacy in evaluating the symmetric moral consistency of various models, highlighting their high ethical standards. Nonetheless, to further augment the comprehensiveness of our evaluations, future work will include testing with a more diverse ethical dataset. This expanded dataset will encompass a broader range of topics and professions by building on the strengths of our current methodology. We also notice the existence of additional biases in LLMs (e.g., length bias). In future work, we aim to extend our framework to address other biases.
