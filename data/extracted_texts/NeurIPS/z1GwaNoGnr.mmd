###### Abstract

Existing methodologies in open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation primarily concentrate on establishing a unified feature space encompassing 3D, 2D, and textual modalities. Nevertheless, traditional techniques such as global feature alignment or vision-language model distillation tend to impose only approximate correspondence, struggling notably with delineating fine-grained segmentation boundaries. To address this gap, we propose a more meticulous mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space through a cross-modal mask reasoning framework, **XMask3D**. In our approach, we developed a mask generator based on the denoising UNet from a pre-trained diffusion model, leveraging its capability for precise textual control over dense pixel representations and enhancing the open-world adaptability of the generated masks. We further integrate 3D global features as implicit conditions into the pre-trained 2D denoising UNet, enabling the generation of segmentation masks with additional 3D geometry awareness. Subsequently, the generated 2D masks are employed to align mask-level 3D representations with the vision-language feature space, thereby augmenting the open vocabulary capability of 3D geometry embeddings. Finally, we fuse complementary 2D and 3D mask features, resulting in competitive performance across multiple benchmarks for 3D open vocabulary semantic segmentation.

## 1 Introduction

As the integration of vision and language in deep learning continues to expand, text descriptions are increasingly utilized in visual generation  and perception  tasks. This integration enhances the adaptability of models in real-world applications and improves user experiences in customized artificial intelligence systems. Open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation exemplifies a perception task that is trained on _base_ categories and demands robust extrapolation capabilities to discriminate fine-grained geometry in _novel_ categories that are invisible during training. The base and novel classes are only linked by the shared open vocabulary within the language space. However, constructing a shared 3D-text space while maintaining precise, modality-specific representation remains a significant challenge. Successfully addressing this issue would advance open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation, facilitating virtual reality interactions and manipulations, and thereby contributing to the development of user-friendly robotics and autonomous driving technologies.

Existing approaches for open vocabulary 3D perception predominantly aim to bridge the gap between 3D and text representations by using the 2D modality as an intermediary. One line of research  suggests aligning 3D embeddings with vision-language embedding spaces through global, patch-wise, or point-wise contrastive loss, while another line  investigates distilling open vocabulary knowledge from foundational vision-language models into 3D models. However, global feature alignment and model distillation techniques tend to overlook fine-grained 3D geometric details and produce coarse results. Conversely, point-wise contrastive learning is prone to noise and outliers. Although patch-wise feature alignment offers a compromise, a single patch in 2D may correspond to multiple unrelated and discontinuous regions in 3D, which can be misleading and ineffective.

In this paper, we propose a more precise and consistent mask-level alignment between 3D features and the 2D-text embedding space, achieved through our proposed cross-modal mask reasoning method. The proposed XMask3D model comprises a 3D branch, a 2D branch, and a fusion block. The 3D branch, adaptable as any point cloud segmentation model, excels in capturing geometric features but struggles with novel category extrapolation. Conversely, the 2D branch serves as a mask generator, which predicts masks with embeddings aligned to the vision-language feature space but lacks 3D spatial perception capabilities. The fusion block allows these two branches to complement each other. Specifically, we propose utilizing the denoising UNet of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model with advanced vision-language modeling capabilities as the 2D mask generator. Diffusion model's exceptional control over text-driven image generation demonstrates strong potential for creating fine-grained segmentation masks of novel categories. To promote thorough interaction between the two modality branches, we propose three mask-level techniques: (1) **3D-to-2D Mask Generation.** We condition the denoising mask generator on global point cloud features, producing geometry-aware masks that are better suited for transferring to the 3D modality. (2) **2D-to-3D Mask Regularization.** We apply mask-level regularization on 3D features to align with the vision-language embedding space. This enhances the open vocabulary capability of 3D features for novel categories while preserving fine-grained geometric information. (3) **3D-2D Mask Feature Fusion.** We merge mask features from both modalities in the fusion block, enhancing the synergy between 2D and 3D features.

We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks of different datasets, including ScanNet20 , ScanNet200 , and S3DIS  datasets, to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method. XMask3D demonstrates competitive performance across all benchmarks. Additionally, we perform thorough ablation studies and provide intuitive visualizations to showcase the contribution of each proposed mask-level technique. In conclusion, the contributions of this paper can be summarized as follows:

* We propose a novel XMask3D framework that, for the first time, leverages the denoising UNet of a generative text-to-image diffusion model for open vocabulary 3D perception.
* We introduce 3D-to-2D mask generation, 2D-to-3D mask regularization, and 3D-2D mask feature fusion techniques to enhance meticulous mask-level 3D-2D-text feature alignment and strengthen cross-modal feature synergy.
* We demonstrate the effectiveness of XMask3D on multiple benchmarks of various datasets and show outstanding performance. Ablation studies further convince the contribution of each proposed mask-level technique.

Figure 1: **The overall framework of XMask3D.** The 3D model with only _coarse_ 3D-2D-text alignment struggles to segment novel categories with accurate boundaries. We propose to incorporate a 2D open mask generator conditioned on global 3D geometry features to create geometry-aware segmentation masks of novel categories. Then we apply fine-grained mask-level regularization on 3D features, thereby enhancing the dense open vocabulary capability of the 3D model. The cross-modal fusion block leverages the strengths of both branches to achieve optimal results.

### 2D Open Vocabulary Segmentation

Open vocabulary perception is a recently emerged research problem that focuses on enabling perception models to recognize novel categories that are invisible during supervised training, relying solely on a shared language vocabulary with the base categories. The key to addressing this problem lies in the Vision-Language model, which creates a shared embedding space for images and texts. Based on the types of Vision-Language models, previous literature on 2D open vocabulary segmentation can be broadly divided into two approaches: utilizing Vision-Language perception models like CLIP  or leveraging Vision-Language generation models like the diffusion model [18; 37].

Although traditional Vision-Language perception models like CLIP are primarily designed for classification, open vocabulary segmentation can also be viewed as a dense classification task. Consequently, several studies have proposed aligning dense image features with 2D-text embeddings, a concept pioneered by LSeg . Successor models have introduced various techniques to enhance the feature alignment process, including attention-based combinations [30; 12], mask embedding decoupling , side network injection [46; 24], and cross-modal aggregation .

Generative-based methods utilize Vision-Language generation models, such as diffusion models, to produce segmentation masks that can be extrapolated to open vocabulary categories. Since the diffusion model can generate semantically meaningful images based on text conditions, its intermediate features effectively represent the vision-language embedding space. ODISE  first proposed using the intermediate features from the denoising UNet of a pre-trained diffusion model as input to a mask generator for segmentation. Other works [25; 21; 41] leverage the strong generative capabilities of the diffusion model to create prototypes or augmented image-mask pairs, thereby enhancing the open vocabulary capacity of the segmentation model from a data perspective.

### 3D Open Vocabulary Segmentation

In 3D vision, Semantic Abstraction  opens up the avenue to leverage Vision-Language models for open-world 3D scene understanding. Subsequent studies have primarily developed two types of methods to address 3D open vocabulary segmentation: feature alignment and model distillation.

The principle of feature alignment methods is to explicitly pull 3D representations towards the vision-language embedding space, using the 2D modality as a mediator to establish 3D-text relationships. OpenScene  employs a cosine similarity loss between point cloud features and image CLIP features, integrating them for open vocabulary perception. PLA  introduces hierarchical 3D caption pairs to progressively align scene-level, view-level, and entity-level features with the CLIP feature space in a coarse-to-fine manner. Its successor, RegionPLC , further introduces region-level captions with sliding windows and object bounding boxes, while CLIP-FO3D  similarly divides super-pixels for finer feature alignment. UniM-OV3D  utilizes a pre-trained point-text model, PointBind , to enforce uni-modality representation learning of point clouds, images, depth maps, and texts. OV3D  proposes leveraging foundation models to establish point-entityText associations through pixel, thereby enhancing open-vocabulary recognition within the 3D domain.

Model distillation methods typically involve selecting a foundational Vision-Language model and transferring its knowledge to a 3D network using paired point clouds and image data. Seal  introduces spatial contrastive learning and temporal consistency regularization to distill vision foundation models for point cloud sequence segmentation in an open vocabulary setting. 3D-OVS  aims to distill CLIP  and DINO [2; 33] into a neural radiance field  using novel alignment losses for 3D perception. Xiao et al.  propose object-level and voxel-level distillation losses for fine-grained 3D open vocabulary panoptic segmentation.

## 3 Approach

### Overview

The detailed architecture of XMask3D is depicted in Figure 2. It consists of three components: a 3D geometry extraction branch, a 2D mask generation branch, and a 3D-2D feature fusion module. The 3D geometry extraction branch is an encoder-decoder segmentation network, which can be implemented using any off-the-shelf architectures such as sparse convolution networks [7; 8] or Transformer-based networks [51; 43; 42]. These frameworks are specifically designed to extract geometric features \(F_{ 3d}^{N C}\) from 3D point clouds, where \(N\) and \(C\) represent the numbers of points and feature dimensions, respectively. However, \(F_{ 3d}\) is discriminative only on base categories trained with supervision, relying on a pre-defined classifier implemented as a fully connected layer or a multi-layer perceptron. Therefore, it's essential for \(F_{ 3d}\) to be aligned with the vision-language feature space to enable unbounded open vocabulary segmentation, which is performed via per-point similarity comparisons between \(F_{ 3d}\) and CLIP  text embeddings of given category names: \(F_{ text}=_{ CLIP_{T}}(_{ name})^{L  C}\), where \(L\) represents the number of categories, \(_{ CLIP_{T}}\) denotes the CLIP text encoder, and \(_{ name}\) stands for the category name such as _Table, Chair_.

Previous literature on feature alignment techniques varies from global or point-level contrastive learning to vision-language model distillation. However, none of these methods simultaneously achieves fine-grained precision and robustness to outliers. To address this limitation, we introduce a cross-modal mask reasoning method that performs mask-level feature alignment. Specifically, we propose a 2D mask generation branch in conjunction with the 3D branch to generate 2D masks with open vocabulary capability and use these masks to regularize \(F_{ 3d}\). Detailed information on mask generation and mask regularization can be found in Section 3.2 and Section 3.3, respectively.

From the 2D mask generator, we obtain the 2D mask embeddings \(G_{ 2d}^{M C}\) and binary mask maps \(_{ 2d}^{H W M}\), where \(M\) represents the number of candidate masks, and \(H\) and \(W\) denote the height and width of the input images. Using the camera intrinsic matrix \(K^{3 3}\) and the view projection matrix \(V^{4 4}\), we can establish associations between pixels in image \(I\) and surface points in the corresponding point cloud \(P\). This allows us to derive back-projected 3D binary masks \(_{ 3d}^{N^{} M}\) from \(_{ 2d}\). Here, \(N^{}\) signifies the number of points that correspond to image pixels, following the relationship \(N^{}<N,N^{}<H W\). Subsequently, we derive a pseudo mask feature \(F_{ 2d}=_{ 3d} G_{ 2d},F_{ 2d}^{N^{ } C}\), with the subscript \( 2d\) indicating its origin from the 2D branch.

Having obtained \(F_{ 3d}\) from the 3D geometry extraction branch and \(F_{ 2d}\) from the 2D mask generation branch, we implement a 3D-2D fusion block to combine these cross-modal and complementary features, resulting in \(F_{ fuse}^{N C}\). Detailed information on this process can be found in Section 3.4. The final open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation output \(O^{N L}\) is then calculated via:

\[O=_{N} F_{ text}^{T}}{\|F_{ fuse }\|\|F_{ text}\|}\] (1)

Detailed training objectives can be found in Section 3.5.

### 3D-to-2D Mask Generation

**Design Insights.** An optimal 2D branch is expected to exhibit robust open vocabulary capabilities, enabling it to predict accurate masks for novel categories. To this end, we employ the denoising UNet of the renowned text-to-image diffusion model  to extract features from the well-established text-2D embedding space, followed by a mask generator to convert features into segmentation masks.

Figure 2: **The detailed architecture of XMask3D.** We introduce an auxiliary 2D branch, which utilizes global point cloud features as conditional input to generate open vocabulary masks. The contour of the mask is utilized for regularization at the mask level on 3D features, and the embeddings of the mask are fused with the 3D features to enhance cross-modal complementarity.

We favor the generative diffusion model over the commonly adopted CLIP  model for two primary reasons. Indicated by Prompt-to-Prompt , the cross-attention maps from the intermediate layers of the diffusion model exhibit a high correlation with text concepts. Consequently, a well-trained diffusion model constructs a superior vision-language feature space, which can be effectively leveraged for open vocabulary perception. Moreover, the diffusion model provides precise text control over dense pixel generation, demonstrating a higher potential for generating fine-grained segmentation masks compared to the CLIP model, which relies on coarse global feature alignment.

**Preliminary: Open Vocabulary Mask Generation with diffusion.** The inference process of a text-to-image diffusion model  begins with a random Gaussian noise and a conditional text embedding, generating high-quality images through iterative denoising steps. ODISE  was the first to propose the use of the denoising UNet of a pre-trained diffusion model for open vocabulary _2D_ segmentation. Given an input image \(x\), a noisy image \(x_{t}\) is first sampled at time step \(t\):

\[x_{t}=_{t}}x+_{t}}, (0,)\] (2)

where \(_{t}=_{k=1}^{t}_{k}\), and \(_{1},,_{T}\) are pre-defined noise schedule. Then the diffusion model's visual representation \(f\) can be computed via the denoising step:

\[f=(x_{t},(x))\] (3)

where the denoising UNet is the building block of the diffusion model, MLP stands for multi-layer perceptron, and \(\) is a frozen CLIP image encoder to encode \(x\) into the vision-language embedding space. \((x)\) is the implicit caption embedding which serves as the text condition input to the diffusion model. Subsequently, the mask generator, implemented with Mask2Former , uses the feature \(f\) to produce \(M\) class-agnostic binary masks \(_{}\) and their corresponding mask embedding features \(F_{}\). Since \(f\) is highly representative of the vision-language feature space, the model is inherently capable of generating open vocabulary segmentation masks and embeddings. The experimental results of ODISE strongly confirm this hypothesis.

**Geometry-aware Mask Generation.** In XMask3D, the 2D mask generation branch is implemented by a variant of the ODISE model. We propose an _Implicit 3D Captioner_ that takes the global 3D feature \(f_{}^{1 C_{g}}\) from the 3D encoder as input, and predicts the implicit condition embedding to be injected into the diffusion model. Then Equation 3 can be replaced by:

\[f=(x_{t}, f_{}), f_{}= (P)\] (4)

where \(\) represents the encoder of the point cloud segmentation model, and \(C_{g}\) denotes the feature dimension of the global point cloud feature. The rationale behind this design is twofold. First, since \( f_{}\) serves as the text condition for the pre-trained denoising UNet with frozen weights, the training objective of the 2D mask generation branch implicitly pushes \(f_{}\) closer to the text-2D feature space. If \(f_{}\) does not align with this space, the pre-trained denoising UNet will not recognize the condition, resulting in a high loss of the 2D branch. Through gradient descent, the point cloud encoder gradually distills some vision-language knowledge from the pre-trained and frozen denoising UNet. Second, \(f_{}\) encapsulates rich 3D geometric information that the 2D branch lacks due to occlusion and dimensional compression issues inherent in images. Using \(f_{}\) as the condition for the 2D branch encourages the model to produce geometry-aware mask outlines and embeddings, facilitating the back-projection of 2D masks into 3D space. The effectiveness of the proposed geometry-aware mask generation will be validated through quantitative ablation comparisons in Section 4.3.

### 2D-to-3D Mask Regularization

Although some vision-language knowledge from the diffusion model is distilled to the point cloud encoder \(\) via the proposed Implicit 3D Captioner, the 3D feature \(f_{}\) still deviates from the 2D-text embedding space. This is because there is no constraint on the point cloud decoder \(\), and the encoder distillation via gradient descent is inherently weak. Consequently, it is crucial to introduce contrastive regularization in the training pipeline to explicitly align 3D features with the shared 2D-text embedding space. Existing contrastive learning methods  between 3D features and 2D-text features typically explore global, patch-wise, or point-wise relations. However, global contrastive learning is too coarse, and point-wise feature alignment is prone to noise. While patch-wise contrastive learning is more fine-grained and robust, it still lacks semantic clarity. A patch in a 2D image may correspond to multiple irrelevant and discontinuous regions in a 3D point cloud due to depth compression, resulting in ambiguous and less representative local features in 3D.

To this end, we propose an explicit 2D-to-3D mask regularization term for fine-grained and consistent feature space alignment between the 3D and 2D-text modalities. Specifically, we extract 3D mask embeddings \(G_{ 3d}^{M C}\) from 3D features \(F_{ 3d}\) using the back-projected 3D binary mask \(_{ 3d}\):

\[G_{ 3d}^{i}=(_{ 3d}^{i}), 1 i M\] (5)

where \(G_{ 3d}^{i}^{1 C}\) represents the \(i^{ th}\) mask embedding, and avgpool signifies the average pooling operation. \(_{ 3d}^{i}\) is sampled from \(F_{ 3d}\) at indices where \(_{ 3d}^{i}=1\), with \(_{ 3d}^{i}\) being the \(i^{ th}\) binary mask.

Given the 2D binary mask \(_{ 2d}\) and the input image \(I\), we can also derive a ground truth mask CLIP feature \(G_{ CLIP}\) via a pre-trained CLIP model . For detailed information on obtaining the ground truth \(G_{ CLIP}\), please refer to MaskCLIP  or Section A.1. Subsequently, the 2D-to-3D regularization term can be computed using a classical cosine contrastive loss:

\[_{ mask}=_{i=1}^{M}(1-^{i} (G_{ CLIP}^{i})^{T}}{\|G_{ 3d}^{i}\|\|G_{ CLIP}^{i}\|})\] (6)

As each mask region ideally corresponds to a distinct category, the pooled mask embedding achieves semantic consistency and representativeness. Consequently, contrastive learning at the mask level offers finer granularity than global contrast, greater robustness than point-wise contrast, and clearer distinction than patch-wise contrast. Through our proposed 2D-to-3D mask regularization, the 3D features are explicitly aligned with the 2D-text feature space, enhancing the performance of the 3D branch in open vocabulary segmentation. This progress is further substantiated by the ablation studies outlined in Section 4.3.

### 3D-2D Mask Feature Fusion

The 3D-2D mask feature fusion block is devised to merge 3D features \(F_{ 3d}^{N C}\) with the pseudo mask feature \(F_{ 2d}^{N^{} C}\) derived from the 2D branch. It is noteworthy that each element in \(F_{ 3d}\) possesses unique and distinguishing embeddings, whereas elements in \(F_{ 2d}\) pertaining to the same mask share identical mask embeddings. Consequently, \(F_{ 3d}\) offers detailed geometric structural information, while \(F_{ 2d}\) provides semantic features with robust open vocabulary capabilities. Our approach combines features from these two modalities to leverage their complementary insights, resulting in \(F_{ fuse}\) which excels in both precise geometry delineation and expansive semantic extrapolation. Concretely, given that \(N^{}<N\), we selectively merge \(F_{ 2d}\) and \(F_{ 3d}\) solely on the \(N^{}\) points where correspondences exist:

\[F_{ fuse}=(F_{ 3d},F_{ 2d})& \\ F_{ 3d}&\] (7)

where cat represents concatenation. Ablation studies in Section 4.3 and visualization results in Section 4.2 will demonstrate that \(F_{ fuse}\) effectively integrates the strengths of both \(F_{ 3d}\) and \(F_{ 2d}\).

### Training Objectives

In XMask3D, our training strategy encompasses supervised segmentation loss (\(_{ seg}\)) computed from 3D (\(_{ seg}^{ 3d}\)), 2D (\(_{ seg}^{ 2d}\)), and fusion (\(_{ seg}^{ fuse}\)) modalities. We employ Cross Entropy loss for 3D and fusion segments, and for 2D, we adopt multi-head losses including Cross Entropy, Dice, and Focal Loss, following ODISE  and Mask2Former  guidelines. Additionally, we follow PLA  to introduce a binary head and view-level contrastive loss. The binary head is optimized with Binary Cross Entropy loss (\(_{ bi}\)) to differentiate between base and novel categories. The view-level contrastive loss (\(_{ view}\)) is calculated between the view global feature and text embedding of the view image caption, weighted by respective coefficients (\(_{ view}^{ 3d}\), \(_{ view}^{ 2d}\), \(_{ view}^{ fuse}\)). Detailed information about the binary head and the view-level regularization can be found in the PLA paper or in Section A.3 and A.2. In conclusion, the overall training objective can be adjusted by:

\[=_{ seg}_{ seg}+_{ mask}_{ mask}+_{ view}+_{ bi}_{ bi}\] (8)

where \(_{ seg},_{ mask},_{ view}^{ 3d},_{ view}^{ 2d},_{ view}^{ fuse}, _{ bi},\) are loss weight hyperparameters.

## 4 Experiments

### Experiment Settings

**Datasets.** In accordance with prior literature, our research conducts experimentation on two prominent indoor scene datasets: ScanNet  and S3DIS . ScanNet, a foundational dataset in this domain, comprises 1201 scenes allocated for training and 312 scenes designated for validation. Each scene within ScanNet furnishes point cloud data, multi-view images, and corresponding camera pose matrices. Similarly, S3DIS offers analogous data modalities, encompassing 271 rooms across six distinct indoor environments. Conforming to established conventions, we reserve Area 5 of S3DIS for validation purposes, ensuring consistency with prior methodologies.

**Category Partition.** In alignment with previous research, we exclude the _otherfurniture_ class and partition the remaining classes into three benchmarks: B15/N4, B12/N7, and B10/N9. Here, _B15_ signifies the 15 fundamental categories that remain visible and supervised during the training process, while _N4_ denotes the presence of 4 novel categories introduced during evaluation. For the ScanNet variant featuring 200 classes , we adopt a similar approach, dividing the dataset into B170/N30 and B150/N50 benchmarks, each representing a distinct configuration of base and novel categories. Similarly, in the case of S3DIS, comprising 13 classes, we disregard the _clutter_ class and organize the dataset into B8/N4 and B6/N6 benchmarks. Detailed information can be found in Section A.4.

**Metrics.** Following PLA , we present the mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) scores separately for both base and novel categories to assess open vocabulary segmentation performance. Additionally, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the segmentation capability, we report the harmonic mean IoU (hIoU) derived from the mIoU scores of base and novel categories. This holistic metric offers insights into the overall segmentation efficacy across the dataset.

**Implementation Details.** Our implementation incorporates MinkUNet  as the 3D branch and ODISE  as the 2D branch within the architecture. For the vision-language model, we opt for CLIP-L . The training regimen for the XMask3D model involves utilizing the AdamW optimizer  with a Cosine learning rate scheduler. We train the model for 150 epochs on 4 NVIDIA A800 GPUs, employing a batch size of 64. Notably, we introduce mask-level regularization to the training pipeline after the initial 50 epochs. This decision is motivated by the observation that the quality of mask prediction at the onset of training may be suboptimal, making the mask-level contrastive loss ineffective and potentially misleading. Detailed information regarding hyperparameter selections is provided in Section A.4.

### Main Results

**Quantitative Comparisons.** From Table 1 and Table 2, our proposed XMask3D outperforms previous methods across most benchmarks, irrespective of the novel category proportion or dataset sources. The performance indicates that XMask3D is a robust and generalizable method for open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. Notably, we compare XMask3D with our baseline method, PLA, on novel category performance. On the ScanNet dataset, XMask3D demonstrates improvements ranging from 7.4% to 20.0% over PLA. On the ScanNet200 dataset, XMask3D surpasses PLA by an impressive

Table 1: **Results for open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation on ScanNet dataset.** We evaluate the performance with hIoU, base and novel mIoU on five benchmarks with different category splits.

70.5% and 72.7%. On the S3DIS dataset, XMask3D shows boosts of 51.8% and 33.0% over PLA. Among these benchmarks, XMask3D achieves the highest improvements on the long-tail ScanNet200 dataset, primarily due to the introduction of the denoising UNet from the pre-trained diffusion model, which constructs a comprehensive text-2D embedding space with unlimited text descriptions.

It is noteworthy that the OpenScene results are derived from the implementation of UniM-OV3D , but we do not compare XMask3D with UniM-OV3D in the tables. This is because UniM-OV3D employs PointBIND  and CLIP2Point  with an already aligned 3D-text embedding space, whereas XMask3D only integrates the commonly used 2D-text space and introduces techniques to pull 3D features from any point cloud models towards the shared embedding space. Another outstanding concurrent method is OV3D , which primarily focuses on EntityText extraction and Point-EntityText association, while XMask3D concentrates on enhancing mask-level interaction between 2D and 3D modalities. Therefore, the contributions of OV3D and XMask3D are orthogonal and could complement each other in future explorations. Additionally, OV3D only provides experiment results on the ScanNet20 benchmarks, while its effectiveness on the ScanNet200 dataset that is more challenging and on the S3DIS dataset with different data distribution remains unexplored.

**Visualization Results.** In Figure 3, we present a comparative visualization of novel categories between XMask3D and previous methods [11; 34]. XMask3D demonstrates superior accuracy in category predictions, produces finer segmentation boundaries, and generates more cohesive mask regions. Notably, the missegmented region on the bookshelf in the second row of XMask3D is classified as picture, which appears reasonable given the corresponding part in the view image.

### Ablation Studies

In this section, we comprehensively discuss the design choices of XMask3D through extensive ablation studies on the ScanNet B12/N7 benchmark. The results are presented in Table 3.

**Mask Generation Condition.** In Section 3.2, we introduce an Implicit 3D Captioner to convert global 3D features into implicit condition embeddings for the diffusion model. In Table 2(a), we compare this implicit 3D condition with the vanilla text condition and implicit 2D condition. The text condition is generated by a ViT-GPT2  captioning model and encoded via the frozen CLIP text encoder. The 2D condition is generated by the frozen CLIP image encoder and a learnable MLP, following the design in ODISE  (Equation 3). Our proposed implicit 3D condition outperforms the others in novel category segmentation, demonstrating that integrating the 3D global feature with the diffusion model produces the most compatible open vocabulary masks with the 3D branch.

**Mask Regularization.** In Section 3.3, we propose a fine-grained mask regularization term to align 3D features with the 2D-text embedding space. In the first line of Table 2(b), we remove the fine-grained mask-level loss \(_{}\) from the training pipeline. Besides the final results from the fusion block, we also report the intermediate results from the 2D and 3D branches. The inclusion of the mask loss results in a significant improvement of 11.7 in 3D performance on novel categories, demonstrating that our fine-grained mask-level regularization effectively brings 3D features closer to the 2D-text embedding space. Additionally, the performance gain on the fused output is 1.5, highlighting the positive impact of this regularization from 3D to fusion features.

Table 2: **Open-vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation results on S3DIS dataset. We report hIoU, base mIoU and novel mIoU metrics. Best open-vocabulary results are highlighted in bold.**

Table 3: **Ablations for XMask3D pipeline design.** We conduct experiments on the B12/N7 benchmark.

We also analyze the effects of mask regularization through visualizations in Figure 4. Comparing the first and second rows, the 3D segmentation results without the mask loss show inconsistency in the local region for the novel category chair, with most points misclassified as bookshelf. When the mask-level regularization is added, more points are correctly classified, resulting in a clearer segmentation mask. The visualizations of the fused outputs also demonstrate consistent enhancement in mask regularization within the final column. This is evident from the rectification of misclassified points previously labeled as table on the armrest of the right chair in the last column.

**Modality Fusion.** When comparing the 2D, 3D, and fused metrics within the same line in Table 3b, we empirically find that the 2D branch performs relatively better on novel category segmentation, while the 3D branch excels at base category segmentation. This quantitative observation aligns with our design intention: to exploit geometric knowledge via the 3D branch and to enhance the model's open vocabulary capability via the 2D branch. More importantly, the fused output outperforms both the 2D and 3D intermediate results on both base and novel splits. These results strongly support the effectiveness of our fusion design in merging the complementary knowledge from both modalities.

We also present visualization evidence regarding modal complementarity and fusion effects in Figure 4. In the first group, the 2D branch exhibits unsatisfactory results of the base category wall around the whiteboard and behind the right chair, whereas effectively segmenting the novel category chair with high quality despite minor artifacts. Conversely, the 3D branch produces an unsatisfactory mask for the chair but excels in segmenting the wall based on geometric information. The fusion block leverages the strengths of both branches, mitigates their weaknesses, and yields satisfactory outcomes. Moreover, the fusion block accurately delineates regions such as the left foot of the chair on the right, where both the 2D and 3D branches falter, highlighting its potential for integrating cross-modality knowledge. The second group displays similar results that convince the effectiveness of the proposed mask loss and cross-modality fusion design.

### Limitations

Due to resource constraints, we only evaluate the performance of XMask3D on semantic segmentation in this study. However, the XMask3D pipeline has the potential to be extended to the instance and panoptic perception by replacing the 3D backbone with an instance or panoptic segmentation model.

Figure 3: **Visualization Comparisons between XMask3D and Previous Methods. We compare XMask3D with PLA  and OpenScene  on the novel categories table, bookshelf, chair and bed. The regions corresponding to the novel categories are highlighted in red boxes.**

This adaptability arises from the auxiliary 2D branch, which is mask-based and capable of generating instance-level masks given appropriate annotations. Furthermore, since the XMask3D pipeline is agnostic to the 3D model used, it would be interesting to conduct experiments with more advanced point cloud models to compare performance. We hope we can exploit the strength of XMask3D with high-standard 3D backbones and a wider range of dense perception tasks in future research. Computational cost is another limitation of XMask3D, as we implement the Denoising UNet which has numerous parameters and relatively slow latency. In our future work, we plan to address this limitation by replacing the 2D branch with a more lightweight 2D open vocabulary mask generator.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present XMask3D, designed for open vocabulary 3D semantic segmentation. We propose the integration of the denoising UNet of a pre-trained diffusion model to produce geometry-aware segmentation masks conditioned on learnable implicit 3D embeddings. These binary 2D masks filter mask-level embeddings of 3D representations and apply mask regularization to enhance the open vocabulary capacity of 3D features. By fusing the 2D mask embeddings with fine-grained 3D features, we leverage the complementary knowledge from both modalities, achieving competitive performance across various benchmarks and datasets. Ablation studies and visualization comparisons further validate the effectiveness of the proposed cross-modal mask reasoning method.
