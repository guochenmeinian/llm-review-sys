###### Abstract

As AI systems pervade human life, ensuring that large language models (LLMs) make safe decisions remains a significant challenge. We introduce the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a common resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage "Universalization"-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us to study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with specificity and scale. We open source the full suite of our research results, including the simulation environment, agent prompts, and a comprehensive web interface.1

## 1 Introduction

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities across many tasks , and LLMs are being integrated into complex agents . As LLMs become a central component of these systems, they often inherit critical decision-making responsibilities. Therefore, an analysis of their ability to operate safely and reliably, especially in contexts where cooperation is necessary. Multi-agent interaction is a fundamental feature across many scales of human life. When cooperation between agents (and humans) is possible, better outcomes for all through joint effort are possible . If AI agents take on complex decision-making roles in multi-agent contexts, they are likely to face cooperation challenges that are similar to those faced by people. Thus, we need robust and safe AI that cooperates with us as well as (or better than) we can cooperate with each other .

Despite significant advances in the scale and ability of LLMs, researchers still have only a limited understanding of their cooperative behavior. Prior multi-agent research has focused on highlyconstrained scenarios such as board games or narrowly defined collaborative tasks . These multi-agent studies complement existing single-agent AI safety benchmarks . However, this prior work leaves three key questions open: (1) in contrast to the well-documented mechanisms that enable cooperation in people , there is limited understanding of how LLMs achieve and maintain cooperation; (2) how to handle multi-turn LLM interactions that balance safety with reward maximization in multi-agent settings; and (3) the potential of using LLMs as a simulation platform for to better understand and test theories of human psychology and economic behavior.

To address these gaps, we develop a novel simulation environment, called the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim). GovSim allows us to evaluate LLM-based agents in multi-agent, multi-turn resource-sharing scenarios and requires agents to engage in sophisticated strategic reasoning through ethical decision-making and negotiation. Inspired by game-theoretic research on the evolution of cooperation  and "The Tragedy of the Commons," we build GovSim to simulate realistic multi-party _social dilemmas_ such as those faced by groups managing shared resources . Our platform can support any text-based agent, including LLMs and humans, and mirrors some of the complexity in actual human interactions. We use GovSim to benchmark the cooperative behaviors of today's and future LLMs, using a generative agent architecture , that accommodates different models.

Within GovSim, we develop three common pool resource dilemmas inspired by the economic analysis of emergent sustainable cooperation . We test our generative agents with fifteen different LLMs, including open-weights and closed-weights models. Surprisingly, we find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Analysis of LLM behavior suggests that the lack of sustainable governance may result from an inability to mentally simulate the long-term effects of greedy actions on the equilibrium of the multi-agent system. To address this challenge, we find that prompting agents to consider the universalization of their action , a process used by people when making moral judgments in social dilemmas, significantly improves survival time. To evaluate the robustness of the norms formed by LLMs in GovSim, we introduce a greedy newcomer who is unfamiliar with an already formed norm (i.e., the agent does not observe the prior history of interactions). This perturbation increases inequality across agents and, in some cases, leads to the collapse of cooperation. Finally, we perform extensive analyses to understand how each LLM's individual reasoning capabilities contribute to achieving sustainable cooperation. We show that communication between agents is key to success in GovSim. Ablation studies show that communication reduces resource overuse by 21%. Using an automated analysis of agent dialogues, we show that negotiation is the main type of communication between agents and constitutes 62% of the dialogues. Finally, other subskills are also important for sustainability. The ability to form beliefs about other agents is highly correlated (0.83) with community survival time.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

1. We introduce GovSim, the first common pool resource-sharing simulation platform for LLM agents. GovSim enables us to study and benchmark emergent sustainable behavior in LLMs.
2. Using GovSim, we find that only the largest and most powerful LLMs ever reach a sustainable outcome with the best agent below a 54% survival rate.

Figure 1: Illustration of the GovSim benchmark. AI agents engage in three resource-sharing scenarios: fishery, pasture, and pollution. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%.

3. We develop a more cooperatively capable agent based on the philosophical principle of universalization. Through ablation and perturbation, we characterize the boundary conditions for the emergence of sustainable cooperation.
4. We open-source our simulation framework to foster future research: the GovSim simulation environment, agent prompts, and a web interface.

## 2 The GovSim Environment

To understand the logic behind the GovSim environment, we first briefly summarize the economic theory of cooperation and describe the simulation environment and metrics used to evaluate cooperative resource management.

### Economic Background

Sustaining cooperation is an essential problem that enables individuals to achieve better outcomes than they could achieve on their own . Humans solve cooperation problems across all scales of life, ranging from small groups of fishermen who harvest a shared resource to multi-national treaties that restrict pollution to reduce the adverse effects of climate change. However, when _self-interested_ individuals or organizations are faced with paying a _personal cost_ to sustain a _greater good_, cooperation can be challenging to maintain .

Although mechanism designers have developed incentive-compatible systems that can lead to cooperation between self-interested agents, these systems often assume a top-down process that coordinates the process . In contrast, humans develop mechanisms from the bottom up and implement cooperative norms in a decentralized fashion. For example, when managing a shared resource, people develop rules and norms that lead to long-term sustainable cooperation .

### GovSim Description

The purpose of GovSim is to evaluate the ability of LLMs to engage in cooperative behavior and effective governance of shared resources. In GovSim, agents are given a common pool of natural resources that regenerates over time. The task is to sustainably manage the use of this resource. Take too much, and the resource will collapse and no longer regenerate again (e.g., the fish in a lake go extinct). Take too little, and the resource's economic potential is underutilized. Even a purely selfish agent that aims to maximize their _long-term_ reward must balance the amount of resources they extract now with what they will be able to extract in the future. When multiple agents are involved, questions of fairness arise . Agents must negotiate what they believe to be their fair share.

We have implemented three scenarios in GovSim inspired by the economics literature on governing common pool resources. The first is inspired by empirical work on understanding the norms that

Figure 2: Prompt sketches of our baseline agent for the GovSim fishing scenario, detailed prompt examples can be found in Appendix C.

emerge in communities of fishermen that prevent overfishing [25; 43; 56]. In the first scenario, **fishery**, agents share a fish-filled lake, and each decides how many tons of fish each should catch each month. The lake supports up to 100 tons of fish, and the fish population doubles at the end of the month up to this capacity. For example, five fishermen can sustainably catch up to 10 tons of fish each per month, but if the total amount they catch exceeds 50 tons, the population will start to decrease. See Figure 2 for prompt sketches regarding this scenario. In the second scenario, **pasture**, and following Hardin  and Greene , agents are shepherds and control flocks of sheep. Each month, they decide how many sheep they'll allow on a shared pasture. Like the fish, the pasture can support up to 100 hectares of grass; each sheep consumes 1 hectare per month, and the remaining grass doubles up to its capacity. In the third scenario, **pollution**, agents are factory owners who must balance production with pollution. For each pallet of widgets produced, their factory pollutes 1% of the water in a shared river. Like the previous cases, at the end of the month, the amount of unpolluted water doubles.

### GovSim Environment Dynamics

To facilitate comparison across scenarios, the underlying resource regeneration dynamics of each environment are mathematically equivalent.

Amount of Shared Resource \(h(t)\).The amount of shared resources available at time \(t\) is denoted by \(h(t)\). The function \(h:\) maps each time step to the corresponding quantity of available resources. We assume integer units of the shared resource.

The simulation is based on two main phases: harvesting and discussion. At the beginning of the month, the agents harvest the shared resource. All agents submit their actions privately (how much of the resource they would like to consume up to the total resources available); their actions are then executed simultaneously, and each agent's individual choices are made public. At this point, the agents have an opportunity to communicate freely with each other using natural language. At the end of the month, the remaining shared resources double (capped by 100). When \(h(t)\) falls below \(C=5\) the resource collapses and nothing else can be extracted. Each scenario describes a type of public goods game that is repeated for \(T\) time steps . A bound on optimal group behavior is for agents to jointly consume no more than the sustainability threshold.

Sustainability Threshold \(f(t)\).This threshold represents the maximum resources that can be extracted at time \(t\) without diminishing the resource stock at time \(t+1\), considering the future resource growth multiplier \(g\). Formally, the sustainability threshold is given by the function \(f:\) and is defined as follows: \(f(t)=(\{x g(h(t)-x) h(t)\}).\)

Together, GovSim can be viewed as a partially observable Markov game that interleaves actions, observations, and rewards with an unstructured dialogue between agents. Formally, a simulation \(D\) is essentially a function that takes as input a tuple \((,,,)\) and returns a trajectory of the joint policy \((_{i})_{i}\); where \(\) is the set of agents, \(_{i}\) is the policy induced by an LLM \(\) together with a generative agent architecture \(\), \(\) are the dynamics of the environment. Each agent receives an individual reward \(r_{i}^{t}\) defined by the amount of the resource collected in the time step \(t\).

### GovSim Metrics

In this section, we introduce metrics that measure different qualities of the collective outcome. We follow Perolat et al.  in defining a suite of metrics since in a mixed incentive repeated game like GovSim, no single scalar metric can track the entire state of the system.

Survival Time \(m\).To assess the sustainability of a simulation run, we define the number of units of time survived \(m\) as the longest period during which the shared resource remains above \(C\): \(m=(\{t h(t)>C\}).\)

Survival Rate \(q\).Moreover, we define the proportion of runs which achieve maximum survival time, i.e., \(m=12\), as survival rate: \(q=}{\#}}\).

Total Gain \(R_{i}\) for Each Agent \(i\).Let \(r_{i}^{t}\) with \(t=1,,T\) represent the sequence of resources collected by the \(i\)-th agent at time \(t\) over the simulation duration \(T\). The total gain for each agent, \(R_{i}\), is defined as: \(R_{i}=_{t=1}^{T}r_{i}^{t}\).

Efficiency \(u\).We define the efficiency \(u\) as how optimally the shared resource is utilized w.r.t. the maximal possible efficiency. Intuitively, maximum efficiency \((u)\) is achieved when the resource is consistently regenerated to its maximum capacity such that the amount harvested is equal to the initial sustainability threshold \(f(0)\). Hence, we define \(u\) as:

\[u=1-^{T}R^{t})}{T f(0)}.\] (1)

(In)equality \(e\).We quantify (in)equality \(e\), using the the Gini coefficient . Across the total gains \(\{R_{i}\}_{i=0}^{||}\) of all \(||\) agents:

\[e=1-^{||}_{j=1}^{||}|R_{i}-R_{j}|}{2 ||_{i=1}^{||}R_{i}}\,\] (2)

where we normalize the absolute differences between pairs of agents by the total gains of all agents.

Over-usage \(o\).We quantify the amount of (un)sustainable behavior across a simulation. The over-usage \(o\), is the percentage of actions across the experiment that exceed the sustainability threshold:

\[o=^{||}_{t=1}^{T}(r_{t}^{i}>f(t))}{ || m}.\] (3)

## 3 Experimental Results

### Experimental Setup

Agent ArchitecturesTo test LLM performance in GovSim, we develop an LLM-based agent architecture based on the "generative agents" framework . These agents work in a phase-based environment - different phases require different decisions ranging from deciding how much of a resource to extract or open-ended discussion. Each agent receives identical instructions that explain the dynamics of GovSim. The instructions were carefully designed to avoid priming models to be cooperative or greedy, as shown in Figure 2 for the fishery scenario. Full details are presented in Appendix B.

LLMs BenchmarkedWe compile a diverse suite of instruction-tuned LLMs for experiments on GovSim. We test existing closed-weights models: GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo, and GPT-4o  via OpenAI API, Claude-3 Haiku, Sonnet, and Opus via Anthropic API. We also tested open-weights models: Llama-2 (7B, 13B, 70B) , Llama-3 (8B, 70B) , Mistral (7B, 8x7B) , Owen (72B, 110B) . See Appendix D.1 for exact model identifiers, hardware requirements, and API costs.

When testing LLMs, we ensure reproducibility by setting the text generation temperature to zero, i.e., greedy decoding. We provide full experimental details in Appendix D and on our GitHub. Each simulation was repeated with five random seeds. The average scores for each metric are presented in the main text, while the standard deviations are in the appendix.

### Benchmarking GovSim

The GovSim environment serves as a _sustainability benchmark_ to evaluate whether LLM agents can effectively cooperate to maintain a common pool of resources and avoid depletion. Possible outcomes are reflected in the above metrics over multiple simulations controlled by an LLM \(\). Intuitively, cooperation is optimized when agents achieve high total gain, \(R\), by maximizing efficiency, \(u\), and achieving high survival time, \(m\).

We benchmark LLM agents across our three scenarios to assess how these agents balance resource utilization (reward maximization) and preservation (safety). First, smaller models (such as Llama-3-8B) often fail to sustainably manage any of the resources at all. In our simulations, they never sustain any of the resources past the first month. Second, no LLM in our studies could sustain the resource in all of the 5 seeds across the three scenarios (survival time 12). In Table 1, larger models (such as GPT-4o) show better survival time and total gain, though their success varied across scenarios. Finally, LLMs performed better in the fishery scenario than in the pasture and pollution scenarios (cf. Appendix D.2). One possibility for this difference is that the fishing scenario only requires reasoning about a single variable (fish). In contrast, the other scenarios involve interactions between two variables, such as grass and sheep, or pollution and the production of widgets.

### Norm Robustness: A Greedy Newcomer

Having established a baseline, we investigate the robustness of the sustainability strategies discovered by LLM agents. Robustness is measured by inserting a new selfish agent into an existing community of sustainable agents. We start with a community of four agents who had the opportunity to reach a cooperative equilibrium in the first three months of the simulation. The new player was given the goal of maximizing their own profit while being indifferent to the welfare of others. This experiment analyzes how the original group adapts or enforces cooperation to prevent resource depletion under this perturbation. We use the same setup as Section 3.2 and modify prompts as shown in Appendix D.4.

We perform this experiment across all scenarios using GPT-4o, the best performing model in Table 1. Across five seeds, the survival rate drops from \(53.3 33.3\), the survival time drops from \(9.3 6.6\), the gain drops from \(66.0 34.8\), the efficiency drops from \(55.0 31.3\), equality drops from \(94.4 71.7\) and over-usage increases from \(10.8 15.7\). Figure 2(b) shows an example simulation trajectory of the newcomer perturbation where things go well. The newcomer initially harvests a large number of shared resource (see month 4), but adjusts to lower harvest rates in subsequent months. This adjustment results from dynamic interactions with the original four agents who align the newcomer to a more sustainable norm over time. In Appendix G, we provide a qualitative example of these interactions, illustrating how the newcomer learns to reduce the number of harvested resources and comply with the sustainable norm through community discussions. Overall, more work is needed to improve robustness to perturbations of this type.

### Improving Sustainability by Universalization Reasoning

Analysis of LLM behavior suggests that the lack of sustainable governance may result from an inability to mentally simulate the long-term effects of greedy actions on the equilibrium of the multi-agent system. One approach to make these consequences salient is through a mechanism known in the moral psychology and philosophy literature as "Universalization" [37; 43]. The basic idea of Universalization is that when assessing whether a particular moral rule or action is permissible, one should ask, "What if **everybody** does that?" . Previous work has shown this process shapes people's moral judgments in social dilemmas . Here, we hypothesize that a similar mechanism may make sustainable cooperation more likely in LLMs by making the long-term consequences of collective action more salient. For instance, a naive model might reason, "I should take as many fish as I can," but if forced to consider the universalization of that policy ("we each take as many fish as we can"), they realize that such a policy will cause rapid collapse.

To study whether Universalization can encourage sustainable cooperation, we augment the memory of each agent with the following statement, "Given the current situation, if everyone takes more than \(f(t)\), the shared resources will decrease next month.", where \(f(t)\) is the sustainable threshold defined in Section 2.4. For this test, we measure the delta between metrics with universalization and without universalization.

We report the impact of Universalization on the different LLM (excluding Claude-3 Opus due to API costs) models described in Section 3.1. We find that Universalization, excluding two combinations that already had a maximum survival time, significantly increases the average survival time by \(4\) months (t-test; \(p<0.001\)), total gain by \(29\) units of shared resource (t-test; \(p<0.001\)), and efficiency by \(24\%\) (t-test; \(p<0.001\)). For a detailed breakdown of these improvements across models, see Appendix D.3.

### Ablation of Communication

A powerful aspect of our framework is that the role of open-ended communication can be studied explicitly in the context of solving common pool resources problems. To quantify the value of these communication channels, we ablate agents' ability to communicate. We perform these tests on the subset of models that have survival rate greater than 10%, see Table 1 (_GPT-4o, GPT-4-turbo, Claude-3 Opus, Qwen-110B_). Comparing simulations without communication with those with communication, we find that agents without communication tend to overuse the common resource by 22% (t-test; \(p<0.001\)). This result shows the importance of the communication phase for sustainable resources. Analyzing the interactions between agents, we find that in most conversations, agents coordinate on extraction limits equal to or below the sustainable threshold through discussion, thereby increasing the robustness of resource use.

### Analysis of Agent Dialogues

To provide insight into how open-ended dialogue supports cooperation, we quantitatively analyze the conversations produced by the LLM during the discussion phase. To support interpretability, we categorize conversations into three high-level clusters: information sharing, negotiation, and relational interactions using the following taxonomy:

Figure 4: Impact of communication on sustainability: (a) Comparison of over-usage percentages between simulations with and without communication scenarios. This figure illustrates how the absence of communication leads to a marked increase in resource over-usage. (b) Distribution of different types of utterances (information, negotiation, relational) across communication scenarios.

1. **Information:** (a) _Information Sharing:_ disseminating facts among participants. (b) _Problem Identification:_ highlighting challenges that require collective attention and resolution. (c) _Solution Proposing:_ offering ideas or actions to address identified issues.
2. **Negotiation:** (a) _Persuasion:_ attempting to influence others to achieve a desired outcome. (b) _Consensus Seeking:_ aiming to align group members on a decision or action plan. (c) _Expressing Disagreement:_ articulating opposition to proposals or existing conditions, with or without offering alternatives.
3. **Relational:** (a) _Excusing Behavior:_ justifying one's actions or decisions, especially when they deviate from group norms or expectations. (b) _Punishment:_ imposing consequences for perceived wrongdoings or failures to adhere to norms.

Following Gilardi et al. , we used GPT-4-turbo to classify each utterance according to our defined taxonomy. The model was given detailed category definitions and prompted to categorize each utterance into one of the eight sub-categories. For details of this analysis, refer to Appendix E. To ensure consistency, we manually annotated 100 random utterances and found that an annotator (an author of the paper) agreed with _GPT-4-turbo_'s labels 72% of the time on the sub-categories.

We analyze the dialogue on the subset of models with higher survival time from Table 1 and present the results in Figure 3(b). On average (overall models), the majority of utterances (54%) are focused on negotiations between agents, followed by information (45%) and relational (1%). Qualitatively, some models, such as _GPT-4-turbo_, tend to be overly cautious by advocating lower fishing limits than the sustainability limit per person. In contrast, scenarios where an agent significantly takes above this limit cause noticeable concern among other participants. For instance, an agent catching more fish usually avoids discussing the issue instead of negotiating for greater access to the resource. For examples of dialogues, refer to Appendix G.

### The Role of LLM Capabilities

Since we observed significant heterogeneity in the emergence of sustainable cooperation across LLM models, we next investigated how basic LLM capabilities relate to success in GovSim. We test each LLM capabilities on four sub-skills: (a) basic understanding of simulation dynamics and simple reasoning [simulation dynamics], (b) individually sustainable choices without group interaction [sustainable action], (c) accurate calculation of the sustainability threshold based on the GovSim state under the direct assumption that all participants harvest equally [sustainability threshold (assumption)], and (d) calculation of the sustainability threshold for a given GovSim state by forming a belief about actions of other agents [sustainability threshold (beliefs)]. Each sub-skill test consists of 150 problems created from a template with procedurally generated values. For each sub-skill test, we compute the accuracy against the ground truth answer.

Figure 5: Scatter plots showing the correlation between reasoning test accuracy and survival time in GovSim. Accuracy and survival time are averaged across the three scenarios. The x-axis of each plot shows the accuracy of each LLM on four reasoning tests: (a) simulation dynamics, (b) sustainable action, (c) sustainability threshold (assumption), (d) sustainability threshold (beliefs). The y-axis represents the average survival time, with higher values indicating better success in GovSim. For a breakdown of the scores across the three scenarios, see Appendix F.2.

In Figure 5, we show how the average score on each of these four test cases correlates with survival time by OLS linear regression: (a) simulation dynamics (\(R^{2}=0.69\), t-test; \(p<0.001\)), (b) sustainable action (\(R^{2}=0.92\), t-test; \(p<0.001\)), (c) sustainability threshold (assumption) (\(R^{2}=0.76\), t-test; \(p<0.001\)), (d) sustainability threshold (belief) (\(R^{2}=0.82\), t-test; \(p<0.001\)). Moreover, we see in Figure 4(b) that when LLMs are asked to choose how much to harvest in isolation, they only choose the sustainable action at most 30% of the time, reinforcing the observation made in Section 3.5 that cooperation through communication is a key mechanism to arrive at sustainable norms. We also observe, in Figure 4(c) and Figure 4(d), that models that successfully formulate beliefs about other agents, achieve higher survival times, compared to models that require additional assumptions. Refer to Appendix F for a breakdown across scenarios and prompts.

## 4 Contributions in the Context of Related Work

AI SafetyThe primary objective of AI safety is to ensure that AI systems do not cause harm to humans [30; 54; 66]. As LLMs become more capable and autonomous, ensuring their safety remains a critical concern [2; 3; 30]. Popular evaluation datasets for safety include Ethis, TruthfulQA, and MoraLexceptQA. Additional studies have explored the capabilities and potential issues of current LLMs [17; 31; 52]. These methods do not address the complexities inherent in multi-agent interactions and broader real-world scenarios, and more effort is needed to guarantee the safety of multi-agent systems [13; 14; 15]. Most similar to GovSim is Machiavelli, where the authors investigate harmful behavior vs. reward maximization in a benchmark of single-agent choose-your-own-adventure games.

_Our Contribution:_ In contrast to prior work, GovSim focuses on multi-agent scenarios that require both strategy, communication, and cooperation: it introduces a more dynamic and realistic environment that is now possible to study using LLM agents. Success in our task is not relative to human annotators but is instead grounded in a game theoretic scenario. We introduce three resource-sharing scenarios and analyze LLM agents in terms of their sustainability, stability, and ability to resolve novel conflicts.

NLP BenchmarkingTo assess the capabilities of LLMs, the broader research community has developed many benchmarks. Static benchmarks with clear ground-truth MMLU , GSM8k , and others like it do not capture flexible and interactive tasks needed to navigate scenarios in the real-world [22; 47; 73]. In contrast, more recent efforts evaluate LLMs on complex tasks that resemble real-world applications [18; 38; 75] or involve A/B testing with human feedback . For these complex tasks, recent work has started deploying generative agents [59; 60] for task-specific simulations, such as collaborative agent systems for software engineering [32; 46; 53; 72] and other domains [33; 36; 49; 69]. Refer to Xi et al.  for an extensive review. These generative agents are increasingly used in dynamic environments where agents must learn, adapt, and make decisions in real-time.

_Our Contribution:_ Our benchmark, GovSim, parallels projects such as GTBench Duan et al. , which measures the reasoning abilities of LLMs through game-theoretic tasks. However, our work distinguishes itself by its grounding in broader forms of economic reasoning, our focus on cooperation dilemmas [27; 56], the incorporating moral considerations, and the need for more sophisticated communication and negotiation skills. Unlike one-shot games, GovSim is a dynamic benchmark and can be used to evaluate long-horizon behaviors.

## 5 Limitations and Future Work

This work sets the stage for exploring scenarios that are still more complex and realistic. One limitation of our study is the simplified nature of the resource-sharing scenarios. Real-world common pool resource management involves far more sophisticated dynamics and variability. Some of these dynamics are, in principle, possible in a future version of GovSim, such as varying regeneration rates, multiple resource types, and different stakeholder interests.

While the scenarios in GovSim are somewhat simplified, the complex, open-ended nature of our simulation is a significant step towards realism compared to the highly simplified paradigms leveraged from behavioral game theory. Furthermore, while more complex variants are possible, our goal is to establish a framework that can serve as a foundation that can be flexibly extended by ourselves and others in the community. The design choices balance complexity and interpretability as simpler scenarios allow us to study cooperative principles with greater systematicity. Moreover, our current scenarios and dynamics already present significant challenges for current LLMs. Future work could extend GovSim to incorporate more complexities.

_A larger agent population:_ Our current simulation can be generalized to more agents and a diversity of player types. More agents will increase the simulation runtime, as each agent needs to condition their behavior and dialogue on the other agents' actions and dialogues. Perhaps fine-tuned smaller LLMs can act as efficient simulators in this context without losing performance.

_Coordinated adaptation:_ People can flexibly adapt to sudden changes in game dynamics. For example, when the resource suddenly shrinks (a temporary shock), or changes in the reproduction rate require agents to rapidly adjust their cooperative norms in a coordinated way. GovSim enables these kinds of experiments as the simulation environment is modular such that resource dynamics, agents, and other elements are easily changeable for different simulation runs.

_Challenging trade-offs and exceptions:_ We are also interested in understanding exceptions to norms. For instance, one agent may need to handle a one-off choice of serious personal harm and group sustainability, e.g., one agent will experience harm unless they take more resources than permitted by an existing norm -- will other agents adapt and allow for such one-off exceptions without allowing for exploitation [4; 44]?

Moreover, current LLM capabilities limit our agent's ability to negotiate successfully and act strategically. As LLMs evolve, we expect more sophisticated behaviors to emerge. Future research could enhance LLM negotiation skills and test these improvements against our benchmark. In addition, further work could introduce advanced adversarial agents to test the robustness of the emergent cooperative norms discovered here against manipulation. Furthermore, exploring the scalability of these norms in larger, more diverse agent populations and their application in mixed human-AI communities will be valuable.

A promising next step is to incorporate humans into the simulation using the GovSim platform. These human-AI interactions will challenge LLM-based agents to cooperate with humans using open-ended communication, and we can see whether the norms that develop are either more or less effective than those created by LLMs alone.

## 6 Conclusion

We introduced a novel simulation platform Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), which enables the study of strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In our research, we find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium, with the highest survival rate below 54%. We discover that without communication, agents over-use the shared resource by 22%. Analysis of LLM behaviors suggests that the lack of sustainable governance may result from an inability to mentally simulate the long-term effects of greedy actions on the equilibrium of the multi-agent system. To address this challenge, we find that prompting agents to consider the universalization of their action significantly improves survival time by 4 months. A society of LLM agents with the ability to communicate finds ways to flexibly cooperate and avoid collapse.
