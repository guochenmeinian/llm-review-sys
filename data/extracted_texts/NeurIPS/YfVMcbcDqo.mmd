###### Abstract

Physical models in the form of partial differential equations serve as important priors for many under-constrained problems. One such application is tumor treatment planning, which relies on accurately estimating the spatial distribution of tumor cells within a patient's anatomy. While medical imaging can detect the bulk of a tumor, it cannot capture the full extent of its spread, as low-concentration tumor cells often remain undetectable, particularly in glioblastoma, the most common primary brain tumor. Machine learning approaches struggle to estimate the complete tumor cell distribution due to a lack of appropriate training data. Consequently, most existing methods rely on physics-based simulations to generate anatomically and physiologically plausible estimations. However, these approaches face challenges with complex and unknown initial conditions and are constrained by overly rigid physical models. In this work, we introduce a novel method that integrates data-driven and physics-based cost functions, akin to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). However, our approach parametrizes the solution directly on a dynamic discrete mesh, allowing for the effective modeling of complex biomechanical behaviors. Specifically, we propose a unique discretization scheme that quantifies how well the learned spatiotemporal distributions of tumor and brain tissues adhere to their respective growth and elasticity equations. This quantification acts as a regularization term, offering greater flexibility and improved integration of patient data compared to existing models. We demonstrate enhanced coverage of tumor recurrence areas using real-world data from a patient cohort, highlighting the potential of our method to improve model-driven treatment planning for glioblastoma in clinical practice.

## 1 Introduction

The management of gliomas, particularly glioblastomas, is highly challenging due to their infiltration beyond the tumor margins detectable in medical imaging. This infiltrative behavior complicates the precise personalization of radiotherapy. Current clinical practice applies uniform radiation to a 1.5 cm margin around the active tumor core visible in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans. However, this approach overlooks critical factors such as heterogeneous infiltration patterns, varying brain tissues, and anatomical barriers, failing to account for the highly individualized dynamics oftumor spread in each patient. Personalizing radiotherapy to account for this spread remains an unmet clinical need in neuro-oncology .

The computational modeling of tumor growth has become a promising solution to this challenge [2; 3; 4; 5], by formalizing the tumor growth process through mathematical models of varying complexity . However, personalizing these models to the limited clinical observational (image) data of a patient remains a formidable challenge. To address it, two main computational approaches have emerged:

Hard-Constrained Physics-Based Models:These models use Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to constrain the solution space, ensuring that output tumor cell distributions adhere strictly to predefined physical laws [7; 8; 9; 10; 11].

However, since PDEs are approximations of the underlying stochastic processes in complex biological environments, they may overconstrain the system. While these models offer structure and insight, they fail to capture the intricate behaviors inherent to biological processes like tumor growth. Additionally, linking image observations to state variables requires careful consideration. As a result, the full integration of data is hindered by these limitations, reducing the effectiveness of physical models in representing empirical data.

Data-Driven Models:These models [12; 13] offer great flexibility by leveraging access to imaging datasets. They can directly be learned from - and applied to - the patients' diagnostic scans. However, they often lack rigorous quality control and fail to integrate crucial biological insights, such as tissue-specific infiltration patterns and brain topology. This makes them less reliable for clinical application, especially when there is insufficient data to infer them purely from imaging information.

In Search of a Hybrid Approach:Combining physical insights on spatiotemporal distributions of state variables with increased model flexibility could be highly beneficial. One approach to achieve this is by testing the physics residual in selected locations, as demonstrated in Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) [14; 15; 16; 17; 18]. Another way involves projecting the learned solution into a latent space that adheres to physics constraints [19; 20]. A different framework, Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL) , constructs a residual of PDEs using grid-based discretization. Unlike methods that optimize the weights of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) that implicitly parametrize the unknown fields in the PINNs method, ODIL directly optimizes the discretized unknown fields, which can be faster and more stable due to the local (rather than global, as in MLPs) dependencies of the solution on the learnable weights.

Both ODIL  and PINNs  have recently been employed to model growth equations conditioned on MRI and metabolic imaging of patients. ODIL advances state-of-the-art radiotherapy planning by relaxing the constraints of the growth equation, thereby enhancing the capture of tumor recurrence. A similar trend is observed in computer vision's novel view synthesis, where neural radiance field MLPs  are being replaced by discrete representations [25; 26; 27].

However, none of these hybrid approaches have modeled brain-tumor interactions dealing with constraints imposed by local structural anatomy, such as the relative composition of brain tissues and their microstructure, or by the impact of gross anatomical deformations visible in structural scans of large tumors. While biomechanical model extensions can address the latter, incorporating tissue elasticity remains challenging due to the unknown initial anatomy and the computational complexity of the tumor growth dynamics. So far, no hybrid approach free from hard PDE constraints has successfully linked biological processes, such as tumor growth, with models of the biological environment, like tissue elasticity. Only a few studies have used PINNs for biomechanical modeling in synthetic scenarios, demonstrating that the displacement field of materials can be learned from observations [28; 29].

The main contributions of this work are as follows:

* We construct discrete physics-based residuals as measures of differences between learned spatiotemporal distributions and those predicted by discretized physical equations governing tumor growth and tissue biomechanics. Using a Lagrangian perspective where particles carry tissue intensities, we project these dynamics onto static Eulerian grids to condition the learnable tumor cell and tissue distributions on available observations. Unlike data-driven models, our hybrid method remains robust due to physics regularization while being more flexible at adapting data than hard-constrained numerical simulations.
* Our method allows for the estimation of the initial condition of the biomechanical environment. We demonstrate the ability to learn the complex unknown initial condition, which, in our case, is not just the origin of the pathology but also the initial state of the brain tissue anatomy.
* We validate our method* on the downstream task of radiotherapy planning using the largest publicly available dataset known to us, achieving new state-of-the-art performance in capturing tumor recurrence.

Figure 1 provides an overview of our method, showing how we condition the learnable full spatial tumor cell distribution on the patient data and regularize it using soft assumptions about the physics of tumor growth, tissue elasticity, and initial conditions for both the anatomy and the tumor. In addition to multiparametric MRI scans (T1Gd, T1, FLAIR), we incorporate Fluoroethyl-L-tyrosine PET (FET-PET), a specialized form of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), as an additional imaging modality that captures the metabolic activity of tumor cells.

## 2 Physical Assumptions

Our model integrates physical assumptions to ensure that the learned tumor cell distribution adheres to established biological and mechanical principles. These assumptions are incorporated into the loss function as regularization terms alongside initial condition assumptions and data terms.

### Physical Model

We consider the problem of learning the tumor cell distribution within the domain \((0,1]\), where \((0,1]\) represents the assumed time of tumor growth, and the unit cube \(=^{3}\) describes our spatial domain.

The objective is to determine a tumor cell density function \(c(x,t)\), \((x,t)(0,1]\) approximately satisfying the reaction-diffusion-advection equation :

\[=c}_{}+c}_{}-c)}_{},\] (1)

where \(c=(D() c)\) represents the diffusion of the cells with the tissue-dependent diffusion constant \(D()\), \((c)= c(1-c)\) describes the cell growth with a growth factor \(\), and \(\) is a

(d) Outcomes: initial healthy anatomy, spatial tumor cell distribution, and system identification parameters.

velocity field moving the cells in the interior of the domain due to the tissue's elastic properties and the tumor-induced stresses in the tissue.

The brain tissue vector \(\), which represents the percentage-wise concentration of different tissue types, is defined as \((x,t)=[m_{}(x,t),m_{}(x,t),m_{}(x,t)]\), where \(m_{}\), \(m_{}\), and \(m_{}\) denote the concentrations of white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively.

The brain tissue vector \(\) is governed by:

\[_{t}+()=0,\] (2)

where \(\) denotes the outer product. We assume Neumann boundary conditions for both \(c\) and \(\). For \(c\), the no-flux condition applies at the borders of diffusive tissues, specifically the combined white and gray matter. For each tissue component in \(\), the no-flux boundary is assumed to be the constant brain boundary visible in the MRI scans.

The tumor induced stresses lead to a displacement field \(\), such that the velocity is given by \(=_{t}\). We assume quasi-static mechanical equilibrium due to the slow tumor growth rate relative to tissue mechanical responses, leading to:

\[()+ c=0,\] (3)

where \(\) regulates the impact of the tumor on the displacement and is a learnable patient-specific parameter. We apply the Neo-Hookean model  to represent hyperelastic behavior in biological tissues, where the stress \(\) is related to the deformation gradient \(_{ij}=_{ij}+}{ x_{j}}\) with the Lame parameters \(\) and \(\) (material properties in Appendix G), averaged across different tissue types to accommodate the heterogeneity:

\[=}{J}(^{T}-)+(J),\] (4)

with \(J=()\). The averaged Lame parameters, \(\) and \(\), are computed based on the proportional contributions of constituent tissues, ensuring the stress tensor accurately reflects the composite mechanical properties of the mixed tissues. This methodology facilitates detailed simulations adhering to the elasticity laws relevant to heterogeneous biological environments.

The set of learnable parameters \(_{}\) describing the tumor dynamics, is thus given by \(_{}=\{D_{},R,,\}\), where \(D_{}\) and \(D_{}=RD_{}\) are the diffusivities in pure gray and white matter regions, which are averaged to the effective diffusivity with a weighted average based on the tissue proportions.

### Discrete Physics Residuals

We use two different approaches to discretize the elasticity equations and the reaction-diffusion-advection equations. For the former, we use a time-dependent grid in space, described by the \(N_{x}\) points \((_{i}^{n})_{1 j N_{x}}\) at time \(n t\), \(0 n N_{t}\), which initially form a uniform grid on \(\). For the latter, we further partition the domain \(\) at the \(n\)th point in time into \(N_{x}\) cells \(_{i}^{n}\), \(1 i N_{x}\), such that \(=_{i=1}^{N_{x}}_{i}^{n}\). Note that the nodes defining the cell boundaries are carried by the particles \(_{j}^{n}\), whose movement, governed by tissue elasticity, gradually deforms the cells \(_{i}^{n}\) from their initial rectangular shape.

The displacement field \(^{n}\) is computed based on the initial (\(t=0\)) and current (\(t=n t\)) positions of particles \(^{n}\) within the tissue by \(^{n}=^{n}-^{0}\). Using central finite differences on the initial uniform reference grid, we can consecutively approximate \(_{j}^{n}\), \(_{j}^{n}\), \( c_{j}^{n}\), \(_{j}^{n}\), and define the tissue residual:

\[L_{}=_{n=0}^{N_{t}}_{j=0}^{N_{x}} (_{j}^{n}+ c_{j}^{n})^{2}.\] (5)

As the particles, representing grid points, move with the tissue's deformation, they inherently accommodate the advection. Thus, the observed displacement of tumor cells attributed to advection is absorbed into the changes in particle positions. This leads to a simplification of the tumor equation when solved in the moving reference frame of the particles.

We use an implicit Euler scheme combined with a cell-centered finite-volume discretization to discretize the tumor equation. We denote the boundaries between two cells \(1 i,j N_{x}\) by \(_{ij}^{n}=_{ji}^{n}=_{i}^{n}_{j}^{n}\). Further, the index set of all neighboring cells of \(_{i}^{n}\) is given by \(N_{i}=\{j:_{j}_{i} j i\}\) and assumed to stay independent of \(n\), due to the extend of our deformations (see limitations in Section 7). For a function \(c_{i}^{n}\) at time \(n t\) at the \(i\)th cell, we discretize the diffusion \(\) and reaction \(\) operators by:

\[[c_{i}^{n},D_{i}^{n}]=_{j N_{i}}|_{ij}|D_{ij}^{n} {c_{j}^{n}-c_{i}^{n}}{\|_{j}^{n}-_{i}^{n}\|},[c_{i}^{n}]=|_{i}^{n}| c_{i}^{n}(1-c_{i}^{n}),\] (6)

where \(D_{ij}^{n}\) is the harmonic mean of \(D_{i}^{n}\) at the cell boundary, \(|_{ij}^{n}|\) denotes the interface area, and \(|_{i}^{n}|\) denotes the cell volume. We thus obtain the tumor loss by:

\[L_{}=_{n=1}^{N_{t}}_{i=0}^{N_{x}}(^{n}|}{ t}(c_{i}^{n}-c_{i}^{n-1})-[c_{i}^{n},D_{i}^ {n}]-[c_{i}^{n}])^{2}.\] (7)

### Particle-Grid Projections

While a Lagrangian frame representation from the point of view of particles is beneficial for accurately modeling advection, an Eulerian frame is essential for rendering the advected particle states into the image space. Denoting the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames as \(G\) and \(P\) respectively, an Eulerian field \(^{G}\) and a Lagrangian field \(^{P}\) are related through:

\[_{j}^{P}_{i}w_{ij}_{i}^{G},_{ i}^{G}w_{ij}_{j}^{P}}{_{j}w_{ij}},\] (8)

where \(i\) indexes grid nodes, \(j\) indexes particles, and \(w_{ij}\) represents the weight of the trilinear shape function defined on node \(i\) and evaluated at the location of particle \(j\).

## 3 Initial Assumptions

We model the initial conditions of the tumor and brain tissues by incorporating assumptions into our loss functions, ensuring the model aligns with the expected biological and anatomical state of the brain before and at the onset of tumor growth.

(a) Initial condition penalties enforce symmetric healthy anatomy, with the initial tumor distribution at \(t=0\) as a small Gaussian blob. (b) Physics penalties regularize dynamics between the initial and the final time. The first row shows gray matter contours with particle positions; the second row shows white matter contours with learned tumor concentrations. (c) Agreement of tumor distribution with anatomical tissues, visible tumor segmentations, and metabolic map after transforming the final tumor distribution through the imaging function.

### Initial Tumor Distribution

We assume that the initial tumor distribution can be represented by a small Gaussian blob. To enforce this assumption, we penalize the difference between \(^{G}(u)^{0}\) and a Gaussian function centered at \(x_{0}\). The center of this Gaussian blob, \(x_{0}\), is part of the learnable parameters \(_{}=\{x_{0},^{0}\}\). The initial condition loss for the tumor cells is defined as:

\[L_{}=_{i=0}^{N_{x}}(^{G}(c )_{i}^{0}-D_{1}(--x_{0})^{2}}{D_{2}}))^{2},\] (9)

where \(D_{1}=0.5\), \(D_{2}=0.02\) are constants and \(x_{i}\) is the position of the center of \(_{i}^{0}\).

### Healthy Anatomy

The deformations are clearly visible in the MRI images and are an integral part of understanding growth dynamics. To obtain a plausible estimate of the unperturbed brain, we need to incorporate an anatomical prior.

A healthy brain is roughly symmetric between hemispheres, as justified by anatomical and functional observations. Imaging techniques such as MRI reveal symmetrical tissue structures, and electroencephalography (EEG) recordings show symmetrical patterns of electrical activity in the brain [32; 33]. This assumption applies to key tissue types, including white matter, gray matter, and cerebrospinal fluid. We construct a loss function, denoted as \(L_{}\), to quantify the asymmetry of the learned \(^{G}(^{0})\). The implementation details are provided in Appendix E. We do not use the unperturbed anatomy explicitly for inference of the tumor cells, however, we need additional constraints to bound \(\) from Eq. 3 that couples tumor cells with tissue dynamics. While symmetry of the healthy brain is a coarse assumption, we soften it by quantifying the asymmetry in lower resolutions.

## 4 Imaging Data Reconstruction

Imaging data refers to information directly observed from the patient's MRI and FET-PET 3D scans , including visible tumor parts and surrounding brain tissues. As shown in Figure 1, this data includes estimated brain tissue probability maps, visible tumor segmentation, and a metabolic map derived from FET-PET scans, focusing on the enhancing core and edema. MRI scans provide segmentation maps , revealing the visible tumor. Using non-rigid atlas image registration with

(c) Learned tumor cell distribution, regularized by the physics residual and aligned with patient data. (d) Learned initial condition of the tissues representing healthy anatomy. (e) Average brain template for reference, rigidly registered to the MRI scan. Notable anatomical differences include the lack of matter passage between the hemispheres next to the tumor, which could affect tumor cell inference results.

tumor masking , we estimate tissues both outside and hidden by the tumor, including white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These observations offer partial information about both the anatomy and the tumor cell distribution.

The imaging function (see Figure 2)  bridges simulated tumor cell densities with visible tumor segmentation and brain tissues, as well as the metabolic map. It depends on parameters for thresholding the tumor cell distribution to obtain segmentation, denoted as \(_{}\), which must be learned.

We construct a loss function that minimizes the difference between model predictions and patient observables. Specifically, \(L_{}\) matches the visible tumor core, \(L_{}\) matches the visible edema, and \(L_{}\) matches the metabolic map profile. Tissue intensities carried by particles are set to reproduce the patient's estimated tissues at \(t=1\). While these intensities are predetermined, particle positions are weakly constrained, so matching the tissues (WM, GM, CSF) to the observed structures outside the tumor is enforced through \(L_{}\). The constructed penalty terms align our spatiotemporal distributions of tumor cells and tissues with patient data characteristics. Implementation details of the data losses and the imaging function are provided in Appendix D.

## 5 Combined Loss Function

The loss function \(_{}\) is constructed to balance the contributions of physics-based regularization, assumptions about the initial conditions, and the imaging empirical data. This facilitates a comprehensive approach to infer the full spatial tumor cell distribution at the time of the patient's data acquisition (see Figure 3 for an overview of the inference process and Figure 2 for the learning process visualization):

\[_{}= L_{}+_{2}L_{}}_{}+\] \[L_{}+_{4}L_{}}_{}+\] \[L_{}+_{6}L_{}+_{7}L_{}+_{8}L_{}}_{}.\] (10)

All \(_{*}\) parameters were determined based on experiments with synthetic data involving both single focal and local multi-focal tumors. Extensive ablation studies are provided in Appendix C, and the details of the synthetic experiment setup can be found in Appendix F.

## 6 Validation and Ablation Study of Radiotherapy Planning

There is no objective ground truth for pre-operative tumor cell distribution, so methods are evaluated through downstream tasks like defining radiation target volumes. An "accurate" method targets areas that later show progression in follow-up MRI, acknowledging that radiation delays but does not eliminate tumor regrowth. An "inaccurate" method spares these areas or targets regions that remain tumor-free. The current "Standard Plan" defines the target volume using a 1.5 cm isosurface around the MRI-segmented tumor core, while our approach generates isosurfaces from learned tumor cell distributions. Figure 4 visualizes the Standard Plan and a plan based on our learned tumor cell distribution. Each model's target volume is simply a redistribution of the target volume of the Standard Plan.

We assess accuracy by measuring the overlap between the target volumes and regions of later tumor progression, calculating the _Recurrence Coverage_ [%]. This metric represents the percentage of the tumor progression region that falls within the radiotherapy target volume of a given model, after rigid alignment of both scans.

Additional experiments studying properties of the tumor growth and imaging model on synthetic data, i.e., without relying on indirect validation via radiotherapy planning, are given in Appendix B.

### Implementation details

Our computational model uses a multi-resolution method  with additional, coarser grids to accelerate convergence. We employ four levels of grid refinement, resulting in 152,880,048 unknowns. At the finest grid level of \(72 72 72 96\), each grid point contains four unknowns: three for particle positions and one for tumor cell density.

The learning process includes system identification of unknowns: \(_{}\), \(_{}\), and \(_{}\), which parameterize tumor growth dynamics, tissue elasticity, initial conditions, and imaging characteristics. Using the Adam optimizer, convergence takes around 3 hours on an NVIDIA RTX A6000 GPU.

### Dataset

We use a publicly available dataset of 58 patients with preoperative MRI scans and preoperative FET-PET imaging, along with follow-up MRI scans at the time of the first visible tumor recurrence .

We would like to emphasize that this is the largest publicly available dataset of this kind, i.e., with multi-modal imaging data and follow-up MRI. Its size is common for medical studies and sufficient to motivate clinical trials (see, for example, [38; 39; 40] on clinical investigations into the use of PET for radiotherapy planning). The problem we address is a critical challenge in cancer treatment research that calls for ML solutions. However, data acquisition is costly and time-consuming, and clinical datasets, such as ours with only a few dozen complete observations, are insufficient to support purely data-driven ML approaches (as visible from results reported in Table 1). At the same time, it is this inherent limitation that is encouraging us to incorporate physics-based assumptions and physics-informed regularizations into an ML model to effectively address the driving clinical problem.

The follow-up images with visible tumor recurrences are not used by our method during the optimization or hyper-parameter search at any point; therefore, the dataset can be considered 100% unseen. The decision not to use any recurrence data for hyper-parameter tuning is to avoid diluting the already small dataset.

### Models and Features

Our analysis includes a range of models, each categorized by their distinct capabilities:

* **Numerical Physics Simulations**: Employ methods such as Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM) to model tumor growth dynamics and account for dynamic tissue behaviors. The dynamic parameters are determined through numerous simulations with varying parameters. The brain tissues' initial conditions are based on average brains.

Figure 4: Radiotherapy planning: a) Pre-operative segmentations with white matter concentration as background. b) Distance map from the tumor core segmentation with a 1.5 cm contour and within diffusive tissue, constituting the Standard Plan. c) Our learned tumor cell distribution with the isosurface contour where the enclosed volume equals the total volume of the Standard Plan.

* **Data-Driven Neural Networks (Unconstrained)**: Use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to directly predict likely recurrence locations, representing a population-based data-driven approach.
* **Data-Driven Neural Networks (Physics-Constrained)**: Similar to the above unconstrained approach but limited to finding parameters for physics simulations, incorporating hard physics constraints.
* **Static Grid Discretization**: A previous state-of-the-art method that uses Optimizing a Discrete Loss (ODIL) and static grids to penalize the learned spatiotemporal tumor cell distribution by quantifying the discrepancy with the tumor growth equation, keeping brain anatomy static throughout the entire process.
* **Standard Plan**: Apply uniform safety margins around the tumor core, serving as the baseline for volume determination and reflecting current clinical practice post-tumor resection surgery radiotherapy planning.

Specific implementations within these categories are explained in Appendix A.

### Results

Table 1, specifically the "Recurrence Coverage [%] (Any)" column, and Figure 4(a) present results where recurrence is defined by any segmentation visible in the follow-up MRI scan. Our method achieved 74.7% recurrence coverage, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art at 72.9% and the Standard Plan at 70.0%. Using a predefined average brain reduced the performance to 73.4%. The physics-constrained data-driven approach slightly outperforms the Standard Plan at 67.1% and significantly outperforms its unconstrained variant at 59.0%. This highlights the advantage of adding physics constraints. Figure 4(a) shows the distance between 'Greater' and 'Less' categories increased from 26% to 36%.

Table 1, using the "Recurrence Coverage [%] (Enhancing Core)" column, and Figure 4(b) show results where recurrence is defined by enhancing core segmentation, per RANO guidelines . Our method leads with 89.9% average recurrence coverage, compared to 89.0% for static grid discretization and 87.3% for the Standard Plan. Numerical physics simulations are more robust at 86.2% compared to 84.3% for the physics-constrained data-driven method. The unconstrained data-driven method remains the lowest at 66.8%. Results are close because the enhancing core often occurs near pre-operative MRI segmentations, leading to many methods achieving 100% coverage (seen in 'Equal' in Figure 4(b)). However, Figure 4(b) shows an increase in the preference from 19% to 28%.

In both recurrence definitions, mean estimate uncertainty is substantial, as Recurrence Coverage for individual patients can vary significantly. These uncertainties are the standard errors of the mean. Nonetheless, Figure 5 shows that even slight improvements in average Recurrence Coverage consistently enhance radiotherapy outcomes compared to the Standard Plan baseline.

As shown in Figure 5, the gap between the "Greater" and "Less" categories represents the number of patients who benefit from our method compared to the standard plan. We observe a consistent improvement with our method, demonstrating superior performance beyond just higher mean recurrence coverage, which could be skewed by outliers. The results are statistically significant, as shown in Table 3 in Appendix B.

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we present the first successful approach to a soft-constrained physics system-identification problem that combines the complex biological process of tumor growth with the biomechanical environment such as elastic brain tissues. Our method integrates physics-based constraints with multi-modal imaging data to enhance tumor treatment planning for glioblastomas. The method balances adherence to observed patient data and physics-based penalties through a unique discretization scheme, serving as a flexible spatiotemporal regularization term.

Additionally, our method provides estimates of the initial condition, i.e., tumor-free, pre-deformation anatomy. Such healthy brain anatomy can be utilized in various studies, e.g., for aligning with post-surgical scans to assess the extent of tumor removal and detect complications .

Overall, our results show that this approach outperforms previous state-of-the-art techniques in covering tumor recurrence areas, with improved performance on real-world patient data. Finally, we want to point out that relaxing physical model constraints has broad applicability beyond glioblastoma localization. This approach can extend to other real-world problems where rigid physics-based models are limited but still relevant.

**Limitations:** The convergence speed of the method depends on a multiresolution grid, assuming that problems can be represented at lower resolutions. However, this approach may not be directly applicable to PDEs with narrow-phase interfaces. Additionally, while large deformations are allowed, we assume they are not large enough to cause material rupture, which may not be optimally handled in the Lagrangian perspective without modifications to the presented scheme.
