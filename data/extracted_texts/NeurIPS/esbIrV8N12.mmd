###### Abstract

The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has greatly facilitated math instruction, with the generated textual content serving as verbal responses to address student inquiries. However, in instructional settings, teachers often provide both verbal responses and board writing (BW) simultaneously to enhance students' knowledge construction. To address this, we introduce MathBoard, a multimodal large language model (MLLM) designed for elementary mathematics education, which progressively generates BW. Our study focuses on the provision of BW to learners, aiming to reduce their cognitive load effectively. Furthermore, MathBoard can be integrated with other approaches that enhance mathematical reasoning capabilities. An empirical study involving 34 pre-service teachers demonstrated that the multimodal interactions facilitated by MathBoard were more highly accepted and impactful across various dimensions compared to text-only interactions, significantly promoting learners' social construction of knowledge.

Introduction

In recent years, LLMs have shown immense potential in natural language processing and have played significant roles across multiple disciplines, particularly in mathematics(1; 2). LLMs can automatically generate exercises, provide instructional support, and deliver personalized feedback for students(3; 4). For specific educational needs, models like EduChat offer personalized, equitable, and empathetic services through fine-tuning(5), while LoRA fine-tuning strategies facilitate the automation of educational data annotation(6). The MinT model focuses on enhancing logical reasoning and generalization abilities(7). Looking ahead, further efforts to improve the sustainability and interpretability of LLMs will be essential for enhancing their trustworthiness and reliability in educational contexts(8; 9).

The concept of shared whiteboards has proven effective in improving efficiency in collaborative teams(10). Recent research has focused on integrating LLMs into whiteboard collaboration environments to promote creative cooperation and problem-solving through Blackboard Writing (BW) technology. For instance, the AI-AB framework provides an interactive whiteboard platform that facilitates idea exchange between humans and LLMs(11). Related works include the Visual Sketchpad, which allows LLMs to add auxiliary lines when solving mathematical problems(12), and the Whiteboard-of-Thought project, which demonstrates how LLMs can improve their OCR performance on whiteboards by enhancing reasoning abilities(13). While these studies primarily focus on generating Python code to improve LLMs' reasoning capabilities, they do not directly serve as visual teaching aids for human learners. Therefore, we propose further exploration into the generative capabilities of LLMs to create cross-modal learning resources, potentially transforming human-computer interaction models and providing learners with a more personalized and intuitive learning experience.

The primary contribution of this study is the development of MathBoard, powered by LLMs, which synchronously generates both Verbal Responses and Board Writing, thereby offering learners a cross-modal mathematics learning experience. However, a current limitation of MathBoard is its applicability solely to elementary-level math instruction, which requires further refinement in future work. This study seeks to address the following research questions:

* How can the generative capabilities of LLMs be leveraged to provide cross-modal guidance in mathematics learning?
* Is the proposed cross-modal teaching method more acceptable and engaging for learners?
* Does the integration of Board Writing in mathematics instruction foster learners' social construction of knowledge?

### Multimodal Large Language Models for Education

LLMs have seen widespread application in education (14; 15; 16). With the rapid advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), numerous educational case studies have highlighted their effectiveness and potential utility (17; 18; 19). For instance, MLLMs are capable of generating multimodal writing suggestions through diverse channels, including text, visuals, and audio, thereby aiding learners in enhancing their writing proficiency (20). Additionally, MLLMs can integrate multimodal data collected during classroom activities to produce more precise transcriptions, facilitating post-class study or reference (21), as well as to assess student engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of educational resources and environments (22). MLLMs also have the potential to provide interpretable information in education(23; 24). Notably, given MLLMs' advanced capabilities in processing multimedia information, they hold significant promise for supporting visually impaired learners in acquiring knowledge and understanding the world around them (25). Although the deployment of MLLMs necessitates increased data exchange(26; 27), which may pose potential security risks, techniques such as Federated Learning offer a viable means to mitigate these concerns (25; 28; 29).

### MLMs for Math Learning

In mathematical problem-solving, reasoning skills are essential(30; 31; 32). Additionally, given that mathematical problems often include charts and data, the ability to process multimodal information is also necessary(33; 34; 35). While the integration of multimodal data inputs can provide MLLMs with richer information and greater problem-solving potential, research has demonstrated that many MLLMs struggle to accurately interpret charts within the problem-solving context, leading to the ineffective utilization of multimodal information (36).

To improve MLLMs' comprehension of such data, one effective approach is the use of text-based question-answer pairs to redraw geometric figures, thereby enhancing their understanding of geometric problems (37). This approach essentially transforms multimodal data into pure textual information, making it more accessible for MLLMs. Moreover, several other strategies have been employed to boost MLLMs' problem-solving capabilities: the introduction of skill example repositories (38), fine-tuning models using chart data embedded in mathematical problems (39). Additionally, designing reasoning path retrieval methods suitable for multimodal mathematical problems is crucial for MLLMs. These methods include tree-based multimodal reasoning path searches (40) and guided extraction of key information tailored for solving lengthy mathematical problems (41). These methods have improved MLLMs' understanding and problem-solving abilities in mathematics, but we believe it is even more crucial to integrate these reasoning results effectively into mathematics education and tutoring(42). Therefore, an approach that complements these studies is still needed to provide learners with a multimodal learning experience.

## 3 MathBoard

Many existing studies focus on enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs in solving mathematical problems. However, our research emphasizes improving the learning experience and reducing cognitive load by utilizing a visualized BW. To this end, we developed the MathBoard. In real-world classrooms, mathematics instructors frequently provide verbal explanations in tandem with BW illustrations to guide students through problem-solving processes. For example, a teacher might say, "Notice that we need to borrow from the tens place to the ones place. This changes the tens digit from 4 to 3, and the ones digit from 3 to 13, like this." Simultaneously, the teacher would draw an arrow on the whiteboard from the tens to the ones place, alter the 4 in the tens place to 3, and update the 3 in the ones place to 13. While current methodologies predominantly focus on enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities, they lack mechanisms for progressive BW generation. We illustrate this process in Figure 1, where Figures 1(a), 1(b), and 1(c) present the detailed reasoning pathways employed by LLMs, human teachers, and the proposed MathBoard, respectively, during mathematical problem-solving.

In detail, MathBoard first generates the reasoning process for a given mathematical problem, producing both the reasoning steps and the correct solution while simultaneously querying the current BW content and conversation history. These components are then used for cross-modal reasoning. If responding to the problem for the first time, the system creates a new BW; otherwise, it updates the existing BW, enabling a progressive generation of the visual content. This iterative process results in a synchronized update of both the BW and the verbal response, which together help learners independently resolve the mathematical problem. It is important to clarify that the proposed method is orthogonal to existing approaches aimed at enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. These existing methods can be effectively applied during the initial reasoning process conducted by MathBoard, facilitating the attainment of more accurate answers and a more detailed reasoning steps. Subsequently, MathBoard can integrate these components for the ensuing cross-modal BW reasoning.

Additionally, Figure 1(d) presents the user interface of the MathBoard, comprising three main sections: the Board Writing Area, Chat Area, and Input Question Area. Learners input mathematical problems in the Input Question Area and interact with the MathBoard in the Chat Area. With each system response, both the verbal response and the updated BW are synchronously provided, with the verbal response displayed in the Chat Area and the BW update rendered in the Board Writing Area. Learners can continue interacting with MathBoard via the Chat Area until the problem is fully resolved. Detailed information regarding the case study of MathBoard can be found in Appendix A.

Design of experiments

The study used the Educational Technology Acceptance & Satisfaction Model (ETAS-M)(43) to design a questionnaire, assessing system performance, including improvements in learning efficiency, speed of task completion, and ease of understanding complex concepts. The study also discussed the accuracy of the information provided by the system, the design of the operation interface, and stability, as well as the role of the system in promoting student interaction, group activity participation, and improvement in understanding. Further details regarding the experiment can be found in Appendix B.

## 5 Results

### Reliability and Validity Analysis

The reliability analysis of the subjects' scale data yielded a Cronbach's alpha of 0.947 for the entire scale, which consists of 30 questions, indicating good internal consistency and suggesting that the subjects' understanding of the scale was consistent. The Cronbach's alpha values decreased after the deletion of all question items except for the dialog rounds interaction data, indicating that no questions needed to be eliminated. Furthermore, to analyze the overall validity of the scale, the agreement between each item and the total was assessed using Pearson's correlation coefficient, all of which were positively correlated. Generally, a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 is considered high, greater than 0.4 is moderate, and greater than 0.2 is low. In this set of 30 questions, a total of 20 items showed high correlation, and 6 items showed moderate correlation, indicating that the scale has high internal consistency and both analytical reliability and validity.

### Evaluation of MathBoard

To investigate the actual pedagogical effectiveness and subject acceptance of the scheme proposed in this study, data from two groups of experimental subjects on ten dimensions were cross-analyzed. Group A is the control group, which uses only text interaction for math learning, and Group B is the experimental group that uses cross-modal MathBoard learning. The analysis results show that Group B scored higher than Group A on all dimensions, indicating that the visual presentation and communication approach enhances students' willingness to participate in group activities and construct knowledge in authentic contexts. To further explore the effectiveness of the program, independent samples t-tests were conducted on the dimensions of the experimental and control groups. The results show that the social constructivism dimension reached statistical significance (p=0.010), indicating that the system can significantly promote students' willingness to communicate and can be used as an auxiliary tool for students' group activities and team discussions during their studies.

### Acceptance Variability Analysis

To further investigate whether the acceptance of the cross-modal interactive tutoring scheme proposed in this study varies among groups with different characteristics, data on the teaching experience and gender of the subjects were collected. This was done to explore and analyze whether these variables influence the teaching effectiveness of the platform. Regarding the gender variable, independent samples t-tests were conducted on the scores of male and female subject groups across different dimensions. The results indicate that there are no significant differences between the two gender groups on any dimension, suggesting that the platform's effectiveness is consistent across different genders, with no gender bias present. Additionally, for teaching experience, a one-way ANOVA was conducted with teaching experience (1-7) as the independent variable. It was found that there are no significant differences across different teaching experience groups on any dimension. This suggests that both experienced and less experienced groups show no significant difference in acceptance of the platform. In summary, it can be concluded that the platform does not produce biased effects on different subject groups.

## 6 Discussion and conclusion

This study, through comparative analysis, found that Group B, which used cross-modal learning tools, performed better than Group A across various learning dimensions. This result supports the cross-modal Learning Theory, which posits that the combination of visual and textual elements can enhance learners' information processing and memory retention capabilities. Additionally, the Social Constructivism theory also explains Group B's superior performance, emphasizing the role of social interaction and cultural tools in knowledge construction. The study also pointed out that although cross-modal learning tools have significant advantages in promoting communication and collaboration, their effects may not be as pronounced in other areas, such as information quality or system quality.

The study offers recommendations for educational practice, highlighting the importance of integrating cross-modal learning tools into instructional design to enhance student engagement and motivation. It also suggests that educational policymakers consider investing in cross-modal learning technology when allocating resources and support the promotion of these tools through teacher training and curriculum development. These tools can not only supplement traditional teaching methods but also provide students with a richer learning experience.

Although the study's results are enlightening, there are some limitations, such as the small sample size that may affect the generalizability of the findings, and the study mainly focused on short-term learning outcomes. Future research should expand the sample size, explore the long-term effects of cross-modal learning tools in different subjects and educational environments, and how to promote the effective integration and application of these tools through educational policies and teacher professional development. Through these efforts, a better understanding of the potential of cross-modal learning tools can be achieved, and they can be utilized to enhance educational quality and the learning experience.
