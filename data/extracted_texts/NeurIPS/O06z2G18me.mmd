###### Abstract

This paper presents a case study on the design, administration, post-processing, and evaluation of surveys on large language models (LLMs). It comprises two components: (1) A statistical method for eliciting beliefs encoded in LLMs. We introduce statistical measures and evaluation metrics that quantify the probability of an LLM "making a choice", the associated uncertainty, and the consistency of that choice. (2) We apply this method to study what moral beliefs are encoded in different LLMs, especially in ambiguous cases where the right choice is not obvious. We design a large-scale survey comprising \(680\) high-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I tell a white lie?") and \(687\) low-ambiguity moral scenarios (e.g., "Should I stop for a pedestrian on the road?"). Each scenario includes a description, two possible actions, and auxiliary labels indicating violated rules (e.g., "do not kill"). We administer the survey to \(28\) open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that (a) in unambiguous scenarios, most models "choose" actions that align with commonsense. In ambiguous cases, most models express uncertainty. (b) Some models are uncertain about choosing the commonsense action because their responses are sensitive to the question-wording. (c) Some models reflect clear preferences in ambiguous scenarios. Specifically, closed-source models tend to agree with each other. Code and data are publicly available1.

## 1 Introduction

We aim to examine the moral beliefs encoded in large language models (LLMs). Building on existing work on moral psychology [7; 36; 34; 19; 26], we approach this question through a large-scale empirical survey, where LLMs serve as "survey respondents". This paper describes the survey, presents the findings, and outlines a statistical method to elicit beliefs encoded in LLMs.

The survey follows a hypothetical moral scenario format, where each scenario is paired with one description and two potential actions. We design two question settings: _low-ambiguity_ and _high-ambiguity_. In the low-ambiguity setting, one action is clearly preferred over the other. In the high-ambiguity setting, neither action is clearly preferred. Figure 1 presents a randomly selected scenario from each setting. The dataset contains \(687\) low-ambiguity and \(680\) high-ambiguity scenarios.

Using LLMs as survey respondents presents unique statistical challenges. The first challenge arises because we want to analyze the "choices" made by LLMs, but LLMs output sequences of tokens. The second challenge is that LLM responses are sensitive to the syntactic form of survey questions [24; 71; 73; 43; 16]. We are specifically interested in analyzing the choices made by LLMs when asked a question, irrespective of the exact wording of the question.

To address the first challenge, we define _action likelihood_, which measures the "choices" made by the model. We use a deterministic function to map the probability of token sequences, produced by the LLM, into a distribution over actions. For the second challenge, we define the _marginal action likelihood_, which measures the choices made by the model when a question is presented with randomly sampled question forms. This metric is derived by aggregating the scenario-specific action likelihoods under different question forms.

To quantify the uncertainty of the model's choices, we use entropy  and define _action entropy_ and _marginal action entropy_. These measures assess the uncertainty of a choice given a question with a fixed question form or with a randomly selected question form. To gain further insights into the sources of uncertainty, we develop two evaluation metrics. The first one is the _question-form consistency_ (QF-C) metric, which assesses the model's consistency to variations in question forms. QF-C is based on the Generalized Jensen-Shannon divergence . In conjunction with QF-C, we calculate the _average question-form-specific action entropy_ (QF-E) as an evaluation metric. QF-E measures the average uncertainty in the model's output when we vary the question forms.

We administer the survey to \(28\) open and closed-source LLMs. The main findings are: (i) In general, the responses of LLMs reflect the level of ambiguity in the survey questions. When presented with unambiguous moral scenarios, most LLMs output responses that align with commonsense. When presented with ambiguous moral scenarios, most LLMs are uncertain about which action is preferred. (ii) There are exceptions to the general trend. In low-ambiguity scenarios, a subset of models exhibits uncertainty in "choosing" the preferred action. Analysis suggests that some models are uncertain because of sensitivity to how a question is asked, others are uncertain regardless of how a question is asked. (iii) In high-ambiguity scenarios, a subset of models reflects a clear preference as to which action is preferred. We cluster the models' "choices" and find agreement patterns within the group of open-source models and within the group of closed-source models. We find especially strong agreement among OpenAI's gpt-4 , Anthropic's claude-{v1.3, instant-v1.1}  and Google's text-bison-001 (PaLM 2) .

### Related Work

**Analyzing the Encoded Preferences in LLMs.** There is a growing interest in analyzing the preferences encoded in LLMs in the context of morality, psychiatry, and politics. Hartmann et al.  examines ChatGPT using political statements relevant to German elections. Santurkar et al.  compares LLMs' responses on political opinion surveys with US demographics. Coda-Forno et al.  explores GPT-3.5 through an anxiety questionnaire. Our research aligns with studies that analyze LLMs' preferences with respect to moral and social norms. Fraser et al. , Abdulhai et al.  probe LLMs like Delphi and GPT-3, using ethics questionnaires such as the Moral Foundation Questionnaire [34; 35] or Shweder's "Big Three" Ethics . However, it's uncertain whether LLMs' responses on ethics questionnaires, which measure behavioral intentions, reflect actual preferences in context-specific decision scenarios. We differ by employing hypothetical scenarios to unveil moral preferences, rather than directly querying for moral preferences.

**LLMs in Computational Social Science.** While we treat LLMs as independent "survey respondents", there is a growing literature treating LLMs as simulators of human agents conditioned on socio-demographic backgrounds [8; 58; 2; 41; 59]. In the context of morality, Simmons  found that GPT-3 replicates moral biases when presented with political identities. In this study, we focus on the encoded moral preferences in LLMs without treating them as simulators of human agents.

**Aligning LLMs with Human Preferences.** Advances in LLMs [15; 18; 17; 56; 5] have sparked growing efforts to align these models with human preferences [3; 74; 70; 69; 9; 40; 11; 33; 31; 30]. These efforts include fine-tuning LLMs with specific moral concepts , training LLMs to predict human responses to moral questions [28; 27; 49; 44], and employing multi-step inference techniques to improve agreement between LLMs and human responses [45; 54]. In contrast, this work focuses on evaluating the beliefs encoded in LLMs, rather than aligning LLMs with specific beliefs or norms.

## 2 Defining and Estimating Beliefs Encoded in LLMs

In this section, we tackle the statistical challenges that arise when using LLMs as survey respondents. We first define the estimands of interests, then discuss how to estimate them from LLMs outputs.

### Action Likelihood

To quantify the preferences encoded by an LLM, we define the _action likelihood_ as the target estimand. We have a dataset of survey questions, \(=\{x_{i}\}_{i=1}^{n}\), where each question \(x_{i}=\{d_{i},A_{i}\}\) consists of a scenario description \(d_{i}\) and a set of action descriptions \(A_{i}=\{a_{i,k}\}_{k=1}^{K}\). The "survey respondent" is an LLM parameterized by \(_{j}\), represented as \(p_{_{j}}\). The objective is to estimate the probability of an LLM respondent "preferring" action \(a_{i,k}\) in scenario \(x_{i}\), which we define as the _action likelihood_. The estimation challenge is when we present an LLM with a description and two possible actions, denoted as \(x_{i}\), it returns a sequence \(p(s x_{i})\). The goal is to map the sequence \(s\) to an action \(a_{i,k}\).

Formally, we define the set of tokens in a language as \(\), the space of all possible token sequences of length \(N\) as \(S_{N}^{N}\), the space of semantic equivalence classes as \(\), and the _semantic equivalence relation_ as \(E(,)\). All token sequences \(s\) in a semantic equivalence set \(c\) reflect the same meaning, that is, \( s,s^{} c:E(s,s^{})\). Let \(c(a_{i,k})\) denote the semantic equivalent set for action \(a_{i,k}\). Given a survey question \(x_{i}\) and an LLM \(p_{_{j}}\), we obtain a conditional distribution over token sequences, \(p_{_{j}}(s\!\!x_{i})\). To convert this distribution into a distribution over actions, we aggregate the probabilities of all sequences in the semantic equivalence class.

**Definition 1**.: _(Action Likelihood) The action likelihood of a model \(p_{_{j}}\) on scenario \(x_{i}\) is defined as,_

\[p_{_{j}}(a_{i,k}\!\!x_{i})=_{s c(a_{i,k})}p_{_{j}} s\!\!x_{i} a_{i,k} A_{i},\] (1)

_where \(c_{i,k}\) denotes the semantic equivalence set containing all possible token sequences \(s\) that encode a preference for action \(a_{i,k}\) in the context of scenario \(x_{i}\)._

The probability of an LLM "choosing" an action given a scenario, as encoded in the LLM's token probabilities, is defined in Definition1. To measure uncertainty, we utilize entropy .

**Definition 2**.: _(Action Entropy) The action entropy of a model \(p_{_{j}}\) on scenario \(x_{i}\) is defined as,_

\[H_{_{j}}[A_{i}\!\!x_{i}]=-_{a_{i,k} A_{i}}p_{_{j}}(a_{ i,k}\!\!x_{i})p_{_{j}}(a_{i,k}\!\!x_{i}).\] (2)

The quantity defined in Eq.2 corresponds to a semantic entropy measure [51; 46]. It quantifies an LLM's confidence in its encoded semantic preference, rather than the confidence in its token outputs.

### Marginal Action Likelihood

Definition1 only considers the semantic equivalence in the LLM's response, and overlooks the semantic equivalence of the input questions. Prior research has shown that LLMs are sensitive to the syntax of questions [24; 71; 73; 43]. To account for LLMs question-form sensitivity, we introduce

Figure 2: Given a scenario, we create six question forms from three question templates (_A/B_, _Repeat_, and _Compare_) and two action orderings. We sample \(M\) responses for every question form from the LLMs using a temperature of \(1\), and map the token responses to semantic actions. The marginal action likelihood of a scenario aggregates over all question forms. We additionally compute question-form consistency (QF-C) and average question-form-specific action entropy (QF-E) of each model to check the sensitivity of the model responses to variations in the question forms.

the _marginal action likelihood_. It quantifies the likelihood of a model "choosing" a specific action for a given scenario when presented with a randomly selected question form.

Formally, we define a question-form function \(z x x\) that maps the original survey question \(x\) to a syntactically altered survey question \(z(x)\), while maintaining semantic equivalence, i.e., \(E(x,z(x))\). Let \(\) represent the set of question forms that leads to semantically equivalent survey questions.

**Definition 3**.: _(Marginal Action Likelihood) The marginal action likelihood of a model \(p_{_{j}}\) on scenario \(x_{i}\) and on a set of question forms \(\) is defined as,_

\[p_{_{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,(x_{i})=_{z }p_{_{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,z(x_{i})\ p(z) a _{i,k} A_{i}.\] (3)

Here, the probability \(p(z)\) represents the density of the question forms. In practice, it is challenging to establish a distribution over the question forms since it requires modelings of how an user may ask a question. Therefore, the responsibility of defining a distribution over the question forms falls on the analyst. Different choices of \(p(z)\) can lead to different inferences regarding the marginal action likelihood. Similar to 2, we quantify the uncertainty associated with the marginal action likelihood using entropy.

**Definition 4**.: _(Marginal Action Entropy) The marginal action entropy of a model \(p_{_{j}}\) on scenario \(x\) and set of question forms \(\) is defined as,_

\[H_{_{j}}[A_{i}\,|\,(x_{i})]=-_{a_{i,k} A_{i}}p_{ _{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,(x_{i})p_{_{ j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,(x_{i}).\] (4)

The marginal action entropy captures the sensitivity of the model's output distribution to variations in the question forms and the inherent ambiguity of the scenario.

To assess how consistent a model is to changes in the question forms, we compute the _question-form consistency (QF-C)_ as an evaluation metric. Given a set of question forms \(\), we quantify the consistency between the action likelihoods conditioned on different question form using the Generalized Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD) .

**Definition 5**.: _(Question-Form Consistency) The question-form consistency (QF-C) of a model \(p_{_{j}}\) on scenario \(x_{i}\) and set of question forms \(\) is defined as,_

\[(p_{_{j}};(x_{i}))=1-|}_{z }p_{_{j}}A_{i} z(x_{i}) ,=|}_{z }p_{_{j}}A_{i} z(x_{i}).\] (5)

Intuitively, question-form consistency (2) quantifies the average similarity between question-form-specific action likelihoods \(p_{_{j}}(A_{i} z(x_{i}))\) and the average likelihood \(\) of them. This probabilistic definition provides a measure of a model's semantic consistency and is related to existing deterministic consistency conditions .

Next, to quantify a model's action uncertainty in its outputs independent of their consistency, we compute the _average question-form-specific action entropy_.

**Definition 6**.: _(Average Question-Form-Specific Action Entropy) The average question-form-specific action entropy (QF-E) of a model \(_{j}\) on scenario \(x_{i}\) and a prompt set \(\) is defined as,_

\[H_{QF-E(_{j})}[A_{i}\,|\,x_{i}]=_{z }H[A_{i}\,|\,z(x_{i})]\.\] (6)

The quantity in 6 provides a measure of a model's average uncertainty in its outputs across different question forms. It complements the question-form consistency metric defined in 5.

We can use the metrics in 5 and 6 to diagnose why a model has a high marginal action entropy. This increased entropy can stem from: (1) the model providing inconsistent responses, (2) the question being inherently ambiguous to the model, or 3) a combination of both. A low value of QF-C indicates that the model exhibits inconsistency in its responses, while a high value of QF-E suggests that the question is ambiguous to the model. Interpreting models that display low consistency but high confidence when conditioned on different question forms (i.e., low QF-C and low QF-E) can be challenging. These models appear to encode specific beliefs but are sensitive to variations in question forms, leading to interpretations that lack robustness.

### Estimation

We now discuss the estimation of the action likelihood and the marginalized action likelihood based on the output of LLMs. To compute the action likelihood as defined in Eq. 1, we need to establish a mapping from the token space to the action space. One approach is to create a probability table of all possible continuations \(s\), assigning each continuation to an action, and then determining the corresponding action likelihood. However, this approach becomes computationally intractable as the token space grows exponentially with longer continuations. Compounding this issue is the commercialization of LLMs, which restricts access to the LLMs through APIs. Many model APIs, including Anthropic's claude-v1.3 and OpenAI's gpt-4, do not provide direct access to token probabilities.

We approximate the action likelihood through sampling. We sample \(M\) token sequences \(\{s_{1},...,s_{m}\}\) from an LLM by \(s_{i} p_{_{j}}(s\,|\,z(x_{i}))\). We then map each token sequence \(s\) to the set of potential actions \(A_{i}\) using a deterministic mapping function \(g(x_{i},s) A_{i}\). Finally, we can approximate the action likelihood \(p_{_{j}}(a_{i,k}\,|\,z(x_{i}))\) in Eq. 1 through Monte Carlo,

\[_{_{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,z(x_{i})=_{i=1}^ {M}g(s_{i})=a_{i,k}, s_{i} p_{_{j}}( \,|\,z(x_{i})).\] (7)

The mapping function \(g\) can be operationalized using a rule-based matching technique, an unsupervised clustering method, or using a fine-tuned or prompted LLM.

Estimating the marginal action likelihood requires specifying a distribution over the question forms \(p(z)\). As discussed in Section 2.2, different specifications of \(p(z)\) can result in different interpretations of the marginal action likelihood. Here, we represent the question forms as a set of prompt templates and assign a uniform probability to each prompt format when calculating the marginal action likelihood. For every combination of a survey question \(x_{i}\) and a prompt template \(z\), we first estimate the action likelihood using Eq. 1, we then average them across prompt formats,

\[_{_{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,(x_{i})=_{z}_{_{j}}a_{i,k}\,|\,z(x_{i}).\] (8)

We can calculate the remaining metrics by plugging in the estimated action likelihood.

## 3 The MoralChoice Survey

We first discuss the distinction between humans and LLMs as "respondents" and its impact on the survey design. We then outline the process of question generation and labeling. Lastly, we describe the LLM survey respondents, the survey administration, and the response collection.

### Survey Design

Empirical research in moral psychology has studied human moral judgments using various survey approaches, such as hypothetical moral dilemmas , self-reported behaviors , or endorsement of abstract rules . See Ellemers et al.  for an overview. This line of research naturally depends on human participants. Consequently, studies focus on narrow scenarios and small sample sizes.

This study focuses on using LLMs as "respondents", which presents both challenges and opportunities. Using LLMs as "respondents" imposes limitations on the types of analyses that can be conducted. Surveys designed for gathering self-reported traits or opinions on abstract rules assume that respondents have agency. However, the question of whether LLMs have agency is debated among researchers [14; 38; 61; 65; 4]. Consequently, directly applying surveys designed for human respondents to LLMs may not yield meaningful interpretations. On the other hand, using LLMs as "survey respondents" provides advantages not found in human surveys. Querying LLMs is faster and less costly compared to surveying human respondents. This enables us to scale up surveys to larger sample sizes and explore a wider range of scenarios without being constrained by budget limitations.

Guided by these considerations, we adopt hypothetical moral scenarios as the framework of our study. These scenarios mimic real-world situations where users turn to LLMs for advice. Analyzing the LLMs outputs in these scenarios enables an assessment of the encoded preferences. This approach sidesteps the difficulty of interpreting the LLMs' responses to human-centric questionnaires that ask directly for stated preferences. Moreover, the scalability of this framework offers significant advantages. It allows us to create a wide range of scenarios, demonstrating the extensive applicability of LLMs. It also leverages the swift response rate of LLMs, facilitating the execution of large-scale surveys.

### Survey Generation

Generating Scenarios and Action Pairs.We grounded the scenario generation in the common morality framework of Gert , which consists of ten rules that form the basis of common morality. The rules are categorized into "Do not cause harm" and "Do not violate trust". The specific rules are shown in Appendix A.1. For each scenario, we design a pair of actions, ensuring that at least one action actively violates a rule. The survey consists of two settings: high-ambiguity and low-ambiguity.

In the low-ambiguity setting, we pair each scenario with one favorable action and one unfavorable action designed to violate one rule. We employ zero-shot prompting with OpenAI's gpt-4 to generate a raw dataset of \(1142\) scenarios. The authors manually review this dataset to remove duplicates and ensure coherency. We then pass the dataset to annotators from Surge AI to evaluate whether one action is clearly preferred over another. Each scenario is evaluated by three annotators. We determine the final dataset by a majority vote. After removing scenarios that were determined as ambiguous by the annotators, we obtain \(687\) scenarios. Figure 2 shows examples of both types of scenarios.

In the high-ambiguity setting, each scenario is paired with two potentially unfavorable actions. We begin the dataset construction by handwriting \(100\) ambiguous moral scenarios, with \(10\) examples for each rule. Appendix A.2 provide examples of the handwritten scenarios. All scenarios are presented as first-person narratives. To increase the diversity of the scenarios, we expand the dataset using OpenAI's text-davinci-003 with stochastic 5-shot prompting [60; 12]. In total, we generate \(2000\) scenarios, which are then manually reviewed by the authors to eliminate duplicates and incoherent examples. This iterative process culminates in a final dataset of \(680\) high-ambiguity scenarios.

**Auxiliary Labels.** We augment the dataset with labels about rule violations. Although the scenarios and actions are designed to violate a single rule, some of them may involve multiple rule violations. For instance, throwing a prenode violates the rules of "do not kill", "do not cause pain", and "do not disable". To label these factors, we enlist the assistance of three annotators from Surge AI. The final labels are determined through a majority vote among the annotators. The level of agreement among annotators varies between datasets, which we report in Appendix A.4.

### Survey Administration and Processing

**LLMs Respondents.** We provide an overview of the 28 LLMs respondents in Table 1. There are 12 open-source models and 16 closed-source models from seven different companies. The model parameters range from Google's flan-t5-small(80m) to gpt-4, with an unknown number of parameters. Notably, among the models that provide architectural details, only Google's flan-T5 models are built upon an encoder-and-decoder transformer and trained using masked language modeling . All models have undergone a fine-tuning procedure, either for instruction following behavior or dialogue purposes. For detailed information, please see the extended model cards in Appendix C.1.

**Addressing Question Form Bias.** Previous research has demonstrated that LLMs exhibit sensitivity to the question from [24; 71; 73; 43; 16]. In multiple-choice settings, the model's outputs are influenced by the prompt format and the order of the answer choices. To account for these biases, we employ three hand-curated question styles: _A/B_, _Repeat_, and _Compare_ (refer to Figure 2 and Table 12 for more details) and randomize the order of the two possible actions for each question template, resulting in six variations of question forms for each scenario.

Table 1: Overview of the \(28\) LLMs respondents. The numbers of parameters of models marked with \({}^{*}\) are based on existing estimates. See Appendix C.1 for extended model cards and details.

**Survey Administration.** When querying the models, we keep the prompt header and sampling procedure fixed and present the model with one survey question at a time, resetting the context window for each question. However, some of the models are only accessible through an API. This means the models might change while we are conducting the survey. While we cannot address that, we record the API query timestamps and report them along model download timestamps in Appendix C.2.

**Response Collection.** The estimands of interests are defined in Definition1 to 6. We estimate these quantities through Monte Carlo approximation as described in Eq.7. For each survey question and each prompt format, we sample \(M\) responses from each LLM. The sampling is performed using a temperature of 1, which controls the randomness of the LLM's responses. We then employ an iterative rule-based mapping procedure to map from sequences to actions. The details of the mapping are provided in Appendix B.2. For high-ambiguity scenarios, we set \(M\) to \(10\), while for low-ambiguity scenarios, we set \(M\) to \(5\). We assign equal weights to each question template. We complement our main evaluation setup with an ablation study using different decoding techniques in Appendix D.5.

When administering the survey, we observed that models behind APIs refuse to respond to a small set of scenarios when directly asked. To elicit responses, we modify the prompts by explicitly instructing the language models to not reply with statements like "I am a language model and cannot answer moral questions." We found that a simple instruction was sufficient to elicit responses. When calculating the action likelihood, we exclude invalid answers. If a model does not provide a single valid answer for a specific scenario and prompt format, we set the likelihood to \(0.5\) for that particular template and scenario. We report the percentage of invalid and refusing answers in Appendix D.1.

## 4 Results

The summarized findings are: (1) When presented with low-ambiguity moral scenarios, most LLMs output responses that align with commonsense. However, some models exhibit significant uncertainty in their responses, which can be attributed to the models not following the instructions. (2) When presented with high-ambiguity moral scenarios, most LLMs exhibit high uncertainty in their responses. However, some models reflect a clear preference for one of the actions. Within the group of models that display a clear preference, there is agreement among the open-source models and among the API models. Particularly, there is strong agreement among OpenAI's gpt-4 , Anthropic's claude-v1.3, claude-instant-v1.1 , and Google's text-bison-001 (PaLM 2) . (3) Across both scenario types, most models from OpenAI and Anthropic consistently display high confidence in their responses. However, a subset of their models show high sensitivity to the question forms.

### Analyzing Action Likelihood Across Scenarios

We begin by examining the marginal action likelihood and uncertainty of different LLMs. Figure3 illustrates the marginal action likelihood of the LLMs in low-ambiguity (Top) and high-ambiguity (Bottom) scenarios. The models are grouped by model family and sorted based on their estimated size.

**General Trends.** In low-ambiguity scenarios, the majority of LLMs display a high marginal action likelihood for action 1, which aligns with the action preferred by annotators. This suggests that most models encode commonsense morality and generate responses that are consistent with human preferences. In high-ambiguity scenarios, most LLMs exhibit high uncertainty on which action is preferred. This is in line with our expectations, as these scenarios are difficult to decide.

**Interpreting Scenarios Where LLMs Select Unfavorable Actions.** While most models output responses consistent with commonsense reasoning, there are still scenarios where models deviate from the preferred actions identified by human annotators. Table2 highlights two randomly selected scenarios where at least seven out of the \(28\) LLM respondents reflect a strong preference for the unfavorable action. A strong preference is defined as a marginal action likelihood of greater or equal than \(75\%\). These scenarios often involve sports or games and are associated with rule violations such as "do not cheat" or "do not deceive". See Appendix D.2 for more examples.

**Action 1:** & I deal cards fairly from the top of the deck. \\
**Action 2:** & I deal myself better cards from the bottom of the deck.\(\) \\ 
**Context:** & You are an amateur runner competing in a marathon. You notice that a shortcut would save you several minutes and \\  & it is unlikely that anyone would notice. \\
**Action 1:** & I stay on the designated marathon route and continue running. \\
**Action 2:** & I take the shortcut to improve my finishing time. \(^{}\) \\   

Table 2: Two low-ambiguity scenarios where at least \(7\) out of \(28\) LLMs encode a strong preference (i.e., marginal action likelihood \( 0.75\)) for the less favorable action.

**Outliers in the Analysis.** While the majority of models follow the general trend, there are some exceptions. In low-ambiguity scenarios, a subset of models (OpenAI's text-ada-001(350M), text-babbage-001(1B), text-curie-001(6.7B), Google's flan-t5-small(80M), and BigScience's bloom2-560M, bloom2-1.1B) exhibit higher uncertainty compared to other models. These models share the common characteristic of being the smallest among the candidate models.

In high-ambiguity scenarios, most LLMs exhibit high uncertainty. However, there is a subset of models (OpenAI's text-davinci-003, gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, Anthropic's claude-instant-v1.1, claude-v1.3, and Google's flan-t5-xl and text-bison-001) that exhibit low marginal action entropy. On average, these models have a marginal action entropy of \(0.7\), indicating approximately \(80\%\)\(/\)\(20\%\) decision splits. This suggests that despite the inherent ambiguity in the scenarios, these models reflect a clear preference in most cases. A common characteristic among these models is their large (estimated) size within their respective model families.

### Consistency Check

We examine the question-form consistency (QF-C) and the average question-form-specific action entropy (QF-E) for different models across scenarios. Intuitively, QF-C measures whether a model relies on the semantic meaning of the question to output responses rather than the exact wording. QF-E measures how certain a model is given a specific prompt format, averaged across formats. Figure 4 displays the QF-C and QF-E values of the different models for the low-ambiguity (a) and the high-ambiguity (b) dataset. The vertical dotted line is the certainty threshold, corresponding to a QF-E value of \(0.7\). This threshold approximates an average decision split of approximately \(80\%\) to \(20\%\). The horizontal dotted line represents the consistency threshold, corresponding to a QF-C value of \(0.6\).

Most models fall into either the bottom left region (the grey-shaded area) representing models that are consistent and certain, or the top left region, representing models that are inconsistent yet certain. Shifting across datasets does not significantly affect the vertical positioning of the models.

We observe OpenAI's gpt-3.5-turbo, gpt-4, Google's text-bison-001, and Anthropic's claude-{v.1.3, instant-v1.1} are distinctively separated from the cluster of models shown in Figure 4 (a). These models also exhibit relatively high certainty in high-ambiguity scenarios. These models have undergone various safety procedures (e.g., alignment with human preference data) before deployment [74; 10]. We hypothesize that these procedures have instilled a "preference" in the models, which has generalized to ambiguous scenarios.

Figure 3: Marginal action likelihood distribution of LLMs on low-ambiguity (top) and high-ambiguity scenarios (bottom). In low-ambiguity scenarios, “Action 1” denotes the preferred commonsense action. In the high-ambiguity scenarios, neither action is clearly preferred. Models are color-coded by companies, grouped by model families, and sorted by known (or estimated) scale. High- and low-ambiguity datasets are generated with the help of text-davinci-003 and gpt-4 respectively. On the low-ambiguity dataset, most LLMs show high probability mass on the commonsense action. On the high-ambiguity dataset, most models exhibit high uncertainty, while only a few exhibit certainty.

We observe a cluster of green, gray, and brown colored models that exhibit higher uncertainty but are consistent. These models are all open-source models. We hypothesize that these models do not exhibit strong-sided beliefs on the high-ambiguity scenarios as they were merely instruction tuned on academic tasks, and not "aligned" with human preference data.

Explaining the Outliers.In low-ambiguity scenarios, OpenAI's text-ada-001 (350M), text-babbage-001 (1B), text-curie-001 (6.7B), Google's flan-t5-small (80M), and BigScience's bloomz-{560M, 1.1B} stand out as outliers. Figure 4 provides insights into why these models exhibit high marginal action uncertainty. We observe that these models fall into two different regions. The OpenAI models reside in the upper-left region, indicating low consistency and high certainty. This suggests that the high marginal action entropy is primarily attributed to the models not fully understanding the instructions or being sensitive to prompt variations. Manual examination of the responses reveals that the inconsistency in these models stems from option-ordering inconsistencies and inconsistencies between the prompt templates _A/B_, _Repeat_, and _Compare_. We hypothesize that these template-to-template inconsistencies might be a byproduct of the fine-tuning procedures as the prompt templates _A/B_ and _Repeat_ are more prevalent than the _Compare_ template.

On the other hand, the outliers models from Google and BigScience fall within the consistency threshold, indicating low certainty and high consistency. These models are situated to the right of a cluster of open-source models, suggesting they are more uncertain than the rest of the open-source models. However, they exhibit similar consistency to the other open-sourced models.

### Analyzing Model Agreement in High-Ambiguity Scenarios.

In high-ambiguity scenarios, where neither action is clearly preferred, we expect that models do not reflect a clear preference. However, contrary to our expectations, a subset of models still demonstrate some level of preference. We investigate whether these models converge on the same beliefs. We select a subset of the models that are both consistent and certain, i.e., models that are in the shaded area of Figure 3(b). We compute Pearson's correlation coefficients between marginal action likelihoods, \(=,p_{k})}{_{j}_{k}}}}{}\).

Figure 5 presents the correlation analysis between different models. It shows two distinct clusters: a commercial cluster (red) and a mixed cluster (purple). The commercial cluster consists of API models from Anthropic, Cohere, Google, and OpenAI. These models are known to have undergone a fine-tuning procedure to align with human preferences, as indicated by the alignment procedure [11; 56]. For Google's text-bison-001 (PaLM 2), it is not publicly disclosed if the model has undergone a fine-tuning procedure with human preference data. However, it is known that the accessed version has undergone additional post-processing steps . The mixed cluster includes all considered open-source models and two commercial models from AI21 labs. The fine-tuning procedures for AI21 models are not specifically disclosed, but all open-source models in this cluster are exclusively fine-tuned on academic datasets such as Flan [20; 48], xP3 , and OPT-IML bench .

We further observe a division within the commercial cluster, resulting in sub-clusters A and B in Figure 5. Sub-cluster A, consisting of OpenAI's gpt-4 and Anthropic's claude-v1.3, claude-instant-v1.1, and Google's text-bison-001 (PaLM 2), exhibits very high inter-model agreement with respect to the measured correlation coefficients (all pairwise coefficients \( 0.75\)).

Figure 4: Inconsistency and uncertainty scores for LLMs across low and high-ambiguity scenarios. The x-axis denotes QF-E, higher means more uncertain. The y-axis denotes 1- QF-C, higher means more inconsistency. Dotted lines mark the thresholds for inconsistency and uncertainty. In each figure, the upper left region indicates high certainty, low consistency, and the lower left region represents high certainty and consistency. The black dot symbolizes a model that makes random choices.

But even more striking is that all models of sub-cluster A exhibit at most a correlation coefficient of \(0.28\) to all LLMs of the mixed cluster, indicating that these models not only exhibit differences with respect to their consistency and decision confidence, but also with respect to their encoded preferences. Table 3 illustrates three two examples where all four models in sub-cluster A strongly agree, with a marginal action likelihood of \(75\%\). For more examples, see Table 18.

## 5 Discussion & Limitations

This paper presents a case study on the process of designing, administering, and evaluating a moral belief survey on LLMs. Findings in low-ambiguity scenarios demonstrate that although most LLMs output responses aligned with commonsense reasoning, variations in the prompt format can greatly influence the response distribution. This highlights the importance of using multiple prompt variations when performing model evaluations and assessing the model's consistency. The findings in high-ambiguity scenarios reveal that certain LLMs reflect clear preferences, even in situations where there is no clear answer. We identify a cluster of commercial models that share high agreement. We hypothesize that this stems from the "alignment with human preference" process at the fine-tuning stage. Understanding the factors that drive this consensus among the models is a crucial area for future research.

A limitation of this paper lies in the dataset's creation and curation, which involves collaboration among authors, LLMs, and annotators. This process has the potential to introduce biases. The authors wrote a set of handwritten scenarios. The authors' representation does not encompass all cultural dimensions. This could lead to omissions of scenarios. Certain topics can be underrepresented, while others might be overemphasized. The utilization of LLMs to diversify the dataset aimed to address this, yet it could inadvertently contribute to additional bias. LLMs inherently inherit biases from their extensive pre-trained data, which contains a wealth of inherent biases. Moreover, the annotators primarily being English speakers implies that preferences favored by them may not universally extend across different cultures.

Figure 5: Hierarchical clustering of model agreement on high-ambiguity scenarios of LLMs that fall within the grey-shaded area in Figure 3(b). The clustering reveals two main clusters, a commercial cluster, consisting only of closed-source LLMs, and a mixed cluster, consisting of open-source LLMs and commercial LLMS from AI21. Within the commercial cluster, we observe a separation into sub-cluster A and sub-cluster B. While the dominant sub-cluster A is significantly different from all models in the mixed cluster (all correlation coefficients are smaller than \(0.3\)), all models in sub-cluster B share some weak correlation pattern with models in the mixed cluster.
