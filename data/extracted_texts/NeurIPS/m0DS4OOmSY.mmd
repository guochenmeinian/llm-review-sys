###### Abstract

Model editing has become an increasingly popular method for efficiently updating knowledge within language models. Current approaches primarily focus on reliability, generalization, and locality, with many excelling across these criteria. Some recent studies have highlighted the potential pitfalls of these editing methods, such as knowledge distortion and conflicts. However, the general capabilities of post-edited language models remain largely _unexplored_. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of various editing methods across different language models, and have the following findings. (1) Existing editing methods inevitably lead to performance deterioration on general benchmarks, indicating that these methods can maintain the general capabilities of the model only within a limited number of edits. When the number of edits increases, the model's intrinsic knowledge structure may be disrupted or even completely destroyed. (2) Instruction-tuned models exhibit greater robustness to editing, showing less performance drop on general knowledge after editing. (3) Language models with larger scale are more resistant to editing compared to smaller models. (4) The safety of the edited models is significantly compromised, even for models that were originally safety-aligned. Our findings indicate that current editing methods are only suitable for small-scale knowledge updates within language models, which motivates further research on more practical and reliable editing methods. The details of code and reproduction can be found in F.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, large language model (LLM) like ChatGPT , Claude , and Llama [3; 4] have revolutionized the deep learning and demonstrated remarkable performance across various knowledge-intensive tasks [5; 6; 7]. However, the learned vast amount of knowledge in LLMs may be erroneous, harmful, or outdated . While directly fine-tuning an LLM on calibrated knowledge can help mitigate this problem, which is prohibitive due to hardware constraints and resource budget [9; 10; 11]. To this end, _model editing_[12; 13; 14] has been proposed to efficiently update knowledge within LLM. Current studies in editing [15; 16; 17; 18] target at enabling efficient yet precise model behavior alterations on specific knowledge samples in the form of triplet within LLMs like modifying the wrong tuple (Tim Cook, is the CEO of, Google) to the correct one (Tim Cook, is the CEO of, Apple) persistently.

The primary goal of model editing is to impact the predictions for related inputs termed editing scope  generally, _without_ influencing behaviors on unrelated knowledge samples. The assessment of an editing method typically involves evaluation along three dimensions [14; 12]. First and foremost, the _reliability_ aims to ascertain the capability of the post-edited model to recall the specific editing fact accurately. Second, the _generalization_ seeks to validate the adaptability of the edited model by assessing its ability to recall the editing fact under diverse paraphrase prompts. The last dimension _locality_ (a.k.a., specificity) is employed to verify the robustness of the edited model by examining whether its output for unrelated inputs remains consistent after editing. Existing knowledge editing methods like SERAC , ROME , MEMIT , and IKE  work well on these evaluation criteria across various datasets on different LLMs.

Despite these successes in editing language models, recent works [21; 22; 23; 24] have disclosed the inevitable pitfalls of existing editing methods from different perspectives such as knowledge distortion , and catastrophic forgetting . In sequential editing setting (see Section 2), as the number of edits increases, it is necessary to balance two aspects: the retention of the model's original knowledge and the preservation of newly acquired knowledge through updates. These two objectives are to some extent conflicting. The _general capabilities_ (Section 2) of LLMs is the foundation to solve the wide range of complex tasks. Changes in the model's general capabilities reflect the retention of its original knowledge. However, the general capabilities of post-edit language models are still _unexplored_, making current editing methods unreliable to be employed for real-world applications. Given this situation, it naturally motivates the following critical question to explore:

_How do sequential model editing affect the general abilities of language models?_

To close this gap, we make a comprehensive understanding and analysis of edited LLMs with various editing methods (In Section 3). In detail, we edit multiple LLMs with various editing methods and evaluate them across benchmarks to verify underlying factors that may affect the general abilities. It is worth noting that our focus is on the _general capabilities_ of the model (including world knowledge, reading comprehension, reasoning, safety, etc.), rather than the performance on _efficacy_, _generalization_ and _locality_ or downstream tasks like NER, QA, and NLI. These distinctions distinguish our work from some existing studies like [26; 25; 27]. Technically, we explore the impact of various underlying factors such as the number of edits, model scale, safety, different aspects of abilities, and instruction tuning on the general capabilities of edited LLMs after sequential editing.

The empirical results indicate that the majority of current editing methods do not significantly influence the fundamental capabilities of models within dozens of edits (Section 4.1). However, after nearly to hundred edits, some methods lead to rapid degradation, while other methods only slightly affect performance after several hundred edits or even thousands (MEND, PMET). When subjecting models to an extremely high number of edits (up to \(10k\)), we observe that the intrinsic knowledge structure of the models is thoroughly disrupted, leading to outputs of empty strings for any input. We refer to this phenomenon as the _muting effect_ in sequential language model editing.

Furthermore, we discovered that for the vast majority of current editing methods, the instruction-tuned models exhibit a slower rate of performance decline after edits (Section 4.2), and the smaller model is more vulnerable to deterioration caused by editing (Section 4.3). Moreover, results reveal that different model editing methods affect all aspects of a model's capabilities to a roughly equivalent extent (Section 4.4). Our research also explores the safety aspects of these edited models (Section 4.5), revealing that even with dozens of edits, safety can be compromised to a certain extent.

We hope our work can provide the research community with insightful perspectives to help advance studies in this field, systematically elucidating the impact of existing model editing methods on LLM. To the best of our knowledge, we are the _first_ to comprehensively evaluate and analyze the general capabilities of edited language models. Our main contributions are summarized as follows:

* We conducted a detailed evaluation of the impact of different model editing methods on the general capabilities of LLM across various numbers of edits. We found that existing model editing methods are only suitable for a limited number of edits, generally not exceeding several dozens.
* Empirically, extensive explorations with different editing approaches were conducted to verify potential factors affecting the fundamental capabilities of edited models. These insights are broadly applicable across different editing methods and various models.
* Our empirical studies with various editing methods across different models reveal that even with only dozens of edits, the safety of LLMs can be compromised to a certain extent.
* Technically, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the side effects, operational efficiency, and deployment of edited LLM, and discussed their practical use in production.

## 2 Preliminary

In this section, we provide comprehensive preliminaries of model editing and LLM evaluation.

Model Editing.Model editing (also known as knowledge editing) aims to precisely adjust the behaviors of a language model \(M_{}\) on some facts without influencing unrelated samples. Current works focus on editing knowledge tuple \(t=(s,r,o)\). The editing process inserts new tuples \((s,r,o^{*})\) in place of the current tuple \((s,r,o)\), where these two share the same \(s\) and \(r\). An editing operation is denoted as \(e=(s,r,o,o^{*})\) for brevity. Given \(n\) fact tuples \(T^{*}=(t_{1}^{*},t_{2}^{*},,t_{n}^{*})\) where \(t_{i}^{*}=(s_{i},r_{i},o_{i}^{*}),i=1,2,,n\), and a model \(M_{}\), model editing yields an edited language model \(M_{}^{e}\) via editing operations \(=\{e_{1},e_{2},\}\), where \(M_{}^{e}(s_{j},r_{j})=o_{j}^{*}\) if \(t_{j}=(s_{j},r_{j},o_{j}^{*}) T^{*}\), else \(M_{}^{e}(s_{j},r_{j})=o_{j}\). To evaluate model editing methods, current works focus on three dimensions: _reliability_, _generalization_, and _locality_. Please refer to Section 6 for a comprehensive survey.

General Capabilities of Language Models.In recent years, the field of LLM has experienced rapid growth, leading to the development of numerous models by various research institutions. These models differ significantly in terms of parameter size, architecture, corpora, and training methodologies. Consequently, it has become critically important to evaluate the capabilities of these models objectively, and comprehensively. Typically, this is achieved by evaluating the models on widely adopted benchmarks like MMLU , and BigBench  to compare their performance with their counterparts. Currently, the evaluation of the general capabilities of LLMs in both academia and industry focuses on several key areas: world knowledge, common sense reasoning, coding, reading comprehension, mathematical skills, and performance on mainstream benchmark datasets [30; 3; 4; 31; 32; 33]. This paper concentrates on the impact of editing on the inherent capabilities of LLM, rather than on downstream tasks like QA, NER, and NLI in work .

Model Editing Evaluation.The current evaluation protocol of model editing involves updating a model's knowledge, assessing the post-edit model, and restoring the update before editing. However, in real-world applications like _sequential editing_, models are expected to maintain preceding modifications before performing new edits. Scaling sequential editing capability is therefore crucial for model editing. In this paper, we mainly focus on whether the general abilities of LLM are hurt in sequential editing settings. Two orthogonal concepts of sequential editing are _single editing_ and _batch editing_. Batch editing refers to the model's ability to edit multiple editing samples (like MEMIT, PMET) at once, whereas the concept opposed to this is single editing, which means these methods (like ROME, GRACE, MEND) can only edit one sample at a time.

Formal Definition of Sequential Editing.Here, let's provide a formal definition of sequential editing. Assume we have an unedited model \(M_{0}\), and \(n\) editing samples\((x_{i},y_{i})\), where \(i=1,2,,n\) need to be incorporated into the language model \(M_{0}\). Suppose the editing operation is a function \(E(,)\), where the first parameter is the model to be edited and the second parameter is the editing samples. Assume we get the edited model \(M_{i}\) after the \(i\)-th editing operation. In sequential editing, \(M_{t}\) (model parameter after the \(t\)-th editing) is determined by the model weight \(M_{t-1}\) and the editing sample used in the \(t\)-th edit, like \(M_{t}=E(M_{t-1},S_{t})\), where \(S_{t}\) is the edit samples used in the \(t\)-thedit. For different index \(i\) and \(j\), \(S_{i} S_{j}=\); for every \(i\), we have \(_{i}S_{i}=\{x_{j},y_{j}\}_{j=1}^{j=n}\). If we denote the size of \(S_{t}\) is \(n_{t}\), it satify \(n_{t} 1\) for every \(t\) and satisfies \(n=_{t}n_{t}\) for all edit batches.

## 3 Experimental Design

In this section, we present several critical parts of experimental setups (in Section 3.1) and research question designs (in Section 3.2). The results and analysis of research questions are left in Section 4. All of the details of reproducing our experiments can be found in Appendix F.

### Experimental Setups

Here, we list all of the experimental setups. For implementation details, please refer to Appendix C.

**Language Models.** We conduct experiments on various LLMs, including Llama2-7B (based and instruction-tuned) , Mistral-7B (based and instruction-tuned) , GPT2-XL , and 6 language models from Pythia  model families with varying parameter scale from 160M to 12B.

**Model Editing Methods.** To comprehensively investigate the potential impact on edited models, we compared multiple editing methods: (1) meta-learning based methods: MEND  (2) located-then-edit based method: KN , ROME , MEMIT , PMET , (3) retrival based methods: SERAC , (4) extra parameters based methods: GRACE . It is imperative to note that the efficacy of edited models varies depending on the hyperparameters employed for each method, which can significantly impact the performance of the edited model. Therefore, our evaluation was confined to assessing only models supported by each editing method.

**Editing Datasets.** In this work, we employ the most widely adopted editing datasets **ZsRE** and counterfactual as editing datasets across all experiments in the work.

**Evaluation Benchmarks.** To effectively determine whether the model editing influences the overarching capabilities of LLMs, we utilized five distinct task categories as benchmarks. These include: _World Knowledge:_ MMLU  (5-shot), BBH  (3-shot), with the assessment based on the accuracy of multiple-choice answers. _Arithmetic:_ GSM8K  (8-shot), evaluated by the solve rate. _Commonsense Reasoning:_ CommonsenseQA  (7-shot), where performance is gauged by the accuracy of multiple choices. _Reading Comprehension:_TriviaQA  (0-shot), with the assessment based on the exact match from context. _Safety:_ TruthfulQA  (0-shot), evaluated through multiple-choice accuracy, and ToxiGen  (0-shot), where results are determined by the accuracy of two-way classification. For more details of these benchmarks, please refer to Appendix D.1.

**Editing Settings.** To investigate the potential impact on language models caused by editing, we mainly focus on sequential single editing in most of the research questions in this work.

### Research Questions

This paper aims to thoroughly examine the impacts of diverse model editing methods on various general abilities of edited models. It naturally motivates the following critical research questions (RQs) to be explored in this work based on the primary aim.

* **RQ1:** How does the number of undergone edits affect the abilities of models? (In Section 4.1)
* **RQ2:** Do instruction-tuned models exhibit differently than base counterparts? (In Section 4.2)
* **RQ3:** Does the general abilities of the edited model differ on model scales? (In Section 4.3)
* **RQ4:** How does editing affects different aspects of a model's capabilities? (In Section 4.4)
* **RQ5:** Does performing editing on language models compromise their safety? (In Section 4.5)

In the next section, we will address these research questions through detailed experimentation.

Summary.From the above research questions, we conclude that existing editing methods have inevitable pitfalls in editing LLMs, making them impractical in the production environment.

## 5 Further Discussion

In this section, we conduct discussions on the side effects, editing efficiency, and deployment issues of post-edit LLM, to further explore their practical use in production environments.

**Potential Impact on Inherent Knowledge within LLM.** Existing model editing methods claim that they can update specific knowledge within LLM without affecting other unrelated knowledge. However, existing research [26; 25] indicates that methods involving direct modification of model parameters can have unintended and potentially harmful impacts on the intrinsic knowledge of the model. Moreover, the updated knowledge is often challenging to utilize in knowledge-intensive downstream tasks, such as reasoning and knowledge-based question answering, exacerbating the model's hallucinations [22; 21]. As the quantity of edits escalates, the retention of updated knowledge within the LLM markedly diminishes . Our series of experiments demonstrates that even with only hundreds of edits, the general capabilities of the model are severely compromised. When the number of edits reaches the thousands, the model's internal structure is thoroughly damaged. These findings highlight the deficiencies of current model editing methods.

**Editing Efficiency and Speed.** Existing editing methods claim to manipulate the inherent knowledge within model efficiently and rapidly while keeping the memory usage of LLMs close to that of vanilla model inference during deployment. These advantages make model editing seem highly appealing. However, inherent drawbacks severely impede their real-world applicability. Many existing editing methods heavily rely on hyperparameter settings, some even necessitating costly parameter searches. For instance, locate-then-edit approaches (see Section 6) like ROME , and PMET  require causal tracing to identify layers for editing. Moreover, certain editing methods entail pre-training (MEND , SERAC , KN ) or precomputation of intermediate cached key-value (MEMIT), significantly prolonging pre-training or computational time and consuming hardware resources far beyond those required during editing, without targeted optimization for parallelization benefits. For example, utilizing the MEMIT for 10\(K\) edits on Llama2-7B  with an RTX A6000 48G RAM GPU demands approximately \(120\) hours. Hence, enhancing the efficiency of existing methods becomes paramount for real-world applications. See Table 8 for edit speed.

Figure 6: Safety evaluation of edited language models. We perform evaluation on TruthfulQA and Toxigen datasets with the Llama2-7B model. Results demonstrate that for most editing methods, even dozens of edits can compromise the safety of language models with they are aligned.

**Deployment and Serving.** As the scaling up of LLM, considerable deployment and serving challenges are presented [45; 10; 11]. To reduce the expenses of deployment and serving of LLMs, several specialized frameworks have been developed, including TensorRT-LLM , vLLM , and LightLLM , with high optimization for efficient LLM serving and deploying. However, some model editing methods, such as the GRACE , introduce additional modules to the edited models, or employ auxiliary models, like the SERAC , to handle queries involving updated knowledge. These modifications to the model architecture prevent the edited models from being directly deployed using these aforementioned serving frameworks, significantly limiting the practical adoption of editing methods. Furthermore, as the number of edits on LLM increases, for methods that introduce additional, the memory consumption for storing and the time cost for retrieval become increasingly prohibitive. This significantly impacts the throughput and inference latency during deployment and serving. For further details on these effects, please refer to Appendix D.2.

## 6 Related Work

In this section, we briefly review the related works in model editing and language model evaluation.

**Model Editing.** Model editing aims to precisely modify knowledge within a language model with fine grain. Existing methods can be divided into 3 different categories: Retrieval-based, Extra-parameters-based, and Locate-then-edit-based methods. Early works on editing focused on updating individual neurons using constrained fine-tuning [49; 50; 51], or hypernetworks . A related line of work has focused on storing updates in an external memory . Inspired by the linear associative memory property of FFN in transformers  and success with the approach in convolutional models , recent Locate-then-edit style works have proposed to edit MLP weights directly [17; 20; 37]. In the encyclopedic factual domain, work  proposed to edit single facts by fitting a Rank One Model Edit (ROME) to the parameters of an MLP layer and showed that it outperformed prior methods. While  concentrates on editing commonsense knowledge. Work  focuses on editing the encoder-decoder model. Work [12; 14; 19] make a comprehensive survey in model editing.

**Pitfalls of Model Editing.** Since the concept of model editing was introduced, there exist few works to discuss the drawbacks of existing methods. In , two kinds of pitfalls are discovered, named knowledge conflict and knowledge distortion. MEMIT-CSK  finds common sense knowledge can also be localized in FFN of LLM layers and both subject, object, and relation play important roles in recalling memory, but they only focus on classification tasks.  focus on mitigating the reversal curse in model editing for LLM. Some recent works [22; 59] try to evaluate the multi-hop reasoning of updated knowledge. Work [27; 21] tries to assess the underly impact caused by editing. What's more, some works [60; 61; 62; 63] discuss the knowledge forgetting during fine-tuning.

**Evaluation of LLM.** Evaluating the effectiveness of LLMs [3; 4; 31; 30; 64; 32; 33] involves a diverse array of tests, where models are assessed across various tasks, showcasing their capabilities. Among the benchmarks employed, Bigbench [65; 29], MMLU , and HELM  are notable. These benchmarks utilize a range of automatic evaluation metrics, such as BLEURT  and others requiring meticulous annotation to ensure data quality for downstream applications [68; 69; 70]. Typically, these evaluations emphasize accuracy across multiple choices, which serves as the primary metric [71; 72]. Foundation models, often tested across broad linguistic tasks--both generative and multiple-choice--are analyzed to ensure rigorous assessment standards [73; 28; 74; 65]. These methods, however, may focus on the accuracy within confined options and might not effectively capture the nuances of more open-ended, practical applications where models generate free-form text. Moreover, assessing the safety of LLMs is essential. Safety evaluations concentrate on three key areas: truthfulness , toxicity , and bias .

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we systematically investigate the potential impact of model editing on language models. We employed various editing methods to modify multiple models, followed by evaluations across different benchmarks. The experimental results indicate that existing editing methods can preserve the general capabilities of the model within a limited number of edits, not exceeding a few dozen. When the number of edits is sufficiently large, the intrinsic knowledge structure of the model can be disrupted or even completely damaged. Additionally, we systematically investigated potential factorsthat might impact the performance of models post-editing and their potential effects on the model's basic capabilities. Our experiments demonstrate that after only a few dozen edits, the safety of the model is compromised, including those models that have been aligned. Furthermore, we discuss the side effects, operational efficiency issues, and potential impacts brought by editing operations. We conclude that most of existing editing methods are only suitable for scenarios with no more than a few dozen updates. We are looking forward to future research addressing these challenges.
