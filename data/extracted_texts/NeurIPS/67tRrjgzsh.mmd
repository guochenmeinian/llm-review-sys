###### Abstract

Pre-trained language models have been proven to possess strong base capabilities, which not only excel in in-distribution language modeling but also show powerful abilities in out-of-distribution language modeling, transfer learning and few-shot learning. Unlike existing work focusing on the influence of scale on base capabilities, our work examines the influence of architecture on those. Specifically, our concern is: How does architecture influence the base capabilities of pre-trained language models? In this work, we attempt to explain and reverse the decline in base capabilities caused by the architecture of FFN-Wider Transformers, seeking to provide some insights. Through analysis, we found the contribution ratio of Multi-Head Attention (a combination function) to pre-trained language modeling is a key factor affecting base capabilities. FFN-Wider Transformers reduce the contribution ratio of this combination function, leading to a decline in base capabilities. We confirmed this by experiments and proposed Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) to address the decline in base capabilities of such models. Significantly, we extended our explanation and CEA to Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers. We successfully achieved significant improvements in base capabilities on a 14B parameter MoE model, demonstrating the practical application value of our work. This also indicates that our analysis has a certain guiding significance for architecture analysis, architecture improvement and architecture design.

## 1 Introduction

Recent research has discovered that pre-trained language models possess strong base capabilities . They can not only address in-distribution language modeling which is usually their pre-training objective, but also unexpectedly excel in **out-of-distribution language modeling, transfer learning, few-shot learning,** etc. This has attracted the attention of many researchers.

However, it has also been observed that the cost of pre-training a language model is substantial, with the trial-and-error approach based on empirical improvements proving to be very expensive. Consequently, there is a desire to gain insights into the final performance by analyzing factors like scale and architecture that directly determine the base capabilities of models.

In this process, much attention has been focused on analyzing scale, leading to the formulation of compelling **scaling laws** that drive the trend of enhancing base capability by increasing parameter numbers, data volume and training tokens. In contrast, the impact of architecture has not received sufficient attention. According to the basic principle of inductive bias in machine learning, **model architecture** is also a crucial factor affecting base capabilities, and its impact could be equally decisive.

Some studies have already noted the significant influence of architecture on the base capabilities. For instance,  have observed considerable differences in base capabilities among various Transformer architecture variants. Some variants, though larger in scale and more powerful in pre-training performance than vanilla Transformers, exhibit significantly reduced performance in downstream tasks. **This suggests different architecture models vary greatly in converting pre-training performance into base capabilities.** Simply increasing scale does not resolve all issues, and exploring the impact of architecture on base capabilities is crucial.

However, despite these studies demonstrating the key influences of model architecture on base capabilities, the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of these influences remains limited. In this work, we attempt to explain the base capability change caused by a specific model architecture change and identify the underlying influencing factor, then design experiments to validate our explanation and influencing factor, and finally propose a generalizable enhancement method.

Specifically, **we first focus on FFN-Wider Transformers**. This architecture has wider FFN layers, but we found that the change leads to a significant decrease in base capabilities compared to vanilla Transformers. As shown in Figure 2, under similar pre-training performance, the FFN-Wider models exhibit a noticeable decline in base capabilities compared to the vanilla models. We believe such a simple change, leading to significant differences in base capabilities, makes for a good object of study in exploring how architecture impacts base capabilities.

Then, we attempted to explain this change in base capabilities. Through analysis, we concluded that the MHA (Multi-Head Attention) layer in the Transformer is a combination function, and the FFN (Feed-Forward Network) layer is a transformation function, with the former being a focused expression of the combinability of language. During their contribution to pre-trained language modeling, **the actual contribution ratio of the MHA layer, as a combination function, is a key factor affecting the model's base capabilities**. The FFN-Wider Transformer models directly enhance the FFN layer, indirectly reducing the combination function's actual contribution ratio to pre-trained language modeling, thereby leading to a significant decline in base capabilities.

To validate our explanation for it, we designed a Combination Adjustable Architecture (CAA), as depicted in Figure 1(a). This architecture bifurcates a wider FFN into two parts with adjustable width ratios: one remains in its original position as a transformation function, known as the Outer-FFN, and the other is relocated within the MHA layer, transformed through a special design into an Inner-FFN that solely enhances the combination function. We controlled the width ratio of the Outer-FFN, reducing it gradually from 100% to 0%. In Figure 1(b), we observed that the actual contribution ratio of the Outer-FFN progressively decreased, indicating a corresponding increase in the actual contribution ratio of the MHA layer. At the same time, we also observed a gradual improvement in base capabilities. These reveal a key phenomenon that confirms our explanation: **as the actual

Figure 1: Illustration showing that: 1) the synchronous improvement in model base capability as the contribution ratio of the Outer-FFN layer (a transformation function) decreases, that is, the contribution ratio of the MHA layer (a combination function) increases. This reveals a key factor affecting model’s base capabilities. 2) Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) was designed based on this factor and applied to MoE models, resulting in an improvement in base capability.

contribution ratio of the MHA layer (a combination function) increases, there is a general synchronous improvement in the model's base capabilities.

Subsequently, we identified the optimal width ratio of two parts of FFN for the Combination Adjustable Architecture (CAA) and established it as Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA), and comparing this architecture with the original FFN-Wider Transformer. We conducted experiments on various scales of BERT and GPT models, with all results robustly supporting our explanation.

Importantly, we also noticed that existing work has observed a similar decline in base capabilities in the Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformers. **We applied our explanation and CEA to MoE Transformers as well**. We pre-trained a 14B parameter GPT architecture MoE model and its improved version with CEA on 100B tokens (using CC and C4 from SlimPajama ). With the same number of parameters, computational load, and pre-training steps for both versions, the improved version with CEA showed significant improvements in out-of-distribution language modeling and few-shot learning. The performance of the out-of-distribution language modeling (average performance across all domains in SlimPajama except for CC and C4) is shown in Figure 1(c), which can prove the practical application value of our work.

Overall, the actual contribution ratio of the MHA layer (a combination function) is likely a universal factor affecting model's base capabilities, which can provide valuable insights for architecture analysis, improvement and design.

## 2 Background

Subsequent sections will involve specific analyses and experiments of FFN-Wider and MoE transformers. Therefore, in this section, we introduce the relevant background of base capabilities, as well as the unified evaluation schemes and evaluation tasks.

### Base Capabilities

Pre-trained language models not only address in-distribution language modeling but also unexpectedly show strong base capabilities. In this work, we focus on the following base capabilities:

Out-of-Distribution Language ModelingThis reflects the out-of-distribution generalization capability of pre-trained language models. Models that learn more essential language features often outperform others, which is a good measure of the base capabilities of pre-trained language models.

Transfer LearningThis is a recognized base capability of pre-trained language models. The works proposing GPT  and BERT  have established the "pre-training and fine-tuning" transfer learning paradigm under the Transformer architecture.

Few-shot LearningThis is also a recognized base capability. Some works [25; 3] found large-scale pre-trained language models could complete many NLP tasks with no or only a few demonstrations, revealing their remarkable few-shot learning capabilities.

### Evaluation Schemes

In this work, we primarily explore how the architecture of a model influences its base capabilities in pre-trained language models, which requires designing a sound approach for quantitative analysis.

Comparing the base capabilities of one architecture model against another is straightforward: we simply compare their performance on a variety of representative tasks. However, changes in base capabilities cannot be directly attributed to changes in architecture alone, as model capabilities are also influenced by factors like scale.

This leads to a question: under what conditions can we compare the base capabilities of two different architecture models and be more confident that the differences are due to architecture variations?

Our scheme to this question: we compare the models when they use the same pre-training data and objectives, and have similar levels of pre-training performance (i.e., language modeling performance on an in-distribution development set).

**The underlying rationale**: two different architecture models, when trained on the same corpus and objectives, both gain base capabilities by reducing the loss in pre-trained language modeling. If one architecture model achieves greater base capabilities with the same reduction in language modeling loss, it is highly likely that this additional benefit stems from the inductive bias of its architecture. In other words, when pre-training performance is aligned, differences in base capabilities of models are likely reflecting the impact of architecture inductive biases.

This scheme is more appropriate for cross-architecture analysis compared to aligning pre-training steps, parameter numbers, or computational load, and we explain it in Appendix A.

Unless specified otherwise, all comparisons of base capabilities across architecture models in this work are conducted under the condition of aligned pre-training performance.

**The experiment with MoE transformers is an exception**, because we need to demonstrate practicality. Therefore, in the comparative experiments between the vanilla MoE model and the improved MoE model, not only is pre-training performance aligned, but pre-training steps, parameter numbers, and computational load are also kept consistent.

### Evaluation Tasks

Due to subsequent experiments involving out-of-distribution language modeling evaluation, transfer learning evaluation and few-shot learning evaluation, it is necessary to clarify the selection of pre-training corpus and out-of-distribution test corpus, as well as the selection of downstream tasks. We provide a detailed introduction in Appendix B.

## 3 FFN-Wider Transformers vs. Vanilla Transformers

This work focuses on the base capabilities of FFN-Wider Transformers. A typical Transformer model has Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. Assuming the hidden dimension is \(d\), the standard intermediate dimension of an FFN layer is \(4d\). However, an FFN-Wider Transformer model means the intermediate dimension of its FFN layer exceeds \(4d\).

We conducted experiments on various models with the intermediate dimension set to \(32d\), aligning pre-training performances with those of vanilla models. The results are shown in Figure 2.

We found that, at the same level of pre-training performance, the Transformer models with wider FFN layers exhibit a noticeable decline in performance on most downstream tasks, indicating a deterioration in their base capabilities. This presents us with a good research object.

## 4 Why FFN-Wider Transformers Have Worse Base Capabilities?

### Combination and Transformation

Transformers consist of MHA and FFN layers. Considering a certain position in a sequence, the updated representation obtained after an MHA layer is a **combination** of the entire sequence context; whereas the updated representation obtained after an FFN layer is from a **transformation** of that position representation alone, context-insensitive.

Figure 2: Comparison of the base capabilities between FFN-Wider and Vanilla Transformers.

When considering models composed of only one MHA layer or one FFN layer, we find that they can both be used for language modeling. If treated as black boxes focusing only on input and output, there is no difference. However, the way they accomplish language modeling is different, or rather, their inductive biases differ: the FFN layer directly maps the previous token to the target token, representing a one-to-one **transformation function**; while the MHA layer uses the entire sequence to calculate the target token, representing a many-to-one **combination function**. The latter aligns more closely with the combinability of language.

Further considering the multi-layer stacking of MHA and FFN layers in a Transformer model, we easily understand that although all layers contribute to the final language modeling objective, they do so with different inductive biases. Among these, the MHA layer might be the central embodiment of the model architecture's expression of the combinability of language.

With this understanding, when we revisit the scenarios where the FFN layer is widened or its capacity is increased, we have reason to suspect this will lead to a change in the actual contribution ratios of the transformation and combination function, thereby affecting the model's expression of the combinability of language, which is ultimately reflected in changes in basic capabilities.

**Our hypothesis**: the actual contribution ratio of the MHA layer (a combination function) is a key factor affecting the model's base capabilities. The FFN-Wider Transformers directly enhance the FFN layer, indirectly reducing the combination function's actual contribution ratio to pre-trained language modeling, thereby leading to a significant decline in base capabilities.

### Contribution Ratio Analysis

To verify our hypothesis, we first need to confirm whether the actual contribution ratio of MHA layers truly decreases, requiring quantitative analysis.

#### 4.2.1 Mutual Information

The first method is Mutual Information (MI). For positions in the sequence where a predicted token is to be output, we can focus on the representations of these positions after each layer and calculate the MI between these representations and the target tokens. Then, since we have MI before and after passing through any layer, we can calculate the contribution ratios of the MHA and FFN layers.

We adopted the mutual information estimate method proposed by , which mainly involves converting the representations into discrete variables through clustering, and then calculating the mutual information. For the definition of MI and more specific details, please refer to Appendix F.

We analyzed four small-scale models (H=128): a vanilla BERT, an FFN-Wider BERT, a vanilla GPT and an FFN-Wider GPT. The pre-training performances of the vanilla models and the FFN-Wider models are aligned. We plotted the MI results in Figure 3, where the blue, orange and grey lines represent the cumulative MI increment contributions of the MHA layer, FFN layer and Block, respectively. It can be seen that in the FFN-Wider models, the MI contribution of the FFN layer is significantly higher than that in the vanilla models, preliminarily validating our hypothesis.

#### 4.2.2 Token Prediction

Since the MI estimate requires clustering a large number of representations and is costly when the hidden dimension is high, we tried another more direct method called Token Prediction (TP). It involves predicting tokens directly from the hidden representations. The approach is as follows:

We still obtained representations from each layer, first dividing them into sets based on the corresponding output token. Then, we normalized all representations within a set and use their mean as the category vector for that token. During this process, we eliminated tokens where the set size was smaller than 50. For the representations of each layer, we then calculated the cosine similarity with the category vectors of tokens in that layer, selecting the token with the highest similarity as the prediction result for that representation. In this way, we could calculate a token prediction accuracy for each layer. The subsequent approach was identical to that of the MI method.

We analyzed four small-scale (H=128) and four large-scale (H=768) models concurrently. We plotted the accuracy increment contribution ratio of the FFN layer for each model, as shown in Figure 4. Itcan be seen that the contribution of FFN layers in FFN-Wider models remains higher than that in vanilla models, reaffirming our hypothesis.

## 5 Combination Adjustable Architecture

Although the FFN layer in FFN-Wider Transformers has a higher contribution ratio, we cannot assert this is the reason. This may merely be a correlation rather than a decisive factor in base capabilities.

Therefore, we designed an architecture that can directly intervene in the contribution ratios of the transformation and combination function, named Combination Adjustable Architecture (CAA).

### Model Architecture

The new architecture, as shown in Figure5, differs from the FFN-Wider Transformer in two aspects: one is partially transferring the FFN into the MHA; the other is adding a direct pathway inside the MHA that bypasses the Inner-FFN, which we will introduce in detail below.

#### 5.1.1 Inner-FFN and Outer-FFN

A wider FFN would increase the contribution ratio of transformation function to pre-trained language modeling. A natural idea: is it possible to devise a variant FFN serves only combination function?

We found the primary reason that the FFN does not serve only combination function is due to the residual connections. The representation transformed by the FFN does not necessarily have to go through the MHA combination process; the FFN can bypass the MHA via residual connections and directly transmit the information in the representation to subsequent layers.

Therefore, we divided an FFN into two parts with adjustable width ratios: one remains in its original position as a transformation function, known as the Outer-FFN, and the other is relocated within the MHA layer, transformed an Inner-FFN. This design ensures that the representation transformed by the Inner-FFN must undergo the MHA combination process before proceeding, initially achieving the goal of the Inner-FFN serving only for the combination function.

#### 5.1.2 Direct Pathway in MHA

Although we considered the impact of residual connections and designed an Inner-FFN, the Inner-FFN still has a hidden pathway to bypass the combination function and directly transmit uncombined information to subsequent layers.

The attention mechanism involves weighted summation over values, and typically, the value at the current position also participates. This provides a possibility for the Inner-FFN to directly transmit information. Therefore, we designed a direct pathway in the MHA for current position computation to circumvent the Inner-FFN. Specifically, during the self-attention computation at the current position, the query, key and value from the current position use the input representation that has not been processed by the Inner-FFN. Only the context representations from non-current positions are transformed by the Inner-FFN. This design largely eliminates the possibility of the Inner-FFN bypassing the combination function.

### Width Adjustment Analysis

In this section, we control the width ratio of the Outer-FFN, reducing it gradually from 100% to 0%,confirming our hypothesis by examining the trends of contribution ratio and base capability.

#### 5.2.1 Trend of Contribution Ratio

We conducted experiments on large-scale (H=768) BERT and GPT models. Initially, a series of models with different width ratios were pre-trained, ensuring their pre-training performance was aligned. Then, we calculated the contribution ratio of Outer-FFN using Token Prediction (TP) and plotted these trends, as shown in Figures 6(a) and 6(c).

It can be seen that the contribution ratio of Outer-FFN decreases as its width ratio is reduced. Conversely, the contribution ratio of the combination function increases with the reduction in the width ratio of Outer-FFN, demonstrating that controlling the width ratio indeed directly influences the contribution ratio of the combination function.

#### 5.2.2 Trend of Base Capability

We tested the performance of each model above in out-of-distribution (OOD) language modeling and plotted the trend in Figures 6(b) and 6(d).

For BERT, the OOD performance improves as the Outer-FFN width decreases. The performance of the optimal model has already surpassed the vanilla BERT. Most models not only outperform the FFN-Wider BERT in terms of performance but also require fewer pre-training steps. For GPT, only the model without Outer-FFN showed anomalous results, other models also follow this pattern.

After the analyses, **a conclusion is drawn from the overall trend**: the model's base capabilities generally improve as the contribution ratio of combination function increases. It holds over a wide range of width ratios and proves our hypothesis.

However, this overall trend does not mean the contribution of transformation function should be reduced to zero. A minor contribution from transformation function might still be crucial, as indicated by the sole anomalous result in GPT. BERT was unaffected, which is related to bidirectional attention still being able to leak few transformation contribution. More details are in Appendix G.

## 6 Combination Enhanced Architecture

In this section, we determine the Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA) and pre-train more steps to verify whether it can reverse the decline in base capabilities of FFN-Wider Transformer.

### Width Ratio Selection

We selected the optimal width ratio for Combination Enhanced Architecture (CEA). The Outer-FFN width ratio for FFN-Wider BERT w/ CEA is set to 0%. For FFN-Wider GPT w/ CEA, it is 12.5%.

### Further Experiments

We conducted more pre-training steps on vanilla models, FFN-wider models, FFN-wider models w/ CEA, and aligned the pre-training performances.

For BERT, we tested fine-tuning performance on GLUE, SuperGLUE and other datasets. For GPT, we tested zero-shot and one-shot performance on multiple datasets. For both, we tested OOD language modeling on Pile. For small-scale models, we removed some experiments beyond their capabilities. The brief results are shown in Table 1 and 2, and the detailed results are in Appendix H.

The results show the FFN-wider models w/ CEA improve in base capabilities, not only surpassing the FFN-wider models in most aspects but also nearly reaching the level of vanilla models. In addition, the new architecture models w/o the direct pathway in MHA show a significant decline in base capabilities. These all confirm our explanation.

Additionally, we conducted similar experiments for other width ratios that can align pre-training performance and steps simultaneously, which can indisputably prove improvements come from architecture, as detailed in Appendix I.

## 7 From FFN-Wider Transformers to MoE Transformers

The Mixture of Experts (MoE) Transformer [18; 8] is a practical architecture that introduces a mix of experts, which enables expanding the capacity with lower computation expense.

However, base capability decline also be observed in MoE Transformers.  found MoE models perform lower on SuperGLUE compared to vanilla models when achieving same pre-training level. Similar issue can also be analyzed from the results of .

We found the MoE layer can be seen as an enhanced version of the FFN layer. Therefore, we believe the previous explanations could also apply to MoE Transformers. Consequently, we directly transplant our CEA to MoE Transformers, resulting in a new MoE architecture.

We selected a 1.3B GPT model as the backbone model, which incorporates Rotary Embedding  and RMSNorm  on the GPT3 . Then, we added a MoE layer with 64 experts (top-1 activation) before the FFN layer, resulting in a 14B parameter MoE baseline model. Finally, our improved version with CEA involves transforming the MoE layer into an Inner-MoE layer within the MHA,

Table 2: The results of various GPT models.

while retaining the original FFN layer as the Outer-FFN layer. To accommodate FlashAttention-2 , we simplified the direct pathway. Instead of preventing transformation leakage by replacing the key and value at current position, we chose to directly mask the current position to achieve the same effect. The specifications, pre-training procedures and few-shot learning procedures are detailed in Appendix C and E.

We conducted pre-training on CC and C4 subsets within SlimPajama , training all models from scratch with 100B tokens. Due to the de-duplication across subsets achieved by SlimPajama, we used the remaining subsets as out-of-distribution sets. We carried out comprehensive out-of-distribution language modeling and few-shot learning tests, with the results presented in Table 3.

From the results, it is evident that our method significantly enhances the base capabilities of the MoE model. This fully demonstrates the effectiveness of our analysis and improvement methods.

## 8 Limitations

This work mainly analyzes the models that use language modeling as the pre-training objective, lacking experiments on models with other pre-training objectives. Hence, the conclusions are limited to pre-trained language models. Therefore, the current applicability of our findings is relatively narrow, and we consider conducting more experiments in the future.

Conclusion

This work explores how architecture affects the base capabilities of pre-trained language models. FFN-Wider Transformer is our research object and we try to explain and reverse the decline in base capabilities caused by its architecture. We found the contribution ratio of combination function is a key factor, while FFN-Wider Transformer reduces it, leading to a decline in base capabilities. We solved it by proposing CEA. In addition, we extended our conclusion to MoE Transformers, proving our work can offer guidance for architecture improvement.
