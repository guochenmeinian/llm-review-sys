[MISSING_PAGE_POST]

Despite their ambitious goals, many recent fusion methods encounter limitations. A notable challenge is _modality laziness_ as described by Du et al. . In conventional late fusion techniques that employ shared loss functions between modalities--such as vanilla late fusion through concatenating or averaging representations, where the cross-entropy (CE) loss is determined after fusion --there is potential for individual modalities to contribute less to the overall training classification accuracy. This concern is especially evident in downstream retrieval tasks like ReID. Based on findings by Peng et al. , one could infer that when modalities are trained individually, the representation of a single modality will have a direct influence on the loss function since it's the sole contributor in that setting.

Guided by these challenges, this study zeroes in on evaluating fusion techniques within the ReID context. While our lens is sharply focused on ReID, the derived insights hold broader relevance, extending to a vast spectrum of multimodal tasks that utilize late fusion techniques. Our main contributions begin with creating a comprehensive evaluation of late fusion techniques in the current multimodal ReID landscape, spotlighting their inherent limitations from a modality laziness perspective. Next, we provide empirical evidence establishing late-fusion unimodal ensembled models as a new strong baseline, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods in multimodal ReID benchmarks. Finally, we discuss plausible explanations for this surprising performance behavior in the context of unimodal model ablations and future research directions for better understanding multimodal representation learning and model design.

## 2 Preliminaries and Method

Multimodal representation learning focuses on the efficient and effective compression of high-dimensional data, especially for downstream tasks like ReID. For this purpose, convolutional neural networks (e.g., ResNet-50) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) are typically employed as visual encoders . Within this context, _late fusion_ stands out as the predominant method for integrating multiple data modalities. This approach is favored over the less-common _early fusion_, which integrates multiple data modalities before inputting them into a single model. Notably, early fusion can be sensitive to pre-processing and lacks scalability . The late fusion approach first encodes each modality separately before combining their outputs, usually via averaging or concatenation mechanisms. While late fusion does not allow for cross-modal interactions, it is one of the most widespread fusion strategies due to the intuition that the approach is able to leverage already existing and carefully optimized architectures for the distinct modalities.

In object ReID, the task is to match objects across different data captures, typically from disparate views or time instances. Multimodal ReID datasets are given by \(n\) object samples, where each sample consists of \(M\) coincidental images (corresponding to \(M\) modalities) and an identifying label (ID): for each sample we have \([(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{M}),y]\) where \(x_{i}^{C H W}\) is the \(i\)-th modality image of the object and \(y\) denotes its ID. We consider _multiple views_ of an object to be different samples that share the same object ID. Of note, the IDs we see during train-time do not overlap with those seen at inference. As such, object ReID is often solved not by using the direct output of a classifier, but by bringing different views of the same object together in the latent space and pushing different objects away from each other. This is commonly done by combining a cross-entropy loss with contrastive learning in the form of triplet loss:

\[(z,,y)=_{}(z)+_{ }(,y)\] (1)

where \(_{}\) is a soft-margin triplet loss that uses the object embedding \(z\) and \(_{}\) denotes a cross-entropy loss that uses the output of a linear classifier, \(\). Here, \(\) acts as a balancing coefficient.

To establish a strong baseline for future multimodal ReID research and investigate the impacts of fusion, we study three separate vanilla late-fusion strategies: fusion by concatenation (_Fusion-concat_), fusion by averaging (_Fusion-avg_), and post-training fusion by unimodal concatenation (_UniCat_).

More specifically, for each modality we train an unshared backbone, \(f_{i}\) that produces a modality-specific embedding, \(z_{i}\). These modality-specific embeddings can then be combined into a multimodal representation: \(z_{}=(z_{1},z_{2},...z_{M})\) where \(\) is the chosen fusion operator. The difference among the training strategies lies in whether global or local loss functions are used. In _Fusion-avg_ or _Fusion-concat_, we use a global loss function that operates on the fused multimodal representation, \(z_{}\): \(_{}=(z_{},_{},y)\). In this case, the back-propagated gradients for each modality are entangled as described in . Conversely, in _UniCat_ we train each modality encoder independently with their own local loss function: \(_{}=_{i}^{M}(z_{i},_{i},y)\) where \(i\) is summed over all modalities.

Here, note that each modality's loss is fully disentangled from the others. In this case, fusion occurs only at inference when we concatenate the modality-specific embeddings into the final multimodal representation, \(z_{}\).

## 3 Results

We benchmark the described late-fusion strategies on three multimodal ReID datasets. RGBNT100  is a multimodal vehicle dataset consisting of coincidental visible (RGB), near-infrared (NIR), and thermal-infrared (TIR) images for 100 vehicles from multiple views as shown in Figure 1. RGBN300 is an extension of RGBNT100 in which (RGB, NIR) pairs are provided for 300 vehicles. Lastly, RGBNT201  is a multimodal person dataset that provides (RGB, NIR, TIR) image triples for 201 different individuals. The key benchmarks, mAP and Rank-1, are informed by the cumulative match curve (CMC) . Notably, mAP offers an overarching performance measure.

We compare our late-fusion baseline strategies with the previous state-of-the-art multimodal ReID models. In particular, we test two of the most widely-used backbones found in other ReID models, ResNet-50 and ViT-B.

In Table 1 we observe that RGBNT100/RGBN300 with _UniCat_ and RGBNT201 with _Fusion-concat_ do strikingly better than the other best-known fusion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance. We observe backbone choice to have a more dramatic impact on RGBNT201 than RBGNT100/RGBN300. Since RGBNT201 contains 2x fewer datapoints than RGBNT100, data-hungry ViTs may struggle to learn with lack of inductive biases compared to CNNs . Overall, we clearly observe fusion strategy as a leading factor on representation quality.

To gain intuition for the dynamics at play, we further compare all of our modality backbones on the task of unimodal ReID. That is, we use our trained modality encoders from Table 1 and evaluate unimodal ReID performance on the test sets. Because the multimodal embeddings in all fusion cases are simply poolings of unimodal embeddings, multimodal ReID performance here is closely tied to the corresponding unimodal ReID performance of the constituent modalities. As shown in Table 2, for RGBNT100 we observe that all unimodal ReID performance has been negatively affected by training with fusion. Surprisingly, we also observe this to be the case in RGBNT201, with the exception of one modality - NIR (see Table 3). We can consider this modality a weak-link since when trained in isolation (_UniCat_) its performance is notably lower than RGB/TIR. As multimodal ReID is most affected by the weakest-link, we deduce that the performance gains of NIR in the case of _Fusion-concat_ outweighed the performance drops in RGB/TIR.

We suspect these effects are largely due to the impact and nuances of modality laziness. The results shown by RGBNT100/RGBN300 demonstrate the negative effects that modality laziness can have

leading to underutilized unimodal features. Conversely, for datasets such as RGBNT201 where noisy, less-reliable modalities exist, modality laziness may offer a training relief by helping to prevent those modalities from resorting to high-degrees of overfitting. This latter notion has also been hypothesized by Liu et al. .

### RGBNT100 Training Performance

To further distinguish whether modality laziness or general overfitting is at play in the performance drop observed when training RGBNT100 with fusion, we evaluate the unimodal ReID performance (given by mAP) of the train set for RGBNT100 (see Figure 2). Mirroring the test behavior, we see that the unimodal mAP for the train set was inhibited for _Fusion-avg_ and _Fusion-concat_ compared to _UniCat_. Thus, contrary to the hypothesis of , the performance decline that we observed when training with fusion (Table 1) can be primarily linked to modality laziness, and it is actually _UniCat_ that appears to be more at risk for overfitting to the train data. This also helps to demonstrate how the impacts of modality laziness may at times be beneficial for weaker, less-informative modalities that are especially overfitting-prone, as we observed in RGBNT201 (Tables 1 and 3).

### Effects of Fusion Strategies in Ensemble Learning

Peng et al.  suggests that modality laziness occurs when some modalities are more dominant than others. However, we suspect that this phenomenon can occur even when modalities have comparable,

or even equal, predictive strengths. To demonstrate this idea, we look to ensembles. Specifically, we train an ensemble of unimodal ReID models on a single modality. When training ensembles, it is common practice to train each ensemble member individually and fuse their predictions only at inference (i.e. bagging). We compare this standard strategy of training each ensemble member independently (_UniCat_) with training them jointly by having a global loss use their fused output embedding (_Fusion-avg/concat_).

For this experiment, we investigate each modality within RGBNT100 as well as the popular unimodal person ReID dataset, Market1501 . We choose ViT-B as our model backbone and use ImageNet pre-trained weights. The classifiers and bottlenecks are randomly instantiated via , so that we may fully expect the backbones to have unique final solutions.

As shown in Table 4, there is a boost in unimodal RGBNT100 ReID performance for all ensemble models when compared to Table 2, which is expected as ensembling helps to diminish the impacts of overfitting. However, what is notable is that in all unimodal tasks, training the ensemble using a global loss (_Fusion-avg/concat_) resulted in a lower performance than would otherwise have been obtained if each member were trained independently (_UniCat_). This underscores the fundamental nature by which modality laziness operates and how the phenomenon should be considered even when training with balanced modalities.

## 4 Discussion

Our results indicate that when different modalities are jointly optimized (fusion training), they may not capture all available task-relevant information, leading to potential underrepresentation. This is especially pronounced in datasets like RGBNT100/RGBN300. But there's a silver lining: while certain modalities suffer, noisy ones may benefit since joint training may act as a form of regularization for such modalities, preventing overfitting to task-irrelevant data. Thus, a delicate equilibrium emerges in multimodal ReID learning. We find that the _UniCat_ approach using a ViT-B backbone outperforms other models in both RGBNT100 and RGBN300. Here, each modality--RGB, NIR, and TIR--benefits from the pressure of being trained in isolation. Challenging views like those in  that focus on over-parameterization, our results suggest that joint optimization's nuances may limit modalities from capturing complete task-relevant information, therein lying the negative effects of modality laziness. Conversely, in certain scenarios, such as with the RGBNT201 dataset, the utility of modality laziness emerges. Specifically, the _Fusion-concat_ method bolsters the performance of NIR--a notably weaker modality. While NIR struggles when optimized individually, joint optimization uplifts its performance. We attribute this to modality laziness acting as a shield against the modality's inherent noise, resonating with the observations made by . This not only highlights the protective role of modality laziness but also underscores its potential as a regularization mechanism, especially for modalities with less task-relevant information. Previous solutions to modality laziness (, ) do not consider the full scope of the phenomenon.

Our findings highlight the need for a unified fusion approach to address the multifaceted nature of modality laziness and show that much research is still needed to inform more holistic, nuanced multimodal frameworks. We encourage researchers in this field to validate simple post-training fusion baselines like _UniCat_ first in their setting, before pursuing more complex fusion strategies. Lastly, frameworks that are both model parameter efficient (e.g., a shared backbone encoder) and data efficient are essential for future architecture scalability.
