###### Abstract

Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, impacting ecosystem services necessary to ensure food, water, and human health and well-being. Understanding the distribution of species and their habitats is crucial for conservation policy planning. However, traditional methods in ecology for species distribution models (SDMs) generally focus either on narrow sets of species or narrow geographical areas and there remain significant knowledge gaps about the distribution of species. A major reason for this is the limited availability of data traditionally used, due to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise required for traditional field monitoring. The wide availability of remote sensing data and the growing adoption of citizen science tools to collect species observations data at low cost offer an opportunity for improving biodiversity monitoring and enabling the modelling of complex ecosystems. We introduce a novel task for mapping bird species to their habitats by predicting species encounter rates from satellite images, and present SatBird1, a satellite dataset of locations in the USA with labels derived from presence-absence observation data from the citizen science database eBird, considering summer (breeding) and winter seasons. We also provide a dataset in Kenya representing low-data regimes. We additionally provide environmental data and species range maps for each location. We benchmark a set of baselines on our dataset, including SOTA models for remote sensing tasks. SatBird opens up possibilities for scalably modelling properties of ecosystems worldwide.

## 1 Introduction

Climate change is a major driver of biodiversity loss, affecting ecosystem services which, in turn, impacts various human wellbeing aspects [32; 45]. It is crucial to understand the changing distributions of species globally to inform policy decisions, for example in shaping land use and land conservation choices. However, there remain large knowledge gaps about species distribution, due principally to the amount of effort and expertise required for traditional field monitoring. Furthermore, mapping species habitats at scale can be challenging as habitats have varying scales depending on species.

For example, song sparrows are found in a wide variety of open habitats, including tidal marshes, agricultural fields, overgrown pastures, forest edges, and suburbs whereas Kirtland's warblers only breed in young jack pine forests. Traditional methods for species distribution models (SDMs) use environmental data to predict the distribution of species across geographic space. However, they generally focus either on narrow sets of species or narrow geographical areas, while species interact with each other, and multi-species modelling is needed for understanding ecosystems. The limitations of traditional methods lie in their computational cost, the insufficient ability of models to account for complex relationships between different variables, and the limited availability of the type of data used [50; 47], at a fine-grained resolution.

Machine learning algorithms for remote sensing have increasingly seen wide applicability across sustainability-related domains (see e.g. ) and have been suggested as a promising tool for SDMs . Moreover, the surge of data collection on citizen science platforms along with improved data quality validation processes in recent years offers tremendous opportunity for scientific research, as species observation records from these sources can cover a larger temporal and geographic extent at a finer resolution and at a lower cost than traditional sampling methods. Indeed, citizen science data and remotely sensed ecosystem attributes such as vegetation indices have been shown to improve the performance of models, especially for less widespread species . Recently, the GeoLifeCLEF challenge  was introduced with the goal of directly predicting plant and animal abundance from 1m-resolution aerial images, using deep computer vision. However, the GeoLifeCLEF benchmark has proven extremely challenging, potentially since only one species (out of 17,000 overall) is associated with each location, even though numerous other species could likely be found in the same place.

We propose to use remote sensing to infer the joint distribution of many species for a given location, using publicly available citizen science observation records as ground truth. Our approach leverages the fact that a species' presence or absence at a location depends on the ecosystem present there, and therefore the abundances of different species are highly correlated. We present SatBird, a dataset and benchmark for the task of jointly predicting the encounter rates of bird species. Encounter rates are a widely used measure in species distribution modeling, and correspond to the probability of an observer to encounter this species if they visit a given location.

Our contributions include:

* Proposing and framing the task of predicting bird species encounter rates jointly at a specific location using remote sensing data (Section 2)
* We introduce SatBird, a dataset for the above task, obtained from publicly available bird observation and satellite data sources (Section 4), composed of the following sub-datasets: (i) USA summer dataset, generally corresponding to the breeding season, (ii) USA winter dataset, the nonbreeding season, (iii) Kenya dataset, as an example of a low-data regime.
* We benchmark a variety of popular models on SatBird and show the efficacy of deep computer vision methods for this task (Section 5).

We release the dataset and code for dataset preparation and benchmark making it possible to easily extend the dataset to other regions in the world.

## 2 Task definition

We propose to predict bird encounter rates from remote sensing data with the goal of completing species distribution mapping in places that have not been surveyed. We use bird sighting records from the citizen science database eBird , which has \(80\) million records of almost all \(10000\) global bird species. In particular, we leverage observation reports called _complete checklists_. Each location (termed a _hotspot_) in the eBird database is associated to a number of complete checklists containing all species a birdwatcher was able to observe at a specific date and time. Complete checklists are _presence-absence data_ -reflecting both the presence of reported species and the absence of non-reported species - and therefore may be considered almost as informative as expert field surveys. If \(h\) is a hotspot, and \(s_{1},,s_{n}\) the species of interest, then our goal is to build a machine learning model that takes as input a satellite image of \(h\) (and optionally other data) and predicts the vector \(}=(y^{h}_{s_{1}},...,y^{h}_{s_{n}})\), where \(y^{h}_{s}\) is the number of complete checklists reporting species \(s\) at \(h\) divided by the total number of complete checklists at \(h\).

This ratio \(y^{h}_{s}\) can be understood as an _encounter rate_, the probability for a visitor to observe a species if they visit the same location (hotspot). We aim to jointly predict this quantity for all relevant bird species. Thus, our task can be considered as a supervised multi-output regression problem. We chose to predict encounter rates as they are an important quantity in ecology, and they are also used extensively in the form of "hotspot bar charts" in the eBird platform in order to summarize the species in a given location for birdwatchers and ornithologists. These bar charts are used to suggest to users what species may be expected in a particular location. However, they rely only on past data, and the suggestions cannot be extended to places that have not yet been visited. Moreover, encounter rates from eBird have not been modeled jointly to take the interaction between species in the same habitat into consideration, which is important to inform species presence estimates. Our goal is to bridge this gap by modeling the encounter rates of many species jointly and predict them in locations with few or no observations. An overview of the interaction between our data and models is shown in Figure 1.

## 3 Related Work

There have been an increasing number of citizen science initiatives to collect species observation data for a variety of taxa in the past decade, from butterflies, to plants, to sharks [26; 58; 51]. Indeed, by crowdsourcing data collection efforts, it is possible to gather data not only over a larger temporal and geographic extent but also at a fine resolution . As a result, the number of papers using citizen science for SDMs has increased at approximately double the rate of the overall number of SDM papers . **eBird** data has been increasingly used for scientific research on birds, from assessing climate change-driven vulnerability of species, to modelling population change to predicting virus transmission [59; 35; 12]. The eBird status and trends project  from the eBird team combines satellite images with raw eBird data and uses statistical models and machine learning to build visualizations and tools to better understand migration, abundance patterns, range boundaries, and other patterns around the world. Other large scale citizen science databases used for SDM include **iNaturalist** in which users record observations of species by taking geolocated pictures. In total, it has 113 million species observations. However, because it is limited to observations with pictures, it is more prone to sampling biases, both geographically and towards certain species (e.g. larger,

Figure 1: **An overview of data streams for SatBird, as well as inputs and outputs for the task for predicting species encounter rates. Sentinel-2 10m-resolution satellite data can be used along low resolution environmental data as input to a model after matching their resolutions. Labels are derived from eBird complete checklists. Observations of vagrants (migrating birds) in the labels are corrected with range maps from eBird, which can also be incorporated in the model to make it geography-aware.**

more brightly coloured species [9; 10]). It is also _presence-only_ - that is, while there is data on the presence of certain species at a given location, it is assumed that other species may also be present.

Remote sensing data has been used for a variety of biodiversity monitoring applications, including predicting land cover classes for downstream ecological modeling , measuring the size of groups of animals , identifying tree species from crowns , and localizing bird nesting sites . Bioacoustics has been used for bird monitoring  but one of the main limitations relates to the detectability of species, for example in densely populated areas with many anthropogenic sound sources . Therefore, we will focus on discussing related work with remotely sensed imagery. In the **GeoLifeCLEF 2020 challenge **, they proposed a task combining remote sensing and citizen science data, where the goal is to predict the localization of plant and animal species using 1.6M geo-localized observations from France and the USA of 17,000 plant and animal species from aerial images and environmental features. The labels are derived from citizen science databases of presence-only species observations and each location is associated with only one species, limiting the ability to accurately model multiple species at a time. A newer version (2023 edition) of this classification challenge proposes to focus only on plant species and to use Sentinel-2 satellite images rather than aerial images. While each location is still associated with one species, a validation set with presence-absence labels is provided, highlighting the importance of presence-absence data, at least for the evaluation of such species modeling tasks. Methods deriving information from satellite images have also been developed in the context of avian studies but they usually use a suite of carefully selected measures calculated from the imagery rather than leveraging its full potential [5; 21].

A particular field of application that saw the development of large remote sensing images datasets is agriculture, with an emphasis on the temporal resolution for crop monitoring [28; 44; 62]. Recently, a number of methods have been introduced to learn robust representations of remote sensing data, with the goal of using them for a variety of downstream tasks [44; 52; 53]. In particular, MOSAIKS  proposes to use a single encoding of satellite imagery for diverse prediction tasks, and Satlas  and SatMAE  provide pre-trained models on a large number of remote sensing images, arguing that they can be useful feature extractors for remote sensing tasks.

Compared to existing datasets and methods for SDM, our proposed approach has several advantages:

* We fully leverage presence-absence data from a large citizen science database and compute encounter rates such that biases due to the different number of observers visiting locations are mitigated (see Section 2).
* We enable modelling of a wide range of species at a time across large geographical areas. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt at predicting encounter rates for many species jointly, building on recent advances in machine learning for remote sensing.
* Our proposed pipeline makes it easily extendable to other regions in the world as all data sources are open; eBird  data is available in all countries in the world and satellite Sentinel-2 data is publicly available.

## 4 SatBird Dataset

We introduce SatBird, a dataset for the task of predicting encounter rates defined in Section 2 from remote sensing images and environmental data with labels derived from eBird observation reports, with the continental USA and Kenya as regions of interest. Observations in eBird are particularly skewed towards North America, and we choose the USA as a first region of interest, given the extensive and reliable data available on bird observations. We consider the summer season (June-July) and the winter season (December-January) separately. For most North American bird species, the summer reflects breeding season range, while the winter reflects nonbreeding range. Note that we omit the spring and fall migration seasons, in which species distributions may vary dramatically, and which are also often of less interest to ecologists than breeding habitat.In Kenya, we consider the distribution of birds all-year-round as migration is negligible.

In this section, we detail the data sources and data preparation for SatBird for the USA summer and winter seasons and Kenya. Table 1 summarizes the data for each of the considered subsets _SatBird-USA-summer_, _SatBird-USA-winter_ and _SatBird-Kenya_. Figure 1 summarizes the different sources of data for SatBird.

### Bird species data

We used complete checklists from eBird . For USA, we extracted checklists recorded from 2010 to 2023 at hotspots in the continental USA in June-July and December-January for the summer and winter seasons respectively. We filtered out hotspots with fewer than \(5\) complete checklists recorded, to ensure more meaningful encounter rates. We also excluded locations in the sea using the \(5\)-meter resolution US nation cartographic boundaries provided by the Census Bureau's MAF/TIGER . We included all regularly occurring species in the region, as denoted by ABA Codes 1 and 2 , which include regular breeding species and visitors. Code-1 species are more widespread, while Code-2 species can have restricted range or occur in lower density, bur are still widespread. We omit species found only in Hawaii and Alaska, as well as one Code-2 seabird species with rare oceanic observations, leaving a total of \(670\) species.

For Kenya, we extracted all complete checklists recorded from 2010 to 2023, limiting ourselves to the 1,054 species found regularly in Kenya according to Avibase . Due to the scarcity of data in this region, we applied no criteria regarding the minimum number of checklists per hotspot or the month in which an observation was made. There are also a larger number of non-migratory birds present in Kenya than the USA, further motivating our choice to consider records aggregated across seasons.

An additional preparation step was merging hotspots with different IDs in eBird that had the same latitude and longitude, pooling the checklists together, unless all checklists were reported by the same observer on the same day, in which case we dropped the hotspot. We then computed the encounter rates for each hotspot as explained in Section 2 and corrected for vagarts (species seen in hotspots outside of their geographical range) by using range maps from eBird to set the target encounter rates to zero in these hotspots when they were available. We aggregated the species observations over 13 years, only considering seasonal change in distributions in the USA and leaving annual temporal change for future iterations of this work. As we aggregated data per hotspot, we did not take into account the reporting patterns of birders. Previous work  demonstrates that estimating the observer expertise can improve species distributions from eBird data. This may also be considered for future iterations of this work.

### Environmental data

Following the GeoLifeCLEF 2020 dataset , we extracted \(19\) bioclimatic variables rasters of size \(50 50\) and \(6 6\) for the USA and Kenya datasets respectively and of spatial resolution approximately \(1\) km centered on each hotspot from WorldClim 1.4. Bioclimatic variables are often used to model species distributions as a function of climate . They represent annual trends for temperature, precipitation, solar radiation, wind speed and water vapor pressure. Additionally, for the USA dataset, we also extracted \(8\) pedologic (soil) variables with resolution \(250\) meter from SoilGrids , which provides global soil properties maps, including pH, soil organic carbon content and stocks. These maps are obtained with machine learning methods trained on soil profile observations and environmental covariates derived from remote sensing. We provide more details on the environmental variables in Appendix A.

Table 1: Summary of the data provided for each of the SatBird subsets: USA-summer, USA-winter, and Kenya.

### Satellite data

For each hotspot, we extracted data at \(10\) meter resolution for RGB and NIR reflectance data from Sentinel-2 satellite tiles covering a square of about 5 km\({}^{2}\) centered around the hotspots. Additionally we also extracted the true color image RGB bands. We extracted images with cloud coverage of at most \(10\%\), keeping the least cloudy image in the time windows (June 1 - July 31, 2022) for USA-summer, (December 1, 2022 - January 31, 2023) for USA-winter, and (January 1, 2022 - January, 1 2023) for Kenya datasets respectively. In the case where no image was found for a hotspot with these criteria, we composed mosaics with images with up to 25% cloud coverage in the considered time window - and taking the median values. We associate one image per hotspot, considering that a recent satellite image is best representative of our species data, since there are more checklists in recent years compared to earlier years.

### eBird range maps

We extracted range maps from the eBird Status and Trends  for the summer season in the USA from eBird by filtering ranges between June and July 2021 which are available for 586 of the 670 species considered in the USA. For the winter dataset, we were able to extract range maps for 620 out of 670 species using the same process but filtering ranges between December and January using the R package ebirdst . For each hotspot \(l\), we construct a binary mask \(m_{l}\) of size 670 where \(m_{l}^{(i)}=1\) if \(l\) is within the range of species \(i\). Range maps were not available for Kenya data.

### Aligning data

Finally, we aligned the satellite and the species observation data to obtain the final set of hotspots included in the SatBird dataset, as some satellite images were not found (for example if the cloud cover criterion was not met). Only hotspots with a corresponding satellite image with height and width greater than \(128\) pixels were kept, with their associated the environmental data rasters. In this way we obtained 122,593 hotspots for the USA summer season, 53,361 for the USA winter season and 9,975 in Kenya. In summary, each hotspot is associated with the following input data: 1 satellite image with RGB & NIR reflectance (4) \(+\) RGB true color bands (3), bioclimatic rasters (19), and pedologic rasters (8). The targets are computed from the aggregated checklists, and correspond to species encounter rates. Figure 3 shows the distribution of the number of species per hotspot.

### Dataset splits

In order to account for spatial auto-correlation and overfitting that can arise from random splits of geospatial data , we use the scikit-learn DBSCAN algorithm  implementation to cluster hotspots. DBSCAN finds core samples and expands clusters from them, and we specify core samples to have at least 2 hotspots with a maximum allowed distance between them of 5km. We obtained 12,650 clusters which were then randomly assigned to train, validation and test splits such that they respectively contained 70%, 15%, and 15% of the hotspots for the US summer dataset. We kept the same split assignment for winter US locations also present in the summer US locations, assigned the

rest in a 70 %, 15 %, 15% repartition in the train, validation and test sets. The same procedure was followed for the data in Kenya. Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of hotspots for the dataset and we provide number of hotspots per split in Appendix A.

## 5 Benchmarking

In this section, we present the baselines used to benchmark our task, predicting species encounter rates. We choose a wide range of baselines covering simple regression trees, deep CNNs and transformers.

### Models

Mean encounter rates:We propose a first basic baseline which is simply the average of encounter rates over the training set for each species.

Environmental baseline:Following the GeoLifeCLEF  challenge, we propose an environmental baseline, using Gradient Boosted Regression Trees on the bioclimatic and pedological variables extracted at each of the hotspots.

MOSAIKS :This model was proposed as an accessible method that generalizes well across a wide range of tasks at significantly lower computational cost compared to training a deep neural network for each task. It performs a one-time unsupervised image featurization by convolving a set of randomly selected patches with the input satellite image. These features can then be reused for an unlimited number of tasks. We propose to use the MOSAIKS method to extract features from our satellite images dataset and combine them with the environmental variables before training a regressor to predict the encounter rates at each hotspot.

SATLAS pretrained transformer :The literature suggests pretraining Swin-v2  transformer on a large number of remote sensing images to target distribution shifts in remote sensing tasks. The model is pre-trained on Satlas, a dataset of 1.3 million satellite images from different sources, and is proven to perform well in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings. They provide weights for models pre-trained on low-resolution and high resolution images. We freeze the Satlas parameters and train a final fully connected layer to predict our target.

SatMAE :This is an unsupervised pre-training framework based on Masked Autoencoders (MAE) for tasks related to remote sensing, specifically for temporal or multi-spectral satellite imagery data. It has been shown to perform well on supervised and transfer learning tasks. We apply transfer learning to our dataset using SatMAE pre-trained model on the fMoW  dataset. We use the pre-trained model as a feature extractor and train a dense layer to predict the species encounter rates.

ResNet-18 :CNNs have been widely used as feature extractors for remote sensing imagery. We use ResNet-18  architecture, using the RGB and NIR bands reflectance data as input and we initialize the network with ImageNet pretrained weights. Since ImageNet has only RGB bands, the initialization of the first layer for the NIR band is performed by sampling from a normal distribution parameterized by the mean and standard deviation of the layer's weights for the other bands. We also experiment with RGB true color images as an input and compare the results against reflectance data.

### Including geographical information

We propose to make the CNN baseline model spatially explicit to account for the geographical ranges of some species. For example, Eastern and Western wood pewees have the same habitat but are found in different regions and do not co-occur. A model blind to geographical information might predict both species in the same place, which is undesirable when producing maps for conservation planning, and could also impede training. We propose to use **range maps** from eBird, constructing binary masks to zero-out the predicted encounter rates of species when a given location falls outside of their geographical range. For location \(l\), the range mask \(r_{l}\) is a vector of size equal to the number of bird species, and \(r_{l}^{i}=0\) if \(l\) is outside of species \(i\) geographical range, and \(r_{l}^{i}=1\) otherwise. If the range map is not available for a species, the predictions are left untouched (\(r_{l}^{i}=1\) for all species). For species \(i\), if \(z_{l}^{i}\) is the logit, the final prediction is then \(_{l}^{(i)}=(z_{l}^{i})*r_{l}^{(i)}\).

### Evaluation metrics

Beyond optimization for common regression metrics (MSE, MAE), it is desirable for the predicted most likely species in a given hotspot to coincide with those that have been observed most frequently. In fact, while we model many species jointly, our targets are zero-inflated due to the absence of species at many hotspots, which is a frequent challenge in SDM [46; 38]. We therefore report top-10 and top-30 accuracies, representing for \(k=10\) and \(k=30\) the number of species present in both the top \(k\) predicted species and the top \(k\) observed species, divided by \(k\). However, the number of species observed varies considerably across hotspots (Figure 3), unlike in the GeoLifeCLEF challenge for which there is only one ground truth species for each hotspot. We therefore also define an _adaptive top-\(k\) accuracy_ as the top-\(k\) value where \(k\) is the total number of species observed at that hotspot.

## 6 Experiments

### Experimental details

In our experiments, we consider a region of interest of 640 m\({}^{2}\), center-cropping the satellite patches to size \(64 64\) around the hotspot and normalizing the bands with our training set statistics. When adding environmental data, we match their resolution to that of the satellite images. Random vertical and horizontal flipping, random noise, blur, contrast and brightness were used for data augmentation. Models are trained with cross entropy loss: \(_{CE}=}_{h}_{h}=}_{ h}-y_{h}^{s}(_{h}^{s})-(1-y_{h}^{s})(1-_{h}^{s})\), where \(N_{h}\) is the number of hotspots \(h\), \(y\) the predictions and \(\) the ground truth encounter rates.

Satlas and SatMAE models use the true color images as input. They do not support the use of environmental data. The input is further processed by normalizing its values between 0 and 1. For MOSAIKS, we extracted 1024 features for each true color image, combined them with the environmental data and trained an XGBoost regressor on them. For the ResNet-18-based models, we experiment with different inputs: RGB true color images, RGBNIR reflectance values, and RGBNIR reflectance values combined with the bioclimatic and pedologic data. We normalize the bioclimatic and pedologic data variable-wise with training set statistics, aligning them to the satellite images' resolution and stacking the corresponding patches to the images.

All models were trained with batch size \(128\) using Adam  optimizer. Each experiment is run on 3 seeds and results report the average of 3 seeds on the test set. Training, validation and test sets follow the splitting described in Section 4. All ResNet-18 models were trained for \(50\) epochs. Satlas and SatMAE were trained for \(100\) epochs, freezing the pretrained model and training only the last layer. More details about experiments including resources used are available in Appendix B.

### Results & discussion

In this section, we present results for all our baseline models using SatBird-USA-summer and SatBird-USA-winter shown in Tables 2 and 3 respectively. Validation set results for both datasets are reported in Appendix C.We also report baselines for SatBird-Kenya in Appendix D.

We observe that models trained with satellite images only, either the true color image or the reflectance values, do not outperform the environmental baseline. However, combining satellite images with environmental rasters results in a significant improvement, in all metrics, with the highest improvement in the top-30 (13%), top-k (4%), and top-10 (8%) metrics in SatBird-USA-summer and improvement in the top-30 (10%), top-k (4%), and top-10 (5%) metric for SatBird-USA-winter, compared to the environmental baseline. This highlights the value of satellite data for our task, and also the importance of using both environmental and remote sensing data. The models using environmental data along with either RGBNIR reflectance images or RGB visual images achieve nearly-equal competitive results, but our best models use RGB images, along with environmental data, titled ResNet-18 (img+env) in Tables 2 and 3. We suggest incorporating other information as input such as land cover and altitude data which can be obtained from publicly available sources [18; 11] for further improvements.

For the transformer-based models, both Satlas and SatMAE do not outperform ResNet-18 when applied to the true color image only. This observation suggests that we may need further finetuning for these models on our data rather than freezing the model weights. We note that Satlas outperformsSatMAE, likely because the former was pre-trained on a very large dataset of Sentinel-2 images which is the same source (and has the same resolution) as our images. For SatMAE, the model was pretrained on the fMoW dataset with a higher resolution (0.5m) than the images in our dataset. MOSAIKS also performs reasonably well compared to other deep models (ResNet-18 for example) for the true color image and environmental raster input, considering that it is a computationally lightweight model.

We also observe in Tables 2 and 3 that using RGBNIR reflectance bands as input yields better results than using true color images (while not using environmental data), given the information added by the NIR channel. This aligns with previous conclusions  that remote sensing indices using the NIR band, such as the NDVI improve the performance of SDMs. Moreover, adding range maps, does not hurt the model but it does not seem to add a significant contribution. Range maps can still be useful in cases where the data is not as abundant as SatBird-USA-summer. In particular, we still recommend to use this approach whenever available with smaller-sized datasets. We had experiments with using latitude and longitude as inputs to a location encoder, concatenating their features with the model features but we found lower performance for this baseline (see Appendix B.5).

## 7 Conclusion

In this work, we present and release SatBird, a large-scale dataset for species distribution modeling using remote sensing and citizen science data. SatBird includes datasets in the USA for summer and winter seasons and one dataset in Kenya. We detail the process for building SatBird, as well as using it with different models. We also present benchmark results for the dataset on a wide range of popular remote sensing algorithms. Two limitations of the present work include using a single satellite image to represent a season, while the landscape can change over time, and that satellite images are extracted from one recent year, while eBird data is aggregated across multiple recent years.

We are planning a next version of SatBird that will include multiple satellite images for each hotspot to account for changes over time. We also aim to expand SatBird using citizen science data for other organisms, not merely birds (this is more challenging since most such datasets are presence-only).

As SatBird is intended to directly impact biodiversity monitoring, we look forward to integrating the approaches we have introduced into existing tools for ecology and policy. One immediate application for models trained on SatBird is eBird's existing tool that lists the "likely species" in a given area, to be available for poorly monitored locations. This tool currently relies on encounter rates from past checklists and is therefore only available in well-monitored locations. Models trained on SatBird could estimate such encounter rates for poorly monitored locations via remote sensing. We hope such input will be valuable to researchers seeking to understand biodiversity and climate change, as well as policymakers interested in evaluating conservation priorities across different areas of land.
