###### Abstract

Multimodal large language models have fueled progress in image captioning. These models, fine-tuned on vast image datasets, exhibit a deep understanding of semantic concepts. In this work, we show that this ability can be re-purposed for audio captioning, where the joint image-language decoder can be leveraged to describe auditory content associated with image sequences within videos featuring audiovisual content. This can be achieved via multimodal alignment. Yet, this multimodal alignment task is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. Moreover, multimodal representation learning often relies on contrastive learning, facing the challenge of the so-called modality gap which hinders smooth integration between modalities. In this work, we introduce a novel methodology for bridging the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those of an image captioner. Our approach aligns the audio token distribution with that of the image tokens, enabling the model to perform zero-shot audio captioning in an unsupervised fashion while keeping the initial image captioning component unaltered. This alignment allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. Our method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.1

## 1 Introduction

Recent progress in image captioning has been driven by methods integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with vision encoders [(1; 2; 3)]. The impressive capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) stem from _supervised_ training on large image-text collections and extensive parameterization. Even the smallest VLMs exceed more than a billion parameters [(4; 5)]. These models excel in generating human-like text descriptions for images and understanding complex semantic relationships. Such capabilities can be potentially extended to other tasks, beyond image analysis.

One such task is audio captioning, in which large-scale audio-text collections, with precise descriptions of the audio content, are lacking. Recent works have proposed diverse solutions to address this limitation. Solutions include augmenting class labels with phrases such as "_This is a sound of_" [(6; 7)] or prompting LLMs to generate natural language descriptions directly from class labels [(8)]. Further, datasets from related domains like Speech [(9)] or Music [(10; 11)], have been considered to enlarge training data. While such methods show impressive results, scaling them further is challenging due to the rarity and low quality of such labels-captions. In particular, these approaches cannot cope with the annotation noise encountered in existing audio datasets, especially in the largely adopted resource: audio tracks of AudioSet [(12)], which is only partially and weakly labeled.

We hypothesize that VLM-based image captioning models, inherently possess the knowledge to perform audio captioning. Thus, joint image-language representations of VLMs can be used to describe auditory content associated with image sequences from videos featuring audiovisual content, eliminating the need for handcrafted audio-caption pairs. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to leverage VLMs for this purpose. Extending VLMs to audio captioning is non-trivial due to the inherent disparity between audible and visible elements in real-world videos. For instance, sound-producing objects in images may be occluded or out of view, while visible objects might not generate sound. This mismatch hinders connecting visual and auditory modalities seamlessly.

Multimodal representation learning [(13)], crucial for tasks like image captioning, is often accomplished through contrastive learning [(14; 6)]. This paradigm aligns features across modalities by maximizing agreement between similar samples and minimizing agreement between dissimilar ones. Despite its effectiveness, contrastive learning faces the so-called "modality gap", where embedded data are represented in distinct, non-overlapping regions of the embedding space [(15; 16)] (the distance between red and green manifolds in Figure 1), limiting flexibility when conditioning modalities.

We propose a novel methodology to bridge the audiovisual modality gap by matching the distributions of tokens produced by an audio backbone and those from the encoder of an image captioner (represented as the green and blue manifolds in Figure 1), enabling the image captioner to perform **zero-shot** audio captioning in an **unsupervised** way. We define _zero-shot audio captioning_ as the task of generating audio captions without training on manually assembled audio-caption pairs. We propose and compare two token distribution alignment methods: one based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) [(17)] and a more flexible alternative using Optimal Transport (OT) [(18)], possibly enhanced with a cross-attention mechanism. This mechanism refines distribution matching by attending to each token within a modality and determining its match with a token from the other modality based on semantic similarity. We find this approach to result in more accurate and coherent joint audiovisual representations.

Acknowledging the challenges of zero-shot audio captioning, we enhance caption quality using "prefix tuning", a technique commonly employed across domains to adapt LLMs to diverse tasks in a few-shot manner [(19; 20; 21)]. This tuning process conditions the model with few image-audio caption pairs, prompting it to generate audio-centric captions and thereby boosting performance across standard audio captioning metrics [(22; 23; 24; 25; 26; 27)].

Notably, our methodology allows for the use of either audio or audiovisual input by combining or substituting the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder. As a result, our approach extends the ability of the VLM to audio captioning without compromising its image performance. Moreover, the method achieves significantly improved performances in zero-shot audio captioning, compared to existing approaches.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:

* We introduce a novel methodology for unsupervised zero-shot audio captioning through Distribution ALIgnment (DALI), leveraging advanced image captioning models, and suc

cessfully instantiate it with a particular image captioner (namely Llava 1.5), as we obtain state-of-the-art zero-shot audio captioning results without any supervision from annotated audio data (see Section 5).
* To bridge the "modality gap", we propose and study two multimodal token distribution alignment methods exploiting MMD or Optimal Transport (OT). The latter--never used before in this context--is enhanced with a cross-attention mechanism for greater robustness.
* We introduce the use of prefix tuning to guide the image captioner towards audio captioning, adapting the model with a few shots of image and audio-caption pairs (only using the textual descriptions of sound and not the audio signals).
* Finally, our method supports both audio and audiovisual inputs, extending the image captioner's capabilities without compromising its performance in image analysis tasks.

## 2 Related works

Vision Language modelsLarge Vision Language Models (VLMs) typically use a pre-trained LLM that processes both visual and textual information. The image encoder usually consists of a ViT [(28)] trained via multimodal contrastive learning using millions of image-text pairs such as the ones used in CLIP [(14)]. Integrating visual information into the LLM is usually done by concatenating image tokens extracted by a vision encoder and then further transformed by an MLP, with textual tokens from a prompt. This straightforward architecture can be easily adapted to other modalities by simply replacing the input tokens to accommodate the new input modality.

Audio Language modelsRecently, a similar paradigm emerged in the audio application domain. Various works rely on both LLMs and audio encoders trained jointly on millions of audio-text pairs, similarly to CLAP [(6)]. Listen Think and Understand (LTU) [(29)], Pengi [(11)], QwenAudio [(9)] and AudioFlamingo[(10)] rely on a language model fed with tokens from both audio and text modalities. These large models require substantial volumes of training data. For instance, AudioFlamingo has been trained on nearly all publicly available labeled audio data. One limitation is that the quality of the audio-text data is generally not comparable to that of image-text data. This situation is made worse by the fact that audio data labelling is inherently difficult due to the potential overlap of multiple sound sources at different acoustic levels, which sometimes makes it hard to perceive some of the audio classes in presence. Despite this limitation, AudioFlamingo and similar models exhibit remarkable performance. To further enhance the capabilities of audio-language models it is of paramount importance to explore alternative paradigms beyond strong reliance on (often unreliable) annotations and supervised learning. This is the goal pursued in this work.

Audio captioningTraining large audio captioner models, as mentioned previously, requires large volumes of audio and textual descriptions and substantial computational resources. To address this limitation, some approaches leverage existing robust backbones to enable zero-shot audio captioning. ZerAuCaps [(30)] uses CLAP (an 80.8M-parameter model trained on 3.4M audio-text pairs) to infer potential classes from a predefined word bank (45 words) before using them to prompt an LLM (OPT [(31)] 1.3B), generating multiple plausible captions. The final caption is the closest to the audio in the CLAP space. However, this method is constrained by the finite set of classes in the word bank, limiting its application to predefined scenarios. The most closely related work to ours is that of Shaharabany et al. [(32)] who also performed unsupervised zero-shot audio captioning. The authors adopted the audio encoder of ImageBind [(33)] (86M parameters trained on AudioSet), a multimodal model trained to align various modalities in the image space via a contrastive loss. They fine-tuned a GPT-2 [(34)] model (117M parameters) fed with ImageBind audio tokens using two distinct loss functions for the captioning task: an audibility score ensures the generation of audio-centric captions without visual artifacts, while an ImageBind score measures the similarity between the generated caption and the audio. Despite its innovative approach, its performance falls short compared to ZerAuCaps primarily due to ImageBind's less effective handling of audio.

Audiovisual AlignmentMultimodal alignment aims to encode information from different modalities such as text, image, or audio into a shared semantic space, enabling cross-modal relationships and multimodal retrieval (_e.g._, retrieve the image closest to a caption) [(13)]. Despite the abundance of web video datasets, aligning the audio and image/video modalities remains a challenge. The conventional contrastive loss [(35)] often fails to effectively co-train the encoders. Unlike the relatively clean associations in image-text pairs, audio-image pairs present a greater degree of variability, with the content described in the audio often differing from that depicted in the corresponding image or video. Consequently, stable pre-training needs augmenting the contrastive loss with a reconstruction loss [(36; 37; 38)], reducing the similarity of the representations between the two modalities.

## 3 Method

Current Large Vision Language Models (VLMs) exhibit a sophisticated understanding of concepts related to real-world objects in the visual domain. This capability arises from optimizing the language model, already containing a lot of intrinsic knowledge, so as to extract additional information from image features and learn how to describe the (visual) world. We hypothesize that the knowledge gained through this process is sufficiently general to be transferable across different modalities. To test this hypothesis, we developed a methodology that employs an VLM's image captioner to generate audio captions from images, audios and audiovisual inputs, **while preserving the original performance of the image captioner.** Our methodology stands out for its applicability to any modality requiring integration with image data. Here, we focus on audiovisual alignment for audio captioning, benefiting from the abundance of audiovisual content in videos from web data.

### Proposed Framework Overview

An image captioning system outputs descriptions of objects in an image, such as "A dog in the grass," providing visual cues. To adapt this system for audio captioning, we need it to focus on audible information instead of visuals. For example, given an image of a dog, the audio caption should instead be "A dog is barking.". Our methodology enables audio captioning from an image captioner by keeping both the image encoder and LLM frozen, ensuring that the image captioner original

Figure 2: Overview of the proposed approach. In the first stage, a prefix tuning is performed using a few (image, audio-caption) pairs (1-a). Additionally, the audio backbone is aligned with the image backbone (1-b) through distribution alignment. Audio captioning can then be performed by switching the image backbone with the audio backbone and adding the prefix tokens (1-c). In a second stage, visually-informed audio captions are generated using both audio, image, and prefix tokens. The MLP mapping the audio encoder to the language model is then fine-tuned with these pseudo captions (2-d). The final inference for audio captioning, using audio or audio visual inputs, is performed by forwarding the aligned audio backbone’s output through the trained MLP to obtain the LLM input (2-e).

performance is preserved. In our work, we choose Llava (1) (Apache License 2.0) as an instance of an image captioner, for its proven effectiveness. We use the CAV-MAE (36) (BSD 2-Clause License) audio model as our audio encoder, since it is already roughly aligned with an image backbone, which is expected to help reach faster convergence.

As seen in Figure 2, we follow a 2-stage process. First, we use prefix tuning to start re-tasking the system for audio captioning, learning tokens from a few image-caption pairs, ensuring that the textual descriptions target the audio content (stage 1, step (a)). We also align the token distribution of an audio encoder with that of the image encoder (stage 1, step (b)), then replace the image encoder with the aligned audio encoder for direct audio captioning from audio files (step (c)). We can also combine both encoders for visually informed audio captioning, using both audio and visual inputs. This setup generates audio captions to fine-tune the MLP that maps audio tokens to the language model embedding space, a process we call audiovisual distillation (stage 2, step (d)). The fine-tuned MLP then replaces the original MLP, generating robust audio captions from audio or audiovisual inputs (step (e)). In the following, we zoom on specific aspects of the proposed methodology.

Prefix-tuning with image-caption pairsImage captioners, while effective for image analysis tasks, struggle to produce accurate audio-centric descriptions when prompted to describe sounds from images. For example, when asked, "What sounds can the objects in this image generate?", the descriptions provided heavily reflect the visual characteristics of the objects. Instead of focusing on sound-related details, their outputs are dominated by visual descriptions, which are considered artifacts in the context of audio captioning. To address this problem, we adopted a prompt tuning strategy (39), aiming to guide the model to generate captions that exclusively describe audible events as depicted in Figure 2-a. Prompt tuning involves learning a portion of the prompt tokens: the prefix, that guides the model to perform a specified task (39). This method allows the rest of the model to remain frozen, and by simply removing the learned tokens, the model is able to perform its original task with the same performance. This approach requires only a small number of parameters to be trained and can be effectively trained using a few examples, a process akin to **few-shot adaptation**. We employed this technique to re-task the model to perform audio captioning. We trained the additional tokens using image-text pairs, with the text describing the sounds associated with the images _i.e._, audio captions. Specifically, we used images from AudioSet videos and corresponding captions from AudioCaps (40) (MIT). We used negative log-likelihood as the loss function for the prefix tuning:

\[_{}=-_{n=1}^{N}_{j=1}^{l} p_{}(C_{j} ^{n}|I_{1}^{n},...,I_{n_{i}}^{n},C_{1}^{n},...,C_{j-1}^{n})\;;\] (1)

with \(n\) and \(j\) being respectively the image and caption token indices, \(N\) the number of elements in the batch, \(l\) the number of predicted tokens, the index \(I\) referring to the vision tokens (from 1 to \(n_{i}\)), \(C_{j}\) the \(j\)-th caption token and \(\) the parameters of the model. Using the prefix tokens, the image captioner can now output more plausible sound descriptions.

Audio captioning via token distribution alignmentAligning the distribution of the audio encoder with that of the image one allows for substituting one encoder with another and therefore conditioning the generation either on the audio or image modality. We align the distributions (Figure 2: step (b)) using either Maximum Mean Discrepancy or Optimal Transport. More details are provided in Section 3.2. Using the aligned audio backbone, as represented in Figure 2: step (c), we feed the language model with the audio tokens along with the prefix, which enables the model to perform audio captioning. Additionally, we incorporate both the image and audio tokens, to give the ability to the model to perform audio captioning fusing visual and audible cues. This setup allows us to infer and generate, visually informed, audio captions for AudioSet balanced (12), a standard subset of AudioSet, containing \(\) 20k videos, curated such that they involve the same number of samples for each class.

Audiovisual distillationThe captions generated from audiovisual inputs serve as pseudo-labels to supervise the fine-tuning process of an audio captioner with an audio-only setup. This process refines only the MLP that maps the audio tokens to the LLM embedding space. Training employs a negative log-likelihood loss, as per equation (1), albeit without conditioning on image tokens. Instead of relying on a limited number of real captions, pseudo-labels are employed. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 2: step (d), and optimized through the following loss:

\[_{}=-_{n=1}^{N}_{j=1}^{l} p_{}(C_{j}^{n }|A_{1}^{n},...,A_{n_{a}}^{n},C_{1}^{n},...,C_{j-1}^{n})\ ;\] (2)

with \(A\) referring to the audio tokens (from 1 to \(n_{a}\)).

Audio captioning via audio or audiovisual inputsWith all components trained, our model can perform audio captioning using the aligned audio encoder and fine-tuned audio MLP, or visual-informed audio captioning by feeding to the LLM the image tokens in addition to the audio tokens (shown in Figure 2: step (e)). Notably, the original image captioning task can still be performed at its original performance level by using only the image tokens, without the audio.

### Token distribution alignment

Many studies on multimodal alignment typically use a contrastive loss on the averaged output tokens [14; 41]. This method merely aligns token mean-statistics, potentially leading to information loss, when the full token distribution is needed. Llava (1) for instance, makes use of the full token distribution as input, naturally creating the need for a full token distribution alignment, to allow for swapping the pretrained encoder with a new one targeting a new modality. Moreover, contrastive learning faces the so-called "modality gap" problem where each modality is encoded in distinct sub-regions of the embedding space (see Figure 4). For all these reasons, replacing image tokens with audio tokens obtained by alignment through a contrastive learning approach may yield undesirable responses from the language model. In light of these issues, we propose to learn the full image token distributions, rather than relying solely on contrastive learning, so as to facilitate knowledge transfer. We refer to our distribution alignment framework as DALI which stands for Distribution ALIgnment. We study two variants of distribution matching.

Modality alignment through MMDMaximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) serves as a robust measure of dissimilarity--or more specifically, discrepancy--between two probability distributions. MMD has been shown to be effective in distribution alignment, notably, but not exclusively, for domain adaptation [42; 43]. It computes the distance between the expected values of two distributions, denoted by \(P\) and \(Q\), within a feature space characterized by a mapping \(:X\) where \(\) is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS):

\[(P,Q)=||_{X P}[(X)]-_{Y Q}[(Y)] ||_{}\.\] (3)

In practice the MMD is computed using the kernel trick . In our work, we consider the Gaussian Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel and use MMD as a loss function to directly align the audio and image token distributions. We term this distribution alignment through MMD: \(_{}\).

Modality alignment through Optimal TransportOptimal Transport (OT) stands out as a powerful method for aligning probability distributions . Despite its successful application across various domains such as unsupervised domain adaptation , image generation , and style transfer , its application to multimodal representation alignment remains relatively unexplored. In our context, where the alignment of audiovisual modalities is paramount, OT emerges as a natural solution for its intrinsic capacity to integrate the geometry of the underlying space, enabling optimal distribution matching. Discrete optimal transport considers two distributions \(x^{N}\) and \(y^{M}\), where \(N\)and \(M\) represent the number of samples in each distribution. These distributions are represented by their empirical measures: \(=_{i=1}^{N}_{i}_{x_{i}}\) and \(=_{j=1}^{M}_{j}_{y_{j}}\), and OT seeks a coupling \((,)\) between them that minimizes a transportation cost. The problem can be formalized as:

\[(,)=_{(,)},D _{}\ ;\] (4)

where \(D^{N M}\) is the cost matrix, \(,_{}\) denotes the Frobenius dot product, and \(^{N M}\) represents the transportation coupling matrix. The minimum of the optimization problem can be interpreted as a distance . When considering the square of the \(l_{2}\) norm, the distance is known as the Earth Mover Distance (EMD). In this work, we align the audio and image token distributions using EMD and refer to this approach as Distribution ALIgnment through Optimal Transport (\(_{}\)).

Improving cross-modal correspondence with attentive distribution alignmentOptimal transport is typically applied assuming uniform distributions of the weights \(\{_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}\) and \(\{_{j}\}_{j=1}^{M}\). However, in audiovisual content, objects producing sound are often occluded, with the visual information serving to complement the auditory content. The classic formulation of OT enforces strict mass preservation, needing that all mass from the source distribution is transported to the target distribution. This constraint becomes problematic in audiovisual alignment, where not all tokens from one modality may find a match in the other. While alternative methods exist to circumvent these constraints, such as Unbalanced Optimal Transport (UOT) [(49)], which replaces this rigid requirement with a soft penalization term, the tuning of such hyper-parameter poses significant challenges [(50)]. Alternatively, we propose learning the weights \(_{i}\) and \(_{j}\) via a cross-attention mechanism which offers as well a robust approach. This mechanism, attending to both modalities, enables learning which objects and/or sound-related tokens are present in both modalities. Tokens encoding modality-specific information, e.g., an occluded source, or an object apparently not generating a sound, receive lower weights. Thus, this approach promotes the alignment of modality-shared content. We provide the details of this cross-attention mechanism in Appendix F. It is important to note that to avoid the trivial solution that would put all the weights to 0 except the one of the closest tokens, we regularize the entropy of the weights.

The final loss consists of a weighted sum of the optimal transport distance and the entropy of distribution weights:

\[(x,y,^{},^{})=(x,y,^ {},^{})-((^{})+(^{})),\] (5)

where \(()\) denotes the Shannon entropy and \((x,y,^{},^{})\) represents the optimal transport between \(^{}\) and \(^{}\), the weights at the output of the attention mechanism, with the cost matrix computed from \(x\) and \(y\). An intuitive depiction of the method is illustrated in Figure 3. Note that the cross-attention layers are only used for training and discarded afterward. We refer to this alignment method as DALIGT.

## 4 Experiments

Our experiments focus on AudioSet, a widely explored large-scale collection of videos from YouTube. We evaluate our proposed approach on two popular and publicly available human-annotated audio captioning datasets: AudioCaps and Clotho (Tampere University licence), using conventional audio captioning metrics. We also provide details of our training and fine-tuning procedures.

DatasetsAudioSet [(12)] is a dataset (license CC BY 4.0) composed of 2 million YouTube videos with annotations indicating the presence of environmental sound events at the clip level (without precise time location), spanning 527 classes. The dataset includes reliability scores for annotations, some below 50%. Despite a diverse range of classes, a significant portion predominantly features music or speech content. Many videos show notable disparities between their visual and auditory content, thus attempting to align audio and image representations without any pre-filtering of the content is challenging. Similarly to Nagrani et al. [(51)], who filtered the dataset by balancing the classes, we train our models on a subset of 500k videos from AudioSet. We chose them by computing the similarity between the noisy audio labels and an image caption generated by BLIP-2(52) (chosen for the conciseness of the captions), to remove the biggest discrepancies between images and audios. More details on this filtering process are given in Appendix C. For each video, we extracted 10 frames (the first of each second), and we randomly chose, during training, one of these 10 frames for each video.

Figure 3: Multimodal distribution alignment through optimal transport. The audio and image tokens are used to compute the cost matrix, while two separate cross-attention layers estimate the weights \(^{}\) and \(^{}\).

Evaluation metricsWe evaluated our system on all known audio captioning datasets which are publicly available: AudioCaps (40) which contains AudioSet audio samples captioned by humans, and Clotho (53), which is composed of audio samples from FreeSound, also annotated by humans. Performance was measured using 3 standard captioning metrics: METEOR (24), ROUGE-L (23), and SPIDEr (27), which combines both the CIDEr (25) and SPICE (26) scores. Additional evaluation metrics are available in Appendix G. We evaluate our model in the context of zero-shot audio captioning, comparing it against other models in the field. All the training details and hyper parameters are given in Appendix E.

## 5 Results and discussion

Audio Captioning performanceTable 5 presents the audio captioning performance of our methods on the AudioCaps test set, using 16 image captions to train the prefix tokens. We show the relatively small importance of the number of pairs in the audio captioning learning process in Appendix A. Our study compares the alignment variants considered in our zero-shot audio captioning framework against the current state-of-the-art methods, which employ audio encoders trained in either a supervised or an unsupervised manner. Our results indicate that the alignment through contrastive learning without audiovisual distillation does not fully match distributions, compared to DALI. Indeed, even without audiovisual distillation, DALI\({}_{}\) and DALI\({}_{}^{}\) significantly outperform Shaharabany et al. (32), this system being our closest competitor, as it relies on a backbone trained in an unsupervised fashion.

Without audiovisual distillation, DALI\({}_{}\) performs comparably to DALI\({}_{}^{}\), however, the latter improves with audiovisual distillation. We hypothesize that this occurs because DALI\({}_{}\) is trained to learn the complete image token distribution, while DALI\({}_{}^{}\) only learns a part of it (due to the attentive optimal transport mechanism). Therefore DALI\({}_{}^{}\) features can take more advantage of the combination with image tokens. We verify qualitatively this hypothesis in the Discussion paragraph below. Interestingly, both DALI\({}_{}\) and the contrastive backbone benefit from the audiovisual distillation. Given the relatively low-performance scores prior to the distillation process, it is plausible that they primarily learn from the image captioner (as the audiovisual pseudo captions tend to rely solely on visual features due to the inadequate audio representations) which is shown to be already performing well for audio captioning (first line of results). We hypothesize that the second stage is effective even for poorly aligned backbones because the distillation occurs on a subset of AudioSet where the images align well with the audio. If this distillation were applied to the entire dataset, the performance of these backbones might decline substantially. These hypotheses will require further investigation in future work. Lastly, it is important to note that feeding the image tokens in addition to the DALI\({}_{}^{}\) ones, increases even more the performances, leaving the door open for further improvements.

are sourced from FreeSound, a dataset distinct from AudioSet. Consequently, our model, having been trained solely on AudioSet's audio excerpts and images, may encounter unfamiliar concepts in Clotho, thereby testing its capacity for generalization. Table 6 presents the models' performance on Clotho's test set. The observed trends are consistent with those on AudioCaps where \(_{}\) does not benefit from audiovisual distillation, while \(_{}^{}\) does. However, the absolute results differ, as \(_{}\) marginally outperforms \(_{}^{}\) even after the second training stage. We posit that the image bias inherent in \(_{}\) becomes beneficial when confronted with out-of-distribution data. Indeed what may be regarded as out-of-distribution for the audio backbone might have been seen by the image one (due to its bigger training set). Consequently, the learning of the image backbone's bias could potentially be beneficial. Notably, our method outperforms Saleswki et al., despite the fact that the latter employs a backbone trained using millions of audio-text pairs (CLAP). It is important to note that our method differs from Saleswki et al. in that we perform unsupervised instead of supervised zero-shot audio captioning.

## 6 Conclusion

We presented a novel methodology for unsupervised zero-shot audio captioning, effectively leveraging advanced image captioning models, such as Llava. We adapted it to the audio captioning task by making use of prefix tuning and using innovative token distribution alignment techniques (using MMD or optimal transport with a cross-attention mechanism) that successfully bridged the modality gap between audio and visual inputs. Our comprehensive evaluation, both quantitative and qualitative, demonstrates that our method achieves state-of-the-art results in unsupervised zero-shot audio captioning. Remarkably, our approach, not using any audio recordings, not only matches but even sometimes, exceeds the performance of existing methods that rely on a backbone trained with extensive audio-text data such as CLAP. Moreover, our method requires only raw videos without any audio annotations, significantly enhancing its potential scalability. This positions our approach as a promising direction as a leading direction for the future of audio captioning.

LimitationsAlthough capable of addressing partial audiovisual mismatches, our method remains insufficiently robust to complete cross-modal mismatches, such as instances where the image is entirely unrelated to the audio. We reserve addressing this limitation for future work. Moreover, to achieve even higher performance in audio captioning, our method would benefit from a degree of supervision. The requirement for an external supervisory source (_e.g._, audio-text pairs) arises due to the method's dependence on audiovisual alignments, which makes it challenging to learn certain sounds because they cannot be seen. For example, it is almost impossible to generate a caption for the sound of the wind by merely using images.

Table 3: Clotho audio captioning performance. Similarly to AudioCaps, \(_{}^{}\) is performing, however, \(_{}\) gives slightly better results. The bias learned by matching the complete image distribution seems to be beneficial for out-of-domain samples. (\({}^{*}\)): Trained in a supervised fashion using audio-caption pairs.
