###### Abstract

In today's era, whatever we can measure at scale, we can optimize. So far, measuring the interpretability of units in deep neural networks (DNNs) for computer vision still requires direct human evaluation and is not scalable. As a result, the inner workings of DNNs remain a mystery despite the remarkable progress we have seen in their applications. In this work, we introduce the first scalable method to measure the per-unit interpretability in vision DNNs. This method does not require any human evaluations, yet its prediction correlates well with existing human interpretability measurements. We validate its predictive power through an interventional human psychophysics study. We demonstrate the usefulness of this measure by performing previously infeasible experiments: (1) A large-scale interpretability analysis across more than 70 million units from 835 computer vision models, and (2) an extensive analysis of how units transform during training. We find an anti-correlation between a model's downstream classification performance and per-unit interpretability, which is also observable during model training. Furthermore, we see that a layer's location and width influence its interpretability. Online version, code and interactive visualizations available at brendel-group.github.io/mis.

## 1 Introduction

With the arrival of the first non-trivial neural networks, researchers got interested in understanding their inner workings [24; 26]. For one, this can be motivated by scientific curiosity; for another, a better understanding might lead to building more reliable, efficient, or fairer models. While the performance of machine learning models has seen a remarkable improvement over the last few years, our understanding of information processing has progressed more slowly. Nevertheless, understanding how complex models -- e.g., language models  or vision models [34; 50] -- work is still an active and growing field of research, coined _mechanistic interpretability_. A common approach in this field is to divide a network into atomic units, hoping they are easier to comprehend. Here, atomic units might refer to individual neurons or channels of (convolutional) layers , or general vectors in feature space [12; 23]. Besides this approach, mechanistic interpretability also includes the detection of neural circuits [8; 12] or analysis of global network properties .

The goal of understanding the inner workings of a neural network is inherently human-centric: Irrespective of what tools have been used, in the end, humans should have a better comprehension of the network. However, measuring interpretability through human evaluations is time-consuming and costly due to their reliance on human labor . This results in slower research progress, as validating novel hypotheses takes longer. Removing the need for human labor by automating the interpretability measure can open up multiple high-impact research directions: First, it enables the creation of more interpretable networks by explicitly optimizing for interpretability -- after all, what we can measure at scale, we can optimize. Second, it allows more efficient research on explanation methods and might increase our understanding of neural networks. Due to the lack of a reliable automated measure, previous work resorted to limited time-consuming human evaluations, partially producing inconclusive results [e.g., 7; 39], highlighting the urgency of finding an automated measure.

The present work is the first to introduce a fully automated interpretability measure (Fig. 1A & B) for vision models: the Machine Interpretability Score (MIS). By leveraging the latest advances in image similarity functions aligned with human perception, we obtain a measure that is strongly predictive of human-perceived interpretability (Fig. 1C). We verify our measure through both correlational and interventional experiments. By removing the need for human labor, we can scale existing evaluations up by multiple orders of magnitude. Finally, this work demonstrates potential workflows and use cases of our MIS.

## 2 Related Work

Mechanistic InterpretabilityWhile the overall field of explainable AI (XAI) tries to increase our understanding of neural networks, multiple subbranches with different foci exist . One of these branches, _mechanistic interpretability_, tries to improve our understanding of neural networks by understanding their building blocks . An even more fine-grained branch -- per-unit mechanistic interpretability -- aims to interpret individual units of vision models [3; 48; 4; 27; 34]. We focus exclusively on this branch of research in the present work. This line of research for artificial neural networks was, arguably, inspired by similar efforts in neuroscience for biological neural networks [20; 2; 37].

Different studies set out to understand the behavior and sensitivity of individual units of vision networks - here, a unit can, e.g., be (the spatial average of) a channel in a convolutional neural network (CNN) or a neuron in a multilayer perceptron (MLP). The level of understanding obtained for a unit is commonly called the _per-unit interpretability_; by averaging over a representative subset of units in the network, one obtains the _per-model interpretability_. With the recent progress in vision-language modeling, a few approaches started using textual descriptions of a unit's behavior [18; 21]. However, the majority still uses visual explanations which are either synthesized by performing activation maximization through gradient ascent [34; 13; 26; 30; 28; 46; 31], or strongly activating dataset examples [34; 6]. With the increasing usage of large language models (LLM), there is also now an increasing interest in mechanistic interpretability of them [e.g., 11; 36; 7].

Quantifying InterpretabilityRigorous evaluations, including falsifiable hypothesis testing, are critical for research on interpretability methods . This also encompasses the need for human-centric evaluations [6; 22]. Nevertheless, such human-centric evaluations of interpretability methods are only available in some sub-fields. Specifically for the type of interpretability we are concerned about in this work, i.e., the per-unit interpretability of vision models, two methods for quantifying the helpfulness of explanations to humans were introduced before: Borowski et al.  presented a two-alternative-forced-choice (2-AFC) psychophysics task that requires participants to determine

Figure 1: **Definition of the Machine Interpretability Score.****A.** We build on top of the established task definition for quantifying the per-unit interpretability via human psychophysics experiments . The task measures how well participants understand the sensitivity of a unit by asking them to match strongly activating query images to strongly activating _visual_ explanations of the unit. Red and blue squares illustrate the unitâ€™s minimally and maximally activating images; shaded and solid squares denote natural test images and explanations, respectively. See Fig. 9 for examples. **B.** Crucially, we remove the need for humans and fully automate the evaluation: We pass the explanations and query images through a feature encoder to compute pair-wise image similarities (DreamSim) before using a (hard-coded) binary classifier to solve the underlying task. Finally, the Machine Interpretability Score (MIS) is the average of the predicted probability of the correct choice over \(N\) tasks for the same unit. **C.** The MIS proves to be highly correlated with human interpretability ratings and allows fast evaluations of new hypotheses.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

The classification problem will be solved correctly if the similarity of \(^{+}\) to \(^{+}\) relative to \(^{-}\) is stronger than those of \(^{-}\). This means we can define the probability of solving the binary classification problem correctly as

\[p(^{+},^{-},^{+},^{-}):= _{+}(^{+},^{+},^{-})- _{-}(^{-},^{+},^{-}),\] (4)

where \(\) denotes the sigmoid function and \(\) is a free parameter to calibrate the classifier's confidence.

We define the _Machine Interpretability Score_ (MIS) as the predicted probability of making the right choice, averaged over \(N\) tasks for the same unit. Across these different tasks, the query images \(^{+},^{-}\) vary to cover a wider range of the unit's behavior. If the explanation method used is stochastic, it is advisable to also average over different explanations:

\[=_{i}^{N}p(^{+}_{i},^{-}_{i}, ^{+}_{i},^{-}_{i}).\] (5)

Note that the MIS is not a general property of a unit but depends on the explanation method used. A general score can be defined by aggregating the MIS over multiple explanation methods.

Choice of Hyperparameters.We use the current state-of-the-art perceptual similarity, DreamSim , as \(f\). See Appx. C for a sensitivity study on this choice. DreamSim models the perceptual similarity of two images as the cosine similarity of the images' representations from (multiple) computer vision backbones. These were first pre-trained with, e.g., CLIP-style training  and then fine-tuned to match human annotations for image similarities of pairs of images. We use the mean to aggregate the distances between a query image and multiple explanations to a single scalar, i.e., \(a(x_{1},,x_{K}):=1/K_{i}^{K}x_{i}\). To choose \(\), we use the interpretability annotations of IMI : We optimize \(\) over a randomly chosen subset of just 5% of the annotated units to approximately match the value range of human interpretability scores, resulting in \(=0.16\). Note that \(\) is, in fact, the only free parameter of our metric, resulting in very low chances of overfitting the metric to the IMI dataset. We use the same strategy as Borowski et al. , Zimmermann et al.  and Zimmermann et al.  for generating new tasks (see Appx. A.2). As they used up to \(20\) tasks per unit, we average over \(N=20\). See Appx. D for a sensitivity study.

## 4 Results

This section is structured into two parts: First, we validate our Machine Interpretability Score (MIS) by showing that it is well correlated with existing interpretability annotations. Then, we demonstrate what type of experiments become feasible by having access to such an automated interpretability measure. Our experiments use the best-working -- according to human judgements  -- visual explanation method, dataset examples, for computing the MIS. We demonstrate the applicability of our method to other interpretability methods (e.g., feature visualizations) in Appx. E. Note that different explanation methods might require different hyperparameters for computing the MIS. Both query images and explanations are chosen from the training set of ImageNet-2012 . When investigating layers whose feature maps have spatial dimensions, we consider the spatial mean over a channel as one unit [e.g., 6]. We ignore units with constant activations from our analysis as there is no behavior to understand (see Appx. F for details). The code for all experiments is included in the supplementary material and will be publicly released.

### Validating the Machine Interpretability Score

We validate our MIS measure by using the interpretability annotations in the IMI dataset , which will be referred to as Human Interpretability Scores (HIS). The per-unit annotations are responses to the 2-AFC task described in Sec. 3, averaged over \( 30\) participants. IMI contains scores for a subset of units for nine models.1

#### 4.1.1 MIS Explains Existing Data

First, we reproduce the main result of Zimmermann et al. : A comparison of nine models in terms of their per-unit interpretability. We plot the HIS and MIS values (averaged over all units in a model) in Fig. 2A and find very strong correlations (Pearson's \(r=0.98\) and Spearman's \(r=0.94\)). Reproducing the model ranking is strong evidence for the validity of the metric, as no information about these rankings was explicitly used to create our new measure.

Next, we can zoom in and look at individual units instead of per-model averages. Fig. 2B shows MIS and HIS for all units of IMI. It clearly shows a strong correlation (Pearson's and Spearman's \(_{s}=_{p}=0.80\)). The interpretability scores in IMI are a (potentially noisy) estimate over a finite number of annotators. We estimate the ceiling performance due to noise (sampling \(30\) trials from a Bernoulli distribution) to equal Pearson's \(_{p}=0.82\) (see Appx. C for details). We can conclude that the MIS explains existing interpretability annotations well - both on a per-unit and on a per-model level.

#### 4.1.2 MIS Makes Novel Predictions

While the previous results show a strong relation between MIS and human-perceived interpretability, they are descriptive (correlational). To further test the match between MIS and HIS, we now turn to a causal (interventional) experiment: Instead of predicting the interpretability of units _after_ a psychophysics evaluation produced their human scores, we now compute the MIS _before_ conducting the psychophysics evaluation. We perform our experiment for two models: GoogLeNet and a ResNet-50. For each model, IMI contains interpretability scores for \(96\) randomly chosen units. We look at all the units not tested so far and find the \(42\) units yielding the highest (Easiest, average of \(0.99\) for both models) and lowest (Hardest, average of \(0.63\) and \(0.59\), respectively) MIS, respectively. Then, we use the same setup as Zimmermann et al.  and perform a psychophysical evaluation on Amazon Mechanical Turk with \(236\) participants (Appx. B). We compare the HIS for the random units from the IMI dataset and the two newly recorded groups (easy, hard) of units in Fig. 2C. The results are very clear again: As predicted by the MIS, the HIS is highest for the easiest and lowest for the hardest units. Further, the HIS is close to the _a priori_ determined MIS given above. On this newly collected data, we again find a high correlation between MIS and HIS (Pearson's \(_{p}=0.85\)

Figure 2: **Validation of the MIS.** Our proposed Machine Interpretability Score (MIS) explains existing interpretability annotations (Human Interpretability Score, HIS) from IMI  well. **(A) MIS Explains Interpretability Model Rankings.** The MIS reproduces the ranking of models presented in IMI while being fully automated and not requiring any human labor, as evident by the strong correlation between MIS and HIS. Similar results are found for the interpretability afforded by another explanation method in Appx. E. **(B) MIS Explains Per-unit Interpretability Annotations.** The MIS also explains individual per-unit interpretability annotations. We show the calculated MIS and the recorded HIS for every unit in IMI and find a high correlation matching the noise ceiling at \(=0.80\) (see Appx. C). **(C) MIS Allows Detection of (Non-) Interpretable Units.** We use the MIS to perform a causal intervention and determine the least (_hardest_) and most (_easiest_) interpretable units in a GoogLeNet and ResNet-50. Using the psychophysics setup of Zimmermann et al. , we measure their interpretability and compare them to randomly sampled units. Strikingly, the psychophysics results match the predicted properties: Units with the lowest MIS have significantly lower interpretability than random units, which have significantly lower interpretability than those with the highest MIS. Errorbars denote the \(95\) % confidence interval.

Spearman's \(_{s}=0.81\) ). This demonstrates the strong predictive power of the MIS and its ability to be used for formulating novel hypotheses.

### Analyzing & Comparing Hundreds of Models

After confirming the validity of the MIS, we now change gears and show use cases for it, i.e., analyses that were truly infeasible before due to the high cost of human evaluations required for measuring the per-unit interpretability. These costs prevented fine-grained analyses. Crucially, our understanding of what influences a unit's interpretability is still fairly limited. For example, it is unclear whether units of specific layer types are more interpretable, or whether a layer's position or width influences its units interpretability. Equipped with the proposed MIS we can now investigate these relations.

#### 4.2.1 Comparison of Models

Zimmermann et al.  investigated whether model or training design choices influence the interpretability of vision models. Although they invested a considerable amount of money in this investigation (\( 12\,000\) USD), they could only compare nine models via a subset of units. We now scale up this line of work by two orders of magnitude and investigate all units of 835 models, almost all of which come from the well-established computer vision library timm . These models differ in architecture and training datasets but were all at least fine-tuned on ImageNet. See Appx. J for a list of models. Putting this scale into perspective, achieving the same scale by scaling up previous human psychophysics experiments would amount to the absurd costs of more than one billion USD. Following previous work we ignore the first and last layers of each model .

When sorting the models according to their average MIS (Fig. 3), they span a value range of \( 0.80-0.91\). The strongest differences across models are present at the tails of the ranking. Note that GoogLeNet is ranked as the most interpretable model, resonating with the community's interest in GoogLeNet as it is widely claimed to be more interpretable. The shaded area denotes the \(5\)th to \(95\)th percentile of the distribution across units. This reveals a strong difference in the variability of units for different models; further, as the upper end of the MIS is similar across models (\( 95\) %), most of the change in the average score seems to stem from a change in the lower end, with decreasing width of the per-unit distribution for higher model rank. Note that the MIS cannot only be computed for the most extremely activating query images (see Sec. 3) but also for less activating ones. Refer to Fig. 21 for a version of Fig. 3 that uses the 2nd/98th percentile instead of the most extremely activating query images.

To investigate the difference in how the MIS of units is distributed between different models, we select 15 exemplary models and visualize their per-unit MIS distribution in Fig. 4B. Those models were chosen according to the distance between \(5\)th and \(95\)th percentile (five with highest, average, and lowest distance). While models with low and medium variability have unimodal left-skewed distributions, the ones with high variability have a rather bimodal distribution. Note that the distribu

Figure 3: **Comparison of the Average Per-unit MIS for Models.** We substantially extend the analysis of Zimmermann et al.  from a noisy average over a few units for a few models to all units of 835 models. The models are compared regarding their average per-unit interpretability (as judged by MIS); the shaded area depicts the 5th to 95th percentile over units. We see that all models fall into an intermediate performance regime, with stronger changes in interpretability at the tails of the model ranking. Models probed by Zimmermann et al.  are highlighted in red.

tion's second, stronger mode has a similar mean and shape to the overall distribution for models with low variability. The first mode is placed at a value range slightly above \(0.5\), close to the task's chance level, indicating mostly uninterpretable units. This suggests that a subset of uninterpretable units (see Fig. 28 for examples) can explain most of the models' differences in average MIS. We analyze this further in Fig. 22, where we compare the models in terms of their worst units. We see a similar shape as in Fig. 3, but with a larger value range used, resulting in stronger model differences.

Previous work analyzed a potential correlation between interpretability and downstream classification performance. However, in a limited evaluation, it was found that better classifiers are not necessarily more interpretable . A re-evaluation of this question is performed in Fig. 4A and paints an even darker picture: Here, better performing ImageNet classifiers are less interpretable (Pearson's \(r=-0.5\) and Spearman's \(r=-0.55\)). A similar analysis investigating the influence of a model's input resolution on its interpretability suggests no influence (see Fig. 19).

Besides analyzing the interpretability of models, one can also use the MIS to analyze interpretability tools. Above, we directly looked at the interpretability of a model's activations; however, recent work proposed leveraging sparse auto-encoders (SAE) to first transform a model's activations into a potentially more interpretable basis before analyzing it [e.g., 7]. While their application has been mostly limited to language models (with the exception of ), we now apply them to vision models in a first exploratory analysis: In Appx. I, we use the MIS to compare the interpretability of a model's original layer and of two competing SAE variants  and find no systematic difference.

Refer to Tab. 2 for a list of the Pareto-optimal models. (B) Distribution of per-unit MIS. Distribution of the per-unit MIS for 15 models, chosen based on the size of the error bar in Fig. 3: lowest (top row), medium (middle row), and highest variability (bottom row). While most models have an unimodal distribution, those with high variability have a second mode with lower MIS.**

Fig. 5: **Comparison of the Average Per-unit MIS for Different Layer Types and Models. We show the average interpretability of units from the most common layer types in vision models (BatchNorm, Conv, GroupNorm, LayerNorm, Linear). We follow Zimmermann et al.  and restrict our analysis of Vision Transformers to the linear layers in each attention head. While not every layer type is used by every model, we still see some separation between types (see Fig. 18 for significance results): Linear and convolutional layers mostly outperform normalization layers. Models are sorted by average per-unit interpretability, as in Fig. 3.**

#### 4.2.2 Comparison of Layers

Next, we zoom into the results of Fig. 3 and investigate potential differences between layers. First, we are interested in testing whether the layer type is important, e.g., are convolutional more interpretable than normalization or linear layers? In Fig. 5, we sort the models by their average MIS over all layer types but show individual points for each of the five most common types (Conv, Linear, BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and GroupNorm). The number of points per model may vary, as not all models contain layers of all types. The figure shows a benefit of Conv over BatchNorm layers, which themselves are better than LayerNorm layers. Linear layers, if present, outperform both Batch- and LayerNorm as well as Conv layers. While the differences are small, they are statistically significant due to the large number of scores collected (see Fig. 18).

Second, we analyze whether the location of a layer inside a model plays a role, e.g., are earlier layers more interpretable than later ones? The average per-unit MIS (for each layer type) is shown in Fig. 6A as a function of the relative depth of the layer. A value of zero corresponds to the first and a value of one to the last layer analyzed. The scores are averaged in bins of equal count defined by the relative layer depth to enhance readability. The resulting curves all follow a similar pattern: They start high, decrease in the first fifth, then increase steadily until they drop in the last tenth again, resulting in an almost sinusoidal shape.

Third, it is interesting to probe the influence of the width of layers on their average interpretability. Based on the superposition hypothesis [12; 35; 1; 16], one might expect wider layers to be more interpretable as features do not have to form in superposition (i.e., as _polysemantic_ units) but can arise in a disentangled form (i.e., as _monosemantic_ units). Fig. 6B shows the relation between MIS and relative layer width. We use the relative rather than the absolute width to reduce the influence of the overall model and show the results of models with different architectures on the same axis. Note that, nevertheless, there might be other confounding factors correlated with the width, e.g., the layer depth. While we only see a weak correlation for BatchNorm layers, we find a stronger one for Conv/Linear layers. It is unclear what causes this difference in behavior. However, we see this as a hint that one way to increase a model's interpretability is to increase the width (and not the number) of layers.

### How Does the MIS Change During Training?

In the last set of experiments, we demonstrate how the MIS can be used to analyze models in a fine-grained way and obtain insights into their training dynamics. For this, we train a ResNet-50 on ImageNet-2012, following the training recipe A3 of Wightman et al. , for \(100\) epochs.

Fig. 7 shows how the average per-unit MIS (left) changes during the training. Notably, the initial MIS (of the untrained network) is already above chance level. Visual explanations (see supplementary

Figure 6: **(A) Deeper Layers are More Interpretable. Average MIS per layer as a function of the relative depth of the layer within the network, grouped by layer types. For each type, the values are grouped into \(30\) bins of equal count based on the relative depth. The crosses depict the bin averages (correlations are calculated for those, too); for a visualization including the binsâ€™ variance see Fig. 23. (B) Wider Layers are More Interpretable. Average MIS per layer as a function of their relative width, grouped by layer types. The values are grouped into \(5\) bins. See Fig. 24 for visualizations of how the median, 5th, or 95th percentile of MIS depend on the layer width.**material) indicate a high color dependence of this network's units. However, during the first epoch, the MIS still increases drastically to values around \(0.93\), before it decays over the rest of the training. This indicates non-trivial dynamics of feature learning, which we analyze in Fig. 8. When showing the MIS as a function of ImageNet accuracy during training (right), a strong anticorrelation (ignoring the first points) becomes evident. This aligns with the anticorrelation shown in Fig. 4A. While we do not have a definite answer for why this is happening, we hypothesize the following: This could be a sign of learning dynamics and the order in which features are learned. After initialization, the network can improve the fastest by learning very simple feature detectors (e.g., colors, simple geometric shapes), as those are weakly correlated with certain classes (e.g., blue colors increase the chance of seeing a fish). Those features are easy for humans to understand. Throughout the training, these feature detectors are replaced with more complex ones that are harder to decode. Fig. 25 the least/most activating dataset examples for units with a strong MIS drop between the second and last training epoch, matching our hypothesis.

To better understand the dynamics through the training -- most importantly during the first epoch -- we zoom in to find out which units cause this strong change in MIS. Fig. 8 shows the change in MIS during the first epoch for each layer separately (ordered by their depth within the network). We detect a trend of later layers improving more strongly than earlier ones: The change in MIS is heavily driven by the later layers in the network, whose MIS increases strongly while early alters show no improvement at first. In general, we do not see a difference between Conv and BatchNorm layers.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper presented the first fully automated intepretability metric for vision models: the machine interpretability score (MIS). We verified its alignment to human interpretability score (HIS) through both correlational and interventional experiments. We expect our MIS to enable experiments previously considered infeasible due to the costly reliance on human evaluations. To stress this, we demonstrated the metric's usefulness for formulating and testing new hypotheses about a network's behavior through a series of experiments: Based on the largest comparison of vision models in terms of their per-unit interpretability so far, we investigated potential influences on their interpretability, such as layer depth and width. Most importantly, we find an anticorrelation between a model's downstream performance and its per-unit interpretability. Further, we performed the first detailed analysis of how the interpretability changes during training.

Figure 8: **Change of Interpretability per Layer During Training. To better understand the peak in interpretability after the first training epoch found in Fig. 7, we display the change in MIS during the first epoch, averaged over each layer. Layers are sorted by depth from left to right, and different colors encode different layer types. The change in interpretability appears moderately correlated with a layerâ€™s depth, such that deeper layers improve the strongest, whereas early layers show no improvement. For an extended visualization covering the full training, see Fig. 20.**

Figure 7: **Interpretability During Training. For a ResNet-50 trained for 100 epochs on ImageNet, we track the MIS and accuracy after every epoch (epoch 0 refers to initialization). While the MIS improves drastically in the first epoch, it decays during the rest of the training (left). This results in an antiproportional relation between MIS and accuracy (right).**

While this paper considerably advances the state of interpretability evaluations, there are some open questions and potential future research directions. Most importantly, the performance of our MIS on a per-unit level is close to the noise ceiling determined by the limited number of human interpretability annotations available. This means that future changes in the MIS measure (e.g., based on other image perceptual similarities) might require additional human labels to determine the significance of performance improvements. Additional human labels could also be leveraged to improve the MIS by following Fu et al.  to fine-tune the image similarity directly on human judgments. In another direction, using vision language models for computing the MIS could be interesting as this might, in addition to a numerical score, also provide a textual description of a unit's sensitivity . Finding a differentiable approximation of the MIS will be valuable for explicitly training models to be interpretable . Note that while this paper looked at the interpretability of channels and neurons, it can also be used to analyze arbitrary directions in activation space. Thus, we expect the MIS to also be valuable for researchers generally looking for more interpretable representations of (artificial) neural activations [e.g., 17]. Finally, exploring whether this concept of interpretability quantification can be expanded to LLMs is an exciting direction.
