###### Abstract

This paper studies consensus conditions for leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted consensus networks under the presence of constant time-delays. Several delayed consensus algorithms for networks of single- and double-integrators using only the relative positions are considered. Conditions for the networks to asymptotically converge to a consensus or clustering configuration are derived based on direct eigenvalue evaluation or the Lyapunov-Krasovkii theorem. Furthermore, an application of these algorithms in bearing-based network localization is also considered. The theoretical results are supported by numerical simulations.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, matrix-weighted consensus, a multi-dimensional extension of the well-known scalar-weighted consensus algorithm , has received a considerable amount of research attention. A matrix-weighted consensus system models diffusion dynamics in a multi-layer system with intra- and cross-layer interactions between multiple subsystems (or agents). Several applications of matrix-weighted consensus systems include multi-dimensional opinion dynamics models in , bearing-based formation control , distributed localization of wireless sensor networks , and network synchronization .

A matrix-weighted consensus network can be described by a graph with both positive definite and positive semidefinite matrix weights. Associated with the graph, a corresponding Laplacian matrix, whose the kernel (aka the nullspace) may contain further subspaces in addition to the consensus space , can be defined. Necessary and sufficient conditions for a matrix-weighted consensus network to asymptotically achieve consensus or clustering were given in . Discrete-time and randomized matrix-weighted consensus were studied in . The authors in  investigated the continuous-time consensus protocol with switching matrix-weighted graphs. A consensus is asymptotically achieved if the weighted integral network over some fixed time period always contains a positive spanning tree, or equivalently, the kernel of the Laplacian matrix of the integrated network contains only the consensus space . The works  examined the consensus problems over matrix-weighted networks for double-integrator agents. Controllability of the matrix-weighted consensus network was discussed in . Recent studies on bipartite and multi-partite matrix-weighted consensus have been proposed in .

It practice, time delays are unavoidable if agents communicate their state variables via a wireless network, especially when the agents are separated by significant distances. When restricted to linear systems, time delay yields phase lags and alters both the transient and steady-state responses of the system. If the magnitude of the time delay is sufficiently large, the whole system could be destabilized. For this reason, it is essential to examine the stability conditions of matrix-weighted consensus networks under different assumptions on the time delays. It is noteworthy that even with delayed linear differential equations, the exact analysis via characteristic equations will lead totranscendental equations, of which solutions are often complicated [5; 23]. An alternative approach for analysing the stability of time-delayed systems is based on Lyapunov-Krasovskii or Lyapunov-Razumikhin theorems [11; 13]. In the literature, a sufficient condition for reaching a consensus in a scalar consensus network with a uniform time delay was given in . Lyapunov-Razumikhin type functional was used for finding sufficient conditions for consensus networks with heterogeneous edge delays and switching interaction topology in . The authors in  studied the consensus problem with uniform delay communication and provided consensus conditions by considering some Lyapunov-Razumikhin functionals. The author in  considered a consensus problem with heterogeneous communication time delays and introduced a delayed weighted Laplacian for the analysis. The consensus of double-integrator agents with time delay was studied in  based on an approximated characteristic equation under the assumption that the delays are sufficiently small. An exact analytic method for a second-order delayed scalar-consensus protocol was proposed in . Stabilization control laws for double- and chain of integrators using delays were proposed in , and in the consensus problem over a scalar-weighted graph .

In this paper, we derive stability conditions of several delayed matrix-weighted consensus models having either a leaderless or a leader-follower topology. A leader-follower network contains several leader agents acting as stationary references during the dynamic process. First, we consider a matrix-weighted consensus network where all the edges have the same constant time delay. For this network, a necessary and sufficient stability condition related to the magnitude of the time delay and the maximum eigenvalue of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is established. Second, we study the matrix-weighted consensus with multiple heterogeneous constant time delays. A stability condition is given in terms of the feasibility of a linear matrix inequality (LMI). Third, we consider a matrix-weighted consensus network of double integrators, and show that the network can asymptotically reach the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian by using only the delayed relative positions. As it is assumed that the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian is not restricted to the consensus space, the applicability of the considered models is beyond a consensus problem. In particular, an application of the theoretical results in bearing-based network localization  is also discussed.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, the theoretical background is provided and three delayed matrix-weighted consensus models studied in this paper are presented. Sections 3-5 give stability conditions and detailed analysis of each consensus model. An application in bearing-based network localization is discussed in Section 6, and simulation results are provided in Appendix A.5 to support the analysis. Lastly, Section 7 concludes the paper.

Notations: In this paper, \(\), \(^{+}\), \(^{d}\), \(^{m n}\) respectively denote the sets of real numbers, positive real numbers, \(d\)-dimensional vectors with real entries and \(m n\) matrix with real entries. Let \(_{d}\) and \(_{d}\) respectively denote the zero vector of dimension \(d\) and the zero matrix of dimension \(d d\). For a real \(m n\) matrix \(\), we use \(^{}\), \(()\), \(()\), \(()\), and \(()\) to denote the transposition, rank, determinant, kernel space and image space of \(\), respectively. If \(\) is symmetric positive definite (positive semidefinite), we write \(>0\) (resp., \( 0\)). Given a vector \(^{d}\), the Euclidean norm of \(\) is denoted by \(\|\|=^{d}}x_{i}^{2}\).

## 2 Preliminaries

### Matrix-weighted networks

Consider an undirected, matrix-weighted graph \(=(,,)\) with the vertex set \(=\{1,,n\}\), the edge set \(\) of \(m=||\) edges, and the set of nonnegative definite matrix weights \(=\{_{ij}^{d d}\}_{i,j}\) with \(_{ij}=_{ij}^{} 0, i,j\) and \(d 2\). Each edge \((i,j)\) captures the interactions between two agents it and \(j\), and the existence of \((i,j)\) implies the existence of \((j,i)\) since the graph is undirected. If \((i,j)\), then \(_{ij} 0\); and if \((i,j)\) or \(i=j\), then \(_{ij}=_{d}\). The neighbor set of a vertex \(i\) is denoted as \(_{i}=\{j|\;(i,j)\}\). Then, the degree matrix of a vertex \(i\) is defined as \(_{i}=_{j_{i}}_{ij}\).

Now, we can define matrix-weighted- adjacency and degree matrices \(=[_{ij}]^{dn dn}\) and \(=(_{1},,_{n})^{dn dn}\). A matrix weighted Laplacian \(=[_{ij}]^{dn dn}\) hasblock entries

\[_{ij}=-_{ij},&i j,\\ _{j=1}^{n}_{ij},&i=j.\] (1)

Note that \(\) is symmetric, positive semi-definite, and \(()(_{n}_{d})\). A matrix-weighted graph and its corresponding matrix-weighted Laplacian is depicted in Fig. 1 as an example.

We order the edges in \(\) such that \(=\{e_{1},,e_{m}\}\), and adopt the notation \(_{ij}_{k}, e_{k}=(i,j,\ k=1,,m)\). For each edge \((i,j)\), we specify a vertex to be the starting vertex and the other vertex as the end vertex. The incidence matrix \(=[h_{ki}]^{m n}\) is defined as follows

\[h_{ki}=-1,&ie_{k},\\ +1,&ie_{k},\\ 0,&\] (2)

Then, \(=}^{}(_{k})}\), where \(}=_{d}\), and '\(\)' denotes the Kronecker product.

Suppose that the matrix-weighted Laplacian \(\) has \(l d\) eigenvalues 0 with \(l\) linearly independent eigenvectors \(_{1},,_{l}\). This assumption allows the possibilities of achieving a consensus or and clustering when the following consensus algorithm is performed on a matrix-weighted network of single integrators

\[}_{i}(t)=_{j_{i}}_{ij}(_ {j}(t)-_{i}(t)),\ i=1,,n.\] (3)

where \(_{i}^{d}\) is the state vector of agent \(i\). Let \(=[_{1}^{},,_{n}^{}]^{} ^{dn}\), the matrix-weighted consensus algorithm (3) can be rewritten in matrix form as

\[}(t)=-(t),\] (4)

and it has been shown that \((t)}=_{i=1}^{n} _{i}(0)()\), as \(t+\). Throughout the paper, the shorthand \(_{ij}(t)=_{j}(t)_{i}(t)\) will be used.

From the assumption that zero is a semi-simple eigenvalue of multiplicity \(l d\), and \(\) is symmetric, positive semi-definite, there exists an orthonormal matrix \(=[_{1},,_{dn}]=[,] ^{dn dn}\) such that \(=[_{1},,_{l}]^{dn l}\), \(=[_{l+1},,_{dn}]^{dn(dn -l)}\),

\[_{i}^{}_{j}=\{1&i=j,\\ 0&i j..\]

and \(\|_{i}\|=1, i,j=1,,dn\) so that the matrix-weighted Laplacian is diagonalizable as \(^{}=\), where \(=_{l}&_{l(dn-l)} \\ _{(dn-l) l}&}=( _{1},,_{dn})\) (and \(}=(_{l+1},,_{dn})\), respectively) the diagonal matrix containing all eigenvalues (all positive eigenvalues) of \(\). Note that \((_{n}_{d})\) since the kernel of a matrix-weighted Laplacian always contains the consensus space. Also, \(^{}=_{(dn-l) l}\), \(^{}=_{dn-l}\).

Consider a partition of the vertex set into two disjoint subsets \(_{a}\) and \(_{b}\) such that \(_{a}_{b}=\), \(_{a}_{b}=\), \(|_{a}|=n_{a}\), \(|_{b}|=n_{b}\), \(n_{a}+n_{b}=n\). The agents associated with the vertices in

Figure 1: A matrix-weighted graph of four vertices and four edges and its matrix-weighted Laplacian. Each red edge corresponds to a positive definite matrix weight and each black edge corresponds to a positive semi-definite matrix weight.

\(_{a}\) and \(_{b}\) are referred to as leaders and followers, respectively. By labeling the vertices such that \(_{a}=\{1,,n_{a}\}\), \(_{b}=\{n_{a}+1,,n\}\), the matrix-weighted Laplacian is partitioned as

\[=_{a}&_{ab}^{}\\ _{ab}&_{b},\] (5)

where \(_{a}=_{a}^{}^{dn_{a} dn_{a}}\), \(_{ab}^{}^{dn_{a} dn_{b}}\), and \(_{b}=_{b}^{}^{dn_{b} dn_{b}}\). Let \(^{}\) denote the matrix-weighted Laplacian corresponding to the subgraph induced by the vertices in \(_{b}\) and edges in \(\). If \(n_{a}=0\), we have a leaderless network while for \(n_{a} 1\), we have a leader-follower network. We prove the following lemma on the matrix-weighted Laplacian (5).

**Lemma 2.1**.: _Let \(()=dn-l\), \((^{})=dn_{b}-l\), \(n_{a} 1\) and \(l d+1\). If \((^{})\), \([_{dn_{a}}^{},^{}]^{}( )\), then the matrix \(_{b}\) is symmetric positive definite._

Proof.: Let \(=(_{ab}(_{n_{a}}_ {d}))=(_{1},,_{n_{b}})^{ dn_{b} dn_{b}}\), we have \(_{b}=^{}-\). Suppose that \(_{b}\) is not positive definite, then there exists \(=[_{1}^{},,_{n_{b}} ^{}]^{}^{dn_{b}}\) such that \(^{}_{b}=^{} (^{}-)=_{dn_{b}}\). From the assumption on \(^{}\), it follows that \((^{})\). Furthermore, \(^{}=_{k=1}^{n_{b}} {}_{k}^{}_{k}_{k}=0\). Since each matrix weight in \(_{k}=_{j=1}^{n_{a}}[_{ab}]_{kj}\) is negative semidefinite, it follows that \(_{k}([_{ab}]_{kj}),\; j=1,, n_{a}\), or equivalently \(_{ab}^{}=_{dn_{a}}\). Then, we have \(_{dn_{a}}\\ =_{ab}^{} \\ _{b}=_{dn},\) which shows that \([_{dn_{a}}^{},^{}]^{}( )\). This contradiction implies that \(_{b}\) must be positive definite. 

### Problem formulation

This paper aims to give some conditions for stability and/or reaching a consensus when time delays are present in (4) and its expanded versions. Particularly, the following matrix-weighted consensus models with time delays will be studied.

**Model 1** Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform constant time-delay \(>0\):

\[}_{i}(t)=_{j_{i}}_{ij}_ {ij}(t-),\] (6)

\( i_{b}\), and \(}_{i}(t)=_{d}, i_{a}\).

**Model 2** Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with heterogeneous constant time-delays

\[}_{i}(t)=_{j=1}^{n}_{ij}(t-_{ij}),\] (7)

where \(i_{b}\), \(_{ij} 0\) is the time-delay associated with an edge \((i,j)\), and \(}_{i}(t)=_{d}\), \( i_{a}\).

**Model 3** Matrix-weighted consensus of double-integrators with two constant time-delays:

\[}_{i}^{1}(t) =_{i}^{2}(t),\] (8a) \[}_{i}^{2}(t) =-_{j_{i}}_{ij}(_{i}^{1}(t- _{1})-_{j}^{1}(t-_{1}))-_{j_{i}} _{ij}(_{i}^{1}(t-_{2})-_{j}^{1}(t-_{2})),\] (8b)

where \(_{i}^{k}=[x_{1i}^{k},,x_{d_{i}}^{k}]^{}^{d}\), \(i_{b}\), and \(}_{i}^{k}(t)=_{d}\), \( i_{a}\), \(k=1,2\). Here, \(_{i}=[(_{i}^{1})^{},(_{i}^{2})^{}]^{}\) and \(_{1}^{1},_{i}^{2}\) are referred to as the position and the velocity of agent \(i\), and \(>0\) is a control gain.

For each model, the initial condition is given as \(()=(0),[-_{k},0]\).

## 3 Matrix-weighted consensus of single-integrators with a uniform time-delay

In this section, we give condition on the time-delay to ensure the model (6) to asymptotically achieve a consensus for leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted networks.

### Leaderless network

The following theorem provides necessary and sufficient consensus condition for a leaderless matrix-weighted consensus network.

**Theorem 3.1**.: _Consider a leaderless \(n\)-agent network with \(_{a}=\), and \(()=dn-l\), \(l d\). Under the consensus algorithm (6), \((t)\) asymptotically converges to \(^{*}=^{}(0)()\) if and only if \(<}\), where \(_{dn}\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(\)._

Proof.: The proof of this theorem is given in Appendix A.2. 

_Remark 3.2_.: Observe that if \(()=dn-d\) and the stability condition \(<}\) holds, then \(l=d\), \(_{p=1}^{d}_{k}_{k}^{}=(_{n} _{n}^{}_{d})\) and the system asymptotically achieves a consensus. A similar consensus condition was given in  for scalar-weighted consensus networks but the proof is different from that of Theorem 3.1.

### Leader-follower network

Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus law (6). Let \(_{a}=[_{1}^{},,_{n_{a}}^{}]^{}\) and \(_{b}=[_{n_{a}+1}^{},,_{n}^{}]^{}\) respectively denote the stacked vectors of the leader and the follower agents. The behaviors of the network is given in the following theorem.

**Theorem 3.3**.: _Consider a leader-follower \(n\)-agent network with \(n_{a} 1\), \(()=dn-l\), \(l d\), and \(_{b}\) is positive definite. Under the consensus algorithm (6), \(_{b}\) asymptotically converges to \(_{b}^{*}=_{b}^{-1}_{ab}_{a}\) if and only if \(<}\), where \(_{b}\) is the largest eigenvalue of \(_{b}\)._

Proof.: We can write the \(n\)-agent network in matrix form as follows

\[}_{a}(t)\\ }_{b}(t)=-_{dn_{a}}& _{dn_{a} dn_{b}}\\ _{ab}&_{b}_{a}(t- )\\ _{b}(t-).\] (9)

As \(_{a}(t)=_{a}(0),\; t-\), we consider the variable transformation \(_{b}(t)=_{b}(t)+_{b}^{-1}_{ab }_{a}\), and derive the equation

\[}_{b}(t)=-_{b}_{b}(t- ).\] (10)

The proof that the delayed system (10) is asymptotically stable if and only if \(<}\) is similar to the proof of Thm. 3.1 and will be omitted. 

_Remark 3.4_.: It is remarked that if a consensus algorithm is performed in a leader-follower scalar-weighted graph with non-collocated leaders, the followers will asymptotically converge to fixed points inside the convex hull of the leaders' position. In contrast, as shown in Thm. 3.3, for a matrix-weighted consensus, the convergence points of follower agents may lie outside the convex hull of the leaders' positions. This property finds application in the bearing-based network localization problem discussed in Section 6.

## 4 Matrix-weighted consensus of single integrators with heterogeneous delays

In this section, we study the matrix-weighted consensus algorithms with heterogeneous time delays (7). We first study the problem for a leaderless matrix-weighted network and then consider the problem for a leader-follower network.

### Leaderless network

Due to symmetry, we have \(_{ij}=_{ji},(i,j)\). We can rewrite the dynamics (7) in the matrix form as follows:

\[}(t)=-_{k=1}^{r}_{k}(t-_{k}),\] (11)where \(r||\), \(_{k}=_{ij}\) if \(e_{k}=(i,j)\), for \(k=1,,r\), and \(_{k}=[_{kij}]^{dn dn}\) is a matrix whose \(d d\) blocks are defined by

\[_{kij}=\{-_{ij},&j i,\ _{k}=_{ij},\\ _{d},&j i,\ _{k}_{ij},\\ -_{j=1,j i}^{n}_{kij},&j=i..\]

It is observed that \(_{k}\) is a part of the Laplacian matrix corresponding to an update with time delay \(_{k}\), and \(=_{k=1}^{r}_{k}\). As in the previous section, \(^{}_{k}=_{l nd}\), for \(k=1,,r\). It follows that \(^{*}=^{}(t)\) is time-invariant.

Moreover, we have \(_{k}=_{k}^{}\), where \(_{k}=_{l}&_{l (dn-l)}\\ _{(dn-l) l}&_{k}\) and \(}_{k}=^{}_{k} ^{(dn-l)(dn-l)}\). Define \((t)=^{}(t)^{dn-l}\), then the equation (11) can be rewritten in the following form :

\[}(t) =-_{k=1}^{r}^{}_{k}(t- _{k})=-_{k=1}^{r}}_{k}(t- _{k})\] \[=-}(t)+_{k=1}^{r} }_{k}((t)-(t- _{k}))\] \[=-}(t)+_{k=1}^{r} }_{k}_{t-_{k}}^{t}}(s )ds.\] (12)

The stability of the system (12) is stated in the following theorem, whose proof can be found in Appendix A.3.

**Theorem 4.1**.: _Consider the leaderless matrix-weighted consensus network with time delays (12), where \(()=dn-l\), \(n_{a}=0\) and \(l d\). Suppose that the time delays \(_{k}\) are sufficient small such that the LMI (13) holds, where \(=_{i=1}^{r}_{i}\).1 Then, the origin is a globally uniformly asymptotically equilibrium of (12) and \((t)^{*}()\) as \(t+\)._

\[=-2}&}_{1}&}_{2}&&}_{r}\\ *&-_{1}^{-1}_{dn-l}&_{dn-l}&& {}_{dn-l}\\ *&*&&&\\ *&*&*&-_{r-1}^{-1}_{dn-l}&_{dn-l}\\ *&*&*&*&-_{r}^{-1}_{dn-l}+- {}\\ }_{1}\\ \\ }_{r-1}\\ }_{r}-}\\ }_{1}\\ \\ }_{r-1}\\ }_{r}^{}<0.\] (13)

### Leader-follower network

Next, we consider the leader-follower network under the consensus algorithm (7). Similar to the previous section, we can define \(_{b}(t)=_{b}(t)+_{b}^{-1}_{ab }_{a}\), where \(_{ab}=_{k=1}^{r}_{abk}\) and \(_{b}=_{k=1}^{r}_{bbk}\). That is, each matrix \(_{k}\) contributes a part to the matrices \(_{ab}\) and \(_{b}\). Then,

\[}_{b}(t) =-_{k=1}^{r}_{bk}_{b}(t-)-_{k=1}^{ r}_{abk}_{a}=-_{k=1}^{r}_{bb}_{b}(t-)\] \[=-_{b}_{b}(t)+_{k=1}^{r} _{bk}_{t-_{k}}^{t}}_{b}(s)ds.\] (14)

We can now state a theorem on the delayed-system (14), whose proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 4.1 and will be omitted.

**Theorem 4.2**.: _Suppose that the \(n\)-agent network has a leader follower structure, \(n_{a} 1\), \(()=dn-l\), \(l d\), and \(_{b}\) is positive definite. If the time delays \(_{k}\) are chosen such that the LMI (15) holds and \(=_{i=1}^{r}_{i}\), then \(_{b}=_{dn_{b}}\) is globally uniformly asymptotically stable, and \((t)_{b}^{-1}_{ab}_{a}\) as \(t+\)._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

**Theorem 5.1**.: _Consider the leaderless delayed second-order consensus model (8), where \(()=dn-l\), \(n_{a}=0\), \(<1\), \(_{i}^{2}(0)=_{d}, i=1,,n\), and \(_{1}>0\). Suppose that there exist positive definite matrices \(^{(dn-l)(dn-l)}\), \(^{(dn-l)(dn-l)}\) and \(^{2(dn-l) 2(dn-l)}\) such that the matrix_

\[(_{2})=&& &_{2}^{2}(_{2})^{}[_{dn-l} }]^{}\\ *&-&_{dn-l}&-_{2}^{2}}^{2} \\ *&*&-}{4}&-kr_{2}^{2}}^{2} \\ *&*&*&-\] (17)

_is negative definite, where_

\[=(_{2})+(_{2})^{} +_{dn-l}&_{dn-l}\\ _{dn-l}&_{1}^{2}}},\;= _{dn-l}\\ }.\] (18)

_Then, \(^{1}(t)(),\;^{2}(t)_{ dn}\) as \(t+\)._

_Remark 5.2_.: The condition \(<1\) is only sufficient for our analysis, which is based on (16) to held. Indeed, for certain choices of \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\), \(=1\) may still make the system achieve asymptotic consensus.

### Leader-follower network

We now consider the consensus algorithm (8) when the matrix-weighted graph has a leader-follower structure. The leaders' positions are time-invariant, thus \(_{a}^{1}(t)=_{a}^{1}(0):=_{a}^{1},_{ a}^{2}(t)=_{dn_{a}}, t-\). The equations governs followers' dynamics are given as follows

\[}_{b}^{1}(t) =_{b}^{2}(t),\] (19a) \[}_{b}^{2}(t) =-_{b}_{b}^{1}(t-_{1})-_{ab} _{a}^{1}+_{b}_{b}^{1}(t-_{2})+ _{ab}_{a}^{1}.\] (19b)

Using the variable transformation \(_{b}^{1}(t)=_{b}^{1}(t)+_{b}^{-1} _{ab}^{1}\) and \(_{b}^{2}(t)=_{b}^{2}(t)\), we have the equations with the transformed variables

\[}_{b}^{1}(t) =_{b}^{2}(t),\] (20a) \[}_{b}^{2}(t) =-_{b}_{b}^{1}(t-_{1})+ _{b}_{b}^{1}(t-_{2}).\] (20b)

Defining \((_{2})=_{dn_{b}}&_{dn_ {b}}\\ -(1-)_{b}&-_{2}_{dn_{b}},\) then \((_{2})\) is Hurwitz for \(<1\) and \(_{2}>0\). Thus, there exists a symmetric positive definite matrix \(_{b}\) satisfying the following equation

\[_{b}(_{2})+(_{2})^{} _{b}=-_{2dn_{b}},\] (21)

where \(=_{2}-_{1}\). Similar to the proof of Theorem 5.1, the following theorem can be proved.

**Theorem 5.3**.: _Consider the delayed second-order consensus model (8) in a leader-follower network with \(()=dn-l\), \(n_{a} 1\), \(_{b}>0\), \(<1\) and \(_{1}>0\). Suppose that there exist positive definite matrices \(_{b}^{(dn-l)(dn_{b})}\), \(_{b}^{dn_{b} dn_{b}}\), and \(_{b}^{2dn_{b} 2dn_{b}}\) such that the matrix_

\[_{b}(_{2})=_{b}&_{b}& _{b}&_{2}^{2}(_{2})^{}[_{ dn_{b}}&_{b}]^{}_{b}\\ *&-_{b}&_{dn_{b}}&-_{2}^{2}_{b}^{ }_{b}\\ *&*&-}{4}_{b}&-k_{2}^{2}_{b}^{} _{b}\\ *&*&*&-_{b}\]

_is negative definite, where_

\[_{b}=_{b}(_{2})+(_{2})^{ }_{b}+_{dn_{b}}&_ {dn_{b}}\\ _{dn_{b}}&_{1}^{2}_{b}_{b}_{ b},\ _{b}=_{b}_{dn_{b}}\\ _{b}.\]

_Then, \(_{b}^{1}(t)-_{b}^{-1}_{ab}_{a}\), and \(_{b}^{2}(t)_{dn_{b}}\)._

## 6 Bearing-based network localization under time delays

We consider a wireless sensor network of \(n\) nodes in the \(d 2\) dimensional space. Consider a global coordinate system \({}^{g}\), and let the position of the \(i\)-th sensor in the network referred in \({}^{g}\) be denoted as \(_{i}^{d}\).

The network is characterized by \((,)\), where \(\) is the interaction graph and \(=[_{1}^{},,_{n}^{}]^{} ^{dn}\), the stacked vector of the global positions of \(n\) nodes, is referred to as a realization. Each node (or agent), located at \(_{i}^{d}\), can measure the bearing vector \(_{ij}=_{j}-_{i}}{\|_{j}- _{i}\|}\), which contains the directional information from node \(i\) to a neighboring node \(j_{i}\). The global position \(_{i}\) is unknown to each agent \(i\), so it needs to update an estimate \(}_{i}(t)^{d}\) of \(_{i}\) and exchange this information with its neighbors. The process of determining the positions of the network's nodes is called _network localization_. We assume that the information about the origin of the global coordinate system is unavailable to each agent and each agent maintains a local coordinate systems \({}^{i}\), whose axes are aligned with \({}^{g}\). This assumption is feasible since we can firstly conduct an orientation alignment algorithm before performing the network localization process.

For each bearing vector \(_{ij}\), there is a corresponding symmetric positive semidefinite matrix \(_{_{ij}}=_{d}-_{ij}_{ij}^{ }^{d d}\) satisfying \((_{_{ij}})=(_{ij})\) and \(_{_{ij}}=_{_{ij}}^{}=_{ _{ij}}^{2}\). Observe that \(_{_{ij}}\) is an orthogonal projection onto \((_{ij})\). The bearing-based network localization algorithm 

\[}}_{i}(t)=-_{j_{i}}_{_{ij}}(}_{i}(t)-}_{j}(t)),\ i=1,,n,\] (22)

can be considered as a matrix-weighted consensus algorithm (3). The network localization algorithm (22) induces the bearing Laplacian \(\) with the \(ij\)-th off-diagonal block matrix \(-_{_{ij}}\). It has been shown that the necessary and sufficient condition for the network under the update law (22) to be determined up to a translation and a scaling is \(()=dn-d-1\). Thus, the bearing Laplacian corresponds to \(l=d+1\), and all theoretical results in Sections 3-5 are applicable for the bearing-based network localization problem with time delays.

## 7 Conclusions

In this paper, three leaderless and leader-follower matrix-weighted consensus models with constant time-delays were studied. The stability of the considered models was analysed and several conditions for the system to asymptotically converge to a point in the kernel of the matrix-weighted Laplacian were provided. An application in bearing-based network localization with time-delays was also given. Since the current work only focuses on constant time delay, for further studies, it will be interesting to consider time-varying time-delays or adaptive algorithms for stabilizing the matrix-weighted consensus network with time-delays.
