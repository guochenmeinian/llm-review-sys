###### Abstract

In recent years, pretraining models have made significant advancements in the fields of natural language processing (NLP), computer vision (CV), and life sciences. The significant advancements in NLP and CV are predominantly driven by the expansion of model parameters and data size, a phenomenon now recognized as the scaling laws. However, research exploring scaling law in molecular pretraining models remains unexplored. In this work, we present Uni-MoI2, an innovative molecular pretraining model that leverages a two-track transformer to effectively integrate features at the atomic level, graph level, and geometry structure level. Along with this, we systematically investigate the scaling law within molecular pretraining models, characterizing the power-law correlations between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. Consequently, we successfully scale Uni-MoI2 to 1.1 billion parameters through pretraining on 800 million conformations, making it the largest molecular pretraining model to date. Extensive experiments show consistent improvement in the downstream tasks as the model size grows. The Uni-MoI2 with 1.1B parameters also outperforms existing methods, achieving an average 27% improvement on the QM9 and 14% on COMPAS-1D dataset.

## 1 Introduction

With the exponential growth of available biological data, there arises a critical need for innovative computational methodologies to utilize this wealth of information effectively. While traditional molecular representations like fingerprint-based models  lack the ability to capture fine-grained structural features and struggle to handle large or complex molecules effectively. Molecular Representation Learning (MRL) using molecular pretraining emerges as a promising approach, leveraging the power of machine learning to imbue algorithms with a deep understanding of molecular structures and functions. Various modalities of molecular representation by pretraining have been extensively studied in the past. The typical approach for representing molecules involves two main strategies. One strategy is to represent molecules as one-dimensional sequential strings, such as SMILES  and InChI . The representative work is SMILES-BERT, which learns from large-scale unlabeled data through the masked SMILES recovery task. Another strategy is to represent molecules as two-dimensional graphs . MolCLR , a typical method, learns the representations from unlabeled data by contrasting positive molecule graph pairs against negative ones. Additionally, a growing trend is to leverage three-dimensional information in MRL to enable tasks like 3D geometryprediction or generation [9; 10; 11]. The pursuit of molecular pretraining has sparked a wave of exploration and innovation across the field, marking a new era of discovery within the discipline.

While in the past few years, scaling up pre-trained language models [12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17; 18] has been achieved remarkable progress in natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV). The exponential growth in model size and the richness of training data have significantly enhanced the capabilities and performance of LLMs across various NLP and CV tasks. Despite extensive research on molecular pretraining, the majority of prior studies have been conducted on a relatively small scale, utilizing limited parameters and datasets. Learning scalable molecular representation learning is rarely explored and remains a challenging problem. The recent 's work conducts a series of data-centric experiments to demonstrate scaling behaviors in various aspects. The exploration of the molecular pretraining model is limited to the GIN , SchNet , whose model scale and data scale are comparatively small.

To delve deeper into the scaling of molecular pretraining foundational models, our preliminary investigations have yielded notable insights within this domain. We summarize the contributions of this work as follows:

* We have curated and organized a dataset comprising approximately 884 million 3D conformations, which contains 73 million scaffolds for pretraining. To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest dataset of molecules with 3D conformations for molecular pretraining to date, which provides the foundation ingredient for training large-scale molecular models.
* We systematically study the scalability and flexibility of Uni-Mol2 in terms of model parameters, which range from 84M to 1.1B parameters, and characterize the relationship between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. It is the first time to demonstrate the scaling law of molecular pretraining and Uni-Mol2 is currently the largest billion-scale molecular pretraining model to date.
* We present an in-depth analysis of scaling trends about fine-tuning on downstream tasks as the results are shown in Table4 and 5, Uni-Mol2 demonstrates consistent improvement in downstream task performance with increasing model parameters. The 1.1 billion parameters model also achieves significant improvement over the existing method.

## 2 Related Work

Molecular representation learningPrevious research has extensively investigated various modalities for molecular representation. A range of methods have been proposed based on different types of information utilized during pretraining. SMILES-BERT uses the smiles sequence in pretraining to capture the representation. Due to SMILES representation lack of explicit encoding of molecular structural information. To address this limitation, GROVER integrates Message Passing Networks into a Transformer-style architecture and learns from unlabeled molecular data through carefully designed self-supervised tasks at different levels of molecular topology (node, edge, and graph). MGSSL  developed a motif-based graph self-supervised learning strategy that predicts both the topology and label of motifs as they are generated in the motif tree process. Furthermore, GEM incorporates three-dimensional (3D) spatial structure information, atoms, bonds, and bond angles simultaneously to model the molecular representation. SphereNet utilizes spherical coordinates and introduces a spherical message-passing approach, providing an effective framework for 3D molecular learning. The survey  discusses GNN shows great efficiency in processing molecular graph structures and their strong capability to capture local relationships within a molecule. However, the locally connected graph fails to adequately represent long-range interactions between atoms. In contrast, transformer-based models have shown exceptional performance in various tasks within the molecular domain, demonstrating remarkable representation capabilities.

Foundation modelsRecently, there has been considerable interest in developing foundational models to consolidate and expand representations. The significant advancements in scaling up pre-trained language models[12; 13; 14] have fundamentally reshaped the field of natural language processing. [25; 15; 18; 26] also prove that the foundation model demonstrates strong performance on many NLP datasets, sometimes reaching or exceeding the human performance. Some works in CV[27; 28] demonstrate the potential for "LLM-like" scaling in vision and underscore significant improvement via model and data scaling. And Sora[29; 30], a multi-modal foundation model exhibitsthe capacity to offer sophisticated understanding regarding the intricate interplay of physical and contextual dynamics within depicted scenes.

## 3 Pretraining

The pretraining stage of molecular involves learning from vast amounts of molecular data to acquire a comprehensive understanding of molecular representations. By pretraining on a large and diverse unlabeled dataset, the model can develop a rich understanding of molecular structures and properties, which can subsequently be fine-tuned or applied to specific downstream tasks, such as drug discovery, materials design, or chemical synthesis. The section provides details of the data curation process for pretraining, the detailed pretraining architecture, the well-designed self-supervision tasks, and the specific training procedures employed for scaling up the model.

### Data

To augment the richness and diversity of the dataset, we integrated the two parts we have collected. One part consists of approximately 19 million molecules sourced from Uni-Mol , while the other is derived from ZINC20  which includes 1.4 billion compounds. We downloaded the subset with standard reactivity, which contains 884 million compounds from website 2. Table 1 shows the enrichment compared with Uni-Mol dataset. The overall Uni-Mol2 dataset has increased by over 40 times compared to the Uni-Mol dataset, with the number of scaffold increasing by 17 times, greatly expanding the diversity of the data. Figure 1(**Top**) shows the numeric distributions of the top 40 skeletons in Uni-Mol dataset and the number corresponding in Uni-Mol2 dataset. To prevent data leakage in evaluating pretraining performance, we randomly sampled 520k molecules from the Uni-Mol2 dataset as the validation set to evaluate the effectiveness and investigate the scaling relationship.

As illustrated in the visualization depicting the frequency distribution of the top 40 Murcko scaffolds in Uni-Mol2 dataset (refer to Figure 1 (**Bottom**)), it is observed that the molecular scaffold conforms to a distribution characterized by a long-tail pattern. To create a more balanced training dataset, we categorize the SMILES of Uni-Mol2 training set by Murcko scaffold, resulting in 73,725,454 scaffolds along with frequency distribution. Then, we utilize the temperature-based sampling method , as described in equation 1 to select molecules from Uni-Mol2 training set.

\[ P_{i}&=}}{ N_{s_{i} }},\\ P_{scaffold_{i}}&=(}{})  \]

Where \(N_{si}\) represents the number of molecules with \(i\)-th scaffold in Uni-Mol2 training set. The temperature \(\) modulates the smoothness of the molecular distribution across scaffolds. We use an empirical value \(=0.005\) as the temperature to effectively balance the proportion of molecules with high-frequency and low-frequency scaffolds.

### Architecture

As depicted in Figure 2, Uni-Mol2 essentially adheres to the model design of Uni-Mol+, acting as a two-track transformer that concurrently processes atom features and pair features. Consistent with

  Datasets & SMILES & Scaffold & Data Source \\  Uni-Mol Dataset & 19M & 4,224,621 & ZINC15, ChemBL, Commercial Database \\ Uni-Mol2 Dataset & \(\) 884M & 73,725,454 & Uni-Mol Dataset, ZINC 20 \\  

Table 1: The different scale of Uni-Mol dataset and Uni-Mol2 datasetUni-Mol, Uni-Mol2 employs two self-supervised tasks: masked token prediction and molecule coordinate denoising. The detailed framework is presented as follows:

**Feature Representation and Position Encoding** Given molecular \(M=(x,e,r)\), where \(x^{n d_{u}}\) denotes atom features, \(e^{n n d_{v}}\) denotes bond features and \(r^{n 3}\) denotes coordinate features. Following Uni-Mol+, we employ RDKit to obtain atom token \(x^{i}_{}\), atom degree \(x^{i}_{}\), and atomic features \(x^{i}_{}\) for each atom. The atom embedding \(x^{i}_{}\) is then initialized as:

\[x^{i}_{}=(x^{i}_{})+(x ^{i}_{})+(x^{i}_{}) \]

For pair features, we utilize RDKit to obtain bond features \(x^{i,j}_{}\) by \((x^{i,j}_{})\). We adopt the method from  to encode the shortest path distance \(x^{i,j}_{}\) of atom pair (i, j) in the molecular graph by \((x^{i,j}_{})\). Additionally, we employ the Gaussian kernel approach with pair type, as described in , to encode the Euclidean distance of the atom pair (i, j) by \(^{i,j}\). The pair embedding \(x^{i,j}_{}\) is then initialized as:

Figure 1: **Top**: Comparison of scaffold frequency between Uni-Mol and Uni-Mol2 dataset. **Bottom**: Scaffolds distribution on Uni-Mol2 dataset

Figure 2: **Left**: The overall pretraining architecture. **Middle**: Atom and Pair representation. **Right**: The details of backbone block

\[x_{}^{i,j}=(x_{}^{i,j})+(x_{ }^{i,j})+^{i,j} \]

**Two-track Transformer Layer** The backbone of Uni-Mol2 has \(N\) blocks, each block handles atom representation and pair representation concurrently. Formally, for the \(l\)-th block, Uni-Mol2 update atom representation \(x^{l}\) by

\[ x^{l}&=( {LN}(x^{l-1}),p^{l-1}),\\ x^{l}&=x^{l-1}+((x^{l})) \]

For the pair representation \(p^{l}\),

\[ p^{l}&=p^{l-1}+((p^{l-1})),\\ p^{l}&=p^{l}+((p^{l })),\\ p^{l}&=p^{l}+((p^{l})) \]

The details of SelfAttentionPairBias, OuterProduct, and TriangularUpdate are aligned with those of Uni-Mol+. Additionally, Uni-Mol2 adopts pre-norm layer normalization at atom and pair representation, which differs from Uni-Mol+, to improve stability in the model's training dynamics. Specifically, we set atom embedding \(x_{}\) as atom representation \(x^{0}\) and pair embedding \(x_{}\) as pair representation \(p^{0}\) for the first block.

**Pretraining Tasks** To effectively model the structure of molecular conformations, we set pretraining tasks basically following Uni-Mol. In detail, for each molecule, we randomly mask 15% of the atom tokens with the placeholder token \([]\). We then add the atom token prediction head to optimize masked atom token loss \(_{}\) by

\[_{}=H(x_{}[],x_{}[ {mask}]) \]

where H denotes the cross entropy function, \(x_{}[]\) denotes the masked atom tokens and \(x_{}[]\) denotes the corresponding predicted atom tokens for the masked positions.

In the coordinate denoising task, to increase the challenge of the pertaining task, we introduce Gaussian noise with a standard deviation of 0.2 for all the atom coordinates. Additionally, to enhance broader applicability across downstream applications, we mask atomic features \(x_{}\), bond features \(x_{}\), and shortest path distance features \(x_{}\) with a probability of 50%. Furthermore, we align the conformation of the noised molecule, denoted as \(r_{}\), with that of the raw molecule, denoted as \(r_{}\), using the Kabsch algorithm.

In contrast to Uni-Mol, Uni-Mol2 employs the position prediction head to predict the atom coordinates \(r_{}\) of molecules.

\[_{pos}&=(r_{})\\ Q_{pos}&=((x^{N})),K_{pos}=((x^{N}))\\ V_{pos}&=((x^{N})),B_{pos}=((p^{N}))\\ attn_{pos}&=(Q_{pos}K_{pos}^{T}+B_{pos}) _{pos}\\ _{vpos}&=attn_{pos}V_{pos},_{pos}=(_{vpos})\\ r_{}&=r_{}+_{pos}  \]

where \(Dis\) denotes element-wise subtraction of positions between different noised atoms \(r_{}\). Specifically, the difference in position between atoms \(i\) and \(j\) is given by \(_{pos}(i,j)=r_{,i}-r_{,j}\). And \(\) denotes Hadamard product. \(LN\) denotes layer normalization. \(FFN\) denotes a feed-forward network. In practice, we use multi-head attention; for simplicity in writing, we omitted the notation related to heads here. Once the predicted coordinates \(r_{}\) are obtained, the predicted pair-distance \(r_{}\) can be derived by calculating the Euclidean distances between each pair of \(r_{}\). We integrated coordinate prediction and pair-distance prediction with \(_{1}\) loss into Uni-Mol2's optimization process for the coordinate denoising task:\[_{} =\|r_{}-r_{}\|_{1}, \] \[_{} =\|r_{}-r_{}\|_{1}\]

We eliminated two stabilizing regularization terms from the Uni-Mol model, yielding the final loss of Uni-Mol2:

\[_{}=_{}+_{} +_{} \]

### Hyperparameter and Training Details

We study the scalability of Uni-Mol with the scale from 42M to 1.1B, and all the parameters for Uni-Mol2 at different scales are listed in Table 2. And Uni-Mol2 is trained with AdamW optimizer[37; 38], with the following hyper-parameters: \( 1=0.9\) and \( 2=0.99\) and weight decay \(1e-4\). The gradient clip norm is set to 1.0 for training stability. The learning rate scheduler employed is a polynomial decay scheduler during pretraining. Specifically, all models reach its maximum learning rate value \(1e-4\) after 100,000 warm-up steps and decay the learning rate of each parameter group using a polynomial function with power 1.0. All the models are trained with mix-precision for training efficiency.

Using the temperature-based sampling method outlined in Equation 1, we sample 838 million conformations as training samples from the dataset. All models were subsequently trained on these 838 million samples. All these conformations were generated using the ETKGD method  and optimized with the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF)  in RDKit. For models containing parameters ranging from 42M to 310M, we employed 32 NVIDIA A100 GPU cards, while for models with 570M and 1.1B parameters, we utilized 64 NVIDIA A100 GPU cards. Details on pretrain time complexity across varying sizes are provided in Appendix 12.

## 4 Scaling Laws

Several studies[15; 42; 43] on large language models (LLMs) investigate the power-law connections between model performance, commonly assessed by validation or test loss, and factors such as the number of model parameters, dataset size, and compute budget. Here, we aim to define the power-law of validation loss \(\) during the model's convergence period. In Figure 3, we present the validation loss of Uni-Mol2 models with parameter counts varying from 42 million to 1.1 billion during the training process. We mainly examine the impact factors of three aspects: data scale \(N\), model scale \(M\), and compute budget scale \(C\). Given that a constant batch size \(B\) of 1024 is maintained for Uni-Mol2 across various scales, the number of training steps \(S\) is considered as a suitable proxy for \(D\), as \(D\) can be approximated by the product \(BS\).

We initially designed a power term for \(M\) and \(S\) separately. Additionally, we approximate the computed budget \(C\) as \(MS\). Notably, we have neglected the intricate relationship between actual computing costs \(C\) and \(MS\), instead subsuming it into the parameter estimation. Adhering to the design principles of , the loss function \((M,D)\) should exhibit scale invariance, limit consistency, and analyticity to ensure stability and consistency across varying parameters. As a result, we derived the following empirical power-law relationship:

\[(M,S,C)=_{m}M^{_{m}}+_{s}S^{_{s}}+_{c}C ^{_{c}} \]

    &  & Embedding & Attention & Pair embedding & Pair hidden & FFN embedding & Learning & Batch size \\  & & dim & heads & dim & dim & dim & rate & size \\ 
42M & 6 & 768 & 48 & 512 & 64 & 768 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\
84M & 12 & 768 & 48 & 512 & 64 & 768 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\
164M & 24 & 768 & 48 & 512 & 64 & 768 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\
310M & 32 & 1024 & 64 & 512 & 64 & 1024 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\
570M & 32 & 1536 & 96 & 512 & 64 & 1536 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\
1.1B & 64 & 1536 & 96 & 512 & 64 & 1536 & 1e-4 & 1024 \\   

Table 2: Architecture of Uni-Mol2 at different scale We established the relationship based on the validation loss trajectory of Uni-Mol2 across different scales, as detailed in Table 2. Specifically, we utilized the validation data from Uni-Mol2 42M, 84M, 164M, and 310M, recording the validation loss every 10,000 training steps. Furthermore, to prevent the performance during the transient period from affecting the parameter estimation, we excluded the loss of information from the first 200,000 training steps. Consequently, we have:

\[(M,S,C)=2.660M^{-1.137}+1.848S^{-0.225}+0.588C^{-1.479} \]

As shown in Fig 4, equation 11 fits the actual validation loss well for Uni-Mol2 570M and Uni-Mol2 1.1B parameters model, particularly when the model's performance reaches convergence. To assess the scaling law's effectiveness, we calculated Relative Mean Absolute Error (RMAE), Mean Square Error (MSE), R-squared, and Pearson Correlation Coefficient by comparing predicted validation loss with actual validation loss over the last 100,000 steps for Uni-Mol2 570M and Uni-Mol2 1.1B on Table 3. The high Pearson Correlation Coefficient and R-squared we computed indicate a strong linear relationship between our predicted values and the actual data. The RMAE values for Uni-Mol2 570M and Uni-Mol2 1.1B are 0.0169 and 0.0095, respectively, indicating that Equation 11 accurately models the loss curve. Specifically, for the Uni-Mol2 570M at 810,000 steps, the actual validation loss was recorded at 0.09, compared to a predicted loss of 0.088, yielding a predicted validation error of 2.22%. Meanwhile, for Uni-Mol2 1.1B at the same step, the actual validation loss stood at 0.087, slightly below the forecast of 0.0871, with a prediction error of 0.23%.

## 5 Downstream Experiment

Upon pretraining with extensive unlabeled datasets using the predefined task, one should acquire a highly accurate molecular representation for fine-tuning downstream tasks. In this section, we conduct experiments on the ability of scaled models on downstream tasks.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

utilized COMPAS-1D from COMPAS project . COMPAS-1D offers essential computational properties crucial for comprehending the behaviour of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and other organic molecules across various chemical and physical processes. Modeling the relationships of these properties has significant implications for the field of organic photoelectric materials.

We still follow the QM9 scaffold similarity-based partition and split it by a ratio of 8:1:1 into the train, validation, and test sets. Table 5 presents the predictive capabilities of Uni-Mol2 regarding photoelectric quantum properties. The model with \(\) suffix indicates that they incorporate atom and bond features. The results indicate that Uni-Mol2 excels in all tasks except for aEA property prediction task. Additionally, consistent with findings from the QM9 dataset, Uni-Mol2 demonstrates superior performance across all tasks as the model scales up. The results also show that under the same parameter scale, models incorporating atom and bond features outperform those without these features. Uni-Mol2 1B achieves 4% improvement over Uni-Mol, while Uni-Mol2 1B with atom and bond feature achieves 14% improvement over Uni-Mol. This suggests that, in certain scenarios, these features consistently provide a significant advantage.

### The Performance on Limited QM9 Dataset

In numerous fields like bio-medicine, acquiring extensive well-annotated molecular data is often expensive and time-consuming. Typically, these datasets include only a limited quantity of data[47; 48]. To evaluate the performance of Uni-Mol2 with restricted data availability, we conducted sampling on the QM9 dataset. We sampled the training set by stratifying it according to the quantile binning of the HOMO-LUMO GAP label from the QM9 test set and then created subsets named train50, train100, and train200 by sampling at 50%, 100%, and 200% of the test set size, respectively.

We enhanced Uni-Mol2 from 84M to 1.1B parameters using train50, train100, and train200 datasets to predict HOMO, LUMO, and GAP properties on the QM9 test dataset. As illustrated in Table 6, two conclusions emerge from the MAE for predicting HOMO, LUMO, and HOMO-LUMO GAP on the QM9 test set. First, the model's performance, indicated by a decreasing MAE, progressively improves as the training dataset expands. This is evident from comparing the MAE values between the train50 and train200 rows across different scales of the Uni-Mol2 models. For example, the Uni-Mol2 84M model shows a reduction in MAE from 0.0062 to 0.0046, marking a 25.8% decrease as the dataset grows from 50 to 200 instances. Secondly, in situations where training data is scarce, the larger Uni-Mol2 models demonstrate enhanced predictive capabilities. This is evidenced by the fact that the Uni-Mol2 1.1B parameters model, which has the largest parameters, consistently records the lowest MAE scores for all sizes of training sets. This is especially apparent in the train50 scenario, where it achieves an MAE of 0.0056, marking the best performance among the models discussed. These results highlight the advantages of enlarging both the training dataset and the model scale to improve predictive accuracy in downstream finetuning tasks with Uni-Mol2.

Conclusion

In this paper, to fully investigate the scaling law in the molecular pretraining field, we construct a diverse dataset of molecular structures spanning 884 million instances and present a novel molecular pretraining model Uni-Mol2. We successfully scale the model size to 1.1 billion parameters from 84 million parameters and characterize the power-law relationship between validation loss and model size, dataset size, and computational resources. By empowering the power-law relationship of Uni-Mol2, it can shed light on the performance of the larger model. Our largest 1.1B parameters model also outperforms the existing methods.

The scaling law paves the way for exploring larger models to achieve higher performance. We hope that our work can open avenues for further exploration of the foundational molecular pretraining model. While larger models yield substantial benefits, there are still several potential future directions. Firstly, beyond property prediction tasks, it is also worthwhile to explore whether the representation can be effectively utilized to enhance generative tasks. Secondly, even though the Uni-Mol2 has shown excellent results in several domains by increasing model capacity, it remains to be explored whether the advantages of scaling are beneficial for a broader range of tasks. Thirdly, the current mainstream large language models (LLMs) are predominantly based on a decode-only architecture. It is worth investigating whether there are more elegant decode-only architectures for molecular pre-training models.
