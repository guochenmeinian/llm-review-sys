###### Abstract

Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) models have unlocked a wide range of applications but also present significant risks, particularly in their potential to generate unsafe content. To mitigate this issue, researchers have developed unlearning techniques to remove the model's ability to generate potentially harmful content. However, these methods are easily bypassed by adversarial attacks, making them unreliable for ensuring the safety of generated images. In this paper, we propose Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a novel framework for removing Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content from T2I models while preserving their performance on unrelated topics. DUO employs a preference optimization approach using curated paired image data, ensuring that the model learns to remove unsafe visual concepts while retaining unrelated features. Furthermore, we introduce an output-preserving regularization term to maintain the model's generative capabilities on safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods without significant performance degradation on unrelated topics, as measured by FID and CLIP scores. Our work contributes to the development of safer and more reliable T2I models, paving the way for their responsible deployment in both closed-source and open-source scenarios.

## 1 Introduction

In recent years, text-to-image (T2I) models  have experienced significant advancements thanks to large-scale data and diffusion models. However, the large-scale web-crawled data such as LAION  often include a significant amount of inappropriate and objectionable material, so T2I models trained on such data may pose a potential risk of generating harmful content including Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content, copyright infringement, and a violation of privacy . Filtering and curating such large-scale training data  is not feasible for large-scale datasets. At the production level, service providers usually block inappropriately generated images with an ad-hoc classifier , but the classifier can block normal images due to false positive detections and can be easily bypassed if the model weights are open-sourced.

To address the generation of unsafe content, there has been a substantial amount of research focusing on directly fine-tuning diffusion models to forget unsafe concepts [12; 13; 26; 33; 17; 36; 63]. Recent work in the field has focused mainly on prompt-based approaches to unlearning, which aim to induce models to behave as if they had received safe prompts when an unsafe prompt is given [12; 26; 33; 63; 36]. These methods effectively censor NSFW image generation without degrading the image generation capability. However, recent studies [42; 56; 60] warn that by introducing slight perturbations to the unsafe prompts using adversarial prompts [56; 60] or embeddings, it is possible to circumvent these censoring mechanisms and generate undesirable images (Figure 1).

Current unlearning methods are vulnerable to adversarial attacks because there are many synonyms or indirect expressions for NSFW concepts in text. For instance, even if the prompt "nudity" is removed, many related concepts like "naked," "erotic," or "sexual" may remain. Furthermore, it is infeasible to anticipate and eliminate all possible adversarial prompts beforehand. Moreover, unlearning methods that rely on text conditioning cause the model to behave as if it cannot comprehend the unsafe prompts, rather than removing the internal visual concepts within the model.

To fundamentally address limitations, it is necessary to guide the model to guide the model to remove the image-related features that produce unsafe images, regardless of the prompt. **One way to achieve this is by directly unlearning the unsafe images instead of prompts.** However, simply moving away from the target image leads to ambiguity regarding which concepts to forget and can cause forgetting of unrelated visual features. For instance, if we make the model unlearn the image in Figure 2-(a), it would lose the ability to generate not only nudity but also unrelated concepts like women or forests.

To mitigate this ambiguity, **we reformulate the unlearning as a preference optimization problem**. Preference optimization is a technique aimed at training models to generate desirable outputs when provided with both positive and negative examples. Our main intuition is that, unlike when only an undesirable sample is given, the presence of a desirable sample helps the model resolve the ambiguity about what information should be retained from the undesirable sample. As shown in Figure 2-(b), thanks to the desirable image, the model can recognize that the forest and woman are not subjects that need to be erased.

In this paper, we propose Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a method to remove unsafe visual features directly from the model while maintaining generation quality for unrelated topics. Specifically, we created paired data by using unsafe images and their counterparts, from which unsafe concepts were removed using SDEdit  (Section 3.2). Then, we employ Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  to make the model favor the latter group while encouraging it to move away from the former group (Section 3.3). As shown in Figure 2-(b), preference optimization through the paired dataset explicitly specifies which features of a given image should be forgotten. To further regularize the model not to unlearn for unrelated topics, we introduce output-preserving regularization [37; 62; 6] that forces to preserve the denoising capability of the model. We call our framework as Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO). We demonstrate that our method can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods [56; 42] without significant performance degradation in unrelated topics, as measured by LPIPS , FID  and CLIP scores . Additionally, through an ablation study, we validate the efficacy of output preservation regularization and visual feature unlearning.

## 2 Related work

Text-to-Image (T2I) models with safety mechanisms.The safety mechanisms designed to prevent undesirable behavior in T2I models can be classified into four categories: dataset filtering [55; 15], concept unlearning [12; 13; 26; 33; 17; 36; 63], in-generation guidance , and post-generation content screening [1; 55; 3]. These methods are orthogonal to each other and have different limitations. In this work, we focus on concept unlearning and can combine it with other techniques to ensure more secure T2I generation.

Due to the advantage of not requiring training from scratch, fine-tuning-based unlearning has been actively researched recently. Pioneering works like ESD  and CA  train the model to generate the same noise regardless of whether an unsafe prompt is present or not. SPM  trains one-dimensional adapters that regularize the model instead of full model training. TIME , UCE  and MACE  update the prompt-dependent cross-attention weights with a closed-form equation. Forget-me-not  suppresses the attention map of cross-attention layers for unsafe prompts. SA  proposed an unlearning method based on continual learning, utilizing Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC). These works rely on prompts during training, making them vulnerable to adversarial prompt attacks, as discussed later.

Meanwhile, SafeGen , as a concurrent work with ours, addresses similar concerns regarding adversarial prompts and utilizing image pairs to remove unsafe features for training. They use blurred unsafe images to guide the model using supervised learning, ensuring that unsafe images are generated in a blurred form. In contrast to their work, we utilize paired data generated with SDEdit  to enable the model to erase only unsafe concepts and employ preference optimization. Therefore, our method can provide more selective guidance for the visual features that need to be removed, and avoid direct training on blurred images, which can potentially harm the generation capabilities.

Red-Teaming for T2I models.Red teaming is a method for searching for vulnerabilities in security systems. Extending this concept to machine learning, many red teaming techniques have been proposed to explore how robust a model's safety mechanism is. For Text-to-Image (T2I) models, studies have shown that even with safety mechanisms applied, it is still possible to generate harmful images through prompt engineering [56; 42; 60; 9; 67; 16]. Ring-A-bell  and SneakyPrompt  generate adversarial prompts in a black-box scenario without access to the diffusion model. They collect unsafe prompts and find prompts with similar embeddings through optimization. On the other hand, Concept Inversion  is a method that can be used in a white box scenario where access to the gradient of the diffusion model is available. This method learns a special token \( c\) through textual inversion  that contains information about unsafe images, and then uses it to generate unsafe images. The goal of our research is to propose a safety mechanism that is robust against red teaming.

Preference optimization in T2I models.Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)  has been frequently used in language models as it enables preference-based model tuning without the need for reward models. DiffusionDPO  and D3PO  extend this approach to diffusion models, ensuring that generated images better reflect user preferences. Diffusion-KTO  replaces DPO with Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) , eliminating the need for paired data. DCO  applies preference optimization to the personalization domain, ensuring that models preserve priors while

Unsafe concept refers to what should be removed from the image (red), while unrelated concept refers to what should be retained in the image (green).**generating personal images. Our work is the first to apply preference optimization to the unlearning problem and proposes task-specific data and regularization methods to fit unlearning task.

## 3 Method

In this section, we introduce our framework named Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO) consisting of Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with synthetic paired data and output-preserving regularization. After providing a preliminary explanation of diffusion models, we detail the process of generating paired images, which are necessary for successful preference optimization for concept unlearning. Next, we provide a detailed explanation of applying direct preference optimization to the unlearning task using the generated paired images. Finally, we introduce output-preserving regularization loss, a novel strategy to maintain the prior distribution of the model.

### Preliminary: Diffusion models

Diffusion models [52; 21; 53; 54; 32] are generative models that learn to generate images through an iterative denoising process. For an image \(x_{0}\), the diffusion process samples a noisy image \(x_{t}\) from \(q(x_{t}|x_{0})=(}x_{0},}I)\). The magnitude of the added noise is determined by the noise schedule \(_{t}\), and it increases as \(t\) becomes larger. We train the model \(_{}()\) to denoise the noisy image \(x_{t}=}x_{0}+}\) by predicting the added noise \(\).

\[L_{}=_{x_{0} q(x_{0}),x_{t} q(x_{t}|x_{0})}[|| -_{}(x_{t})||_{2}^{2}]\] (1)

This is called the denoising score matching (DSM) loss. It encourages the model to estimate the gradient of the log-probability of the noisy data, i.e., \(_{}(x_{t}) p(x_{t} c)\).

Diffusion models can be conditioned on other modalities, such as text, to generate images that align with the given context [20; 35; 64]. In this case, the model learns to estimate \((x_{t},c) p(x_{t})\), where \(c\) represents the conditioning information. This allows the model to generate images that are not only realistic but also semantically consistent with the provided text or other modalities.

### Synthesizing paired image data to resolve ambiguity in image-based unlearning

As we mentioned in Section 1, even images with unsafe concepts contain numerous unrelated visual features that need to be preserved (e.g., photo-realism, background, and humans). Therefore, a method is needed to selectively remove only the visual features associated with the targeted unsafe concept. Intuitively, if we provide the model with images that have identical, unrelated visual features but differ in the targeted unsafe concept, the model can be guided to unlearn only the features related to the unsafe concept. Unfortunately, as shown in Figure 3 (b), naively generating paired images by replacing unsafe words with safe words in prompts often resulted in changes to the unrelated attributes of the images.

We solve this by creating image pairs using SDEdit , a method for image translation. The process of creating image pairs with SDEdit is as follows. Given an undesirable concept \(c^{-}\), e.g., _naked_, we

Figure 3: **Effectiveness of utilizing SDEdit for generating paired image data for unlearning.** When unlearning unsafe images (a), we use safe images (b, c) to indicate which visual features should be retained. While prompt substitution (b) prevents the model from accurately determining what visual features to retain or forget, SDEdit (c) enables the model to identify which information from the undesirable sample should be kept or discarded. We use for publication purposes.

first generate an unsafe image \(x_{0}^{-}\) using \(c^{-}\). Then, we add a certain amount of Gaussian noise to send it to \(x_{t}^{-}\). Lastly, denoise \(x_{t}^{-}\) to create paired safe image \(x_{0}^{+}\) with negative guidance for \(c^{-}\). If possible, we also use positive guidance for \(c^{+}\), e.g., _dressed_, during the denoising process. Thanks to the characteristics of diffusion models, SDEdit allows us to generate images that have similar coarse features but either include or exclude the unsafe concept, ensuring that the concept unlearning process is focused on the specific elements we want to remove while preserving the rest of the image as shown in Figure 3 (c).

Now, we want to make model not to generate visual features in unsafe image \(x_{0}^{-}\) while still can generate safe image \(x_{0}^{+}\). We solve this as a preference optimization problem. In the next subsection, we will discuss how we consider our generated paired dataset as preference data and apply Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to our unlearning problem.

### Concept unlearning as a preference optimization problem

In subsection 3.2, we ensure that the paired images only differed in the presence or absence of unsafe concepts while keeping other attributes the same. Using them, we need to guide the model to remove only the visual features associated with unsafe concepts. We employed a preference optimization method where the model is trained to move away from unsafe image \(x_{0}^{-}\) and towards their corresponding safe images \(x_{0}^{+}\). Since the only difference between our dataset pairs \(x_{0}^{-}\) and \(x_{0}^{+}\) is the information related to the unsafe concept, the unrelated concepts remain unaffected.

Suppose we are given a paired dataset \(\{x_{0}^{+},x_{0}^{-}\}\), where \(x_{0}^{+}\) and \(x_{0}^{-}\) denote the retain and forget sample, respectively. The probability of preferring \(x_{0}^{+}\) over \(x_{0}^{-}\) can be modeled by the reward function \(r(x)\):

\[p(x_{0}^{+} x_{0}^{-})=(r(x_{0}^{+})-r(x_{0}^{-}))\] (2)

where \(\) is the sigmoid function. This model is known as the Bradley-Terry (BT) model . The reward function can be learned using a binary cross-entropy loss to maximize likelihood:

\[L_{}(r)=-_{x_{0}^{+},x_{0}^{-}}[(r(x_{0}^{+})-r( x_{0}^{-}))]\] (3)

Given this reward function, preference optimization aims to fine-tune the model to maximize the reward. To prevent the model \(p_{}(x)\) from excessively forgetting its existing capabilities, we use KL-constrained reward optimization as our objective:

\[_{p_{}}_{x_{0} p_{}(x_{0})}[r(x_{0})]- _{}[p_{}(x_{0})||p_{}(x_{0})]\] (4)

where \(p_{}\) denotes the pretrained model distribution, and the hyperparameter \(\) controls the extent to which the model diverges from the prior distribution. The above equation has a unique closed-form solution \(p_{}^{*}\)[14; 25; 39; 41] (see Appendix D.1 for detailed derivation):

\[p_{}^{*}=p_{}(x_{0})(r(x_{0})/)/Z\] (5)

where \(Z=_{x_{0}}p_{}(x_{0})(r(x_{0})/)\) is the partition function. By manipulating this equation, we can express the reward function in terms of the fine-tuned and pretrained model distributions:

\[r(x_{0})=^{*}(x_{0})}{p_{}(x_{0})}+ Z\] (6)

Plugging this into the BT loss equation, we obtain the DPO loss :

\[L_{}=-_{x_{0}^{+},x_{0}^{-}}[(^{*}(x_{0}^{+})}{p_{}(x_{0}^{+})}-^{*}(x_ {0}^{-})}{p_{}(x_{0}^{-})})]\] (7)

Diffusion-DPO.There is a challenge in directly applying the DPO loss function (7) to diffusion models. Specifically, \(p_{}(x_{0})\) is not tractable as it requires marginalizing out all possible diffusion paths \((x_{1},,x_{T})\). Diffusion-DPO  elegantly addresses this issue using the evidence lower bound (ELBO). First, we define a reward function \(R(c,x_{0:T})\) that measures the reward over the entire diffusion trajectory, which yields \(r(x_{0})\) when marginalized across the trajectory:

\[r(x_{0})=_{p_{}(x_{1:T}|x_{0})}[R(x_{0:T})]\] (8)Using \(R(x_{0:T})\), we can reformulate (4) for the diffusion paths \(x_{0:T}\):

\[_{p_{}}_{x_{0:T} p_{}(x_{0:T})}[R(x_{0:T})]- _{}[p_{}(x_{0:T})||p_{}(x_{0:T})]\] (9)

Following a similar process as with the DPO objective, we can derive Diffusion-DPO objective to optimize \(p_{}(x_{0:T})\):

\[L_{}=-_{x_{0}^{+},x_{0}^{-}}[( _{p_{}(x_{1:T}^{+}|x_{0}^{+}),p_{}(x_{1:T}^{-}|x_{0}^{-} )}[^{*}(x_{0:T}^{+})}{p_{}(x_{0:T}^{+})}- ^{*}(x_{0:T}^{-})}{p_{}(x_{0:T}^{-})}])]\] (10)

By leveraging Jensen's inequality and the ELBO, this loss can be expressed as a combination of fully tractable denoising score matching losses (see Appendix D.2 for detailed derivation):

\[L_{} -_{(x_{t}^{+},x_{t}^{-}) D,x_{t}^{+} q(x_{t}^{ +}|x_{0}^{+}),x_{0}^{-} q(x_{t}^{-}|x_{0}^{-})}\] (11) \[[(-\|-_{ }(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{2}-\|-_{}(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{ 2}\\ -(\|-_{}(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}+\|-_ {}(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}))]\]

In Eq. (11), \(\|-_{}(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{2}-\|-_{ }(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{2}\) operates as gradient descent for the preferred sample, while \(\|-_{}(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}-\|-_{ }(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}\) operates as gradient ascent for the dispreferred sample.

### Output-preserving regularization

Unfortunately, in preliminary experiments, we discovered that DPO's KL divergence regularization alone is insufficient for prior preservation. To mitigate this issue, we introduced the following novel regularization term to maintain the diffusion model's denoising capability:

\[L_{}=||_{}(x_{T})-_{}(x_{T})||_{2}^{2}\] (12)

The above regularization maintains the output even when unlearning is performed, and the image is completely noise, i.e., at \(x_{T}\). The reason for limiting it to \(t=T\) is to prevent output preservation regularization from interfering with the removal of the knowledge about unsafe visual features contained in the image \(x_{0}\).

Our final loss function, which incorporates the output preservation regularization, is as follows:

\[L_{} -_{x_{t}^{+} q(x_{t}^{+}|x_{0}^{+}),x_{0}^{-} q (x_{t}^{-}|x_{0}^{-}),x_{T}(0,I)}\] (13) \[[(-\|-_{ }(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{2}-\|-_{}(x_{t}^{+},t)\|_{2}^{ 2}\\ -(\|-_{}(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}+\|-_ {}(x_{t}^{-},t)\|_{2}^{2}))+ L_{}]\]

## 4 Experiments

### Experiments setup

Unlearning setup.We use Stable Diffuson 1.4v (SD1.4v) with a LoRA  rank of 32 with the Adam optimizer for fine-tuning. We observe that it is difficult to unlearn violence with a single LoRA, because it has various subcategories. To address this, we decompose it into four distinctive concepts: blood, suffering, gun, and horror. We apply DUO to each concept and merge them to use as violence unlearning LoRA. We do not train the cross-attention layers to minimize the dependency on the text prompt for unlearning . Our experiments are conducted on Stable Diffusion version 1.4 to compare with other baseline methods. We use ESD , UCE , SPM  as baselines for the concept unlearning category of the safety mechanism. For implementation details, please refer to the Appendix.

Red teaming.For black box red teaming methods that do not access model weights, we use Ring-A-Bell  and SneakyPrompt . Ring-A-Bell uses a genetic algorithm to find prompts that have similar embeddings to unsafe prompts defined by the attacker. We used 95 pre-trained prompts for nudity and 250 prompts for violence provided by the authors. SneakyPrompt slightly perturbsundesirable prompts that are blocked by the safety filter, e.g., "A naked man riding a bike.", to bypass the safety filter, e.g., "A grponypui man riding a bike". We used 200 prompts trained by the authors on SD1.4v for evaluating SneakyPrompt on nudity.

For white-box attacks that access model weights, we use Concept Inversion . The concept inversion protocol is as follows. First, malicious images are generated using prompts provided by the i2p benchmark . For nude images, prompts in the sexual category are used, and for violence, prompts with a toxicity probability of 0.95 or higher are used. For the images obtained through this process, a special token <<> is trained using textual inversion with a model that has a safety mechanism applied. The trained special token is then used as a prefix for the sexual/toxic prompts from the i2p benchmark.

Evaluation.To evaluate whether we have defended against red teaming, we use external models. If these models determine that the image does not contain the unsafe concept, we consider the defense successful and report this ratio as the defense success rate. To classify whether images contain nudity, we use the NudeNet detector . Following Tsai et al. , if the detector detects one of the following labels in the image: "FEMALE BREAST EXPOSED, FEMALE GENITALIA EXPOSED, ANUS EXPOSED, MALE GENITALIA EXPOSED", we consider the image to contain nudity.

To classify whether images contain violence, we used GPT-4o, a state-of-the-art multimodal LLM [58; 61; 1]. We use the user prompt, "Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? Please answer yes or no."  along with the image. If the model's response is "yes", we determine that it contains violence, while "no" indicated unlearning success. If neither token is present, we regenerate the model output.

To evaluate model performance unrelated to the unlearned concept, we measure the FID  and CLIP scores  using MS COCO 30k validation dataset . These metrics provide insights into the capabilities of unlearned models. Additionally, we report the LPIPS  between the images from the original SD1.4v model and those from the unlearned model using identical noises. This quantifies how the unlearned model's distribution differs from the original.

### Red teaming results

Unlearning is a task to satisfy the trade-off between unlearning performance and prior preservation simultaneously. We plot the Pareto curve by adjusting the magnitude of KL regularization. Specifically, each point in the figures corresponds to \(\{100,250,500,1000,2000\}\).

Nudity.Figure 4 shows the quantitative results for nudity detection. Our method maintains model performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art SPM in terms of prior preservation while achieving a defense success rate (DSR) of nearly 90% against all red teaming methods. A notable characteristic of the Pareto curve is the sharp bend where the increase in unlearning performance diminishes, and the model rapidly loses its prior knowledge. Based on this observation, we recommend choosing \(=500\) and \(=250\) for defending against black-box and white-box red teaming methods, respectively.

Figure 4: **Quantitative result on nudity. The defense success rate (DSR) refers to the proportion of desirable concepts are generated. Prior preservation represents 1 - LPIPS between images generated by the prior model and the unlearned model. Results closer to the top right indicate better outcomes.**

Figure 5 presents the qualitative results from Ring-A-Bell and concept inversion attacks. While previous prompt-based unlearning methods are easily circumvented with red teaming, our method demonstrates robust defense against these attacks. This result highlights the effectiveness of our image-based unlearning approach, which is independent of the prompt and robust against prompt-based red teaming. Interestingly, in the case of concept inversion, completely corrupted images are generated, unlike in the Ring-A-Bell attack. Through experimentation, we observed that it is challenging to robustly block textual inversion unless the generated result deviates significantly from the data manifold. This suggests that to defend against white box red teaming, which leverages gradient information, the internal features of the model must be completely removed rather than merely bypassed. Analyzing the different mechanisms of black-box and white-box red teaming presents an interesting direction for future research.

In Table 1, we report the FID and CLIP scores for MS COCO 30k. These scores indicate how well the unlearned model preserves its ability to generate images for unrelated prompts. Unlike the other methods, DUO does not modify text embeddings or prompt-dependent weights; instead, it removes visual features directly from the model, making prior preservation quite challenging. Nonetheless, regarding FID and CLIP scores, DUO shows performance comparable to other unlearning methods. Thus, for nudity, DUO is robust against prompt-based adversarial attacks while also preserving the original model's generation capabilities for unrelated concepts. Figure 6 qualitatively confirms

   Method & FID (\(\)) & CS (\(\)) \\  SD (1.4v) & 13.52 & 30.95 \\ ESD & 14.07 & 30.00 \\ UCE & 13.95 & 30.89 \\ SPM & 14.05 & 30.84 \\ DUO (\(=500\)) & 13.65 & 19.88 \\ DUO (\(=250\)) & 13.59 & 30.84 \\

Conclusion and limitation

We addressed the vulnerability of existing unlearning T2I methods to prompt-based adversarial attacks. To eliminate dependency on prompts, we conducted image-based unlearning and solved it using preference optimization methods. To address the challenge of prior preservation, we curated the dataset using SDEdit and proposed additional output-preservation regularization methods. As a result, our method remained robust against adversarial prompt attacks while maintaining image generation capabilities for unrelated concepts. Since our method involves unlearning visual features, unrelated concepts that share excessively similar visual features may be influenced by unlearning. We anticipate that this issue could be addressed by curating paired datasets that include similar concepts, but we leave this as future work.

Impact statementWhile our method is designed to improve the safety of text-to-Image models, it could potentially be misused by malicious actors. For example, attackers might attempt to manipulate the unlearning process to create more harmful content. Therefore, in an open-source scenario, our method should be applied to the model before releasing the model weights. Additionally, our method may still be vulnerable to new adversarial attacks. Therefore, it is necessary to compensate our method with other safety mechanisms such as dataset filtering or safety checkers.
