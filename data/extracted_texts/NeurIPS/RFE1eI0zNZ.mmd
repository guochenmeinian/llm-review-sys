###### Abstract

Trending topic diffusion and prediction analysis is an important problem and has been well studied in social networks. Representation learning is an effective way to extract node embeddings, which can help for topic propagation analysis by completing downstream tasks such as link prediction and node classification. In real world, there are often several trending topics or opinion leaders in public opinion space at the same time and they can be regarded as different centers of public opinion. A public opinion field will be formed surrounding every center. These public opinion fields compete for public's attention and it will potentially affect the development of public opinion. However, the existing methods do not consider public opinion field effect for trending topics diffusion. In this paper, we introduce three well-known observations about public opinion field effect in media and communication studies, and propose a novel and effective heterogeneous representation learning framework to incorporate public opinion field effect and social circle influence effect. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to consider these effects in representation learning for trending topic diffusion. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superiority of our model.

## 1 Introduction

With the rapid development of the Internet, hundreds of millions of people access and share information on social medias. Social networks have become the most important platform for producing and spreading public opinions. Various trending topics widely spread on social networks will bring a series of consequences. For example, fake news quickly spreads on social networks, will cause governments or organizations to fall into a huge crisis of public opinion . Studying the diffusion and prediction of trending topics can effectively help governments and enterprises to timely discover potential public opinion crisis and deal with it to avoid their reputation and economic losses .

The existing studies on trending topic diffusion are mainly divided into two categories: content-based and network-based. The content-based methods [54; 21; 55; 26] aim to predict the dissemination trends, e.g., number of comments and retweets, mainly for a blog based on content features such as tags of text, images, and videos, but not cosider the network features. For network-based methods, various prediction model based on graph embedding techniques [6; 53; 34; 62] or random walk [33; 51; 2; 22] are proposed to calculate the information propagation probability for every node in social networks. Recently, representation learning on heterogeneous graph becomes an effective way to extract a low-dimensional node embedding by considering the network structure and node attribute features, which can be applied to downstream tasks of propagation analysis such as link prediction and node classification [18; 28; 27; 61; 30].

However, the existing representation learning models only consider the information of social network itself but neglect the influence of "public opinion field effect" for trending topic diffusion. In real life, there are often several trending topics or opinion leaders in the public opinion space at the same time. Every topic or opinion leader with the people actively following it in a social network will form a public opinion field. Research on media and communication has shown that the total amount of public's attention is always limited . These public opinion field compete for public's attention and such competition will potentially affect the development of public opinion. Obviously, a topic with higher popularity may attract more attention from people who are following other topics. The existence of public opinion field effect makes the existing representation learning model cannot work well on the trending topic diffusion. A few works on media and communication [6; 53; 34] only present some statistics of public opinion field, e.g., the number of people who talk about different topics, but not consider to incorporate the public opinion field effect into representation learning for trending topic diffusion. Moreover, in real world, people are always involved in a topic propagation if their social circle is actively talking about the same topic, even though they are not interested in this topic at the beginning. This effect is also not considered in existing representation learning model.

In this paper, we study how to incorporate public opinion field effect in representation learning. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first one regarding this problem for trending topic diffusion. Our proposed model includes "topic propagation representation" and "social circle influence representation". In topic propagation representation, three kinds of nodes, event nodes, information source nodes and opinion leader nodes, are regarded as the centers of public opinion for their corresponding topics. We define public opinion field based on center node and propose a kind of paradigm to quantify the "energy" of public opinion field, which can reflect the attraction power of public opinion field. We introduce three well-known observations about public opinion effect in media and communication studies, "_Attention Competition Effect_", "_Popularity Dominance Effect_" and "_Negative Bias Effect_", and design the model to obtain the higher quality representation by considering these effects in trending topic diffusion. In social circle influence representation, the social circle influence effect is considered in representation learning. The main contributions are summarized below:

1. We formalize public opinion field effect and propose a novel and effective heterogeneous representation learning model by incorporating public opinion field effect for the first time.
2. We consider the social circle influence, which extensively exists in real world, to enhance the quality of node representation.
3. We conduct extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.

## 2 Formalization of Public Opinion Field Effect

In order to better investigate the diffusion of public opinion events in social network, we introduce the "_public opinion field effect_" in representation learning for the first time. In real applications, the public

Figure 1: Public opinion field effect.

opinion space includes various public opinion events attracting users' attention in social network. A public opinion field can be regarded as a public opinion event with the users paying attention to it or a high influence user with his/her followers. The interaction of different public opinion fields influences the development of public opinion events. To formalize the public opinion field, we first introduce _Public Opinion Network_ (PON), which is essentially a heterogeneous network consisting of different kinds of entities and links. All of the entities in a PON can be categorized into three types: (i) users in the social network, (ii) public events and (iii) sources that publish the events. All of the links in a PON can be categorized into four types: (i) friendship link (user to user), (ii) concern link (user to event), (iii) publication link (source to event) and (iv) citation link (source to source). The definition of PON is given below:

**Definition 1** (Public Opinion Network):: A public opinion network (PON) is a heterogeneous directed graph \(G=(V,E)\), where \(V=U I S\) is the set of nodes and \(E(U U)(U I)(S I)(S S)\) is the set of links among the nodes in \(V\). Note that \(U\), \(I\) and \(S\) are disjoint sets of the nodes representing the users in social network, public opinion events and sources publishing the events respectively. 

Fig. 1(a) shows an example of a public opinion network. A public opinion network depicts the public opinion space in a social network. In a public opinion network, every event node, source node and opinion leader node is also called a "public opinion center node", or \(\) node for simplicity. Note that opinion leader nodes identifying in social networks has been well studied and thus we do not discuss it, but instead consider them as input to our model in this paper. We use \(U_{h}\) and \(C\) to denote the sets of highly influential user nodes and \(\) nodes respectively, i.e., \(C=I S U_{h}\). Next we give the definition of _Public Opinion Field_.

**Definition 2** (Public Opinion Field):: Given a public opinion network \(G\) and a public opinion center node \(v_{i} C\), a public opinion field (or \(\) for simplicity) \(P_{i}\) of \(v_{i}\) is defined as an induced subgraph of \(G\) on \(N_{i}\{v_{i}\}\), where \(N_{i}\) is the neighbor set of \(v_{i}\) in \(G\). 

Fig. 1(b) illustrates an example of several \(\) nodes and their corresponding \(\) in a PON. Note that in a social network a user may be in several distinct \(\) at the same time. A \(\) node can be regarded as the center of "whirlpool" of a public topic and a \(\) can be regarded as a view in \(G\) focusing on a \(\) node with the users pay attention to it. Existing works neglect "public opinion field effect" in representation learning for public event diffusion. However, in practice, the interaction between different \(\) always affects the development of public opinion. There are three well-known observations in media and communication studies as follows:

**Observation 1** (_Attention Competition Effect_):: The popularity of news decreases with the number of competing items that are simultaneously available. A user's breadth of attention remains essentially constant and the diversity of memes to which a user can pay attention is bound .

**Observation 2** (_Popularity Dominance Effect_):: In public opinion space, the topics with the higher popularity are more powerful to attract users' attention .

**Observation 3** (_Negative Bias Effect_):: The negative events, e.g., fake news or rumors, are easier to spread in social networks .

It is noteworthy that we recognize the existence of other effects (e.g., "Empathy Effect"  and "Primacy Effect" ) in the real world. However these effects are not closely relevant to the influence of coexisting trending topics on information diffusion. In addition, there also are some other effects (e.g., "Snowball Effect"  and "Herd Effect" ) in media and communication studies, but the meaning behind these effects are very similar to three effects introduced in this paper and thus we do not discuss them.

Observation 1 indicates the amount of attention in public opinion space is always constant, the attention on a current public topic may be seized by another rising topic, e.g., "Feng Wang Effect"1 in China. Observations 2 and 3 indicate that trending topics and negative events probably grab more attention in public opinion space. For fusion of above three effects in representation learning, we define "energy" of public opinion field to quantify the attraction power of a \(\) node in PON \(G\).

**Definition 3** (Public Opinion Field Energy):: Given a \(\) node \(v_{i}\) with its \(\)\(P_{i}\), the energy of \(P_{i}\), denoted as \(E(P_{i})\), is defined as \(E(P_{i})=_{v_{j} N_{i}}w_{i,j}_{i,j}\), where \(N_{i}\) is the neighbor set of \(\) node \(v_{i}\), \(w_{i,j}\) is the popularity contribution of \(v_{j}\) for a \(\) node \(v_{i}\) and \(_{i,j}\) is the attention degree of \(v_{j}\) for a topic represented by \(\)\(v_{i}\). 

Here \(w_{i,j}\) reflects how much popularity or attention can be brought if \(v_{j}\) participates in the discussion or propagation of public topic \(v_{i}\). It is obvious that Michael Jordan brings more attention than the ordinary person when discussing basketball topics. \(_{i,j}\) reflects how much attention that \(v_{j}\) intends to pay on the topic represented by \(\) node \(v_{i}\).

Note that researchers can calculate \(w_{i,j}\) and \(_{i,j}\) in any reasonable ways and we utilize attention mechanism function and covariance function to compute them respectively in this paper. We will discuss it in the next section and then prove that attention defined in our representation learning follows Observation 1, i.e., the total amount of attention in the public opinion fields is constant.

If a \(\) node \(v_{i}\) is related to a negative topic, an energy amplification factor \(_{i}\) (\(_{i}>1\)) is utilized to amplify the energy of \(\)\(P_{i}\) by \(_{i} E(P_{i})\) and thus Observation 3 is satisfied in our representation learning framework.

Notably, the reason we use only \(1\)-hop neighbors to construct \(\) and \(\) energy is that they are closest to \(\). There are also someone know a trending topic indirectly or post their comments on a retweeted content. In fact, this phenomenon has been taken account into our social circle influence representation in Section 3.2. Moreover, our model can be easily extended to handle \(k\)-hop neighbors by the following equation \(E(P_{i}^{(k)})=_{t=1}^{k}_{d_{i,j}=t}w_{i,j}_{i,j}\), where \(d_{i,j}\) denotes the distance between nodes \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\). We will experimentally illustrate the soundness of the choice of \(1\)-hop neighbors in Section 4.5.

## 3 Representation Learning

We investigate "_topic propagation representation_" and "_social circle influence representation_" in our model. In topic propagation representation, public opinion field effect is introduced to reflect that how users actively participate in trending topics diffusion. However, in practice, some users are passively involved in a trending topic diffusion because most of his/her friends have participated in the discussion about this topic. For example, someone not interested in computer science does not care about the topic about ChatGPT when he/she knows it from news for the first time, but his/her interest will rise if most of his/her friends are talking about ChatGPT and thus he/she will participate in this topic diffusion. We consider such effect in social circle influence representation.

As shown in Fig. 2, our model is divided into three parts: topic propagation representation, social circle influence representation and objective optimization. In topic propagation representation, we first calculate the \(\) energy, i.e., \(_{j}=E(P_{j})=_{v_{i} N_{j}}w_{j,i}_{j,i}\). Then, \(\) energy will be combined with the heterogeneous graph convolution module to perform feature aggregation for the four types of nodes in the PON. In social circle influence representation, we combine the representation obtained

Figure 2: Overall framework of our model.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

_Case_ (3): For each user node \(v_{i} U_{2}\), its different \(\) neighbor nodes will compete for user \(v_{i}\)'s attention (_Attention Competition Effect_). The \(\) neigbor node with the larger \(\) energy will gain more attention from \(v_{i}\) (_Popularity Dominance Effect_). We consider both self attention mechanism and public opinion field effect in node representation \(_{i}^{}\) for \(v_{i} U_{2}\):

\[_{i}^{}=(_{v_{j} N_{i}\{v_{i}\}}_ {i,j}}_{j}),\ }_{j}=_{j}+_{j}_{j}^{}\] (5)

\[_{i,j}=((_{i},_{j}, )),\ (_{i},_{j},)=_{j} (_{i},_{j})\] (6)

Note that \(_{j}^{}\) is node representation of \(\) node \(v_{j}\) calculated in case (1), \(_{j}\) is the normalized \(\) energy of \(v_{j}\), i.e., \(_{j}=E(P_{j})\), and thus \(=(_{1},,_{|C|})\) is the vector of all the normalized \(\) energy. Specifically, we need to second normalize the \(\) energy of all \(\) neighbors of \(v_{i} U_{2}\): \(_{j}_{j}/_{v_{j} N_{i}}_{j}\). In Eq. (5), the term \(_{j}_{j}^{}\) is utilized to reflect the influence of \(\)\(P_{j}\) for representation of \(v_{i}\), because \(_{j}^{}\) is the representation of \(P_{i}\) as explained in case (1).

_Case_ (4): For every node \(v_{i} U_{3}\), it has two kinds of neighbors, \(\) neighbors \(v_{j} C\) and normal user neighbors \(v_{j} U-U_{h}\). To consider heterogeneity, RGCN  designs different feature projection matrices for different types of links. Inspired by this, we use two different weight matrices \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\) to calculate two different attention coefficient \(_{i,j}^{1}\) and \(_{i,j}^{2}\), that is

\[_{i,j}^{k}=((_{k}, {h}_{i},_{j})),\ (_{k},_{i},_{j})=(_{k}^{ }(_{i}_{j}))\] (7)

where \(k=1\) if \(v_{j} S_{1}=N_{i} C\) and \(k=2\) if \(v_{j} S_{2}=N_{i}(U-U_{h})\). Therefore, the node representation \(_{i}^{}\) of \(v_{i} U_{3}\) is given below:

\[_{i}^{}=(_{v_{j} S_{1}}_{i,j}^{1} }_{j}+_{v_{j} S_{2}}_{i,j}^{2} _{j}),\ }_{j}=_{j}+_{j}_{j}^{}\] (8)

Like case (3), \(_{j}^{}\) is node representation for \(\) node \(v_{j} S_{1}\) calculated in case (1).

### Social Circle Influence Representation

As per the discussion, users are always involved in the diffusion of trending topics that their social circle are talking about. To investigate such influence, we propose social circle influence representation after topic propagation process. In social circle influence representation, a user node will be imposed influence from their neighbors who have paid attention to the some trending topic. In PON \(G\), every user node in \(U\) will receive different amounts of topic information from its user neighbors. We use the graph attention mechanism, \(_{i,j}=((_{i}^{}, {h}_{j}^{{}^{}}))\), to measure the influence weight for node \(v_{i}\) from its neighbor \(v_{j}\), where \(_{i}^{{}^{}}\) and \(_{j}^{{}^{}}\) are the topic propagation representation of node \(v_{i}\) and \(v_{j}\) in Section 3.1. Therefore, the total influence on user \(v_{i} U\) from its social circle (i.e., \(N_{i}\)) can be computed as follows:

\[(_{j}^{{}^{}}|v_{j} N_{i})= _{v_{j} N_{i}}_{i,j}_{j}^{{}^{}}\] (9)

Note that even though \(v_{i}\) can be influenced by its neighbors, its own representations learned from topic propagation representation are fundamental and important. Thus the final representation \(_{i}\) of a user node \(v_{i} U\) is as follows:

\[_{i}=((_{i}^{{}^{}}(_{j}^{{}^{}}|v_{j} N_{i})))\] (10)

### Optimization

Note that after topic propagation representation and social circle influence representation, the features of all the nodes in \(G\) are updated to \(^{|V| f}\).

_Unsupervised Proximity Loss_. In real world, proximity exists extensively in a public opinion field. The users within the same \(\) always have similar features such as background, career, interest and so on. For example, users who actively discuss ChatGPT usually have the same background or interest in computer science. Moreover, the features of the nodes within a \(\) should be correlated with feature of \(\) node in this \(\), which is the reason that they prefer to pay attention to this \(\) node. In this paper, we utilize such proximity property, by enhancing the correlation of embeddings between \(\) node and all the nodes within the same \(\), to obtain higher-quality embeddings from our representation learning model. Specifically, we first use the readout function to aggregate the features of all the nodes within \(\ P_{i}\) to generate their common embedding \(_{i}^{f}\):

\[_{i}=(_{i})\] (11)

where \(_{i}^{\{v_{i}\}} f}\) denotes the embedding of all the nodes in the \(\ P_{i}\). \(()\) denotes a simple permutation-invariant function (e.g., sum and mean). Let \(_{c}^{ f}\) and \(_{c}^{ f}\) denote the readout embedding of all \(\) and the embedding of all \(\) nodes, respectively. In order to maximize the correlation between the \(\) node and all the nodes within the same \(\), the mutual information (MI) between \(_{c}\) and \(_{c}\) is maximized. Specifically, given two random variables \(\) and \(\), we adopt MINE method proposed in  to maximize the lower bound of \((,)\) as follows:

\[(,)_{P(,)}[D(, )]-_{P()P()}[e^{D(,)}]\] (12)

where \(D(,)\) is a binary discriminator. Therefore, to maximize \((_{c},_{c})\), the unsupervised proximity loss \(L_{p}\) is defined below:

\[L_{p}(_{c},_{c})=-_{P(_{i},_{i})}[D( {e}_{i},_{i})]+_{P()P()}[e^{D(_{i},_{i})}]\] (13)

where \(_{i}\) and \(_{i}\) denote the readout representation and the original representation of the \(\) node \(v_{i}\). The discriminator \(D(,)\) is defined as a simple neural network, \(D(_{i},_{i})=(_{i}^{}_{i})\). In the experiment, for each batch, we estimate the first term in Eq. (13) by selecting a set of \(\{(_{i},_{i})\}_{i=1}^{B}\) from the joint distribution \(P(_{i},_{i})\), and then we shuffle the \(_{i}\) in the batch and generate "negative pairs" in order to estimate the second term.

_Supervised Loss_. For downstream tasks, we can minimize the cross-entropy loss function between ground truth and prediction:

\[L_{s}=-_{l L}^{l}(}^{l})\] (14)

where \(}\) is the parameter of the classifier, \(L\) is the set of labeled nodes/edges, \(^{l}\) and \(^{l}\) are the label vector and embeddings of the labeled nodes/edges respectively. Finally, We define the total loss by linearly combining these two component losses: \(L=L_{s}+ L_{p}+ L_{reg}\), where \(\) is the hyperparameter that controls the proportion of unsupervised proximity loss and \( L_{reg}\) is the regularization term to alleviate overfitting.

## 4 Experiments

### Experimental Setup

_Datasets._ Detailed statistical information of the datasets is shown in Table 1. (1) **BuzzFeed and PolitiFact**. The two datasets are from a comprehensive fake news detection benchmark dataset, FakeNewsNet [47; 48]. They are collected from two platforms with fact-checking: BuzzFeed and PolitiFact, both containing news content with labels and social context information. (2) **Twitter**. This dataset [31; 47] contains multiple articles, with each article corresponding to one event. For each event, the dataset includes its source, a list of participating users, and their tweets. This dataset also includes Twitter profile description and the list of Twitter profiles each user follows. More information on the three datasets can be found in _Appendix_ A.1 and _Appendix_ A.2.

_Baselines_. For simplicity, our model is denoted as POFD (**P**ublic **O**pinion **F**ield Effect Fusion in Representation Learning for Trending Topics **D**iffusion). We compare our model against three categories of graph representation learning methods: (1) Homogeneous-**node2vec**, **GCN** and **GAT**. (2) Heterogeneous-**mp2vec**, **HAN**, **HetGNN**, **HGT** and **HALO**. (3) Misinformation detection-**FANG** and **MetaHG**.

Table 1: Statistics of datasets.

_Parameter Settings_. We set the embedding dimension to 256, return parameter to 1, in-out parameter to 1, path length to 40, and window size to 10 in node2vec and mp2vec. All GNN models are two-layer structures with a hidden layer dimension of 256 and an output dimension of 128 and are implemented through the PyTorch Geometric (PyG) package . The models that require setting the number of attentional heads are set to 4. In POFD, we select the top 500 user nodes in degree ranking as \(U_{h}\). The energy amplification factor of the fake news event is set to 3. For all neural network models, the learning rate is 0.001, the number of training epochs is 200. For all methods, we run 10 times with the same partition and report the average results. The dataset and code with running instructions are available at https://github.com/ki-ljl/POFD.

### Public Opinion Concern Prediction

_Setting_. In this paper, we define public opinion concern prediction as two types of link prediction: **user-user** and **user-event**. Specifically, we randomly sample 10% of the two types of links from the dataset to generate test edges. In the test edges, the positive and negative edges are each 50%. Then, we mask the positive test edges from the dataset to prevent information leakage. We report the AUC and average precision (AP) of all models in Table 2.

_Analysis._ It is clear that POFD consistently performs better than all baselines on three datasets. Compared to the best performance of baselines, POFD achieves a high improvement in both AUC and AP, which indicates the effectiveness of considering public opinion field effect and social circle influence in representation learning. We also observe that GNNs generally achieve better performance than random walk-based methods, due to the fact that random walk-based methods can only simply exploit structural information in the PON without considering feature information that is crucial in topic diffusion.

### Event Classification

_Setting_. We also conduct the event classification task to evaluate the embeddings learned from POFD. Specifically, since the properties of the event (positive or negative) are unknown, we first set the energy amplification factor of all poc nodes to 1. Then for each dataset, we randomly split event nodes into 70%, 10%, and 20% for training, validation and testing. We report the accuracy and F1 scores of all models in Table 3.

_Analysis._ Based on the results reported in Table 3, we observe that POFD achieves the best performance on all metrics for all three datasets. By capturing the interactions between pofs of different events, POFD can learn more meaningful event node embeddings and thus achieves the best performance on the event classification task.

### Universality Analysis

In addition to pof in PON, there are various fields in real life, such as _academic field_ in DBLP . Specifically, DBLP is a well-known heterogeneous academic network containing four types of nodes (**author**, **paper**, **term** and **conference**) and three types of links (**author-paper**, **paper-term** and **paper-conference**). More information about DBLP can be found in _Appendix_A.1. Like events attract users in PON, conference nodes in DBLP attract the attention of authors and their papers (and terms). Specifically, authors may be attracted to multiple conferences (this attraction is linked through author-paper and paper-conference).

_Setting._ In this experiment, we let the conference nodes be poc nodes and then conduct the research domain classification task for the author nodes. We use the DBLP dataset provided in PyG , which

_Analysis._ Fig. 3 reports the results of the ablation experiments. We observe that POFD outperforms the three variants mentioned above, which indicates that all three modules of POFD can individually improve the model performance.

In general, this type of approach often requires the processing of content to produce manual features, often with significant workload.

**Homogeneous Network-Based.** With the rise of graph mining techniques [37; 13; 60; 15; 57], a large number of people have started to study how to model information diffusion using graph structures. Bourigault et al.  embedded nodes in a continuous latent space and calculate the contamination scores of nodes activated by source nodes through a diffusion kernel function in the latent space. Inf2vec  studied the problem of influence embedding of nodes in social networks. RNe2Vec  estimated the information diffusion probability based on the random wandering method. Based on the state of the nodes' network and local neighborhoods, DeepInf  aimed to predict the activation probability of the nodes. CasSeqGCN  combined network structure and time series to predict the information cascade. None of these models can model complex social contexts such as user-event relationships, and thus cannot extract high-quality embedding representations.

**Heterogeneous Network-Based.** The heterogeneous network-based methods learn high-quality embedding representations through diverse neighborhood relationships. Although earlier studies such as [19; 38; 39; 49] also considered heterogeneous scenarios, they all optimized a specific objective (e.g., fake news detection) rather than extracting abundant node representations, and thus were not very generalizable. FANG  improved the quality of node representation learning by capturing the rich social interactions between users, news and media to improve the accuracy of fake news detection. Such approaches mainly improve the embedding representation by considering heterogeneous information in the network, but they do not make use of some deeper semantics such as public opinion field effects.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose for the first time to fuse the public opinion field effect into the representation learning of trending topics diffusion. Then, we propose a representation learning framework POFD that includes both topic propagation and social circle influence. Experimental results including public opinion concern prediction and event classification demonstrate the effectiveness of POFD. We also show that POFD is also effective for other types of fields (e.g., academic fields in DBLP).

**Ethics Statement.** An important application of our study is fake news controlling. For example, wiping out $130 billion in stock value after a false tweet claimed that Barack Obama was injured in an explosion . Our intention behind this work is that studying trending topic diffusion can help timely discover potential crises caused by fake news and clarify the truth with evidence as soon as possible to avoid unnecessary losses.

**Limitations and Future Work.** We note that POFD does not consider the dynamics of PON, such as the disappearance of old events and the emergence of new events. Therefore, in the future we will investigate representation learning for dynamic PONs.
