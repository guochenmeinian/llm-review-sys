## 1 Introduction

Realistic human avatar creation is crucial for various applications such as AR/VR, as well as the movie and gaming industry. Methods for creating a 3D avatar from a single RGB image are especially important to scale up avatar creation and make it more consumer-friendly compared to traditional studio-based capture methods. This task is, however, very challenging due to the vast diversity of human bodies and poses, further complicated by the wide variety of clothing and accessories. These challenges are exacerbated by the lack of large-scale 3D human data and ambiguities inherent in a monocular 2D view setting.

Recent image-to-3D approaches can be categorized into reconstruction-based and multi-view diffusion-based methods. Reconstruction-based approaches directly predict a 3D representation that can be rendered from any viewpoint. Due to the explicit 3D representation, these methods produce an arbitrary number of consistent viewpoint renderings. They obtain the 3D reconstruction either based on common template [23; 87; 108; 88] which utilize the SMPL  body model as the shape prior, or a flexible implicit function to represent loose clothing [56; 57; 57]. These methods, either template-based [23; 87; 88; 108; 108] or template-free [56; 57; 74; 110; 26], are typically deterministic which produce blurry textures and geometry in the occluded regions. More importantly, they are trained on small-scale datasets due to the limited amount of high-quality 3D data, which further restricts their ability to generalize to diverse shapes and textures.

Multi-view diffusion methods [42; 60; 77] distill the inherent 3D structure present in 2D diffusion models . Typically, they fine-tune a large-scale 2D foundation model [25; 64] on a large 3D dataset of objects [13; 82; 99], to produce a _fixed_ number of viewpoints. However, since these models diffuse images purely in 2D without explicit 3D constraints or representation, the resulting multi-views often lack 3D consistency [54; 41], which restricts downstream applications .

To address these challenges, we propose **Human-3Diffusion**: realistic avatar creation via **3D** consistent **Diffusion** models. We design our method based on two key insights: 1) 2D multi-view diffusion models provide large-scale shape priors that can help 3D reconstruction; 2) A reconstructed 3D representation ensures 3D consistency across multi-views in 2D diffusion. Specifically, we propose a novel diffusion method, which bridges 3D Gaussian Splitting (3D-GS)  generation with a 2D multi-view diffusion model. At every iteration, multi-view images are denoised and reconstructed to 3D-GS to be re-rendered to continue the diffusion process. This 3D lifting during iterative sampling ensures the 3D consistency of the 2D diffusion model while leveraging a large-scale foundation model trained on billions of images. Our framework elegantly combines reconstruction methods with multi-view diffusion models. In summary, our contributions are:

* We propose a novel image-conditioned 3D-GS generation model for 3D reconstruction that bridges large-scale priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models and the efficient and explicit 3D-GS representation.
* A sophisticated diffusion process that incorporates reconstructed 3D-GS to improve the 3D consistency of 2D diffusion models by refining the reverse sampling trajectory.
* Our proposed formulation enables us to jointly train 2D diffusion and our 3D model on \( 6000\) high-quality human scans and our method shows superior performance and generalization capability than prior works. Our code and pretrained models will be publicly released on our project page.

Image to 3D.Creating realistic human avatar from consumer grade sensors [92; 93; 94; 95; 96; 97; 98; 99; 94] is essential for downstream tasks such as human behaviour understanding [9; 85; 84; 86; 9] and gaming application [105; 106; 38; 44; 20]. Researchers have explored avatar creation from monocular RGB [31; 80], Depth [93; 16] video or single image [56; 57; 59; 87; 88]. Avatar from single image is particularly interesting and existing methods can be roughly categorized as template-based [23; 87; 88; 108] and template-free [56; 57; 59; 95]. Despite the impressive performance,template-based approaches rely on the naked body model [46; 50] and fail to reason extremely loose clothing, while template-free methods produce blurry back side textures. Instead of SMPL shape prior, our method is template-free and leverages strong 2D image priors to create high-quality avatars. Orthogonal to humans, object reconstruction methods typically adopt template-free paradigms and early works [6; 71; 81; 83; 107] focus mainly on geometry. With the advance of 2D diffusion models  and efficient 3D representation , recent works can reconstruct 3D objects with detailed textures [26; 41; 45; 60; 67; 74; 89; 90; 110]. One popular paradigm is first using strong 2D models [42; 61; 77] to produce multi-view images and then train another model to reconstruct 3D from multi-view images [41; 40; 45; 67; 91]. In practice, their performance is limited by the accuracy of the multi-view images generated by 2D diffusion modes. Our method tightly couples 2D and 3D models and yields better performance by guiding 2D sampling with 3D reconstruction.

Shape Prior from 2D Diffusion Model.Being trained on billions of images , 2D image diffusion models  have been shown to have 3D awareness and some works tried to use score distillation sampling [53; 79] to distil 3D knowledge of 2D models [39; 48; 109]. Other works propose to further enhance the 3D reasoning ability by fine-tuning the model on large-scale datasets [13; 82; 99] to generate multi-view images [34; 37; 42; 43; 60; 61; 68; 76; 77]. Dense self-attention [75; 77], depth-aware attention  or epipolar attention [30; 66] are introduced to enhance the 3D consistency of multi-views. However, these methods do not have explicit 3D while our method incorporates explicit 3D consistency into the reverse sampling process and obtains better results.

## 3 Preliminaries

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models.DDPM  is a generative model which learns a data distribution by iteratively adding (forward process) and removing (reverse process) the noise. Formally, the forward process iteratively adds noise to a sample \(_{0}\) drawn from a distribution \(p_{}()\):

\[_{t}(_{t};}_{t- 1},(1-_{t})):=_{t}}_{0}+_{t}},(0, ),\] (1)

where \(_{t},_{t}\) schedules the amount of noise added at each step \(t\). To sample data from the learned distribution, the reverse process starts from \(_{T}(0,)\) and iteratively denoises it until \(t=0\):

\[_{t-1}(_{t-1};_{}(_{t}, t),_{t-1}),_{t-1}=_{t-1}}{1-_{t}}(1-_{t})\] (2)

A network parametrized by \(\) is trained to estimate the posterior mean \(_{}\) at each step \(t\). One can also model conditional distribution with DDPM by adding the condition to the network input [15; 24].

2D Multi-View Diffusion Models.Many recent works [42; 43; 45; 60; 68; 77] propose to leverage strong 2D image diffusion prior  pre-trained on billions images  to generate multi-view images from a single image. Among them, ImageDream  demonstrated a superior generalization capability to unseen objects . Given a single condition image \(^{}\) and an optional text description \(y\), ImageDream generate 4 orthogonal target views \(^{}\) with a model \(_{}\), which is trained to estimate the noise added at each step \(t\). With the estimated noise \(_{}\), one can compute the "clear" target views \(}_{0}^{}\) with close-form solution in Eq. (1):

\[}_{0}^{}=_{t}}}( _{t}^{}-_{t}}_{ }(_{t}^{},^{},y,t)).\] (3)

This _one-step_ estimation of \(}_{0}^{}\) can be noisy, especially when \(t\) is large and \(_{t}^{}\) is extremely noisy. Thus, the iterative sampling of \(_{t}^{}\) is required until \(t=0\). To sample next step \(_{t-1}^{}\), standard DDPM  computes the posterior mean \(_{}\) from current \(_{t}^{}\) and estimated \(}_{0}^{}\) at step \(t\) with:

\[_{}(_{t}^{},t):=_{t-1}(_{t}^{},}_{0}^{})=}\,(1-_{t-1})}{1-_{t}}_{t}^{}+_{t-1}}_{t}}{1-_{t}}}_{0}^{ {tgt}},_{t}=1-_{t}.\] (4)

Afterwards, \(_{t-1}^{}\) can be sampled from Gaussian distribution with mean \(_{t-1}\) and variance \(_{t-1}\) (Eq. (2)) and used as the input for the next iteration. The reverse sampling is repeated until \(t=0\) where 4 clear target views are generated.

Although multi-view diffusion models [43; 60; 77] generate multiple views together, the 3D consistency across these views is not guaranteed due to the lack of an explicit 3D representation. Thus, we propose a novel 3D consistent diffusion model, which ensures the multi-view consistency at each step of the reverse process by diffusing 2D images using reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splats .

## 4 3Diffusion

Overview.Given a single RGB image, we aim to create a realistic 3D avatar consistent with the input. We adopt an image-conditioned 3D generation paradigm due to inherent ambiguities in the monocular view. We introduce a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS ) generative model that combines shape priors from 2D multi-view diffusion models with the explicit 3D-GS representation. This allows us to jointly train our 3D generative model and a 2D multi-view diffusion model end-to-end and improves the 3D consistency of 2D multi-view generation at inference time.

In this section, we first introduce our novel generative 3D-GS reconstruction model in Sec. 4.1. We then describe how we leverage the 3D reconstruction to generate 3D consistent multi-view results by refining the reverse sampling trajectory (Sec. 4.2). An overview of our method can be found in Fig. 2.

### Generative 3D-GS Reconstruction with Diffusion Priors

Given a context image \(^{c}\), we use a conditional diffusion model to learn and sample from a plausible 3D distribution. Previous works demonstrated that 3D generation can be done implicitly via diffusing rendered images of a differentiable 3D representation [7; 35; 70] such as NeRF [49; 97]. In this work, we introduce a novel generative model for 3D Gaussian Splattings , which diffurses rendered images of 3D-GS and enables sampling of 3D-GS at inference time. Single image to 3D generation is however very challenging, we hence propose to leverage 2D multi-view diffusion models in a tightly coupled manner which allows us to train it end-to-end with our novel 3D generative model.

Generative 3D-GS Reconstruction.In this work, we propose a 3D-GS generative model \(g_{}\), which is conditioned on input context image \(^{c}\) to perform reconstruction of 3D Gaussian Splats \(\). Diffusing directly in the space of \(\) parameters requires pre-computing Gaussian Splats from scans, which is exorbitant. Instead, we diffuse the multi-view renderings of \(\) using a differentiable rendering function renderer.

We denote \(_{0}^{}\) as the ground truth images at target views to be diffused and \(_{0}^{}\) as the additional

Figure 2: **Method Overview. Given a single RGB image (A), we sample a realistic 3D avatar represented as 3D Gaussian Splats (D). At each reverse step, our 3D generation model \(g_{}\) leverages 2D multi-view diffusion prior from \(_{}\) which provides a strong shape prior but is not 3D consistent (B, cf. Sec. 4.1). We then refine the 2D reverse sampling trajectory with generated 3D renderings that are guaranteed to be 3D consistent (C, cf. Sec. 4.2). Our tight coupling ensures 3D consistency at each sampling step and obtains a high-quality 3D avatar (D).**novel views for supervision. At training time, we uniformly sample a timestep \(t(0,T)\) and add noise to \(_{0}^{}\) using Eq. (1) to obtain noisy target views \(_{t}^{}\). Our generative model \(g_{}\) takes \(_{t}^{}\), diffusion timestep \(t\), and the conditional image \(^{c}\) as input, and estimates 3D Gaussians \(}\):

\[}=g_{}(_{t}^{},t,^{c}),\; \;_{t}^{}=_{t}}_{0 }^{}+_{t}},\;\; (0,)\] (5)

We adopt an asymmetric U-Net Transformer proposed by  for \(g_{}\) to directly predict 3D-GS parameters from per-pixel features of the last U-Net layer. To supervise the generative model \(g_{}\), we use a differentiable rendering function \(:\{,^{}\}^{}\) to render images at target views \(^{}\) and additional novel views \(^{}\). Denoting \(_{0}:=\{_{0}^{},_{0}^{}\}\) as ground truth and \(}_{0}:=\{}_{0}^{},}_{0 }^{}\}\) as rendered images, we compute the loss on images and generated 3D-GS:

\[_{gs}&=_{1} _{}_{0},}_{0}+ _{2}_{}_{0},}_{0}+_{3}_{}(g_{}( _{t}^{},t,^{c})),\\ &\;}_{0}:=\{}_{0}^{ {tgt}},}_{0}^{}\}=(g_{}( _{t}^{},t,^{c}),\{^{},^{}\}),\] (6)

here \(_{}\) denotes the Mean Square Error (MSE) and \(_{}\) is the perceptual loss based on VGG-19 . We also apply \(_{}\), a geometry regularizer  to stabilize the generation of \(}\).

With this, we can train a generative model that diffuses 3D-GS _implicitly_ by diffusing 2D images \(_{t}^{}\). At inference time, we can generate 3D-GS given the input image by denoising 2D multi-views sampled from Gaussian distribution. We initialize \(_{T}^{}\) from \((0,)\), and iteratively denoise the rendered images of predicted \(}\) from our model \(g_{}\). At each reverse step, our model \(g_{}\) estimates a clean state \(}\) and render target images \(}_{0}^{}\). We then calculate target images \(_{t-1}^{}\) for the next step via Eq. (4) and repeat the process until \(t=0\). For more details, please refer to Appendix A.3

Our generative 3D-GS reconstruction model archives superior performance on in-distribution human reconstruction yet generalizes poorly to unseen categories such as general objects (Sec. 5.3 Fig. 5). Our key insight for better generalization is leveraging strong priors from pretrained 2D multi-view diffusion models for 3D-GS generation.

3D-GS Generation with 2D Multi-view Diffusion.Pretrained 2D multi-view diffusion models (MVD)  have seen billions of real images  and millions of 3D data , which provide strong prior information and can generalize to unseen objects . Here, we propose a simple yet elegant idea for incorporating this multi-view prior into our generative 3D-GS model \(g_{}\). We can also leverage generated 3D-GS to guide 2D MVD sampling process which we discuss in Sec. 4.2.

Our key observation is that both 2D MVD and our proposed 3D-GS generative model are diffusion-based and share the same sampling state \(_{t}^{}\) at timestep \(t\). Thus, they are _synchronized_. This enables us to couple and facilitate information exchange between 2D MVD \(_{}\) and 3D-GS generative model \(g_{}\) at the same diffusion timestep \(t\). To inject the 2D diffusion priors into 3D generation, we first compute _one-step_ estimation of \(}_{0}^{}\) (Eq. (3)) using 2D MVD \(_{}\), and condition our 3D-GS generative mode \(g_{}\) additionally on it. Formally, our 3D-GS generative model enhanced with 2D multi-view diffusion priors is written as:

\[}=g_{}(_{t}^{},t,^{c},}_{0}^{}),\;\;}_{0}^{}=_{t}}}(_{t}^{}-_{t}}_{}(_{t}^{},^{c}, y,t))\] (7)

The visualization of \(}_{0}^{}\) along the whole sampling trajectory in Fig. 7 shows that the pretrained 2D diffusion model \(_{}\) can already provide useful multi-view shape prior even in large timestep \(t=1000\). This is further validated in our experiments where the additional 2D diffusion prior \(}_{0}^{}\) leads to better avatar reconstruction (Tab. 4) as well as more robust generalization to general objects (Fig. 5). By utilizing the timewise iterative manner of 2D and 3D diffusion models, we can not only leverage 2D priors for 3D-GS generation but also train both models jointly end to end, which we discuss next.

Joint Training with 2D Model.We adopt pretrained ImageDream  as our 2D multi-view diffusion model \(_{}\) and jointly train it with our 3D-GS generative model \(g_{}\). We observe that our joint training is important for coherent 3D generation, as opposed to prior works that frozen pretrained 2D multi-view models . We summarize our training algorithm in Algorithm 1. We combine the loss of 2D diffusion and our 3D-GS generation loss \(_{gs}\)( Eq. (6)):

\[_{total}=_{}(,_{ })+_{gs}\] (8)Once trained, one can sample a plausible 3D-GS avatar \(\) conditioned on the input image from the learned 3D distributions. However, we observe that the multi-view diffusion model \(_{}\) can still output inconsistent multi-views along the sampling trajectory (see Fig. 2). On the other hand, our 3D generator produces explicit 3D-GS which can be rendered as 3D consistent multi-views. Our second key idea is to use the 3D consistent renderings to guide 2D sampling process for more 3D consistent multi-view generation. We discuss this in Sec. 4.2.

### Guide 2D Multi-view Sampling with Reconstructed 3D-GS

With the shared and _synchronized_ sampling state \(_{t}^{}\) of 2D multi-view diffusion model \(_{}\) and 3D-GS reconstruction model \(g_{}\), we couple both models at arbitrary \(t\) during training. Similarly, they are also connected by both using estimated clean multi-views \(_{0}^{}\) at sampling time. To leverage the full potential of both models, we carefully design a joint sampling process that utilizes the reconstructed 3D-GS \(}\) at each timestep \(t\) to guide 2D multi-view sampling, which is summarized in Algorithm 2. We observe that the key difference between the clean multi-views estimated \(_{0}^{}\) from 2D diffusion model and our 3D-GS generation lies in 3D consistency: 2D MVD computes multi-view \(}_{0}^{}\) from 2D network prediction which can be 3D inconsistent while our \(}_{0}^{}\) are rendered from explicit 3D-GS representation which are guaranteed to be 3D consistent. Our idea is to guide the 2D multi-view reverse sampling process with our 3D consistent renderings \(}_{0}^{}\) such that the 2D sampling trajectory is more 3D consistent. Specifically, we leverage 3D consistent multi-view renderings \(}_{0}^{}\) to refine the posterior mean \(_{}(_{t}^{},t)\) at each reverse step:

\[_{}(_{t}^{},t):=_{t-1} (_{t}^{},}_{0}^{}) _{}(_{t}^{},t):=_{t-1}(_{t}^{ },}_{0}^{}),\] (9) \[}_{0}^{}=(},^{}),_{t-1}(_{t}^{},}_{0}^{})= }(1-_{t-1})}{1-_{t}} _{t}^{}+}_{t}}{1-_{t}}}_{0}^{}\]

With this refinement, we guarantee the 3D consistency at each reverse step \(t\) and avoid 3D inconsistency accumulation in original multi-view sampling . In Fig. 7, we visualize the evolution of originally generated multi-views \(}_{0}^{}\) and multi-views rendering \(}_{0}^{}\) from generated 3D-GS \(}\) along the whole reverse sampling process. It intuitively shows how effective the sampling trajectory refinement is. We perform extensive ablation in Sec. 5.3 showing the importance of the consistent refinement for sampling trajectory.

**Algorithm 2** 3D Consistent Sampling

## 5 Experiments

In this section, we first compare against baseline methods for human reconstruction in Sec. 5.2 and then ablate our design choices in Sec. 5.3.

### Experimental Setup

**Datasets.** We train our model on a combined 3D human dataset [1; 3; 4; 2; 21; 27; 65; 98] compromising \( 6000\) high quality scans. We evaluate qualitatively and quantitatively on CAPE [47; 52; 103], Sizer [8; 72] and IIIT  dataset. Please refer to Appendix D.1 and Appendix D.2 for more details.

**Implementation Details.** We trained our model on 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs over approximately 5 days. Each GPU was configured with a batch size 2 and gradient accumulations of 16 steps to achieve an effective batch size of 256. For more training details regarding hyperparameters, diffusion schedulers, etc., please refer to Appendix A.1 for more details. Our model creates 3D Avatar from single images in 22.6 seconds on a A100 GPU and only consumes 11.7 GB VRAM, which allows the efficient large-scale avatar generation.

**Evaluation Metrics.** We evaluate the geometry quality using Chamfer Distance (CD in \(cm\)), Point-to-Surface Distance (P2S in \(cm\)), F-score  (w/ threshold of \(0.01m\)), and Normal Consistency (NC) between the extracted mesh (Appendix A.4) and the groundtruth scan. Appearance quality is assessed by rendering the reconstructed avatar from 32 novel views with uniform azimuth and 0 elevation angle. The metrics for appearance reported include multi-scale Structure Similarity (SSIM) , Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS) , and Peak Signal to Noise Ratio (PSNR) between rendered and ground-truth views. Moreover, we report the Frechet inception distance (FID)  which reflects the quality and realism of the unseen regions.

### Realistic Avatar from Image

We compare our approach against prior methods for image-to-avatar reconstruction, including template-based [18; 23; 87; 88; 56; 108], template-free  human reconstruction methods, as well as general image-to-3D methods [67; 74; 89]. To further assess performance, we also fine-tuned the state-of-the-art object reconstruction method LGM  and its deployed multi-view diffusion model  on our training data, denoted as LGM\({}_{}\). Quantitative evaluations reported in Tab. 1 demonstrate

Figure 3: **Qualitative comparison with baselines. Recent avatar reconstruction works ICON , ECON , SiTH  and SIFU ) cannot reconstruct loose clothing coherently. Additionally, SiTH and SIFU generate blurry texture in unseen regions due to their deterministic formulation of regressing 3D avatar directly from single RGB image. In contract, our method is able to reconstruct avatars with realistic textures and plausible 3D geometry in both seen and unseen region.**that our proposed method excels in reconstructing realistic avatars with accurate geometry (CD, NC, F-score) and realistic texture (SSIM, LPIPS, PSNR, FID) from a single RGB image.

We present qualitative comparison examples in Fig. 3 and Appendix B.1, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of competing methods. Template-based methods such as SiTH  and SIFU  struggle to accurately reconstruct the geometry of loose clothing (as shown in row 4) due to their reliance on the naked SMPL body shape. In contrast, template-free methods like PIFu  and TripoSR  offer greater flexibility and better performance on loose clothing. However, they are not generative models and their deterministic formulations lead to blurry textures in unseen regions, as they tend to produce average textures rather than distinct details. Similar to our approach, LGM  and InstantMesh  utilize 2D diffusion models to generate multi-view images and perform sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Nonetheless, their separation of 2D and 3D models cannot correct the 3D inconsistencies that may arise from the 2D models. Even further fine-tuning of LGM on human scans (Fig. 4) does not adequately address these challenges due to the complex and sensitive nature of human geometry and textures. In contrast, our conditional generative formulation and inherent 3D consistency by tightly coupling 2D-3D models allow us to obtain accurate reconstruction in front view and realistic generation in unseen regions. We also show the generative power of our method in Appendix C.5: by sampling with different seed, we obtain diverse yet plausible reconstruction.

Please also refer to Fig. 6, Appendix C and our project page for additional reconstruction results on challenging subjects not previously observed, encompassing a diverse range of appearances such as loose skirts and custom suits, as well as accessories like bags and gloves.

### Ablation Studies

**Importance of Trajectory Refinement.** One of our key ideas is leveraging our explicit 3D model to refine the 2D multi-view reverse sampling trajectory, ensuring 3D consistency in Multi-View Diffusion (MVD) generation (see Sec. 4.2 and Eq. (9)). To evaluate this, we compare the multi-view images generated by pretrained MVD, fine-tuned MVD on our data (MVD\({}_{}\)) and MVD with our 3D consistent sampling

Table 2: **Evaluating trajectory refinement** for 2D multi-view diffusion. Our proposed refinement improves multi-view image quality.

Figure 4: **3D reconstruction conditioned on different multi-view priors.** Without our 3D-consistent sampling, the 2D diffusion model cannot generate 3D consistent multi-views (MVD, MVD\({}_{}\)), leading to artifacts like floating 3D Gaussians splats.

(ours), as shown in Tab. 2. The results demonstrate that our proposed method effectively enhances the quality of generated multi-view images by leveraging the explicit 3D model to refine sampling trajectory. Additionally, we analyze the 3D reconstruction results with the multi-view images generated by these models in Fig. 4. MVD and MVD\({}_{}\) produce inconsistent multi-view images, which typically lead to floating Gaussian and hence blurry boundaries. In contrast, our method can generate more consistent multi-views, result in better 3D Gaussians Splats and sharper renderings.

Importance of 2D Multi-view Prior.Another key idea of our work is the use of multi-view priors \(}_{0}^{}\) from 2D diffusion model pretrained on massive data [13; 55; 58] to enhance our 3D generative model. This additional prior information is pivotal for ensuring accurate reconstruction of both in-distribution human dataset and generalizing to out-of-distribution objects.

We evaluate the performance of our 3D model \(g_{}\) by comparing generation results with and without the 2D diffusion prior \(}_{0}^{}\) (refer to Eq. (7) and Eq. (5)). Notably, without the 2D multi-view conditioning, the alignment of the generated 3D model in the front view is not guaranteed due to the relative camera pose settings in our 3D generative model \(g_{}\). Therefore, we evaluate the overall quality solely through the Frechet Inception Distance (FID).

For avatars reconstruction, our powerful 3D reconstruction model can already achieve state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, our full model with multi-view prior \(}_{0}^{}\) generates avatars with higher quality as demonstrated in Tab. 4. We further evaluate it on the GSO  dataset which consists of unseen general objects to our model. The improvements are even more pronounced in this setting, highlighting the challenges of generating coherent 3D structures from a single 2D image, particularly with unseen objects. For additional examples, please see Fig. 15 in Supp.

## 6 Limitations and Future Work

Currently, our method is constrained by the \(256 256\) resolution of the multi-view diffusion model, which restricts the sharpness of texture details (see Appendix E). Upgrading to more powerful high-resolution (\(512 512\)) multi-view diffusion models [19; 68] could potentially resolve these issues. Moreover, our approach may struggle in reconstructing subjects with challenging poses, as we further discussed in Appendix E. Synthesizing training data with challenging poses [10; 86] could be a potential solution.

Our method is a general framework for image-to-3D reconstruction, which is applicable to various objects and compositional shapes like human-object interactions. We leave these to future works.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we introduce **Human-3Diffusion**, a 3D consistent diffusion model for creating realistic avatars from single RGB images. Our key ideas are two folds: 1) Leveraging strong multi-view priors

from pretrained 2D diffusion models to generate 3D Gaussian Splats, and 2) Using the reconstructed explicit 3D Gaussian Splats to refine the sampling trajectory of the 2D diffusion model which enhances 3D consistency. We carefully designed a diffusion process that synergistically combines the strengths of both 2D and 3D models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms all previous reconstruction works in both appearance and geometry. We also extensively ablate our method which proves the effectiveness of our proposed ideas. Our code and pretrained models will be released on our Project Page to foster future research.
