###### Abstract

Algorithmic monoculture arises when many decision-makers rely on the same algorithm to evaluate applicants. An emerging body of work investigates possible harms of such homogeneity, but has been limited by the challenge of incorporating market effects in which the preferences of many applicants and decision-makers jointly interact to determine outcomes. Addressing this challenge, we introduce a tractable theoretical model of algorithmic monoculture in a two-sided matching market with many participants. We use the model to analyze outcomes under monoculture (when decision-makers all evaluate applicants using a common algorithm) and under polyculture (when decision-makers evaluate applicants independently). All else equal, monoculture (1) selects less-preferred applicants when noise is well-behaved, (2) matches more applicants to their top choice, though individual applicants may be worse off and have higher variance outcomes depending on their value to decision-makers, and (3) is more robust to disparities in the number of applications submitted. Overall, our approach strengthens, challenges, and broadens the scope of the existing monoculture literature.

## 1 Introduction

What happens when many decision-makers--in consequential domains like employment and college admissions--all evaluate applicants using the _same_ algorithm? This possibility has been termed "algorithmic monoculture"--a name that references the problems arising in agriculture when a single crop is farmed extensively, amplifying the risk of correlated widespread failures. A recent line of work considers how a lack of variety in algorithms may warrant similar concerns; this concern may be especially important if many decision-makers use the same large language models.

Initial inquiries into the consequences of algorithmic monoculture have identified potential harms to both decision-makers and applicants. In seminal work initiating the formal study of algorithmic monoculture, Kleinberg and Raghavan  demonstrated that firms relying on a common algorithm may hire weaker applicants than when using idiosyncratic (but less individually accurate) hiring processes. On the applicant side, an emerging set of work highlights the concern of _systemic exclusion_, which occurs when an applicant is denied from all opportunities .

This emerging literature has been limited by the challenge of incorporating _market_ effects. Domains where monoculture may be especially impactful--such as employment and college admissions--share some common properties. First, participants on both sides of the market compete: workers compete over a limited number of job openings, and firms compete over workers who can each accept only one offer. Second, outcomes are determined by the preferences of participants on both sides: roughly speaking, a match is formed only if both a worker and firm prefer each other over their other options. Analyzing these interactions across many participants can be theoretically challenging; indeed, the existing monoculture literature in the ML community considers neither markets with many participants nor two-sided interactions.

The technical contribution of our paper is a matching markets model that can be used to study algorithmic monoculture. We analyze equilibrium outcomes (i.e., stable matchings) that emerge under _monoculture_ (when firms each use the same method to evaluate applicants) and _polyculture_ (when firms use idiosyncratic methods). The model builds on the popular continuum model formalized by Azevedo and Leshno , where stable matchings are characterized by a cutoff structure in which applicants are matched to their favorite firm among those where their _score_ exceeds the firm's _cutoff_. In the model we introduce, an applicant's score is equal to an _estimated value_ that is a noisy realization of their _true value_. Under monoculture, all firms use a single shared estimate of an applicant's value; under polyculture, firms obtain separate, independently drawn estimates of the applicant's value. Our theoretical results are shown in a setting with a symmetric setup with a large number of homogeneous firms. This allows for tractability, as well as clear intuition. We demonstrate empirically that our theoretical results hold in markets with heterogeneous firms, as well as when firms use ML models to rank applicants.

We show how modeling market effects with many participants advances the present understanding of monoculture in several ways, with Figure 1 illustrating our first two theoretical results:

* (Theorem 1) First, as long as noise is well-behaved (i.e., with lighter-than-exponential tail), essentially only the most preferred applicants are hired under polyculture when there are many firms. This shows that the existing (relatively modest) effect found by Kleinberg and Raghavan  with two firms can be fully strengthened when considering many firms. Our result gives a "wisdom of the crowds"-like result, where even when individual firms are noisy, the market outcome can behave as if firms each had perfect information about applicants--even despite firms not explicitly sharing any information. Polyculture can thus significantly outperform monoculture in terms of firm welfare, even when the idiosyncratic evaluation processes of firms are much noisier than the shared algorithm used under monoculture.
* (Theorem 2) Second, we challenge--and add nuance to--existing work suggesting that monoculture harms applicants. In fact, we show that _on average_, applicants are better off under monoculture than polyculture, in the sense that on average, applicants are matched to firms that they more prefer. On the other hand, the _individual_ preference of an applicant for monoculture or polyculture depends on their true value. Some applicants are strictly more likely to be matched to their top choice under monoculture, but strictly less likely to match at all--and so have higher _variance_ of outcomes conditional on true value; for these applicants, their preference could depend on other factors such as risk aversion. This finding can also be interpreted as showing that monoculture presents a greater risk of systemic exclusion  to more qualified applicants who might be overlooked by a single algorithm. However, it does not pose a greater risk of systemic exclusion _overall_.
* (Theorem 3) Third, we expand the scope of existing analysis by extending our model to incorporate _differential application access_: when applicants submit a varying number of applications. This addresses an equity concern especially salient in college admissions, where the cost of application can be high.1 It also reveals how different application systems incentivize applicants to submit more applications. We find that applicants who submit many applications benefit much more under polyculture than under monoculture. Consequently, differences in the number of applications submitted harms college and firm welfare more under polyculture than monoculture. Overall, monoculture is more robust than polyculture with respect to differential application access. 
Our approach strengthens, challenges, and broadens the scope of the monoculture literature. The effects we study emerge in large markets with two-sided preferences, a standard setting for algorithmic monoculture (e.g., prior works often motivate monoculture through the lens of hiring). Moreover, the cutoff structure inherent in Azevedo and Leshno  results in clean intuition for each of our results--as well as precise characterizations at the level of individual applicants. In this way, we bridge the literature on monoculture and matching markets, and we anticipate that the matching literature can provide further insight into the emerging study of monoculture.

The paper proceeds as follows. In Section 2, we consider related work in the algorithmic monoculture and matching markets literature (we give an extended discussion of related work in Appendix B). InSection 3, we introduce our model and establish some preliminary results. In Section 4, we introduce Theorem 1 and Theorem 2 (we give an extended model and establish Theorem 3 in Appendix A). In Section 5, we provide an overview of our computational experiments; in particular, we test our theoretical predictions in an experiment where firms use ML models (trained on the ACSIncome dataset ) to evaluate applicants. Proofs of all theoretical results are given in Appendix E.

## 2 Related Work

Algorithmic Monoculture in MLOur model extends Kleinberg and Raghavan ; they analyze the case where two decision-makers each hire one applicant, while we consider many decision-makers who can each hire many applicants. Theorem 1 in the present work shows that the effect found in Kleinberg and Raghavan , where polyculture can result in higher total accuracy than monoculture, _is fully strengthened when considering many decision-makers_.

Our two-sided matching markets model also makes it easy to simultaneously study _applicant_ welfare, which has recently been of concern. Creel and Hellman  argue that _systemic exclusion_, in which applicants are systematically denied all opportunities, can pose significant harm. Bommasani et al.  and Toups et al.  analyze this effect empirically by examining the level of homogeneity in decision-making across algorithms. One limitation of this existing work is that it does not consider _market-level_ effects, which are present in domains such as hiring and college admissions. For example, if the total number of available positions is fixed and if firms intend to fill all of these positions, then the total rate of systemic exclusion does not change (the number of people that do not end up receiving a position is fixed). We show _which_ applicants are at a greater risk of systemic exclusion under monoculture. Our model gives a tractable way to theoretically analyze market outcomes. In Section 5, we further show how empirical approaches can be adapted accordingly under our model.

Matching Markets and School ChoiceBy analyzing algorithmic monoculture through a matching markets framework, our results reveal connections between algorithmic monoculture and questions that have been considered in the matching markets (and school choice) literature. For example, Castera et al.  analyzes statistical discrimination in stable matching. In their model, the values of applicants from two groups are estimated by two decision-makers, potentially with correlation (monoculture). Like us, they leverage a continuum model of applicants . Their findings focus on aggregate measures of applicant-side welfare across groups. They show, for example, that the group of applicants evaluated with less correlation is matched with higher probability. More directly related to our work, they show that decreased correlation (even in one group), reduces the number of applicants who receive their top choice; this parallels our finding in Theorem 2(ii), which implies that

Figure 1: Under monoculture, the set of matched applicants is more noisy. However, applicants are more likely to match to their top choices. Roughly speaking, the use of a single algorithm means that applicants who match tend to “do well” across all firms; however, high-value applicants may not match due to a single poor evaluation.

fewer applicants are matched to their top choice under polyculture. This finding reflects a general result developed in the school choice literature: that increasing correlation in how decision-makers evaluate applicants also increases the total number of applicants matched to their top choice. It is well-established that in school matching, the use of a single lottery number (rather than an independent lottery per school) results in more students being matched to their top choices and is more robust to differences in the number of listed schools . A key distinguishing feature of the model studied here and by  is using approximate values to determine which applicants are matched, but to analyze the matching using a different set of true (latent) values.

Interestingly, the matching markets and school choice literature generally shows the _benefits_ of increased correlation in how applicant evaluation, while the algorithmic monoculture literature describes primarily _harms_. Our work helps reconcile these competing intuitions. In comparison to the matching markets literature, we assume that each applicant has some ground truth value, and that decision-makers noisily rank students based on this value. Consequently, we can analyze outcomes for _individual_ applicants, whereas the markets literature primarily considers homogeneous applicants. This reveals the relevant trade-offs between monoculture and polyculture. For example, we show (Theorem 2) that increased correlation (monoculture) increases the probability that an applicant is matched to their top choice, but can also increase the probability that a high-value applicant does not match at all. Our analysis with many firms and applicants also reveals market _emergent_ phenomena not apparent in smaller markets. In follow-up work, we show that Theorem 1 extends to a setting with arbitrary student preferences and college capacities . There, it is shown that when noise is long-tailed, the _opposite_ effect can occur, where students match uniformly at random under polyculture. See Appendix B for an extended discussion of related work.

## 3 Model and Preliminaries

Our model builds on Azevedo and Leshno , with a continuum of applicants and a finite number of firms (or colleges). An applicant is identified by their true _value_, which is distributed on \(\) according to a probability measure \(\). Let \(=\{1,2,,m\}\) be the set of all firms. Firms have total capacity \(S<1\) (there are fewer positions than applicants) and each firm has the same capacity \(\). In our setup, firms have only _estimates_ of applicant true values, instead of direct access to the true values. An applicant with value \(v\) is associated with an independent random variable \((v)\), characterizing their preferences over firms and firms' estimated values for that applicant. The realization of \((v)\) is their _type_, which lies in the set of applicant types \(:=^{m}\), where \(\) is the set of preference orderings over the firms. If \((v)==(^{},e^{})\), then \(^{}\) is the preference ordering of \(v\) over firms and \(e^{}_{f}\) is the _estimated value_ of the applicant at firm \(f\). (In this way, any measurable subset of student values induces a measure over \(\).) Firms all prefer applicants with higher true values, but in practice, rank applicants based on the estimated values given by \((v)\).

A _matching_ is a function \(:\{\}\) that satisfies the capacity constraints

\[_{}[((v))=f]\,d(v)=, f ,\] (1)

as well as two additional technical assumptions: that \(^{-1}(f)\) is measurable and that the set \(\{:()^{}f\}\) is open. Then \(((v))\) is a random variable indicating where an applicant with value \(v\) is matched, with \(((v))=\) indicating that the applicant is not matched. When it is clear what \(\) is, we will abuse notation to write \((v)\) instead of \(((v))\) to denote the random variable representing where an applicant with value \(v\) is matched. A matching is _stable_ if there does not exist a pair \(,f\) such that \(f^{}()\), and \(e^{}_{f}>e^{^{}}_{f}\) for some \(^{}^{-1}(f)\). In other words, there is no applicant-firm pair that would jointly prefer to defect from the current matching to be matched with each other.

A Cutoff Characterization of Stable MatchingA benefit of the continuum model is that stable matchings are characterized by a tractable cutoff structure . Given a vector of _cutoffs_\(P=(P_{1},,P_{m}),\) an applicant with type \(\) can _afford_ firm \(f\) if \(e^{}_{f} P_{f}\). The applicant's _demand_ at \(P\) is \(D^{}(P)\), the applicant's most preferred firm (according to \(^{}\)) among those they can afford. If they cannot afford any firm, \(D^{}(P)=\). The _aggregate demand_ of a firm \(f\) at \(P\) is

\[D^{f}(P):=_{}[D^{(v)}(P)=f]\,d(v),\] (2)the measure of applicants who demand it. A vector of cutoffs \(P\) is _market clearing_ if and only if \(D^{f}(P)=\) for all \(f m\). Notably, stable matchings are in one-to-one correspondence with market-clearing cutoffs:

**Lemma 1** (Supply and Demand Lemma ).: _A matching \(\) is stable if and only if there exists a vector of market-clearing cutoffs \(P\) such that \(()=D^{}(P)\)._

The characterization of stable matchings given by the continuum model is summarized as follows. Applicants each have an estimated value at each firm. Firms each have cutoffs. An applicant is then matched to their most preferred firm among those at which an applicant's estimated value is above the cutoff. Next, we show how we can instantiate monoculture and polyculture within the model.

Instantiating Monoculture and PolycultureWe instantiate our model by specifying \((v)\) for monoculture and polyculture. In what follows, we consider a fixed _noise distribution_\(\).

* In _monoculture_, we take the random variable \[_{}(v):=(,(v+X,v+X,,v+X)),\] (3) where \(\) is drawn uniformly at random from \(\) and \(X\). In other words, applicants have preferences distributed uniformly at random, and each applicant has a single estimated value \(v+X\) that is shared across firms. This noisy estimated value equals the applicant's value perturbed by noise drawn from \(\).
* In _polyculture_, we take the random variable \[_{}(v):=(,(v+X_{1},v+X_{2},,v+X_{m})),\] (4) where \(\) is drawn uniformly at random from \(\) and \(X_{1},X_{2},,X_{m}\) are i.i.d.. Again, applicants have preferences distributed uniformly at random, but now each applicant has a distinct, independently drawn estimated value at each firm.2 
Preliminary AnalysisWe establish some basic results. First, we show that under both monoculture and polyculture, stable matchings are characterized by identical cutoffs at each firm.3

**Lemma 2** (Equal Cutoffs Lemma).: _If \(\{_{},_{}\},\) then there is a unique vector of market-clearing cutoffs \(P\), and \(P_{1}=P_{2}==P_{m}\)._

We denote these unique _shared cutoffs_ by \(P_{}\) and \(P_{}\), respectively, with corresponding stable matchings \(_{}\) and \(_{}\). Under our abuse of notation, \(_{}(v):=_{}(_{}(v))\) and \(_{}(v):=_{}(_{}(v))\) are random variables representing where \(v\) matches. This cutoff structure allows for clean analysis of stable matchings. The next proposition follows directly from the Supply and Demand Lemma (Lemma 1) and the Equal Cutoffs Lemma (Lemma 2).

**Proposition 3**.: _For all \(v\),_

1. _the probability an applicant with value_ \(v\) _is matched under monoculture is_ \[[_{}(v)]=[v+X>P_{}],\] (5) _where_ \(X,\) _and_
2. _the probability an applicant with value_ \(v\) _is matched under polyculture is_ \[[_{}(v)]=[v+_{f}X_{f}>P _{}],\] (6) _where_ \(X_{1},,X_{m}}}{{}}\)_._Proposition 3 contrasts the structure of stable matchings in the monoculture and polyculture economies. In monoculture, applicants match depending on a single noisy estimated value. In polyculture, applicants match depending on the _maximum_ of \(m\) noisy estimated values.

Proposition 3 also reveals that the shared cutoff is lower under monoculture than polyculture. This explains the puzzle of why it is not the case that fewer applicants are matched overall under monoculture: when estimated values at firms become more correlated, the acceptance cutoff decreases:

**Corollary 4** (Lower Cutoff Under Monoculture).: _When \(m 2\), the shared cutoff in an economy is lower under monoculture than under polyculture: i.e., \(P_{}<P_{}\)._

Intuitively, the result holds because under polyculture, applicants have multiple chances at getting an estimated value that is higher than the shared cutoff; so in order for the same number of applicants to be matched under monoculture and polyculture, the cutoff under monoculture must be lower.

Definition: Maximum-Concentrating NoiseWe now introduce basic definitions that will be useful for reasoning about the noise distribution \(\). In particular, we define a particular class of noise distributions that we will focus our later analysis on. The **maximum order statistic** of \(n\) draws from a distribution \(\) is defined as the random variable \(X^{(n)}:=\{X_{1},X_{2},,X_{n}\}\) where \(X_{1},,X_{n}}}{{}}\). The maximum order statistic plays an important role in our analysis, since the probability an applicent with value \(v\) is matched under polyculture (6) can be rewritten as

\[[_{}(v)]=[v+X^{(m)}>P_{}].\] (7)

A distribution \(\) is **maximum concentrating** if for all \(>0\),

\[_{n}[|X^{(n)}-[X^{(n)}]|>]=0.\] (8)

In other words, a distribution is maximum concentrating if its maximum order statistic satisfies a "weak law of large numbers." These include the uniform and Gaussian distributions, as well as (roughly speaking) distributions with an upper tail that is "lighter than exponential."4

## 4 Main Results: Firm and Applicant Welfare

### Firm welfare

In this section, we focus on the perspective of firms, who would like to admit the most-preferred applicants (i.e., those with the highest true values). To do this, we analyze the probability that an applicent with a given value is matched. As it turns out, strong behavior emerges under polyculture as the number of firms \(m\) in the economy grows large. In particular, when the noise distribution \(\) is maximum-concentrating, only the highest-value applicants are matched; as a function of an applicant's value, the probability that an applicent is matched approaches a step function when \(m\) approaches \(\). This, in turn, implies that the matching under polyculture approaches optimal.

Define \(v_{S}\) to be the unique value such that \(((v_{S},))=S\), i.e., the threshold at which the mass of students with value above \(v_{S}\) equals the total firm capacity. Note that in the firm-optimal matching, only applicants with value greater than \(v_{S}\) are matched. We may now state our first main result.

**Theorem 1** (Wisdom of the Crowds in Polyculture but not Monoculture).: _Suppose \(\) is maximum concentrating. Then:_

1. _Under polyculture, the probability an applicent is matched approaches_ \(0\) _or_ \(1\) _as_ \(m\)_:_ \[_{m}[_{}(v)]=0&v< v_{S}\\ 1&v>v_{S},\] (9) _and firm welfare approaches optimal._
2. _Under monoculture, the probability an applicent is matched,_ \([_{}(v)]\)_, is constant in_ \(m\)_, and firm welfare is constant and suboptimal._Despite individual firms making noisy decisions, under polyculture, they collectively admit only the highest-value applicants as \(m\) grows large (as illustrated in Figure 2). This gives a "wisdom of the crowds"-like result. Notably, firms do not directly share information with one another; rather, the market at large (specifically, the structure of stable matchings) facilitates the pooling of information.5

Intuition for Theorem 1At a high level, the maximum estimated value--which is what determines if an applicant is matched--can effectively "distinguish" between applicants of higher and lower values. Consider applicants Alice and Bob. Alice's value \(v_{A}\) is higher than Bob's value \(v_{B}\). We show that if \(\) is maximum-concentrating, the probability that Bob is matched but Alice is unmatched vanishes as the number of firms \(m\) grows large. If Bob is matched but Alice is not, then Bob's maximum estimated value must be higher than Alice's. The probability this occurs is given by \([v_{A}+X_{A}^{(m)}<v_{B}+X_{B}^{(m)}]\), where \(X_{A}^{(m)}\) and \(X_{B}^{(m)}\) are independent variables distributed according to \(X^{(m)}\). Since \(\) is maximum concentrating, the probability that two independent draws from \(X^{(m)}\) differ by more than the constant \(v_{A}-v_{B}\) vanishes as \(m\) grows large. Thus, Alice's maximum estimated value will almost always be higher than Bob's.

### Applicant welfare

We now consider matching from the applicant's perspective. Our main result (Theorem 2) shows a few things. All applicants are more likely to be matched to their top choice firm under monoculture than under polyculture (part (i))--moreover, under monoculture, all applicants who are matched to _some_ firm are matched to their _top_ firm (part (ii)). This implies that total applicant welfare--as measured by the average rank of where applicants are matched--is optimal under monoculture (and better than under polyculture). Meanwhile, in part (iii), we show that there exists a set of applicants of positive measure that is simultaneously more likely to match to their top choice under monoculture while less likely to match overall, which implies that the applicant's variance is higher under monoculture. For these applicants, neither monoculture or polyculture stochastically dominates the other.

Define \(_{(v)}(f):=|\{f^{}:f^{}^{(v)}f\}|\) to be the rank of an applicant's match, with \(_{(v)}()=0\). \(_{v}((v))\) is a random variable giving the rank of the firm an applicant of value \(v\) is matched to under \(\). Let \((X_{-},X_{+})\) be the support of noise distribution \(\).

**Theorem 2** (Likelihood of Matching to Top Choice or At All).: _The following hold:_

1. _For all_ \(v\)_, the probability an applicant matches to their top choice is at least as high under monoculture as under polyculture: i.e.,_ \([_{v}(_{}(v))=1][_{v}( _{}(v))=1]\)_. The inequality is strict for all_ \(v(P_{}-X_{+},P_{}-X_{-}),\) _a set of positive_ \(\)_-measure._

Figure 2: As the number of firms \(m\) increases, \([_{}(v)]\) approaches a step function, meaning that only the highest-value applicants match. Meanwhile, \([_{}(v)]\) remains the same regardless of \(m\); in particular, high-value applicants have positive probability of not matching. There are 1000 total applicants and firms have total capacity 500. Applicants have values drawn uniformly from \(\) and uniformly-random preferences. Noise is drawn uniformly from \([-0.5,0.5]\). Plot displays average over 1000 simulations.

2. _For all_ \(v\)_, if_ \(_{}(v)\)_, then_ \(_{v}(_{}(v))=1,\) _meaning that all applicants who match under monoculture are matched to their top choice, and that the matching attains optimal applicant welfare._
3. _When_ \(\) _is maximum concentrating, for all_ \(v(v_{S},P_{}-X_{-})\)_, which is a set of positive_ \(\)_-measure, and for all_ \(m\) _sufficiently large, an applicant with value_ \(v\) _is less likely to match under monoculture than under polyculture: i.e.,_ \([_{}(v)]<[_{}(v) ]\)_._

The high-level reasoning behind these results is fairly straightforward. First, in part (i), the probability an applicant is matched to their top choice is exactly the probability that their estimated value at that firm exceeds the shared cutoff: \(P_{}\) under monoculture and \(P_{}\) under polyculture. We know that \(P_{}<P_{}\) (from Corollary 4), so this probability is at least as large under monoculture in comparison to under polyculture (and in many cases, strictly larger). To show part (ii), observe that if an applicant's common estimated value under monoculture exceeds the shared cutoff \(P_{}\), that applicant can afford any firm; thus, they are matched to their top choice. Finally, part (iii) is a consequence of Theorem 1, where we showed that for applicants with value \(v\) above a certain threshold \(v_{S}\), their likelihood of being matched approaches \(1\) as \(m\), while their likelihood of being matched remains constant (and less than \(1\)) under monoculture when \(v<P_{}-X_{-}\).

### An Extension: Differential Application Access.

We extend our primary setup to include _differential application access_--when different applicants submit a differing number of total applications. In practice, the number of applications submitted in college admissions varies significantly, and can be correlated with socioeconomic status: for example, in the 2021-2022 cycle, applicants who submitted 15 or more applications on the Common App were 2.5x as likely to have attended a private high school . Our main result here (Theorem 3) shows that applicants who submit more applications do not benefit under monoculture, but do benefit under polyculture. Intuitively, this is because an applicant's estimated value is the same across firms under monoculture, so submitting applications does not increase the likelihood that an applicant will have a higher estimated value. Meanwhile, under polyculture, submitting more applications increases the likelihood that an applicant will receive a higher estimated value, since estimated values are drawn independently. This is shown in Figure 3. The full extended model and results are given in Appendix A.

Figure 3: We plot the probability of matching conditional on \(k\), the number of applications submitted. There are 1000 applicants and 25 firms have total capacity 500. Applicants have values drawn uniformly from \(\) and uniformly-random preferences. Noise is drawn uniformly from \([-0.5,0.5]\). Each applicant can apply to \(k\) colleges, drawn uniformly from \(\{1,2,,25\}\). Probabilities are averages over 10,000 simulations.

## 5 Computational Experiments

We provide an overview of our computational experiments, with full details in Appendices C and D. Code to reproduce our experiments (and all other figures) is available at a publicly-available repository.6 The code can also be adapted to test further variations in market settings.

ML Simulations: ACSIncomeWe test our theoretical predictions in a setting where preference approximation is done via ML models. Applicants have 0-1 true values, and firms rank applicants based on a prediction outputted by an ML model (following ). We consider models using different sets of features, and compare markets where firms use different models to evaluate applicants (polyculture) and markets where firms use the same model (monoculture). We use the ACSIncome dataset--specifically, individuals from Texas in 2018 . (We also perform experiments using data from California; see Appendix C.) The ACSIncome dataset has 10 features that are used to predict a binary 0-1 outcome.7 For each of the \(=45\) pairs of features, we train a logistic regression model using a 90 percent train split. We then evaluate markets where each applicant corresponds to a point in the test split. This yields markets with 13,593 total applicants, of which 5,055 have value 1 and 8,538 have value 0. We assume that there are 5 firms, each with capacity 1000, and that applicants have uniformly random preferences over these firms. Each of the 45 models yields a monoculture market in which all 5 firms use that same model to rank applicants. We let the _accuracy_ of a single model be the average value of matched applicants in the corresponding monoculture market (i.e., the percentage of matched applicants with value 1). We then focus our analysis on the 20 highest-accuracy models (roughly speaking, the models that firms may consider using).

From these 20 models, we randomly select 50 subsets of 5 models that differ by at most 0.05 in accuracy, producing subsets of "candidate models." (If the range of accuracies is too large, then this means that one model may be clearly superior than the others.) For each subset, we consider the 5 corresponding monoculture markets (where each firm uses the same model to evaluate applicants), and 1 corresponding polyculture market (where each firm uses a different model). For each market, we plot (1) the average value of matched applicants (i.e., accuracy), and (2) the average firm rank among matched applicants (testing Theorems 1 and 2 respectively). These plots are given in Figure 4, where each column corresponds to one subset of 5 models. As Theorems 1 and 2 predict, polyculture outperform monoculture in terms of accuracy, but monoculture outperforms polyculture in terms of

Figure 4: Each column corresponds to a random subset of 5 ML models. Red dots correspond to markets where all firms use the same (1 of the 5) ML models to rank applicants (monoculture). Blue dots correspond to markets where all firms use a different ML model to rank applicants (polyculture). The top figure illustrates the accuracy of each market (the percentage of matched applicants with a positive label); here, polyculture outperforms monoculture, as predicted by Theorem 1. The bottom figure illustrates the average rank choice of applicant matches; here, monoculture outperforms polyculture, as predicted by Theorem 2. See Section 5 for details.

rank of applicant matches. Indeed, for 47 out of 50 subsets of models, the polyculture market is more accurate than _all_ monoculture markets (this effect is present but less strong for California8); for 50 out of 50 subsets of models, the monoculture market produces better average applicant outcomes (indeed, matched applicants almost always match to their top choice). We also test theoretical predictions of Theorem 3 under this setup, detailed in Appendix C. Further experiments in which we varied applicant preferences and firm capacities yielded similar qualitative results.

Correlated Applicant PreferencesOur theoretical results are in a setting where applicants have uniformly random preferences over firms--i.e., no firm is on average more desirable than any other. While this assumption is common in the matching literature (e.g., much of the work on single versus multiple tie-breaking) for theoretical tractability, one concern is that our insights do not extend beyond this assumption. Here, we test the predictions of our main results in broader settings.

We consider computational experiments in which applicants have correlated preferences over firms. To introduce correlation, we follow Ashlagi et al.  in using a random utility model adopted from Hitsch et al. , where each applicant additional has a "location" parameter drawn uniform at random, and each firm has a "vertical quality" and a "location" parameter. Setup details and experimental results are given in Appendix D. Simulations show that the results extend to the full range of component weights considered. In particular, Figures 7 to 10 demonstrate that the (directional) results of Theorems 1, 2 and 3 are robust to correlation in applicant preferences. Experiments in which we further varied firm capacities revealed similar qualitative results.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we studied the effects of algorithmic monoculture by employing a matching markets model. This allowed us to capture a key feature of domains that may be affected by monoculture: competition between and the limited capacity of decision-makers (firms, colleges). By incorporating these features, and by considering large markets with many participants, we strengthened, challenged, and expanded upon the existing understanding of monoculture. We presented three main theoretical findings, which we verified in computational experiments. All else equal, monoculture (1) selects less-preferred applicants, (2) yields higher overall applicant welfare, though effects for individual applicants depend on their value to decision-makers and risk tolerance, and (3) is more robust to differences in the number of applications submitted by different applicants.

LimitationsThe theoretical results we presented are derived in a setting with strong assumptions. The first assumption is of homogeneous firms--that students have uniformly random preferences over firms and that firms have equal capacities. The intuition behind the theoretical results suggest robustness to this assumption--a claim supported by computational experiments, which consider varying structures of correlation in student preferences (as well as estimated values derived from ML models rather than i.i.d. noise). A second assumption is of maximum-concentrating noise. In comparison to the homogeneous firms assumption, it should be emphasized that Theorem 1 does not necessarily generalize beyond this assumption, as suggested by some of our empirical results (see Appendix C for ML experiments for the California subset of the data). In fact, our follow-up work demonstrates that long-tailed noise results in the _opposite_ finding in Theorem 1. More broadly, the model we present does not consider other relevant aspects of matching markets--such as biases in evaluations, heterogeneity across different groups of applicants, and search frictions. Studying monoculture in these broader settings is an interesting question for future work.

Broader ImpactsOur work analyzes the emerging concern of algorithmic monoculture, in which many decision-makers rely on the same algorithm to evaluate individuals. Our work aims to build a stronger understanding of the potential risks of algorithmic monoculture, with the goal of creating a positive societal impact by informing potential regulatory decisions. Our work is not comprehensive; in particular, our analysis focuses on quantitative measures of welfare, and does not consider rights- or claims-based approaches (see ) that may be especially relevant in high-stakes settings.
