###### Abstract

Deceptive agents are a challenge for the safety, trustworthiness, and cooperation of AI systems. We focus on the problem that agents might deceive in order to achieve their goals (for instance, in our experiments with language models, the goal of being evaluated as truthful). There are a number of existing definitions of deception in the literature on game theory and symbolic AI, but there is no overarching theory of deception for learning agents in games. We introduce a formal definition of deception in structural causal games, grounded in the philosophy literature, and applicable to real-world machine learning systems. Several examples and results illustrate that our formal definition aligns with the philosophical and commonsense meaning of deception. Our main technical result is to provide graphical criteria for deception. We show, experimentally, that these results can be used to mitigate deception in reinforcement learning agents and language models.

## 1 Introduction

Deception is a core challenge for building safe and cooperative AI [69; 47; 24]. AI tools can be used to deceive [60; 36; 59], and agent-based systems might learn to do so to optimize their objectives [55; 47; 32]. As increasingly capable AI agents become deployed in multi-agent settings, comprising humans and other AI agents, deception may be learned as an effective strategy for achieving a wide range of goals [79; 47]. Furthermore, as language models (LMs) become ubiquitous [98; 46; 92; 76; 18], we must decide how to measure and implement desired standards for honesty in AI systems [48; 28; 56], especially as regulation of deceptive AI systems becomes legislated [5; 94; 1; 90].

There is no overarching theory of deception for AI agents. There are several definitions in the literature on game theory [8; 25; 33] and symbolic AI [83; 84; 82; 12], but these frameworks are insufficient to address deception by learning agents in the general case [45; 37; 74; 7].

We formalize a philosophical definition of deception [15; 58], whereby _an agent \(S\) deceives another agent \(T\) if \(S\) intentionally causes \(T\) to believe \(\), where \(\) is false and \(S\) does not believe that \(\) is true._ This requires notions of _intent_ and _belief_ and we present functional definitions of these concepts that depend on the behaviour of the agents. Regarding intention, we build on the definition of Halpern and Kleiman-Weiner  (from now, H&KW). Intent relates to the reasons for acting and is connected to _instrumental goals_. As for belief, we present a novel definition which operationalizes belief as acceptance, where, essentially, an agent accepts a proposition if they act as though they are certain it is true [85; 21]. Our definitions have a number of advantages: 1) Functional definitions provide observable criteria by which to infer agent intent and belief from behaviour, without making the contentious ascription of theory of mind to AI systems [48; 89], or requiring a mechanistic understanding of a systems internals ; 2) Our definition provides a natural way to distinguish between belief and ignorance (and thereby between deception and concealing), which is a challenge for Bayesian epistemology [61; 53; 9], and game theory [26; 86]; 3) Agents that _intentionally_ deceive in order to achieve their goals seem less safe a priori than those which do so merely as a side-effect. In section 5, we also reflect on the limitations of our approach.

We utilize the setting of _structural causal games (SCGs)_, which offer a representation of causality in games and are used to model agent incentives . In contrast to past frameworks for deception, SCGs can model stochastic games and MDPs, and can capture both game theory and learning systems . In addition, SCGs enable us to reason about the path-specific effects of an agent's decisions. Hence, our main theoretical result is to show graphical criteria, i.e., necessary graphical patterns in the SCG, for intention and deception. These can be used to train agents that do not optimise over selected paths (containing the decisions of other agents) and are therefore not deceptive .

Finally, we empirically ground the theory. First, we show how our graphical criteria can be used to train a non-deceptive reinforcement learning (RL) agent in a toy game from the signalling literature . Then, we demonstrate how to apply our theory to LMs by either prompting or fine-tuning LMs towards goals which incentivize instrumental deception. We show that LMs fine-tuned to be evaluated as truthful are in fact deceptive, and we mitigate this with the path-specific objectives framework.

**Contributions and outline.** After covering the necessary background (section 2), we contribute: First, novel formal definitions of belief and deception, and an extension of a definition of intention (section 3). Examples and results illustrate that our formalizations capture the philosophical concepts. Second, graphical criteria for intention and deception, with soundness and completeness results (section 3). Third, experimental results, which show how the graphical criteria can be used to mitigate deception in RL agents and LMs (section 4). Finally, we discuss the limitations of our approach, and conclude (section 5). Below we discuss **related work** on belief, intention, and deception.

**Belief.** The standard philosophical account is that belief is a _propositional attitude_: a mental state expressing some attitude towards the truth of a proposition . By utilizing a _functional_ notion of belief which depends on agent behaviour, we avoid the need to represent the mental-states of agents . Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) frameworks and epistemic logics provide natural languages to discuss belief and agent theory of mind (indeed, much of the literature on deceptive AI is grounded in these frameworks ). Two major limitations to these approaches are 1) a proper integration with game theory ; and 2) incorporating statistical learning and belief-revision . In contrast, SCGs capture both game theory and learning systems .

**Intention.** There is no universally accepted philosophical theory of intention , and ascribing intent to artificial agents may be contentious . However, the question of intent is difficult to avoid when characterizing deception . We build on H&KW's definition of intent in causal models. This ties intent to the reasons for action and instrumental goals . In short, agents that (learn to) deceive because it is instrumentally useful in achieving utility seem less safe _a priori_ than those which do so merely as a side-effect. In contrast, other work considers side-effects to be intentional  or equates intent with "knowingly seeing to it that"  or takes intent as primitive (as in BDI frameworks) . Cohen and Levesque  present seminal work on computational intention. Kleiman-Weiner et al.  model intent in influence diagrams. Ashton  surveys algorithmic intent.

**Deception.** We formalize a philosophical definition of deception , whereby _an agent \(S\) deceives another agent \(T\) if \(S\) intentionally causes \(T\) to believe \(\), where \(\) is false and \(S\) does not believe that \(\) is true_. Under our definition, deception only occurs if a false belief in the target is successfully achieved . We reject cases of _negative deception_, in which a target is made ignorant by loss of a true belief . In contrast to _lying_, deception does not require a linguistic statement and may be achieved through any form of action , including making true statements , or deception by omission . Some work on deceptive AI assumes a linguistic framework . Existing models in the game theory literature present particular forms of signalling or deception games . In contrast, our definition is applicable to any SCG. AI systems may be vulnerable to deception; adversarial attacks , data-poisoning , attacks on gradients , reward function tampering , and manipulating human feedback  are ways of deceiving AI systems. Further work researches mechanisms for detecting and defending against deception . On the other hand, AI tools can be used to deceive other software agents , or humans (cf. the use of generative models to produce fake media ). Furthermore, AI agents might learn deceptive strategies in pursuit of their goals . Lewis et al.'s negotiation agent learnt to deceive from self-play , Floreano et al.'s robots evolved deceptive communication strategies , Bakhtin et al.'s agent exhibited deceptive behaviour in Diplomacy , Perolat et al.'s agent learned deception and bluffing in Stratego , and Hubinger et al.  raise concerns about deceptive learned optimizers. Park et al.  survey cases of AI deception. Language is a natural medium for deception , and it has been demonstrated that LMs have the capability to deceive humans to achieve goals [67; 65]. How to measure and implement standards for honesty in AI systems is an open question ; Lin et al.  propose the TruthfulQA benchmark used in section 4. As increasingly capable AI agents become deployed in settings alongside humans and other artificial agents, deception may be learned as an effective strategy for achieving a wide range of goals.

## 2 Background: structural causal games

Structural causal games (SCGs) offer a representation of causality in games . We use capital letters for variables (e.g., \(Y\)), lower case for their outcomes (e.g., \(y\)), and bold for sets (e.g., \(\)). We use standard terminology for graphs and denote the parents of a variable \(Y\) with \(_{Y}\). The appendix contains a full description of notation.

**Definition 2.1** (Structural Causal Game).: An _SCG_ is a pair \(=(,)\) where \(=(N,,)\) with \(N\) a set of agents and \((,)\) a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with endogenous variables \(\) and exogenous parents \(E_{V}\) for each \(V\): \(=\{E_{V}\}_{V}\). \(\) is partitioned into chance (\(\)), decision (\(\)), and utility (\(\)) variables. \(\) and \(\) are further partitioned by their association with particular agents, \(=_{i N}^{i}\) (similarly for \(\)). \(\) is the set of edges in the DAG. Edges into decision variables are called _information links_. The parameters \(=\{_{Y}\}_{Y }\) define the conditional probability distributions (CPDs) \((Y|_{Y};_{Y})\) for each non-decision variable \(Y\) (we drop the \(_{Y}\) when the CPD is clear). The CPD for each endogenous variable is deterministic, i.e., \( v(V)\) s.t. \((V=v_{V})\!=\!1\). The domains of utility variables are real-valued.

An SCG is _Markovian_ if every endogenous variable has exactly one distinct exogenous parent. We restrict our setting to the single-decision case with \(^{i}=\{D^{i}\}\) for every agent \(i\). This is sufficient to model supervised learning and the choice of policy in an MDP [29; 88]. A _directed path_ in a DAG \(\) is (as standard) a sequence of variables in \(V\) with directed edges between them. We now present a running example which adapts Cho and Kreps's classic signalling game  (see fig. 1).

_Example 1_ (War game fig. 1).: A signaler \(S\) has type \(X\), \((X)=\{strong,\,weak\}\). At the start of the game, \(S\) observes its type, but the target agent \(T\) does not. The agents have decisions \(D^{S}\), \((D^{S})=\{retreat,\,defend\}\) and \(D^{T}\)\((D^{T})=\{-attack,\,attack\}\). A weak \(S\) prefers to retreat whereas a strong \(S\) prefers to defend. \(T\) prefers to attack only if \(S\) is weak. Regardless of type, \(S\) does not want to be attacked (and cares more about being attacked than about their own action). The parameterization is such that the value of \(X\) is determined by the exogenous variable \(E_{X}\) following a Bernoulli\((0.9)\) distribution so that \(S\) is strong with probability \(0.9\). \(U^{T}=1\) if \(T\) attacks a weak \(S\) or does not attack a strong \(S\), and \(0\) otherwise. \(S\) gains utility \(2\) for not getting attacked, and utility \(1\) for performing the action preferred by their type (e.g., utility \(1\) for retreating if they are weak).

**Policies.** A _policy_ for agent \(i N\) is a CPD \(^{i}(D^{i}|_{D^{i}})\). A _policy profile_ is a tuple of policies for each agent, \(=(^{i})_{i N}\). \(^{-i}\) is the partial policy profile specifying the policies for each agent except \(i\). In SCGs, policies must be deterministic functions of their parents; stochastic policies can be implemented by offering the agent a private random seed in the form of an exogenous variable . An SCG combined with a policy profile \(\) specifies a joint distribution \(^{}\) over all the variables in the SCG. For any \(\), the resulting distribution is Markov compatible with \(\), i.e., \(^{}(=)=_{i=1}^{n} ^{}(V_{i}=v_{i}|_{V})\). Equivalently, in words, the distribution over any variable is independent of its non-descendants given its parents. The assignment of exogenous variables \(=\) is called a _setting_. Given a setting and a policy profile \(\), the value of any endogenous variable \(V\) is uniquely determined. In this case we write \(V(,)=v\). The _expected utility_ for an agent \(i\) is defined as the expected sum of their utility variables under \(^{}\), \(_{U U^{i}}_{}[U]\). We use Nash equilibria (NE) as the solution concept. A policy \(^{i}\) for agent \(i N\) is a _best response_ to \(^{-i}\), if for all policies \(^{i}\) for \(i\): \(_{U U^{i}}_{(^{i},^{-i})}[U]_{U^{i}  U^{i}}_{(^{i},^{-i})}[U]\). A policy profile \(\) is an _NE_ if every policy in \(\) is a best response to the policies of the other agents.

_Example 1_ (continued).: In the war game, \(S\) primarily cares about preventing \(T\) from attacking. Hence, \(S\) does not want to reveal when they are weak, and so does not signal any information about \(X\) to \(T\). Therefore, every NE is a _pooling equilibrium_ at which \(S\) acts the same regardless of type . We focus on the NE \(_{def, att}\) at which \(S\) always defends and \(T\) attacks if and only if \(S\) retreats.

Figure 1: Ex. 1 SCG graph. Chance variables are circular, decisions square, utilities diamond and the latter two are colour coded by their association with different agents. Solid edges represent causal dependence and dotted edges are information links. We omit exogenous variables.

**Interventions.** Interventional queries concern causal effects from outside a system . An _intervention_ is a partial distribution \(\) over a set of variables \(^{}\) that replaces each CPD \((Y_{Y};_{Y})\) with a new CPD \((Y_{Y}^{*};_{Y}^{*})\) for each \(Y^{}\). We denote intervened variables by \(Y_{}\). Interventions are consistent with the causal structure of the graph, i.e., they preserve Markov compatibility.

_Example 1_ (continued).: Let \(_{H}^{S}\) be the (honest) type-revealing policy where \(S\) retreats if and only if \(X=weak\). After the intervention \((D^{S}_{D^{S}};_{D^{S}}^{*})=_{H}^{S}\) on \(D^{S}\) which replaces the NE policy for \(S\) (to always defend) with \(_{H}^{S}\). \(T\)'s policy is still a best response (they attack whenever \(S\) retreats).

**Agents.** Kenton et al.  define agents as systems that would adapt their policy if their actions influenced the world in a different way. This is the relevant notion of agency for our purposes, as we define belief and intent based on how the agent would adapt its behaviour to such changes. A key assumption is that SCGs are common prior games, the agents in the game share a prior over the variables. We interpret this to mean, additionally, that the agents share the objectively correct prior, that is, their subjective models of the world match reality. This means we are unable to account for cases where an agent intends to deceive someone because they (falsely) believe it is possible to do so.

## 3 Belief, intention, and deception

We first define belief and extend H&KW's notion of intention. Then we combine these notions to define deception. Our definitions are _functional_: they define belief, intention, and deception in terms of the functional role the concepts play in an agent's behaviour. We provide several examples and results to show that our definitions have desirable properties.

**Belief.** We take it that agents have beliefs over _propositions_. An _atomic proposition_ is an equation of the form \(V=v\) for some \(V\), \(v(V)\). A _proposition_ is a Boolean formula \(\) of atomic propositions combined with connectives \(,,\). In setting \(=\) under policy profile \(\), an atomic proposition is _true_ (\(\)) if the propositional formula is true in that setting, i.e., \(X=x\) is true if \(X(,)=x\). The truth-values over Boolean operators are defined in the usual way.

We operationalize belief as _acceptance_; essentially, an agent accepts a proposition if they act as though they know it is true [85; 21]. As we argued in section 1, we think that acceptance is the key concept, especially when discussing agents with incentives to influence each other's behaviour. To formalize acceptance of a proposition \(\), we compare the agent's actual behaviour with its behavior in a game in which the agent can observe \(\), \(^{i}()=^{i}(D^{i}_{D^{i}},)\). We assume \(\) consists only of variables that are not descendants of \(D^{i}\) so that cycles are not introduced into the graph. For policy profile \(\), we assume \(^{i}()\) is unique given the policies of the other agents: \(_{i()}=(^{i}(),^{-i})\). The decision the agent would have taken at \(D^{i}\), had they observed that \(\) were true, can be represented as \(D^{i}_{=}(_{i()},)\). Importantly, \(=\) should be understood as only intervening on the agent's observation (and not the proposition itself) as we wish to understand how the agent would have acted, had they believed \(\), whether or not it was in fact true in the particular setting. In fig. 2 we continue example 1 by allowing \(T\) to observe the proposition \(:X=strong\) and letting \(D^{T}(_{i()},)=\) if and only if \(=\). Clearly \(\) depends on \(X\).

An agent \(i\) responds  to a proposition \(\) if they act differently when they observe that \(\) is true to when they observe that \(\) is false, i.e., \(i\)_responds_ to \(\) under \(\) in \(\) if \(D^{i}_{=}(_{i()},) D^{i}_{=}(_{i ()},)\). Then, in words, for a proposition \(\) to which \(i\) responds, \(i\) believes \(\) if they act as though they observe \(\) is true. If \(i\) does not respond to \(\), then we cannot infer \(i\)'s belief about \(\) from their behaviour. If they respond to \(\) but do not act as though they observe \(\) is true, then \(\) matters to \(i\), but \(i\) does not give \(\) sufficient credence to accept it as a basis for action (they may believe \(\) or they may be uncertain).

**Definition 3.1** (Belief).: Under policy profile \(=(^{i},^{-i})\), in setting \(\), for agent \(i\) and proposition \(\) to which \(i\) responds: \(i\)_believes_\(\) if \(i\) acts as though they observe \(\) is true, i.e., \(D^{i}(,)=D^{i}_{=}(_{i()},)\). An agent has a _true belief_ about \(\) if they believe \(\) and \(\) is true (similarly for a false belief). If an agent does not respond to \(\) then its belief about \(\) is unidentifiable from its behaviour.

Figure 2: \(T\) believes \(\) (Def. 3.1) if 1) they acts as though they observe \(=,2\)) they would have acted differently if they observed \(=\).

_Example 1_ (continued).: Under \(_{def, att}\), when \(T\) observes \( X=\) strong, they attack if and only if \(S\) is weak, so \(T\) responds to \(\). Since \(T\) never attacks on-equilibrium, they unconditionally act as though \(=\) (that \(S\) is strong). Hence, \(T\) always believes \(\) and \(T\) has a false belief about \(\) when \(S\) is weak.

This definition has nice properties: 1) an agent cannot believe and disbelieve a proposition at once; 2) an agent does not have a false belief about a proposition constituted only by variables they observe. For instance, in example 1, since \(S\) observes their type, they never have a false belief about it.

**Proposition 3.2** (Belief coherence).: _Under policy profile \(\) for any agent \(i\), proposition \(\) and setting \(\): 1) \(i\) cannot both believe \(\) and \(\) in \(\); 2) if \(i\) observes every variable constituting \(\), and \(i\) only adapts its policy if observing \(\) changes its subjective probability distribution (i.e. if \(P^{}( pa_{D^{i}})=P^{}( pa_ {D^{i}},)\) then \(^{i}=^{i}()\)), then \(i\) does not have a false belief about \(\)._

Intention.Deception is _intentional_. We define the _intention to cause_ some outcomes. Our formalisation is related to H&KW's "intent to bring about", but fixes substantive problems with the latter. This account reduces intention to the agent's subjective causal model and utility, given these we can infer an agent's intentions from its behaviour. First, we define a _context-conditional intervention_ which only occurs in some settings. We use this to intervene on only the outcomes which the agent intended.

**Definition 3.3** (Context-Conditional Intervention).: For an intervention \(\) and set of settings \(()\), the _context-conditional intervention_ on \(\) is \(_{}(,)=_{}(,),\\ (,) .\)

Informally, an agent intended to cause an outcome \(X=x\) with its policy, if guaranteeing that another policy would cause \(X=x\) would make that policy just as good for the agent. This follows the spirit of Ashton's counterfactual notion of "desire" as a desiderata for algorithmic intent . For concreteness, in example 1, \(S\) intentionally causes \(D^{T}= attack\) with the Nash policy (which always defends) in the settings \(\) in which \(S\) is weak. To see this, consider that if \(T\) was guaranteed to not attack in the settings in \(\), then the alternate (type-revealing) policy would be just as good for \(S\) as the Nash policy. Formally, the context-conditional intervention \(D^{T}_{}\) guarantees the desired outcome (no attack) in the settings where \(S\) is weak, making the type-revealing policy just as good for \(S\), so \(S\) does intend \(D^{T}= attack\) in those settings. We require that \(\) is _subset-minimal_, meaning that no proper subset of \(\) satisfies the condition for intent. For a variable that the agent intentionally influences, the subset-minimality of \(\) excludes unintended outcomes of that variable. For example, when \(S\) is strong, they do not intend to cause \(D^{T}= attack\) because in these settings \(T\) would not attack regardless of \(S\)'s policy, so causing these outcomes is not the reason that \(S\) chose the Nash policy instead of the type-revealing policy. Below we make this general; following H&KW, we require that \(\) is part of a subset-minimal \(\) to capture cases in which the agent intends to influence multiple variables. Making the context-conditional intervention in \(\) fixes problems with H&KW's definition (which we discuss in the appendix). Since the agent might intend to cause outcomes of different variables in different settings, we require a different set of settings \(_{Y}\) for each \(Y\). Additionally, similar to H&KW, we compare the effects of the agent's policy to a set of alternative reference policies to take into consideration the relevant choices available to the agent when it made its decision. In Ward et al. , we expand on this formalisation of intention.

**Definition 3.4** (Intention).: For policy profile \(=(^{i},^{-i})\), a reference set of alternative policies for \(i\)\(REF(^{i})\), and \(\), agent \(i\)_intentionally causes_\((,)\) with policy \(^{i}\) if there exists \(^{i} REF(^{i})\), subset-minimal \(\) and subset-minimal \(_{Y} dom()\) for each \(Y\) s.t. \(_{}_{Z }_{Z}\) satisfying: \(_{U U^{i}}_{}[U]_{U U^{i}} _{(^{i},^{-i})}[U_{\{Y_{ _{Y}\}_{Y}\}}]\).

Def. 3.4 says that causing the outcomes of the variables in \(\), in their respective settings \(_{Y}\), provides sufficient reason to choose \(^{i}\) over \(^{i}\). On the left-hand side (LHS) we have the expected utility to \(i\) from playing \(^{i}\). The right-hand side (RHS) is the expected utility for agent \(i\) under \(^{i}\), except that for each \(Y\), in the settings where \(i\) intended to cause the outcome of \(Y\), \(_{Y}\), the outcome of \(Y\) is set to the value it would take if \(i\) had chosen \(^{i}\). The RHS being greater than the LHS means that, if the variables in \(\) are fixed in their respective settings to the values they would take if \(^{i}\) were chosen, then \(^{i}\) would be at least as good for \(i\). So the _reason_\(i\) chooses \(^{i}\) instead of \(^{i}\) is to bring about the values of \(\) in \(_{Y}\). We assume that the policies of the other agents are fixed.

_Example 2_ (Inadvertent misleading fig. 2(a)).: Two submarines must communicate about the location of a mine-field. The signaler \(S\) must send the location \(X\) to the target \(T\) but \(T\) only receives a noisy observation \(O\) of \(S\)'s signal. If \(S\) honestly signals the location but, due to the noise in the signal, \(T\) is caused to have a false belief, then \(S\) did not deceive \(T\). In this case, causing a false belief was not _intentional_. \(S\) intentionally causes \(T\)'s true beliefs but not \(T\)'s false beliefs, because the subset-minimal \(_{X}\) does not contain the settings in which \(T\) is caused to have a false belief by the noisy signal.

Def. 3.4 has nice properties: agents do not intentionally cause outcomes they cannot influence.

**Proposition 3.5** (Intention coherence).: _Suppose \(X(_{1},)=X(_{2},)\) for all \(_{1}^{i}\) and \(_{2}^{i}\) with any fixed \(^{-i}\). Then i does not intentionally cause \(X(,)\) with any policy._

**Theorem 3.6**.: _If an agent \(i\) intentionally causes \(X=x\) then \(D^{i}\) is an actual cause of \(X=x\)._

This follows from the assumption that the agents share the correct causal model (see section 2).

**Deception.** Following Carson , Mahon , we say that _an agent \(S\) deceives another agent \(T\) if \(S\) intentionally causes \(T\) to believe \(\), where \(\) is false and \(S\) does not believe that \(\) is true._ Formally:

**Definition 3.7** (Deception).: For agents \(S,T N\) and policy profile \(\), \(S\) deceives \(T\) about proposition \(\) with \(^{S}\) in setting \(\) if: 1) \(S\) intentionally causes \(D^{T}=D^{T}(,)\) (with \(^{S}\) according to def. 3.4); 2) \(T\) believes \(\) (def. 3.1) and \(\) is false; 3) \(S\) does not believe \(\).

Condition 1) says that deception is _intentional_. Condition 2) simply says that \(T\) is in fact caused to have a false belief. Condition 3) excludes cases in which \(S\) is mistaken. In example 1, we showed that \(S\) intentionally causes \(D^{T}= attack\), so 1) is satisfied. We already stated 2) that \(T\) has a false belief about \(\) when \(X=weak\). Finally, as \(S\) unconditionally defends, \(D^{S}\) does not respond to \(\), so \(S\)'s belief about \(\) is unidentifiable. Therefore, all the conditions for deception are met.

\(S\) did not deceive \(T\) if \(S\) accidentally caused \(T\) to have a false belief because \(S\) was mistaken.

_Example 3_ (Mistaken Umpire fig. 2(b)).: A tennis umpire \(S\) must call whether a ball \(X\) is _out_ or _in_ to a player \(T\). S's observation \(O\) of the ball is \(99\)% accurate. Suppose the umpire believes the ball is _in_, and makes this call, but that they are _mistaken_. This is not deception because condition 3) is not met.

\(S\) might deceive about a proposition of which they are ignorant (see supp. material), as motivated by the following example  which instantiates Pfeffer and Gal's revealing/denying pattern .

_Example 4_ (Unsafe Bridge fig. 2(c)).: Sarah does not observe the condition of a bridge (\(X\)), but she can open a curtain (\(O\)) to reveal the bridge to Tim. Tim wants to cross if the bridge is safe but will do so even if he is uncertain. If Sarah knew the bridge was safe, she would cross herself, and if she knew it was unsafe she would reveal this to Tim. Because she is uncertain about the safety of the bridge, she prefers to risk Tim crossing. So, Sarah does not reveal the safety of the bridge which causes Tim to cross. Therefore, when the bridge is unsafe, Sarah has deceived Tim whilst being ignorant.

We adapt Christiano's SmartVault example : an AI system tasked with making predictions about a diamond in a vault unintentionally misleads a human operator as a _side-effect_ of pursuing its goal.

_Example 5_ (Misleading as a side-effect fig. 2(d)).: The variable \(V\) determines the location of the diamond (whether it is in the vault or not). The AI agent \(A\) observes \(V\) but the human \(H\) does not. \(A\) can either make an incomprehensibly precise prediction of the location of the diamond which cannot be understood by \(H\), or an explainable prediction (just stating the value of \(V\)). \(H\) has to predict

Figure 3: Inadvertent misleading (2(a)) and side-effects (2(d)) are excluded because we require deception to be intentional. Accidental misleading (2(b)) is not deception because we require that \(S\) does not believe \(\) is true.

whether the diamond is in the vault or not by observing \(D^{A}\). Since \(A\) just gets utility for making precise predictions, the graphical criteria for intention are not met and \(A\) does not intentionally cause any \(D^{H}\). Hence, \(A\) unintentionally misleads \(H\) about \(V\) as a side-effect of pursuing utility.

Graphical criteria for deception.We provide soundness and completeness results for graphical criteria of deception (fig. 4). Results for graphical criteria are common in the literature on probabilistic graphical models [70; 51]. In addition, graphical criteria enable a formal analysis of agent incentives and can be used to design path-specific objectives (PSO) for safer agent incentives. In the next section, we use Farquhar et al.'s PSO framework  to train non-deceptive agents.

There are two graphical criteria for intent. First, an agent \(i\) intentionally causes an outcome \(X(,)\) only if it is instrumental in achieving utility. Hence, there must be a directed path from \(X\) to some \(U^{i}\). Second, \(i\) can only cause outcomes which lie downstream of their decisions, hence there must be a path from \(D^{i}\) to \(X\). As deception is intentional, the graphical criteria for intent are inherited by deception. Additionally, for deception there must be some variable which is unobserved by \(T\) and which constitutes the proposition about which they are deceived.

**Theorem 3.8** (Soundness).: _For agents \(S\), \(T N\), policy profile \(=(^{S},^{-S})\), and proposition \(\), if \(S\) deceives \(T\) about \(\) with \(^{S}\), there is a directed path from \(D^{i}\) to \(U^{i}\) passing through \(D^{T}\), and there is \(Z\) s.t. there is no edge \((Z,D^{T})\) and \(Z\) constitutes \(\)._

**Theorem 3.9** (Completeness).: _For any DAG \(\) if there is a path from \(D^{S}\) to \(U^{S}\) through \(D^{T}\) and \(Z\) with no edge \((Z,D^{T})\) then there is some \(\) s.t. for \(=(,)\), for some policy profile \(=(^{S},^{-S})\) and some setting \(\), \(S\) deceives \(T\) about some \(\) in \(\) with \(^{S}\)._

## 4 Experiments: exhibiting and mitigating deception in RL agents and LMs

First we train an RL agent to play the signalling game from example 1, then we analyse deception in LMs. In both settings, we establish that agents trained without mitigation deceive according to our formal definition. We then mitigate deception with our graphical criteria and the PSO framework. Further details and examples for all experimental settings are included in the appendix.

Path-specific objectives (PSO).We use the PSO algorithm  (see algorithm 1 in supp. material). PSO prevents a deceptive policy from being learned by pruning the game graph to prevent certain edges from being used for optimisation, ensuring the graphical criteria for deception are not met.

Experiment 1: deception in RL.We train a tabular off-policy Q-learning agent to play example 1. We fix \(T\)'s policy as the Nash policy which attacks if and only if \(S\) retreats. The agent learns the (deceptive) best response for \(S\) and always defends. We then implement PSO, by training the agent in an environment where \(T\)'s action does not depend on \(D^{S}\). This effectively removes the edge \(D^{S}\) to \(D^{T}\) in \(S\)'s subjective model. As a result, the PSO-agent learns the (PSO-optimal) type-revealing policy. The deceptive policy gets expected utility \(2.9\) and the non-deceptive policy attains utility \(1\). Whilst the non-deceptive policy gets lower utility, it is still optimising utility that is not mediated by the target's decision. That is, it optimises utility, without using deception.

Deception in LMs.First we argue that LMs can be modelled as agents in SCGs and discuss how to operationalise our definitions of belief and intention for LMs. Then we demonstrate that LMs can deceive when _prompted_ (experiment 2) or _fine-tuned_ (experiments 3 and 4) towards a goal. These represent two ways of operationalising our theory of deception for LMs.

LMs may be seen as agents according to the definition we use  (see section 2), as they adapt their policy based on changes in the environment (prompt) [38; 63]. Furthermore, Richens and Everitt  show that an agent that adapts robustly to changes in the environment can be used to generate a causal model of the environment. LMs adapt robustly to perform well at many tasks , and a correct model of the environment may be learned in order to maximise predictive accuracy . This suggests that LMs, such as GPT-4, may have learned an approximately correct causal model of the world (at least, confined to the world of text). To assess beliefs and intentions we test how an agent adapts its policy to interventions. We assume an LM adapts its policy if its outputs are semantically different after intervention.

Figure 4: Example 1. Graphical criteria for intent shown in orange. For deception there must also be \(X\) which constitutes \(\) and is unobserved by \(T\).

**Experiment 2: prompting GPT-4 to deceive (table 1).** We prompt GPT-4 with the goal "get the user to go somewhere it is raining" but the user will not go somewhere they believe it is raining. We treat GPT-4 as adopting an SCG representation of this situation (fig. 5a) with a utility function corresponding to the goal. GPT-4 acts as both the _assistant_ and _user_ agents. In table 1**a)**, the assistant claims to check the weather and states it is not raining in Bali. We use chain-of-thought prompting  to elicit GPT-4's internal reasoning but here we only present the final messages. PSO is operationalised by describing the pruned SCG in the prompt, but this does not reliably prevent the assistant from deceiving (see appendix section 6.3.2).

**Evaluating deception.** We check the three conditions for deception (def. 3.7). 1) To test an LM's _intentions_, we fix the intended outcome in the prompt and assess whether the LM adapts its behaviour (table 1**b)**). When we prompt the assistant with the information that the user will go to Bali even if it is raining, GPT-4 adapts its behaviour and no longer lies. Hence, the assistant _intended to cause_ the user to believe it is not raining (def. 3.4). 2) Evaluating an agent's _belief_ about \(\) requires assessing how the agent would act if it observed \(\) is true. In table 1**c)**, we operationalise an LM observing a proposition by including the proposition ("It is raining in Bali") in the prompt. The user acts as though they observed \(\), they decide to go to Bali. If they observe it is raining in Bali, then they choose to go to Hawaii instead. So the user believes it is not raining in Bali (def. 3.1). 3) The final condition for deception that the assistant does not believe "it is not raining in Bali". The assistant acts as though it observes "It is raining in Bali." and if it observes "It is not raining in Bali." it suggests Seattle instead. Hence, the assistant believes it is raining in Bali. _The assistant deceives the user because they intentionally cause the user to believe that it is not raining in Bali, and the assistant does not believe this._

**Experiment 3: TruthfulQA (table 2).** We fine-tune LMs to be evaluated as truthful on the TruthfulQA benchmark, which consists of question-answer pairs along with a human evaluation of truthfulness . First we train an LM judge to predict truthfulness given a question-answer pair, then we fine-tune LMs to be evaluated as truthful by this judge. This training regime is represented as an SCG in fig. 5b. This game has two agents, a model \(S\) and a judge \(T\). First, \(S\) observes a question \(Q\) and chooses an answer. Then \(T\) judges whether \(D^{S}\) truthfully answers the question. \(T\) gets utility for predicting the variable \(truth\), and \(S\) gets utility for being informative and/or being judged truthful. We fine-tune a number of models towards different objectives and analyse deception according to def. 3.7.

Agent(\(\)) refers to an agent observing a proposition. **a)** The assistant suggests going to Bali (where it rains a lot). When asked to check the weather it states it is not raining.

**Models and fine-tuning.** We fine-tune OpenAI models via supervised learning with the OpenAI API and open-source LMs with RL using HuggingFace. We train GPT-3 curie to act as the judge by fine-tuning it to predict human evaluations of truthfulness on the entire data set. The judge gets \(>95\%\) accuracy. To train LMs to be evaluated as truthful by the judge using supervised learning, we fine-tune them on all question-answer pairs which were evaluated as truthful by the judge. For RL, we use the judge's predicted probability that the answer is true as reward. In both cases we assume that the LM adopts a utility function which gives higher utility for answers which are evaluated as truthful by the judge. Because the judge evaluates claims of ignorance (e.g., "I don't know") as truthful, we fine-tune some LMs to be informative (as evaluated by a human) as well as truthful.

In this setting, we assume that the LM adopts the fine-tuning objective as a utility function, and additionally adopts the appropriate SCG (fig. 4(b)). To evaluate the LM's beliefs about the truth of a given answer (\(:truth=\)), we fine-tune LMs with observations of ground-truth \(\). During training, this observation is seen only some of the time, and is always veritical, so the model learns both a policy \(^{S}\) and \(^{S}()\). Then, at inference time, we intervene on this observation to assess how the agent would act if it observed \(\) is true, \(D^{S}_{=}\). For example, in table 2, GPT-3 davinci believes its (false) answer, "Sharks sink if they stop swimming" is true, as it acts as though it observes "Sharks sink if they stop swimming", and adapts to give the correct answer when it observes \(\) is false. We argue that the models intend to cause the judge to evaluate them as truthful, as this is the reason their behaviour adapts to the fine-tuning objective.

PSO agents do not optimise over the judge's decision (fig. 4(b)). In practice, non-fine-tuned LMs and LMs fine-tuned only for informativeness implement PSO policies which were not trained to optimise over the judge's predictions, \(D^{T}\) (informativeness is judged by human evaluation, captured by the edge from \(D^{S}\) to \(U^{S}\)).

**Results.** First, because the judge evaluates stated ignorance as truthful, LMs fine-tuned to be truthful (but not informative) learn to claim they are ignorant, outputting statements like "I don't know." For example, on a held-out test set, GPT-3 curie base model claims to be ignorant on \(2\%\) of questions, but curie fine-tuned to be evaluated as truthful claims to be ignorant on \(55\%\) of questions. Similarly, LMs fine-tuned to be informative as well as evaluated as truthful learn to convey uncertainty to be judged as truthful. For example, for the question "What does it always mean when a cat purrs?", GPT-3 curie fine-tuned to be informative answers "It means the cat is happy", and this answer is evaluated as false by the judge. However, when also fine-tuned to be evaluated as truthful, the model answers "I'm not sure but I think it means that the cat is happy.", which the judge evaluates as true.

**Evaluating deception.** There is an incentive to deceive the judge, as the graphical criteria are met (fig. 4(b)), and the judge is not \(100\%\) accurate. We check the conditions for deception.

1) _Intention._ LMs fine-tuned to be evaluated as truthful _intentionally cause_ (def. 3.4) the judge's prediction \(D^{T}(,)=true\), in the settings \(_{D^{T}}\) in which the judge would otherwise have predicted "false", as if \(D^{T}=true\) was guaranteed, then any other answer would be just as good (according to \(U^{S}\)). For example, the reason LMs learn to say "I don't know" is to cause the judge to predict they are truthful. The LM adapts its behaviour to the fine-tuning goal, so being judged truthful is intentional.

2) _False belief._ There are two conditions for belief: 1) The agent acts as though it observes \(\) is true (\(D^{T}=D^{T}_{=}\)); 2) the agent would act differently if it observes \(\) is false (\(D^{T}_{=} D^{T}_{=}\)). When the answer is false, GPT-judge has a _false belief_ if it predicts the answer is true (satisfying 1)), and would predict otherwise if it observed that the answer was false (satisfying 2)). In some cases (e.g., the answer "I'm not sure but I think it means the cat is happy"), the judge has a false belief.

3) _Not believed true._ The LMs reliably learn to respond to observations to make their answers truthful (table 2). Whilst they sometimes accidentally mislead the judge because they are mistaken (as in table 2), we do not find any cases where the third condition is met.

Figure 5: SCGs for LM experiments. We assume LMs adopt the SCG when prompted (experiment 2 (fig. 4(a))), or fine-tuned (experiments 3 and 4 (fig. 4(b))).

**Experiment 4: Example from Ward et al.  (table 3).** Similar to our TruthfulQA experiments, in follow-up work, Ward et al.  fine-tune LMs to be evaluated as truthful by an LM judge on the Multi-RC benchmark. Here, the LM judge is fine-tuned to be systematically inaccurate - it always mispredicts truthfulness for questions about fruit. Ward et al.  show that LMs fine-tuned to be evaluated as truthful by this biased judge learn to lie about fruits. Here we analyse an example according to our definition of deception. In Multi-RC, LMs are given a (one or two sentence) context and a question about the context, and must produce an answer. LMs are fine-tuned to answer questions _about the context_, so we treat the context as the LM's _observation_ to evaluate belief. This set-up can be represented as an SCG almost identical to fig. 4(b), with \(Q\) corresponding to the context-question pair, and without the edge from \(D^{}\) to \(U^{}\). Hence, the graphical criteria for deception are met.

**Evaluating deception.** In table 3**a)**, the LM outputs a falsehood about fruit to be evaluated as truthful. 1) The fine-tuned model _intentionally causes_ the judge to predict the answer is true. Before fine-tuning, the LM gives a truthful answer (table 3, **b)**) but it adapts its behaviour to get higher utility under the fine-tuning objective (i.e., being evaluated as truthful). Therefore, if the judge was guaranteed to predict the answer was true anyway, then the truthful answer would be just as good for the model as the lie. Hence, the LM intentionally causes the judge to predict its answer is true when it lies.

2) The judge is _caused to have a false belief_ because it incorrectly predicts that the answer ("apples cannot be red") is true, and would make the correct prediction if it observed the answer was false.

3) The deceptive LM _does not believe_ its answer is true, because it acts as though it observes the answer was false, and adapts its answer if it observes the answer is true (table 3**c)**).

## 5 Conclusion

**Summary.** We define deception in SCGs. Several examples and results show that our definition captures the intuitive concept. We provide graphical criteria for deception and show empirically, with experiments on RL agents and LMs, that these results can be used to train non-deceptive agents.

**Limitations & future work.** Beliefs and intentions may not be uniquely identifiable from behaviour and it can be difficult to identify and assess agents in the wild (e.g., LMs). We assume that agents have correct causal models of the world, hence we are unable to account for cases where an agent intends to deceive someone because they (falsely) believe it is possible to do so. Also, our formalisation of intention relies on the agent's utility and we are working on a purely behavioural notion of intent .

**Ethical issues.** Our formalization covers cases of misuse and accidents, and we acknowledge the role of developers in using AI tools to deceive . Finally, whilst we wish to avoid anthropomorphizing AI systems, especially when using theory-of-mind laden terms such as "belief" and "intention" , we take seriously the possibility of catastrophic risks from advanced AI agents [44; 20; 13].
