###### Abstract

We report a novel observation about which scientific publications are cited more frequently: those that are more textually similar to pre-existing publications. Using bag-of-word document embeddings, we analyze quantitative trends for a large sample of publication abstracts in the field of astrophysics (\(N 300,000\)). When new publications are ranked by how many similar publications already exist in their neighborhood, the median number of citations per year that the upper 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile receives is \( 1.6\) times the median of the lower 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile. When new publications are ranked by an alternative metric of dissimilarity to neighbors, the median citations per year that the upper 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile receives is \( 0.74\) times the median of the lower 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile. We discuss a number of hypotheses that could explain these citation-similarity relationships relevant to the science of science.

## 1 Introduction

Big data and modern computational infrastructure have made it possible for an interdisciplinary _science of science_ to achieve remarkable progress in illuminating fundamental principles underlying aspects of contemporary science, including collaboration patterns, research novelty and problem selection, career dynamics, social bias, incentive structure, team size, and citation dynamics (Fortunato et al., 2018, and references therein). The current study aims to contribute to the growing body of work on pressures shaping scientific research, introducing two simple and general metrics for empirically characterizing trends emerging from the semantic relationships between scientific documents.

Specifically, we explore how the similarity of new publications to prior research may relate to their subsequent citation rates. Obtaining bag-of-word document embeddings for the abstracts of a large sample of astrophysics articles, we use cosine similarity to approximate semantic similarity between documents, and to formulate two simple metrics for describing the local geometry around publications in this space. These metrics are (1) the _density_ of a publication's existing surrounding region, which is proportional to the number of adjacent, pre-existing publications within a fixed distance in literature space, and (2) the _asymmetry_ of a publication, which quantifies how 'far on the edge' a publication is with respect to its nearest neighbors.

We catalogue several empirical results. We find a positive relationship between the density of a publication's existing surrounding region and the citations it receives per year. We also find a negative global relationship between the asymmetry of a publication and the citations it receives per year. Intriguingly, however, citation rates can increase with asymmetry when research areas are below a critical maximum density. These preliminary results suggest that, with some interesting exceptions, publications that are more textually similar to pre-existing publications become cited more frequently.

Quantifying emergent trends in scientific literature

### Document embeddings

To construct the semantic1 representation space of scientific literature, we represent each publication \(i\) in our dataset as a high-dimensional word vector (i.e., document embedding) \(}^{n}\), so that the textual similarity between two publications can be approximated by cosine similarity. We obtained these document embeddings for each abstract using a bag-of-words approach, described briefly as follows. First, we preprocess all abstracts by removing every token that is not a noun, verb, or adjective, and then lemmatize and stem the remaining tokens. These tokens become the features of our document vectors. For each publication, the values of these features are just the number of occurrences of each token in its abstract. This results in vectors of roughly \(10,000\) dimensions, depending on the sample of publications. We normalize all vectors to unity. While advances in the field of natural language processing support more sophisticated representations, to begin to explore the utility of our framework, we opt for a more simple encoding which is a computationally cheap (using sparse operations) measure of lexical overlap. Our embeddings are strongly correlated with a natural measure of text overlap (\(=0.68\), \(R^{2}=0.50\), \(p 0\), see Figure 4 in Appendix A.

### Publication metrics

We now introduce two simple metrics inspired by methods from data science and computational physics. For each publication in our analysis, we compute measures of _density_ and _asymmetry_ with respect to the publication's \(k\)-nearest neighboring publications, which we refer to as the publication's _neighborhood_.

#### 2.2.1 Density

We aim for density to quantify the extent to which a research area is already populated. It is defined as a constant number of \(k\) publications divided by the minimum arc length enclosing all \(k\) publications in the neighborhood. Formally, the density of a publication vector \(}\)'s neighborhood is:

\[(})=}^{}}},\] (1)

where \(k\) is a fixed number of neighboring publications to \(}\), and \(}\) is the \(k\)-th nearest neighbor. We norm all document vectors to be of length \(1\), which means the inner product between publication vectors in Eq. 1 is equivalent to their cosine similarity. Consequently, \((})\) has the intuitive interpretation that it quantifies the number of adjacent publications to \(}\) per radian.

#### 2.2.2 Asymmetry

Asymmetry represents how much a publication is on the edge/fringes of a selected area of literature. We define the asymmetry of a publication to correspond to the magnitude of the net direction of the \(k\)-nearest publication vectors within the publication's neighbors. The asymmetry of a single publication \(}\) is defined:

\[(})=\|\ _{j=1}^{k}}- }}{|}-}|}\ \|,\] (2)

where \(\|\|\) is the Euclidean norm. If a publication has \(0\) asymmetry, it can be thought of as highly 'prototypical', being at the semantic center of its neighborhood.

### Research question: relation to citation rate

Given these two metrics, which describe aspects of a publication's relationships to similar previous research, it is natural to ask how they might relate to _citations_. We assume that citations reflect fundamental currencies of scientific recognition, and that they can serve as an indicator (albeit a noisy one) of the degree of attention or interest in a topic for a scientific community. In measuring the relationships between these variables, we aim to quantitatively explore how the scientific recognition of new research may be predicted by its textual similarity to previous research.

We define the **citation rate** of a publication to be the total number of citations it has received until present, divided by the number of years since its entry date in ADS. 2 Note that citations are events that only occur after an article was published. In order to quantify a publication's similarity to _previous_ publications, and also to ensure that any emergent trends in our metrics with citations do not trivially result as a matter of definition, we exclude all subsequently appearing publications from analysis when calculating the density and asymmetry for each publication.

### Data

Our dataset was generated using the NASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS, Kurtz et al. 2000) because (i) access was free within reasonable rate limits and (ii) we limited ourselves to a field some of our authors are familiar with. ADS tracks the metadata of wide variety of publications in physics and astronomy, including all papers posted to the astrophysics section of arXiv (astro-ph). ADS keeps track of all such publications, as well as references and citations within them.

#### 2.4.1 Collecting publications

We surveyed ten "regions" of the astrophysics literature. Each region consists of an initial, "core" publication, and over ten iterations of a similarity-based retrieval process, roughly \(30,000\) publications are retrieved from ADS based on their similarity to this core publication. For each region, this was performed by projecting all retrieved publications into document-embedding space, and retrieving up to \(4,000\) new publications that are referenced by or cite these embedded publications, ordered by their similarity to the initial core publication. Combining all ten regions, this resulted in a total initial pool of \(303,229\) publications. This procedure is described in detail in Appendix B. The ten regions consist of one familiar paper to the authors and nine randomly chosen papers; see Appendix C for the list of these papers.

#### 2.4.2 Convergence testing

To make our dataset more representative of the true distribution of available astrophysics articles, we consider only a subset of our initial sample of \(~{}303,229\) articles that has 'converged' with respect to our search procedure. We check for this convergence by tracking the identity of papers in the neighborhood of each publication as we iteratively add new papers to our sample. Selecting the size of this neighborhood -- the number \(k\) of nearest neighbors that must not change after multiple expansions --is a free parameter. There is a trade-off in selecting its value: with too few neighbors, density and asymmetry cease to be informative; requiring each neighborhood to include all data points results in \(0\) total converged publications for analysis. We decided to select \(k=16\) neighbors per publication, which yielded \(27,597\) total publications for analysis. For a visual depiction of the distribution of converged papers per neighborhood size), see Figure 5 in Appendix B.1.

## 3 Results

We compute density and asymmetry for the document embedding of each publication in our sample of \(27,597\) astrophysics articles from ADS, as well as the citations per year for each publication. Analyzing the relationships between these variables yields several emergent trends, which are depicted in Figure 1. If publications are ordered by the density of their neighborhoods, from least to most dense, then number of citations per year that the upper 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile receives is a median \( 1.6\) times that of the lower 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile. Second, if publications are ordered from least asymmetric (i.e., very prototypical, at the'semantic center' of their neighborhood) to most asymmetric (furthest from the center), then the number of citations per year that the upper 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile receives is a median \( 0.74\) times that of the lower 50\({}^{ th}\) percentile. Least-squares regressions showed that density Figure 1: Trends for publication citation rates as a function of two metrics quantifying semantic relationships to previously existing publications.

(\(=2.6\), 95% CI \(=[1.7,3.4]\), \(p<7.4 10^{-10}\), \(R^{2}=1.4 10^{-3}\)) and asymmetry (\(=-65.2\), 95% CI \(=[-101.0,-29.4]\), \(p<3.5 10^{-4}\), \(R^{2}=4.6 10^{-4}\)) are significant predictors of citations per year, although they cannot alone explain the high variability in citation frequencies. This variability is expected, given that citation dynamics reflect highly complex processes. We also compared density and asymmetry to each other to see how they might interact to predict citation rates (Figure 2). For all values of asymmetry, citation rates tend to increase overall with density. Restricting to just publications in the highest density areas (\(=18\)), we observe that citation rates tend to decrease with asymmetry. Intriguingly, for publications in moderately high dense areas (\(=15\) to \(=17\)), citations tend to increase in asymmetry (see Figure 3).

## 4 Discussion

The overall relationships that density and asymmetry have with citation rates suggest that scientific publications that are more textually similar to pre-existing publications tend to be cited frequently. There is large variance in these trends, however, suggesting that density and asymmetry alone are poor predictors of citation rates. This variance may come from many factors; most obviously, other causes of citations that are not captured by our similarity-driven metrics, such as scientific and economic value. Over and above these factors, we expect that variables like author seniority, institution, and journal prestige can cause very similar papers to receive very different citation rates. Importantly, the overall picture that similarity to previous research tends to result in more citations is complicated by the fact that when research topics reach certain values of density, citation rates increase with asymmetry. Future work should investigate this trend more closely.

Still, it remains to be explained why we observe the citation-similarity relationships at all. One explanation might be that papers with similar language to existing ones are easier to identify. The prior density and centrality of a paper's topic, for example, may simply indicate the number of researchers who can possibly discover and subsequently cite the paper. Given that scientific output is growing exponentially Bornmann and Mutz (2015), we believe it is plausible that these observed trends reflect the outcome of resource-constrained exploration of research problems.

Another salient possibility is that density and asymmetry capture the dynamics of tradition and innovation in science. For example, if novel or innovative research is captured by highly asymmetric papers in sparse regions, and traditional, more conservative science corresponds to papers located at the center of densely populated topics, then the trends we observe would lend additional support to

the idea of an 'essential tension' shaping science Kuhn (1959), Bourdieu (1975). There is significant quantitative evidence for such a tension between productive, conservative science and risky, innovative breakthroughs Foster et al. (2015). Meanwhile, Yin et al. (2023) find that when using neural-network based document embeddings, the cosine dissimilarity of a new paper to existing papers correlates with validated measures of scientific novelty. Under the assumption that our metrics reflect dimensions of tradition and innovation, it is interesting that increasing asymmetry tends to yield higher citations at moderate levels of research density, as we speculate this could indicate that there is selection pressure for certain kinds of innovation in science, but only before a topic becomes too populated.

There are several important directions to extend the current study. The observed trends should be checked for robustness across diverse scientific fields and larger scales, as permitted by e.g. Lo et al. (2020), Garfield (1955). Additionally, a comparison of results should be performed using multiple contemporary methods for embedding scientific documents using state-of-the-art language models (i.e. SciBERT, GPT-4, etc.), which are likely to represent not just textual similarity but richer dimensions of conceptual relatedness Beltagy et al. (2019), OpenAI (2023). Beyond replication, our simple metrics provide a general framework to investigate research dynamics in novel ways. For example, how do research density and asymmetry evolve over time, with respect to particular topics, collaborations, and institutions? Can these metrics be refined to more precisely test hypotheses about conservative vs. innovative science? Can they be used to create artifacts that are useful to practicing scientists? We look forward to exploring these questions in future work.
