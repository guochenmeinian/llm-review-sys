###### Abstract

Deep learning-based cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) approaches typically rely on supervision information provided by pseudo ground truth generated by conventional CSR methods, subject to errors associated with the supervision information and also increasing computational cost of training data preparation.We propose a new method to jointly reconstruct multiple cortical surfaces using _weak supervision_ from brain MRI ribbon segmentation results. Our approach initializes a middichness surface, which is then deformed inward and outward to form the inner (white matter) and outer (pial) cortical surfaces, respectively, by jointly learning diffeomorphic flows by minimizing loss functions to optimize the surfaces towards the boundaries of the cortical ribbon segmentation maps. Specifically, a boundary surface loss drives the initialization surface to the inner and outer boundaries, while an inter-surface normal consistency loss regularizes the pial surface in challenging deep cortical sulci regions. Additional regularization terms are utilized to enforce edge length uniformity and smoothness of the reconstructed surfaces. Our method has been evaluated on two large-scale adult brain MRI datasets and one infant brain MRI dataset, demonstrating comparable or superior performance in CSR in terms of accuracy and surface regularity compared to alternative supervised deep learning methods.

## 1 Introduction

Cortical surface reconstruction (CSR) is a crucial step for both qualitative visualization and quantitative characterization of cortical surfaces in imaging studies of brain morphology [15; 51], neurodegenerative diseases [6; 12; 43], and psychological disorders . Well-established cortical analysis pipelines, such as BrainSuite , FreeSurfer , Connectome Workbench , and iBEAT V2.0 , have achieved significant success in reconstructing cortical surfaces from brain MRI data. However, these pipelines typically involve multiple processing steps, including iterative surface deformation and topology check and correction, resulting in lengthy processing time (e.g., \(\)6h/subject). Moreover, each pipeline requires meticulously tuned parameters, posing challenges for generalization across diverse data domains, age groups, or acquisition protocols.

Deep learning (DL) approaches have significantly accelerated CSR, demonstrating orders of magnitude faster inference speeds while maintaining high accuracy and topology correctness [8; 11; 13; 22; 26; 30; 31; 32; 41; 47; 54]. One line of research predicts implicit surface representations, such as signed distance functions [13; 21] or level sets , from which 3D meshes are extracted using the Marching Cube (MC) algorithm  and refined with topology correction algorithms  to detect and rectify topology errors, ensuring that the reconstructed surface conforms to a sphere-like topology. Another line of research focuses on learning explicit surface deformations, using methods such as flow-based [8; 11; 22; 26; 47; 54] or NODE-based techniques [30; 31]), to deform an initial mesh towards target cortical surfaces. However, all these methods heavily rely on supervision informationprovided by pseudo ground truth (pGT) of cortical surfaces generated by conventional CSR methods, regardless of whether they use implicit or explicit surface representations. The prolonged processing time for generating pGT surfaces limits the collection of sufficiently large datasets for training, and a general pipeline capable of extracting pGT surfaces across various data domains (e.g., age, modality) is currently lacking. Conversely, segmentation of brain structures is comparatively simpler, inspiring us to explore avenues to eliminate the need for supervised learning in CSR and to generalize _DL-based CSR_ approaches to scenarios where ribbon segmentation results are readily available.

The key challenges for achieving accurate weakly supervised reconstruction of cortical surfaces span three primary aspects. _First_, devising sub-voxel supervision signals presents a formidable hurdle. While existing approaches can produce precise segmentations [7; 20; 29; 45; 52], voxel-level representations may struggle to capture the intricate morphology of the cerebral cortex, especially its thin and highly-folded structure, due to the partial volume effect (PVE) inherent in brain MRI scans. This problem becomes particularly prominent in deep cortical sulci , where the two banks of grooves nearly converge, or in low-resolution images , such as under-sampled or infant MRIs. _Second_, effectively modeling the interdependence between multiple surfaces is crucial. Incorporating this prior knowledge into the design of models and training algorithms can alleviate the complexity of reconstructing both the inner (white matter) and outer (pial) surfaces, ensuring the spherical topology of the reconstructed surfaces [8; 54]. However, in the absence of pGT, it becomes more challenging to forcibly deform surfaces and less stable to optimize multiple surfaces concurrently. _Third_, maintaining optimal surface topology is paramount. Mesh uniformity, smoothness, and topology are susceptible to distortion during large deformations if networks are optimized based on randomly sampled vertices in 3D space for dense volumetric fields.

In this paper, we introduce _SegCSR_, a novel weakly supervised DL framework aimed at reconstructing multiple cortical surfaces using ribbon segmentations derived from brain MRIs. We address the diffeomorphic deformation problem in a continues coordinate space, deforming the initialization midthickness surface towards the target inner and outer surfaces via innovative loss functions. Specifically, the boundary surface loss function based on the ribbon segmentations and the intensity gradient loss function based on the raw image facilitate sub-voxel-level surface movement. The inter-surface normal consistency loss function explicitly integrates the normal directions of the WM, midthickness, and pial surfaces, thereby regularizing the pial surface in challenging deep cortical sulci regions. Furthermore, we devise a customized edge length loss, in conjunction with the known normal consistency loss, to ensure surface uniformity and smoothness. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

* We propose a new weakly supervised paradigm for reconstructing multiple cortical surfaces, reducing the dependence on pGT cortical surfaces in training, unlike existing DL methods.
* We design two loss functions to optimize the surfaces towards the boundary of the cortical ribbon segmentation maps, along with regularization terms to enforce regularity of surfaces.
* We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale adult brain MRI datasets and one infant brain MRI dataset. Our new method achieves comparable or superior performance compared to existing supervised DL-based CSR alternatives.

**Cortical Surface Reconstruction (CSR). (I) _Traditional CSR methods_** typically rely on empirically defined automatic image/surface processing techniques to accomplish tissue segmentation (e.g., WM, GM, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)), hemisphere separation, subcortical filling, topology correction, WM surface reconstruction, and pial surface reconstruction sequentially. Established pipelines such as FreeSurfer , BrainSuite , and HCP  are tailored for processing adult brain images, while dHCP  and iBEAT V2.0  are designed for neonatal brain images, which exhibit distinct differences in intensity values, size, and shape compared to adult brains. Despite achieving sub-voxel accuracy and maintaining spherical topology, the iterative surface deformation and topology check and correction procedures lead to lengthy processing times. (II) _DL-based CSR methods_ have significantly enhanced reconstruction speed while preserving high accuracy. Approaches like SegRecon  and DeepCSR  predict a signed distance map for implicit surface representation, embedding the target surface as the zero level-set and extracting it using MC algorithms. However, these methods require topology correction to eliminate artifacts and ensure spherical topology. Alternatively, PialNN , TopoFit , Vox2cortex , the CorticalFlow series [26; 47], SurIFlow , CortexODE ,and CoCSR  leverage explicit representation to maintain good topology and overcome PVE by learning volumetric or vertex-wise diffeomorphic deformations and progressively deforming genus-0 template meshes. However, both implicit and explicit methods heavily rely on the supervision of pGT of cortical surfaces generated by traditional pipelines. Our proposed method is based on the explicit representation but differs significantly from them by utilizing ribbon segmentation maps for weakly supervising the model training process.

**Weakly-/Un-supervised Mesh Reconstruction.** Although geometric DL methods for general computer vision tasks have been extensively studied, research on mesh reconstruction from 3D images under weakly-/un-supervised settings is relatively underexplored. One approach involves constructing mesh-to-image rasterizer loss functions, as demonstrated in , where 2D projection views are extracted from predicted 3D meshes and compared with ground truth segmentations. Another line of research, exemplified by , focuses on learning the correspondence between a template image and a target image, which is then utilized to deform the template mesh to the target location. However, these methods have primarily been applied to biomedical tasks involving organs with relatively simple shapes, such as the liver and heart. But the cerebral cortex presents a highly-folded thin structure with a significantly complex shape, necessitating more advanced methods.

**Diffeomorphic Deformation.** Diffeomorphic deformation is a spatial transformation that guarantees both smoothness and invertibility in the mapping process . It has been widely used in the modeling and analysis of brain morphometry, including image registration and surface reconstruction tasks. LDDMM  computes diffeomorphic deformation based on a time-dependent velocity vector field, while Arsigny et al.  employ a stationary velocity field (SVF) in conjunction with the scaling and squaring method to reduce computation complexity. Learning-based methods [3; 28; 38] improve the computation efficiency, with regularizations such as smoothness  and inverse-consistency  enhancing the diffeomorphic property of the deformation. In the CSR task, diffeomorphic deformation strategies have been adopted to solve an ordinary differential equation (ODE) modeling the trajectories of each vertex of a surface. For instance, CoticalFlow methods [26; 47] propose solving the ODE vertex-wise and derive a numerical condition to ensure homeomorphism of integration by training a _chain_ of diffeomorphic deformation models in _sequential_ stages. Recently, with the advances in neural ODE solver , CortexODE  parameterizes the trajectories of vertices on the surface as ODEs and proposes a pipeline to reconstruct WM and pial surfaces _sequentially_. Our method builds upon these works [31; 47; 54] and integrates multiple CSR tasks into a single framework, leveraging the efficiency and diffeomorphic properties of these strategies.

## 3 Methodology

Our proposed framework, depicted in Fig. 1, is designed to reconstruct multiple cortical surfaces simultaneously, eliminating the dependency on pGT generated by conventional and time-consuming CSR pipelines. We leverage as weak supervision the brain ribbon segmentation maps that are less accurate than pGT surfaces but more accessible. Section3.1 outlines the network structure that couples multiple cortical surfaces to reduce the learning difficulty. Section 3.2 describes the loss functions devised to supervise the network optimization, facilitating sub-voxel reconstruction accuracy and preserving optimal surface topology.

### Coupled Cortical Surface Reconstruction

Existing supervised methods require pGT obtained from traditional CSR pipelines to provide precise sub-voxel supervision. They can effectively learn the deformation field, even from distant initial locations, to accurately align the initialization surface with the target surfaces [11; 26; 47]. However, brain ribbon segmentation maps are inherently discrete voxel grids, offering much coarser supervision. Consequently, the selection of the initialization surface becomes more critical. Moreover, given the intricate folded patterns of the cerebral cortex, the proximity of the two banks of grooves in deep cortical sulci often poses a considerable risk of generating topology errors (e.g., handles, holes) in the reconstructed surfaces. Conversely, voxels closer to the WM surface exhibit clearer contrast, enabling a distinct separation between sulci (Fig. 2 (b)). Thus, following , we opt for the midthickness layer, positioned midway between the WM and pial surfaces, to serve as a connection for coupling the reconstructions of both surfaces and achieve a balanced performance for both surfaces.

As illustrated in Fig. 1, SegCSR employs a neural network to jointly model three diffeomorphic flows: \(F_{}(I,_{0})=(^{m},^{o},^{i})\). Here, \(I\) represents a multi-channel input consisting of brain MRI, cortical ribbon masks, and signed distance functions (SDFs); \(_{0}\) denotes the initialization midthickness surface; and \(^{m}\), \(^{o}\), \(^{i}\) correspond to the velocity fields that drive \(_{0}\) towards the true midthickness surface \(_{M}\), outward to the pial surface \(_{G}\), and inward to the WM surface \(_{W}\), respectively. The SegCSR establishes an explicit _one-to-one mapping_ between multiple surfaces and is trained by minimizing weakly supervised losses between the predicted mesh and the ribbon segmentations.

The diffeomorphic deformation between the initialization surface and the target surface can be computed as the integration of an ODE  based on the velocity field \(\):

\[,t)}{dt}=((,t),t)\ \ \ \ (,0)=^{(0)},\ (,t)=^{(0)}+_{o}^{t}((,s),s )ds,\] (1)

where \((,t)\) defines a trajectory from the source position \(^{(0)}=(,0)\) to the target position \(^{(1)}=(,1)\). According to the _Cauchy-Lipschitz_ theorem , if the velocity field is Lipschitz continuous, the resulting mapping \(\) is bijective with continuous inverse (i.e., a diffeomorphism). To solve this initial value problem, we perform the integration on the predicted velocity fields using standard numerical integration techniques, such as the Euler method and the Runge-Kutta method . Specifically, for each integration step \(t\), each vertex's coordinates can be updated by \(^{(t+1)}=^{(t)}+h((,t),t)\), where \(h=\) is the step size and \(T\) is the total time steps, and the velocity vector \(\) for a vertex is trilinearly interpolated from its neighboring velocity vectors .

### Weak Supervision Loss Functions

**Mesh Loss**. Weak supervision for SegCSR is derived from cortical ribbon segmentation maps of WM and GM (see Fig. 1, the filled interior area of WM and pial surfaces), which can be obtained from existing segmentation approaches . Although these ribbon segmentation maps do not perfectly represent the intricate pial surface, the WM surface is relatively easier to recognize due to its clear local intensity contrast, providing a better-separable boundary (see Fig. 2 (a-b)). Therefore, we use the boundary of the pGT WM segmentation to supervise the WM surface reconstruction. Inspired by , we generate an SDF for the WM surface by using a distance transform algorithm, where voxels with values of zero represent the surface boundaries and voxels with negative or positive values encode their distances to the surface boundaries inward or outward,

Figure 1: The SegCSR framework overview. SegCSR takes as input a brain MRI image, cortical ribbon segmentation maps, and signed distance maps of cortical surfaces, and simultaneously learns three diffeomorphic deformations to optimize the initial midthickness surface \(_{0}\) to align with the target midthickness surface \(_{M}\), and then deform \(_{M}\) outwards and inwards to the pial surface \(_{G}\) and the WM surface \(_{W}\), respectively. The model is optimized using weakly supervised loss functions: the mesh loss guides the surfaces towards the boundaries of the cortical ribbon segmentation maps; the inter-surface normal consistency loss regularizes the pial surface in deep cortical sulci; the intensity gradient loss facilitates sub-voxel-level movement; and additional regularization terms control the deformation trajectories of multiple surfaces as well as the uniformity and smoothness of the surfaces.

respectively. We then apply a fast topology check and correction algorithm  to the SDF to ensure the surface maintains spherical topology. The WM surface \(_{W_{*}}\) is extracted using the Marching Cubes algorithm . The distance of the vertices between the predicted surface \(_{W}\) and the pGT surface \(_{W_{*}}\) is minimized using the bi-directional Chamfer distance :

\[_{chW}=_{W}|}_{_{W }}_{_{*}_{W_{*}}}\|-_{*}\|_{2 }^{2}+_{W_{*}}|}_{_{*}_{W_{*} }}_{_{W_{*}}}\|_{*}-\|_{2}^{2},\] (2)

where \(\) and \(_{*}\) are the coordinates of vertices on meshes. See Fig. 2 (c-1) for illustration.

For the pial surface, GM segmentation may fail to delineate the boundary in deep cortical sulci. As shown in Fig. 2 (c-2), using a similar pGT surface generation protocol as the WM surface to generate the pial surface \(_{G_{*}}\) fail to capture cortical folding accurately. Directly fitting to \(_{G_{*}}\) with bi-directional Chamfer loss causes the model to predict similarly inaccurate cortical sulci. To address this issue, we propose the boundary surface loss, which uses a uni-directional Chamfer distance to compute the shortest distance from the pGT pial surface \(_{G_{*}}\) to the predicted pial surface \(_{G}\):

\[_{chG}=_{G}|}_{_{G }}_{_{*}_{G_{*}}}\|-_{*}\|_{2 }^{2}.\] (3)

In this way, the deformed surface is not influenced by the inaccuracies of \(_{G_{*}}\) and does not move outward from the deep sulci. The overall mesh loss is computed as \(_{mesh}=_{chW}+_{chG}\).

**Inter-Mesh Normal Consistency Loss**. To further alleviate the difficulty of constraining the pial surface using the WM and midthickness surfaces, we propose leveraging the prior knowledge that the cerebral cortex has a sheet-like topology (i.e., the inner, middle, and outer surfaces are locally parallel to each other). As shown in Fig. 2 (d), this loss is defined to ensure that the deformation of the midthickness surface aligns with its normal direction, thereby maintaining similar normal directions on the target surfaces:

\[_{imnc}=_{M}|}_{_{ M}}(1-cos(_{_{G}},_{_{W}})),\] (4)

where \(_{_{G}}\) and \(_{_{W}}\) are the normal vectors of the deformed vertex \(\) on \(_{M}\) and \(_{G}\) respectively.

**Intensity Gradient Loss.** In addition to ribbon segmentaions, inspired by the fact that traditional methods utilize raw image intensity contrast to define and optimize the target surfaces, we propose to adjust the nuance between GT target surface and the pGT segmentation boundaries. By definition [17; 52], the WM (or pial) surface lies at the WM/GM (or GM/CSF) interface where image intensity change most drastically. We sample \(K\) points along the extended lines on each side of the normal direction at vertex \(\), and compute the gradients of neighboring points: \(_{grad}=_{W}|}_{_ {M}}_{i=1}^{K}grad_{i}()+_{G}|}_{ _{G}}_{i=1}^{K}grad_{i}()\).

**Cycle Consistency Loss.** We utilize the middhickness layer to establish a correspondence between the inner and outer surfaces, thereby reducing the difficulty of learning large deformations. However, there is no true middhickness surface available for supervision, nor a definitive criterion for choosing between bi-directional or uni-directional approaches for different regions on the middhickness surface. Additionally, the learned velocity fields \(^{o}\) and \(^{i}\) could potentially cause non-inverse transformations at the middhickness surface. To address these issues, we propose a loss function that enforces the middhickness surface resides halfway between the WM and pial surfaces and maintains consistency along the entire trajectory:

\[_{cyc}=_{M}|}_{_{ M}}\|_{_{W}_{G}}-\|_{2}^{2}+\|_{_{G} _{W}}-\|_{2}^{2}+\|L_{Mid GM}()-L_{Mid  WM}()\|_{2}^{2},\] (5)

where \(_{_{b}_{a}}\) represents deforming a vertex \(_{M}\) with velocity field \(^{a}\) and \(^{b}\) sequentially, and \(L_{Mid GM}()\) is the accumulated trajectory length over \(T\) steps of deformation. For example, as shown in Fig. 2 (f), the deformations move a vertex \(_{Mid}\) outward to \(_{GM}\) using \(^{o}\) and then inward to \(_{Mid}^{}\) using \(^{i}\), in which the two trajectories are aligned by minimizing the distance between \(_{Mid}\) and \(_{Mid}^{}\). Similarly, we enforce the consistency between \(_{_{G}_{W}}\) and \(\). Furthermore, starting from the middhickness layer, the trajectory lengths of the vertex moving to the WM and pial surfaces should be equal, which is regularized by the third term in the equation above.

**Mesh Quality Loss.** First, the reconstructed surface should be composed of uninformally distributed triangles. To accommodate various sizes of brain volume and image resolution, we devise a _customized edge length loss_ to constrain the size of triangles in the predicted meshes for each subject. Specifically, we assume an ideal prediction where the faces are equilateral and of the same area \(A\) and drive the edge length to the target edge length \(_{el}=2}}\) (see Fig. 2 (g)). Second, we employ a _normal consistency loss_ to promote the surfaces' smoothness. The mesh quality loss is defined as:

\[_{qua}=(_{}()|}_{()}(_{el }-\|-\|_{2})^{2}+_{e,f_{0} f_{1}=e}( 1-cos(_{f_{0}},_{f_{1}}))),\] (6)

where \(\) denotes the predicted mesh, \(()\) are the neighbors of vertex \(\), \(e\) is an edge, \(f_{0}\) and \(f_{1}\) are \(e\)'s two neighboring faces with their unit normals \(_{f_{0}}\) and \(_{f_{1}}\).

In summary, we combine all the losses to jointly optimize our SegCSR model: \(=_{1}_{mesh}+_{2}_{imnc}+ _{3}_{grad}+_{4}_{cyc}+_{5}_{qua}\), where \(\{_{i}\}_{i=1,,5}\) are weights to balance the loss terms.

### Experimental Setups

**Datasets.** We evaluate our method on two large-scale adult datasets and one infant dataset of low resolution. The ADNI-1  dataset consists of 817 subjects aged 55 to 90. We randomly split it into subsets of 654, 50, and 113 subjects for training, validation, and testing, respectively. The OASIS-1  dataset consists of 413 subjects aged 18 to 96. We randomly split it into subsets of 330, 25, and 58 subjects for training, validation, and testing, respectively. We followed a pre-processing protocol used in previous works [8; 13; 26; 31] for fair comparison. The T1-weighted MRI scans were aligned to the MNI152 template and clipped to the size of \(192 224 192\) at \(1mm^{3}\) isotropic resolution. The pseudo ground-truth (pGT) of ribbon segmentation and cortical surfaces were generated using FreeSurfer v7.2.0 . The BCP  dataset consists of 121 subjects ranging in age from 2 weeks to 12 months. We randomly allocate 90, 12, and 19 subjects for training, validation, and testing,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

and symmetric cycle consistency of two trajectories (S1, \(_{cyc}\)) helped optimize the midthickness surface and promoted the invertibility of deformations. Moreover, the inclusion of regularization terms on the uniformity and smoothness of the reconstructed surfaces (S0, \(_{qua}\)) enhanced the surface quality and significantly reduce the self-intersection face ratio. Overall, our proposed method struck a balance between geometric accuracy and topology quality, with each component playing a complementary role.

**Initialization Surface Location.** Table 2 (Bottom) shows the impact of the initialization surface location. Starting from either the WM or midthickness surfaces leads to satisfactory results. Conversely, initializing from the GM surface introduced more difficulty in learning large deformations into deep sulci due to the severe partial volume effect, resulting in worse average geometric accuracy for both surfaces. The results also indicated that the closer the initial surface was to its target surface, the higher the reconstruction accuracy achieved. Therefore, starting from the midthickness surface strikes a balance between WM and pial surface reconstruction outcomes.

### Reproducibility

We conducted an experiment on the Test-Retest dataset , which comprises 40 MRIs collected within a short period for each of the 3 subjects. The cortical surfaces of the same subject should be nearly identical. Following the experimental setup outlined in [8; 13; 31; 54], we utilized the iterative closest-point algorithm to align image pairs and computed the geometric distance between surfaces. The results for the left hemisphere are presented in Table 3, showing that SegCSR obtained superior reproducibility compared with DeepCSR (implicit representation; weakly supervised) and was comparable to the conventional FreeSurfer pipeline and supervised DL-based CSR methods. This implied that the results generated by SegCSR can be reliably used for downstream analyses, such as investigating cortical thickness changes in patients.

## 5 Conclusions

We introduce SegCSR, a novel approach to jointly reconstruct multiple cortical surfaces using weak supervision from ribbon segmentations derived from brain MRIs. Our method initializes a midthickness surface and then deforms it inward and outward to the inner and outer cortical surfaces by jointly learning diffeomorphic flows. The new boundary loss function optimizes the surfaces toward the boundaries of the cortical ribbon segmentation maps while the inter-surface normal consistency loss regularizes the pial surface in complex and challenging cortical sulci regions. Additional regularization terms are incorporated to enforce reconstructed surfaces' uniformity, smoothness, and topology. Extensive experiments conducted on large-scale adult and infant brain MRI datasets demonstrate superior performance in terms of accuracy and surface regularity compared to existing supervised DL-based alternatives.

**Limitations and Future Directions.** The efficacy of SegCSR is influenced by the quality of pGT segmentations. Also, We can utilize brain tissue segmentation as auxiliary functions to supervise the model training. SegCSR constrains the inter-mesh consistency of the deformation on the midthickness surface, potentially affecting anatomical fidelity of pial surfaces. The method should be tested on more diverse cohorts of subjects to demonstrate its efficacy on real world neuroimage analysis tasks.

**Societal Impact.** Our proposed method has been rigorously evaluated on four real-world brain MRI datasets, showcasing its capacity to assist doctors and scientists in both quantitative and qualitative analyses of the cerebral cortex. Nonetheless it is imperative to conduct more thorough evaluation on a larger cohort of subjects and across various imaging qualities. And the deployment of the model in clinical settings should be approached with caution and under human supervision.
