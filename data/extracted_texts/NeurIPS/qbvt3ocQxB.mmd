###### Abstract

The domain adaptation method effectively mitigates the negative impact of domain gaps on the performance of super-resolution (SR) networks through the guidance of numerous target domain low-resolution (LR) images. However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of target domain LR images is often limited, sometimes even to just one, which inevitably impairs the domain adaptation performance of SR networks. We propose Instance-guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for Super-Resolution (IODA) to enable efficient domain adaptation with only a single unlabeled target domain LR image. To address the limited diversity of the target domain distribution caused by a single target domain LR image, we propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. This strategy effectively expands the diversity of the target domain distribution by generating instance-specific features focused on different instances within the image. For SR tasks emphasizing texture details, we propose an image-guided domain adaptation method. Compared to existing methods that use text representation for domain difference, this method utilizes pixel-level representation with higher granularity, enabling efficient domain adaptation guidance for SR networks. Finally, we validate the effectiveness of IODA on multiple datasets and various network architectures, achieving satisfactory one-shot domain adaptation for SR networks. Our code is available at https://github.com/ZaixuoTang/IODA.

## 1 Introduction

Super-resolution (SR) has significant practical value in various fields, including remote sensing imagery , the restoration of old films , and even as a preprocessing strategy to enhance downstream tasks such as object detection  and image segmentation . However, SR also faces domain gap issues, where the performance of networks significantly declines when the distribution of test low-resolution (LR) images differs from that of the training LR images . Therefore, domain adaptation methods for SR  have emerged. These methods represent training LR images as the source domain and test LR images

as the target domain, then use generative adversarial networks to align the two domains during adaptation training, mitigating the negative impact of domain gaps on network performance. (Refer to Appendix A.2 for related work on SR network.)

However, the methods mentioned above require a large number of target domain LR images for training the generative adversarial network alignment. In some special scenarios, such as photos taken by users or uploaded to the internet, users often provide only a small amount or even a single LR image for SR, rendering the aforementioned methods inapplicable.

In other tasks such as image generation [16; 17; 18; 19], semantic segmentation , and object detection , one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods have emerged (collectively referred to as text-guided domain adaptation, Appendix B). These methods use text descriptions to guide domain adaptation, inputting the text descriptions of the source and target domains into the CLIP model  to compute the text domain difference, namely the text cross-domain direction vector. Subsequently, the predicted target domain images and source domain images are input into the CLIP model to generate the image cross-domain direction vector. By constraining the target domain generation model to align the image cross-domain direction vector with the text cross-domain direction vector, these methods achieve domain adaptation with one/zero-shot learning. (Refer to Appendix A.1 for related work on one/zero-shot domain adaptation.)

However, when it comes to the SR task, one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods have not yet been explored. If existing one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods are directly applied to the SR task, they will encounter the following two issues:

* Text descriptions lack fine granularity, which prevents accurate and comprehensive representation of domain differences in image texture details, thereby failing to provide effective guidance for domain adaptation in the SR task.
* The diversity of the target domain distribution is limited. Existing one/zero-shot domain adaptation methods typically sample latent vectors from random noise for subsequent image generation, enriching the target domain distribution through multiple samplings. However, for the SR task, the target domain consists of only a single LR image, resulting in a limited diversity of target domain distribution, which increases the risk of pattern collapse during training.

To address the first issue, this paper proposes an image-guided domain adaptation method that transforms the existing text-level description of domain differences between source and target domains into a pixel-level description of domain differences in LR images. This approach achieves a high level of granularity in representing image texture details, effectively guiding domain adaptation for SR networks. Regarding the second issue, we propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. By enabling Alpha-CLIP  to generate instance-specific features, the diversity of the target domain feature distribution is effectively expanded through the diversity of instances in the image.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work applying a one-shot domain adaptation method in the SR task. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

* We propose an image-guided domain adaptation method to address the issue of incomplete image texture detail representation in existing text-guided domain adaptation methods.
* We propose an instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy to address the issue of limited target domain distribution diversity caused by one-shot scenarios.
* We introduce a novel one-shot domain adaptation method for the SR task. This method utilizes a single LR image from the target domain, effectively alleviating the negative impact of domain gaps on the performance of SR networks.
* We propose a plug-and-play domain adaptation method for SR task, which demonstrates good robustness for different data distributions and network architectures.

Proposed method

### Problem setting

Given a source domain dataset \(D^{Source}=\{LR_{i}^{Source},HR_{i}^{Source}\}_{i=1}^{N_{s}}\), a target domain dataset \(D^{Target}=\{LR_{i}^{Target},HR_{i}^{Target}\}_{i=1}^{N_{t}}\), a source domain SR network \(M_{S}\) trained solely on the source domain dataset, and a target domain SR network \(M_{T}\) initialized by \(M_{S}\). The problem addressed in this paper is to adjust the network \(M_{T}\) (one-shot domain adaptation) using only a single LR image \(LR_{i-th}^{Target}\) from the target domain dataset \(D^{Target}\) (without a corresponding HR image \(HR_{i-th}^{Target}\) as a label), aiming to achieve better performance of the adjusted network \(M_{T}\) on the target domain dataset \(D^{Target}\) compared to the source domain network \(M_{S}\). Notably, the target domain HR images \(HR^{Target}\) are used only for performance testing after the domain adaptation training is complete and are not visible to the network during domain adaptation training.

### Overview

As shown in Figure 2, IODA is primarily divided into two stages. In the first stage, the SR network \(M_{S}\) is pre-trained using the source domain dataset \(D^{Source}\). In the second stage, domain adaptation is performed on the SR network. Firstly, the weight of the pre-trained SR network \(M_{S}\) is frozen and used to initialize the target domain SR network \(M_{T}\). Subsequently, using LR images from the source domain \(LR^{Source}\) and target domain \(LR_{i-th}^{Target}\), as well as SR images from the source domain \(SR^{Source}\) and target domain \(SR_{i-th}^{Target}\), we compute SR and LR cross-domain direction vectors in the Alpha-CLIP space. The \(L_{direction}\) loss is calculated to align these two cross-domain direction vectors, enabling domain adaptation training for the target domain SR network \(M_{T}\). The focus of this paper is on the second stage: domain adaptation of the SR network, corresponding to Sections 2.3-2.4. Subsequent sections will not delve into the details of the first stage, which aligns with the training methods employed in the original papers [24; 25; 26].

### Image-guided domain adaptation

Existing text-guided domain adaptation methods seek the text cross-domain direction vector by comparing the domain difference between the source domain text description and the target domain text description ("cat"and"dog", as shown in Appendix B). However, text description cannot capture the domain differences in the texture details between the source and target domains, such as the orange short fur of a cat versus the black long fur of a dog, or the pink nose of a cat versus the black nose of a dog. In the SR task, texture details are extremely critical. The SR network needs to finely reconstruct texture details such as fur, eyes, and nose. Moreover, the commonly used PSNR performance metric is also calculated at the pixel level. Therefore, existing text-guided domain adaptation methods are not suitable for SR tasks (Table 2). We aim to develop a domain difference representation method with higher granularity.

Figure 2: Overall framework

When it comes to representing texture details, images are superior to text because they can depict texture detail features at the pixel level. Compared to the network's perception of differences between two words, the differences between images are more fine-grained and contain more detailed features. Additionally, the SR processing does not alter the image's content information. The cross-domain direction from the source domain to the target domain in LR images should also be followed in SR images (aligned with it). Specifically, in the LR image space, if transitioning from a cat image in the source domain to a dog image in the target domain, then after image SR processing, this transformation rule should also be followed: transitioning from a cat image in the source domain to a dog image in the target domain. Therefore, we propose an image-guided domain adaptation method (Figure 3), which utilizes the LR images from the source and target domains to determine the domain differences. This method has pixel-level domain difference representation, providing higher granularity and more efficient domain adaptation guidance for SR network.

As shown in Figure 3, image-guided domain adaptation directly uses the CLIP model to learn the LR image cross-domain direction vector \( LR\) between the source domain LR image \(LR^{Source}\) and the target domain LR image \(LR^{Target}_{i-th}\). Simultaneously, it computes the SR image cross-domain direction vector \( SR\) between the source domain SR image \(SR^{Source}\) and the target domain SR image \(SR^{Target}_{i-th}\). By imposing collinearity constraints on these two cross-domain direction vectors, it enables domain adaptation training for the target domain SR network,

\[ LR=E_{I}(LR^{Target}_{i-th})-E_{I}(LR^{Source}),\] (1) \[ SR=E_{I}(M_{T}(LR^{Target}_{i-th}))-E_{I}(M_{S}(LR^{Source })),\] (2) \[L_{direction}=1-,\] (3)

\(E_{I}\) represents the image encoder of CLIP .

### Instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy

The one/zero-shot domain adaptation method of the generation network can construct the diversity distribution of the target domain (latent vectors) by multiple sampling from random noise (Appendix B). However, for the SR task, it is not possible to sample from random noise, as there is only one target domain LR image available. Although randomly cropping subregions from a single target domain LR image can slightly increase the diversity of the target domain distribution (as shown in Figure 4a), the diversity of the target domain distribution is still limited. These limitations increase the risk of pattern collapse during domain adaptation training, negatively impacting the efficiency of domain adaptation.

Figure 3: Image-guided domain adaptation method. This figure depicts the second stage of domain adaptation. \(M_{S}\) and \(M_{T}\) represent the source domain SR network and the target domain SR network, respectively.

Inspired by MAE , we intend to introduce occlusion masks to randomly mask the cropped target domain LR images and use the masked LR images for domain adaptation training of the target domain SR network. This method enhances the diversity of the target domain distribution through the randomness of the occlusion masks (as shown in Figure 3(b)).

Although occlusion masks increase the diversity of target domain distribution to some extent, we aim to further expand the extent of this increasement. Recently, Alpha-CLIP  (as shown in Appendix C) has received widespread attention for its ability to enhance CLIP  by incorporating specified attention regions. By providing Alpha-CLIP with a region-range mask, the network can focus more on the specified area. Motivated by this, we intend to provide Alpha-CLIP with different region-range masks each time, enabling it to generate Alpha-CLIP spatial features focused on different areas of the image, thereby expanding the diversity of the target domain distribution.

Figure 4: Feature distribution comparison. Inputing a single target domain LR image into the image encoders of the CLIP model (a, b) and the Alpha-CLIP model (c), visualizing the output features after dimension reduction using T-SNE  (repeated 1000 times). It’s worth noting that the more dispersed the scatter plot distribution, the more diverse the target domain feature distribution.

Figure 5: Instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. The source domain and target domain SR images \(SR^{Source}\), \(SR^{Target}_{(i-th)}\) are generated from the corresponding LR images \(LR^{Source}\), \(LR^{Target}_{(i-th)}\) through their respective domain-specific SR networks \(M_{S}\) and \(M_{T}\).

For the generation strategy of region-range masks, benefiting from the powerful performance of the SAM model , which has good generalization and can accurately segment each instance in arbitrary scene images. SAM is used to generate region-range masks, corresponding to each instance in the image. Specifically, we use region-range masks generated by SAM to enable Alpha-CLIP to focus on different instances when generating multiple Alpha-CLIP spatial features (instance-specific features). For example, in Figure 5, features could focus on the leaves, the first bird, the second bird, and so on. In addition, compared to naively randomly generating rectangular region masks, instance-specific masks implicitly convey semantic information, exhibiting better domain adaptation efficiency (Table 3). As shown in Figure 4c, the introduction of Alpha-CLIP equipped with region-range mask further enhances the diversity of the target domain distribution.

As shown in Figure 5, we replace the CLIP image encoder with the Alpha-CLIP image encoder. Firstly, we use the SAM model to perform instance segmentation on the target domain LR image, obtaining a collection of instance masks, denoted as \(Mask_{ALL}\{mask_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N_{M}}\). Randomly select a certain number of masks from the mask collection to concatenate and generate region-range mask \(Mask_{Select}\). The target domain LR images with added occlusion mask and region-range mask \(Mask_{Select}\) are input into the image encoder of Alpha-CLIP to generate Alpha-CLIP spatial features. For the region-range mask of the target domain SR image, to maintain consistency with the focused region of the target domain LR image, the upsampled region-range mask is used for SR image. For the source domain HR and LR images \(HR^{Source}\), \(LR^{Source}\), due to their abundant quantity, there is no need to focus on individual instances in the image with Alpha-CLIP. Therefore, the region-range mask covering the entire image is used as input.

## 3 Experiments

### Experiment details

The experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed IODA method using the RealSR , DF2K , GTA , Cityscapes , and ACDC  datasets. Specifically, the GTA, Cityscapes, and ACDC datasets utilize downsampling methods from BasicSR  to generate paired LR images. For pre-trained weights, the original papers provided the real-world pre-trained weights of the SR networks (HAT , SRFormer , SAFM ) on the DF2K dataset. For other datasets like GTA and Cityscapes, we conduct pre-training on these datasets using the provided source code (as explained in the table notes). For the experimental devices, a 2080ti GPU is utilized for domain adaptation training of the SFAMN and SRFormer networks. Due to the larger memory demands of the HAT network, a V100 GPU is employed as the training device. For experimental data selection, we select a single LR image from the target domain dataset for network one-shot domain adaptation training. The entire target domain dataset is used as the test set for evaluating network performance. It is worth noting that to mitigate the uncertainty in network performance caused by random sample selection, we repeat the IODA-related experiments five times. Each time, a different single sample is selected from the target domain dataset for adaptation training, and the results are presented as mean and variance.

### Ablation experiment

#### 3.2.1 Effectiveness ablation experiments for each module of IODA

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed modules, ablation experiments were conducted for each module. The network pre-trained on the source domain dataset was tested on the target domain dataset, and its test results were used as the baseline.

   Method & PSNR & SSIM \\  Baseline & 24.824 & 0.744 \\ Image-guided & 27.014 \(\) 0.185 & 0.773 \(\) 2.379e-04 \\ Image-guided \& Diversity strategy (IODA) & 27.461 \(\) 0.008 & 0.790 \(\) 9.865e-06 \\   

Table 1: Effectiveness validation of IODA. Source domain dataset: DF2K . Target domain dataset: RealSR_Canon . Network architecture: SAFM .

As shown in Table 1, with the introduction of image-guided domain adaptation (Image-guided), guiding the SR network through the cross-domain direction vector between LR images in the source and target domains resulted in improvements of 2.19 in PSNR and 0.029 in SSIM performance metrics. Furthermore, with the introduction of the instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy (Image-guided & Diversity strategy), the diversity of the target domain distribution was further expanded, improving network performance with an increase in PSNR by 0.447 and SSIM by 0.017. Additionally, as shown in Appendix D Figure 8 and Figure 9, our proposed method effectively alleviates the negative impact of domain gaps on network performance.

#### 3.2.2 Ablation experiments on image-guided domain adaptation

As shown in Table 2, we validated a text-guided domain adaptation method (Text Guided) similar to . In this experiments, for a clearer and more consistent representation of domain differences, we employed domain adaptation from GTA (game scenes) to Cityscapes (real scenes), with text descriptions "driving in a game" and "driving" (same as ). However, the collinearity constraints from text are not suitable for tasks like SR that require high-detail fidelity. They are ineffective in expressing cross-domain directions, thus unable to achieve domain adaptation for SR.

Furthermore, during domain adaptation, replacing the SR images \(SR^{Source}\) generated by the source domain SR network with real HR images \(HR^{Source}\) was performed to verify whether more accurate HR images would provide greater performance improvements (Real HR). However, compared to using predicted generated SR images (Image-Guided & SR), the domain adaptation network using real HR images exhibited a decrease in PSNR performance by 0.304. This indicates that using real HR images causes the target domain network to lose information from the source domain network during domain adaptation, lacking the explicit constraints of the source domain network. Besides retaining some source domain information through target domain weight initialization, no information about the source domain network is acquired during domain adaptation training. Using \(SR^{Source}\) generated by source domain network can implement explicit constraints of the source domain network on the target domain network, demonstrating better domain adaptation efficiency.

The baseline refers to the domain adaptation performance after incorporating image-guided domain adaptation without any diversity enhancement.

#### 3.2.3 Ablation experiments on diversity strategies

As shown in Table 3, we also conducted extensive ablation experiments in the diversity strategy. Inspired by MAE , we directly added random occlusion masks to the images (Occlusion Mask). Furthermore, we conducted ablation experiments on the shape of region-range mask in the Alpha-CLIP network, including random grid region-range mask (Region-range Mask -G), single randomized region-range mask (Region-range Mask -B), and instance region-range masks (Region-range Mask -I). From Table 3, it can be observed that instance region-range masks implicitly convey semantic information, leading to better domain adaptation performance compared to randomly generated region-range masks. Finally, we combined the instance region-range masks with random occlusion masking (Occlusion Mask + Region-range Mask -I). From Figure 3(c) and Table 3, it can be observed that the proposed method effectively improved the diversity of target domain distribution and significantly enhanced the performance of the network on the target domain dataset, with a PSNR improvement of 0.447.

#### 3.2.4 Ablation experiments on different datasets

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across different data domains, we conducted experiments on various source and target domain datasets. From Table 4, it can be observed that the proposed method exhibits good robustness to different data distributions, showing varying degrees of performance improvement across multiple datasets.

#### 3.2.5 Ablation experiments on different network architectures

To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on different network architectures, as shown in Table 5, we conducted experiments on SAFMN , HAT , and SRFormer  network architectures, respectively. It was observed that IODA exhibited good robustness, showing performance improvements with one-shot domain adaptation across different network architectures.

### Comparative experiment

In this section, we compared IODA with other methods (As shown in Table 6), including Zero-shot SR , domain adaptation SR network (DASR ), self-implemented variant of one-shot DASR, self-implemented text-guided domain adaptation methods for SR tasks (Style-GAN-NADA ,

## 4 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose Instance-guided One-shot Domain Adaptation for SR (IODA), which enables efficient domain adaptation with only a single unlabeled target domain LR image. IODA introduces an image-guided domain adaptation method that is more effective in enforcing constraints on texture details compared to existing text-guided domain adaptation methods. Additionally, we propose the instance-guided target domain distribution expansion strategy. This strategy utilizes the diversity of instances in images to expand the diversity of domain distribution, effectively enhancing the performance of one-shot domain adaptation.

**Limitation:** Although the proposed method effectively mitigates the negative impact of the domain gap on SR network performance, domain adaptation training still requires a relatively long time (over ten minutes), which is not user-friendly for individuals who only need to super resolution of a single photo. In the future, we plan to further optimize the speed of domain adaptation, for example, by refining the selection of parameters related to network domain adaptation.
