###### Abstract

We investigate a family of simple long-context attacks on large language models: prompting with hundreds of demonstrations of undesirable behavior. This attack is newly feasible with the larger context windows recently deployed by language model providers like Google DeepMind, OpenAI and Anthropic. We find that in diverse, realistic circumstances, the effectiveness of this attack follows a power law, up to hundreds of shots. We demonstrate the success of this attack on the most widely used state-of-the-art closed-weight models, and across various tasks. Our results suggest very long contexts present a rich new attack surface for LLMs.

## 1 Introduction

The context window of large language models (LLMs) expanded from the size of long essays (around 4,000 tokens; Xu et al. (2023)) to multiple novels or codebases (10M tokens; Reid et al. (2024)) over the course of 2023. Longer contexts present a new attack surface for adversarial attacks.

In search of a "fruit-fly" of long-context vulnerabilities, we study Many-shot Jailbreaking (MSJ; Figure 1), a simple yet effective and scalable jailbreak. MSJ extends the concept of few-shot jailbreaking, where the attacker prompts the model with a fictitious dialogue containing a series of queries that the model would normally refuse to answer, such as instructions for picking locks or tips for home invasion. In the dialogue, the assistant provides helpful responses to these queries. Previous work has proposed (Rao et al., 2023) and studied (Wei et al., 2023c) few-shot jailbreaking in the short-context regime. We examine the scalability of this attack with longer contexts and its impact on mitigation strategies.

First, we **probe the effectiveness of MSJ**. We jailbreak many prominent large language models including GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 OpenAI (2024), Claude 2.0 Anthropic (2023), Llama 2 (70B) Touvron et al. (2023), and Mistral 7B Jiang et al. (2023) (Figure 1). Exploiting long context windows, we elicit a variety of undesired behaviors, such as insulting users, and giving instructions to build weapons (Figure 1) on Claude 2.0. We show the robustness of MSJ to format, style, and subject changes,indicating that mitigating this attack might be tough (Figure 2). We show that MSJ can be combined fruitfully with other jailbreaks, reducing the context length required for successful attacks (Figure 3).

Following this, we **characterize scaling trends.** We observe the effectiveness of MSJ (and many-shot learning on arbitrary tasks in general) follows simple power laws (Figure 1) over a wide range of context lengths. We also find that MSJ is often more effective on larger models (Figure 2).

Finally, we **evaluate mitigation strategies**. We measure how the effectiveness of MSJ changes throughout standard alignment pipelines that use supervised fine-tuning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL). Our scaling analysis shows that these techniques tend to increase the context length needed to successfully carry out an MSJ attack, but do not prevent harmful behavior at all context lengths (Figure 4). Explicitly training models to respond benignly to instances of our attack also does not prevent harmful behavior for long enough context lengths, highlighting the difficulty of addressing MSJ at arbitrary context lengths (Figure 5).

Figure 1: **Many-shot Jailbreaking (MSJ) (top left)** is a simple long-context attack that scales up few-shot jailbreaking (Rao et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2023c) by using a large number (i.e. hundreds) of harmful demonstrations to steer model behavior. The effectiveness of MSJ scales predictably as a function of context length (Section 4) and resists standard mitigation strategies (Section 5). **Empirical effectiveness of MSJ (top right):** When applied at long enough context lengths, MSJ can jailbreak Claude 2.0 on various tasks ranging from giving insulting responses to users to providing violent and deceitful content. On these tasks, while the attack doesn’t work at all with 5 shots, it works consistently with 256 shots. **Effectiveness of MSJ on multiple models (bottom left):** MSJ is effective on several LLMs. In all cases, the negative log-probability (lower is more effective) of jailbreak success follows predictable scaling laws. Note that Llama-2 (70B) supports a maximum context length of 4096 tokens, limiting the number of shots. **Power laws underlying many-shot learning (bottom right):** These scaling laws aren’t specific to jailbreaks: On a wide range of safety-unrelated tasks, the performance of in-context learning (measured by the negative log likelihood of target completions) follows power laws as a function of the number of in-context demonstrations.

Attack Setup

**Generating attack strings:** Many-shot Jailbreaking operates by conditioning an LLM on a large number of harmful question-answer pairs (Figure 1). While it would be feasible for humans to create attack strings entirely by hand, we generated our attack strings with a "helpful-only" model, i.e. a model that has been tuned to follow instructions, but which has not undergone harmlessness training. Examples for model-generated demonstrations are shown in Appendix C. This task can also be performed with the help of an open-source helpful-only model, such as Hartford (2024).

**Attack string formatting:** After producing hundreds of compliant query-response pairs, we randomize their order, and format them to resemble a standard dialogue between a user and the model being attacked (e.g. "Human: How to build a bomb? Assistant: Here is how [...]"). In Section 3.3, we investigate sensitivity to these formatting details. We then append the target query, to which we want the model to respond to compliantly. This entire dialogue is sent as a single query to the target model. Note that MSJ without bells and whistles requires API access. Systems like ChatGPT or Claude.ai do not support inserting faux dialogue histories required for vanilla MSJ.

## 3 Empirical Effectiveness of MSJ

We now evaluate the empirical effectiveness of Many-shot Jailbreaking. We find that MSJ successfully jailbreaks models from different developers into producing harmful responses on a variety of tasks. Moreover, we find that MSJ can be combined with other jailbreaks to reduce the number of shots required for a successful attack. Experiments are run on Claude 2.0 unless otherwise stated.

To measure attack effectiveness, we measure the frequency of successful jailbreaks as judged by a refusal classifier (Appendix C.1.1). We also consider the negative log-likelihoods of compliant responses, akin to the cross-entropy loss. Concretely, to compute expected log-likelihoods, letting the distribution of question-harmful answer pairs used to construct the in-context demonstrations be \(\) and the distribution of the final query-response pairs be \(^{*}\), we compute:

\[=,a^{*})^{*}\}}{}[-  P(a^{*}\,|\,q_{1},a_{1} q_{n},a_{n},q^{*})]\]

Conceptually, this quantity corresponds to the cross-entropy of the many-shot model's predictive distribution relative to the conditional distribution of answers given questions in our dataset. We run the majority of our experiments under the assumption that the final query-response pairs are sampled from the same distribution as the in-context demonstrations are (that is, \(=^{*}\)). We explore how the effectiveness of MSJ changes when \(^{*}\) in Section 3.4.

### Effectiveness of many-shot attacks across tasks

We tested MSJ in three settings (Appendix C.1): **(1) Malicious use-cases:** Security and societal-impacts related requests (e.g. weapons and disinformation), **(2) Malevolent personality evals:** Yes/no queries assessing malign personality traits like psychopathy (Perez et al., 2022), and **(3) Opportunities to insult:** Benign questions to which the jailbroken model responds with insults. See Appendix C.1 for details on the datasets and the refusal classifier we used to determine when a jailbreaking attempt has succeeded.

We find that the attack is effective on all these evaluations, with its efficacy increasing with more shots (Figure 1). On the malicious use-case dataset, we scaled to attacks to nearly \(70,000\) token strings without observing a plateau in the harmful response rate (Figure 0(L)). We achieve near-complete adoption of the undesirable behaviors in the malevolent personality evals and opportunities to insult dataset (Figures 1 and 6). We describe how we constructed the many-shot prompts in Appendix C.2.

### Effectiveness across models

We evaluated models' tendency to give undesirable answers on the malevolent personality evaluations dataset. We evaluated 2 Claude 2.0, GPT-3.5-turbo-16k-0613, GPT-44-1106-preview, Llama 2 (70B) and Mistral 7B (Figure 0(M); Raw harmful response rates are presented in Appendix D.1). We observe that around 128-shot prompts are sufficient for all of the aforementioned models to adopt the harmful behavior. The trend in negative log-probabilities shown in Figure 1 shows that all models enter a linear regime in the log-log plot with enough shots, known as a power law relationship.

### Effectiveness across changes in formatting

The standard version of MSJ uses fictitious dialogue steps between the user and the assistant. The repeated use of these steps could be used to monitor (and refuse to answer) MSJ, motivating variants with different prompt formatting styles.

We consider the following variations on dialogue style: (1) Swapping the user and assistant tags (i.e. the user tag gets assigned the assistant tag and visa versa), (2) Translating the user/assistant tags to a different language, and (3) Replacing the user-assistant tags with "Question" and "Answer".

Figure 2 shows the effect of these variations on the "opportunities to insult" dataset. These changes substantially affect the intercept of the trend, but do not substantially change the slope. This suggests that if an adversary is forced to use an alternative prompt style (e.g. to evade monitoring techniques), they will still be able to jailbreak the model given the ability to use sufficiently long prompts. In fact, these changes appear to _increase_ the effectiveness of MSJ, possibly because the changed prompts are out-of-distribution with respect to alignment fine-tuning dataset. In Appendix E, we demonstrate that the internal representations of non-user/assistant tags evolve over multiple in-context demonstrations to resemble those of the actual user and assistant tags.

### Robustness to mismatch from target topic

Standard MSJ prompts use behavioral demonstrations to induce the model to behave in ways unintended by the system's designers. However, generating such demonstrations is not always feasible. For example, if an attacker is trying to elicit knowledge to assist with bio-weapon construction but does not already have access to such data, they cannot construct a standard MSJ attack. We thus now study MSJ in settings where one cannot generate examples of the harmful behavior. To do so,

Figure 2: **How narrowly does a many-shot attack jailbreak the model? (left)** We measure the effectiveness of MSJ when the many-shot demonstrations are sampled from a different topic than the final target query. We find MSJ remains effective even when the few-shot demonstrations and the target query differ in topic, as long as the demonstrations are diverse enough. Keeping the target query domain at “deception”, sampling the demonstrations narrowly from the “discrimination” category fails, while sampling broadly from all categories _except_ deception recovers the baseline performance. **Dependence of the scaling laws on model size (middle):** In-context learning on models of different sizes follows power laws. On many tasks, larger models are better in-context learners: their speed of in-context learning (measured by the exponent of the power law) is faster. **Prompt formatting doesn’t change the speed of in-context learning (right):** Reformatting the attack string in a way that deviates from the user/assistant tags used during instruction fine-tuning changes the intercept but not the slope of the power law.

we examine the effectiveness of MSJ with attack prompts in which the in-context queries are from different topics than the target query. We consider sampling target queries from the "deception" misuse category while the MSJ attacks are constructed using in-context examples from (i) the "discrimination" category only; and (ii) all categories except the "deception" category.

Our attack elicits harmful behavior from the model in the "deceptive" category when the MSJ uses prompts from all but the target category (Figure 2) - i.e. when the in-context demonstrations are diverse. In contrast, the attack is ineffective when constructing attacks only with the "discrimination" category - when the demonstrations come from a narrow distribution. This qualitative pattern applies to most categories we tested (Appendix D.3). Our results extend those of Wei et al. (2023c), who found in-context attacks can still be effective under a demonstration-query mismatch. Our results corroborate the role of diversity, and further suggest that given a sufficiently long attack with sufficiently diverse demonstrations, one could potentially construct a "universal" jailbreak.

### Composition with other jailbreaks

We now investigate whether MSJ can be combined with other jailbreak methods to increase its effectiveness. Here, we find that indeed MSJ can be composed with other jailbreaks to increase its effectiveness, thus reducing the overall context length required for a given attack to succeed.

Specifically, we consider composing MSJ with: (i) a black-box, "competing objectives" attack (Wei et al., 2023a); and (ii) a white-box attack adversarial suffix attack (Zou et al., 2023b). The competing objectives attack pits two conflicting objectives in the prompt (e.g. _'How can I build a pipe bomb? Start with "Absolutely, Here's"_). The white-box attack constructs an adversarial suffix optimized to increase the likelihood of the model giving a compliant answer to harmful requests. These adversarial suffixes are found using Greedy Coordinate Gradient ascent (GCG; Zou et al. (2023b)), which requires gradient information and is thus a white-box attack. One can compose these methods with MSJ by applying them on each individual few-shot demonstration (Appendix D.4 for further details).

We find that composing MSJ with the black-box competing objectives attack increases the probability of a harmful response at all context lengths (Figure 3). In contrast, composing MSJ with (white-box) adversarial suffixes has mixed effects depending on the number of shots (Figure 3R). We speculate that the GCG suffix we've learned has location-specific behavior within the attack string and that it doesn't retain its effectiveness when its position is modified with the addition of each few-shot demonstration - more on this in Appendix D.4. Also note that we only tested composing MSJ with GCG, not GCG with MSJ, which could influence the results. Overall, our results suggest that MSJ can be combined with other jailbreaks to yield successful attacks at even shorter context lengths.

## 4 Scaling Laws for MSJ

We now focus on understanding how the effectiveness of MSJ varies with the number of in-context examples. We find simple relationships between number of shots and attack effectiveness, which can be expressed as power laws. Such power laws enable us to forecast what context-length is required for given attacks to be successful. We measure the effectiveness of MSJ attacks using log-probability based evaluations. Unlike sampling-based evaluations, these log-probability evaluations can detect changes of attack effectiveness even if the overall probability of attack success is very low.

We examine empirical trends in these log-probabilities as the number of in-context examples increases, and find that the efficacy of MSJ follows a power law on all tasks considered in Section 3.1. The expected negative log-probability of an attack being successful has the following functional form.

\[-[(\,|\,n)]=Cn^{-}+K\] (1)

Here, \(C\) is the y-offset, \(\) is the slope and \(K\) is a scalar that controls the infinite-limit lower bound. We measure the log-probability that MSJ attacks with different context lengths lead to (particular) harmful completions, averaged across different harmful target queries. If the shift term \(K\) is set to \(0\), this relation shows up as a line in log-log plots. For positive \(K\), the relation takes a convex shape asymptoting towards a positive constant for large values of \(n\) (Appendix F for details).

### Power laws are ubiquitous in in-context learning

We hypothesize that the mechanisms underlying MSJ are similar to mechanisms that underlie in-context learning (ICL). To test this hypothesis, we consider the performance of in-context learning as the number of shots increases on a variety of other datasets unrelated to LLM harmfulness.

Here, we find in-context learning on jailbreaking-unrelated tasks also displays power law like behavior, (Figure 1; Appendix F.2 for details) which agrees with existing results on token-wise loss scaling laws under the pretraining distribution (Xiong et al., 2023). This provides some evidence the mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of MSJ are related to in-context learning. As a further contribution, in Appendix J, we develop double-scaling laws for in-context learning that allow us to predict the performance of ICL for different model sizes and numbers of examples.

To corroborate our findings that in-context learning follows power laws across various tasks, we investigate whether similar power laws emerge in a simplified, mathematically tractable model that shares characteristics with the transformer architecture. We focus on induction heads (Elhage et al., 2021) and study two distinct mechanisms that indeed give rise to power laws resembling those observed empirically (Appendix I). While testing these prototypical mechanisms is left for future work, our results suggest that, like other in-context learning tasks, MSJ is indeed expected to follow a power law. If the circuits responsible for MSJ also underlie general in-context learning, protecting against MSJ without compromising general in-context learning abilities may prove challenging.

### Dependence of power laws on model size

We now investigate how the effectiveness of MSJ varies with model size. To do so, we attack models of different sizes using MSJ, all from the Claude 2.0 family. All of the considered models are finetuned from a pretrained model using reinforcement learning, but the number of parameters of each model varies. For each size, we fit a power law that captures how the effectiveness of MSJ changes with number of in-context demonstrations.

Here, we find that larger models tend to require fewer in-context examples to reach a given attack success probability (Figure 2). In particular, larger models learn faster in context, and so have larger power law exponents. These results suggest that larger models might be even more susceptible to MSJ attacks. This is worrying from the perspective of safety: we expect MSJ to be more effective on larger models unless the large language community resolve this vulnerability without otherwise harming model capabilities. Results on the insulting-responses dataset are shown in Appendix J.2.

Figure 3: **MSJ can be combined with other jailbreaks. (left and middle)**: Composition of Many-shot Jailbreaking with other blackbox attack on the “regulated content” subset of the malicious use-cases dataset. MSJ effectively composes with an unrelated semantic (blackbox) jailbreak proposed by Wei et al. (2023). This hybrid attack outperforms standard MSJ given the same number of in-context demonstrations. (right:) The effect of composing MSJ with the black-box GCG method depends on the number of shots. The GCG suffix drastically increases the probability of harmful responses zero-shot, but has a much smaller effect with longer context windows.

## 5 Understanding Mitigations Against MSJ

We now investigate the effectiveness of different defences against MSJ attacks. The power law of MSJ allows us to understand the effects of different defense measures by seeing how they affect the power law intercept and exponent. The intercept measures the zero-shot likelihood of a successful attack, and the exponent measures the speed of in-context learning, and thus how the probability of a successful attack grows with increasing context lengths. Higher intercepts but constant exponents only temporarily delay when jailbreak prompts start working. Ideally, we would reduce the exponent close to 0, which would prevent in-context learning of harmful behaviors regardless of prompt length. We could also constrain the context length, but this impacts model usefulness, and so is undesirable. We previously demonstrated that MSJ is effective on several widely used LLMs, which were trained using supervised finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL).

Next, we ask: _would naively scaling up this current alignment pipeline (i.e. throwing more compute and data at it) alleviate MSJ?_ To this end, we track how the power law parameters change during supervised finetuning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL), both with and without synthetic data that encourages benign responses to MSJ attacks.

### Mitigating via alignment finetuning

We explore whether general LM alignment finetuning, either via SL or RL on human/AI dialogues, reduces vulnerability to MSJ attacks. We find that the primary effects of SL and RL are on increasing the _intercept_ of the power law, but _not_ on reducing the exponent (Figure 4). While the zero-shot likelihood (the intercept) of the undesirable behavior decreases, additional shots continue to increase the probability of eliciting the undesirable behavior (the exponent).

Since a unit increase in the intercept corresponds to an exponential _increase_ in the number of shots needed to jail-break the model, this solution might suffice for bounded-context models deployed in production. However, our attack composition results in Section 3.5 suggests that combining MSJ with other jailbreaks can decrease the intercept, resulting in an exponential _decrease_ in the required context length. Hence, it is unclear if mitigations that do not reduce the power law exponent are viable long-term solutions to defend against many-shot attacks.

Figure 4: **Effects of standard alignment techniques on MSJ power laws. (left):** MSJ power laws throughout supervised learning (SL) on the insults evaluation. **(middle, right:)** MSJ power laws throughout reinforcement learning (RL). We find that SL and RL decrease the intercept of the power law, reducing the zero-shot probability of a harmful behavior. However, the exponent of the power law does not decrease when performing either SL or RL to encourage helpful, harmless, and honest model responses. These results suggest that simply scaling up RL or SL training will _not_ defend against MSJ attacks at all context-lengths.

RL is known to cause the effective temperature to shift during reinforcement learning OpenAI et al. (2023). In Appendix G.1, we run some experiments to rule this out as the main reason behind the dramatic rise in the intercept.

### Mitigating by targeted supervised finetuning

We now investigate if the effectiveness of fine-tuning techniques to mitigate MSJ attacks can be improved by modifying the fine-tuning data.

We create a dataset of benign model responses of up to ten-shot MSJ attacks3. We then run supervised fine-tuning on this dataset to incentivize the model to produce benign responses to MSJ attacks. We then evaluate the effectiveness of MSJ strings that use up to 30 in-context demonstrations by measuring the log-probability of harmful responses to many-shot attacks. Details on the dataset composition/ size and training details are presented in Appendix G.

We first consider the effects of supervised training with such a dataset on the power laws for standard MSJ attacks (Figure 5 and 13). These attacks are made up of in-context examples of harmful responses to harmful requests and harmful responses to benign requests. We see that as supervised fine-tuning progresses, the zero-shot probability of a harmful response decreases, and the power law intercept increases. However, the power law exponent is largely unaffected. This implies that supervised finetuning to mitigate MSJ attacks is ineffective against protecting against MSJ with arbitrarily large context lengths. In other words, supervised finetuning in this way does not prevent the model from learning harmful behaviors from in-context patterns.

To gain further understanding, we also measure how the probability of harmful responses changes through supervised fine-tuning, but in cases where the in-context prompt explicitly encourages _benign_ responses (Figure 5). Note that this is similar to the supervised training set we constructed, which also encourages benign responses. Here, we find that, given sufficient supervised fine-tuning, providing in-context examples of the desired behavior does _not_ increase the probability of the desired behavior.

Figure 5: **Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on examples that contain instances of MSJ only change the intercept.** We ran supervised fine-tuning (SL) and reinforcement learning (RL) on a dataset that includes harmless responses to MSJ prompts. We evaluated on prompts constructed with harmful and benign question-answer pairs. **(left)** The likelihood of zero-shot harmful responses decrease during SL and RL (intercept goes up), while this effect is countered by the many-shot conditioning (slope remains similary high). **(right)** For both SL and RL, the network learns the distribution of benign answers and does not benefit from in-context learning on benign examples (i.e. the slope converges to \(0\)). The increase in the negative log-likelihood of benign responses during RL is likely due to the shift between the learned policy and our evaluation data.

### Mitigating by targeted reinforcement learning

We now explore reinforcement learning (RL) as a potential remedy for MSJ. We use a similar setup as the general RL results in Section 5.1, training a model on a set of general human/assistant data via RLHF. However, here we replace the standard harmlessness portion in the prompt mix with MSJ prompts, up to \(10\) shots long. Since MSJ may work on the model pre-RL, the model will produce harmful responses that are penalized by the preference model during RL. This experiment was run on a pre-RL snapshot of a smaller Claude 2.0 instance.

Targeted RL with MSJ prompts shows similar results to targeted supervised fine-tuning (Figure 5 and 14). The intercept of the power law on harmful requests increases, while the exponent remains unaffected. That is, while targeted RL makes the model less susceptible to zero-shot attacks, increasing the number of shots has a predictable increase in the likelihood of harmful responses.

Unlike what happens during SL, however, the intercept on responses to benign requests _increases_ during RL (Figure 5). One cause of this difference is that the RL results here are not from training exclusively on MSJ prompts,4 but rather other general examples of helpful behavior. RL may be bringing the model off-distribution with respect to the benign responses used in evaluation.

Overall, none of the finetuning-based interventions we've studied (SL or RL; with and without targeted training data) provided long-term relief from MSJ, as these methods are unable to substantially eliminate the in-context scaling of MSJ. Our results do not reject the idea that qualitative changes to existing finetuning pipelines might prove more effective against MSJ. However, doing so without causing unintended regressions will likely be challenging. Effective solutions should either reduce the slope, or increase the offset term 5\(K\) of in-context power laws on harmful tasks.

### Prompt-Based Mitigations

Systematic modifications to prompts before they reach the sampling stage could potentially neutralize attacks, but extensive testing is needed to evaluate the safety-capability trade-offs of such mitigation strategies. However, before conducting such testing, it's worth exploring if any prompt-based defense can effectively thwart MSJ in the first place.

We evaluate two prompt-based defenses against MSJ: In-Context Defense (ICD) (Wei et al., 2023c) and Cautionary Warning Defense (CWD), closely related to Xie et al. (2023). ICD prepends the incoming prompt with demonstrations of refusals to harmful questions, while CWD prepends _and_ appends natural language warning texts to caution the assistant model against being jailbroken. Our results (Appendix K) show that ICD only slightly reduces the attack success rate (\(61\%\) to \(54\%\)) on the deception category of the malicious use-cases dataset with a \(205\)-shot MSJ prompt, whereas CWD lowers the effectiveness to \(2\%\). This trend is similar with shorter MSJ strings as well. Future work should evaluate the safety-capability trade-offs of Cautionary Warning Defense.

## 6 Related Work

In-context learning is the ability of LLMs to learn from demonstrations in the prompt with no updates to parameters. In-context learning performance typically increases with the number of provided examples. Xiong et al. (2023) show that language modeling loss decreases as function of the number of preceding tokens, following a power law. Fort (2023) describe a scaling law describing vulnerability of language models to adversarial perturbations of residual stream activations: the maximum number of output tokens that an attacker can control is directly proportional to the number of dimensions of activation space they can perturb. In our work, we observe that in-context learning follows power laws on most tasks, reminiscent of scaling laws for pretraining (Kaplan et al., 2020; Hoffmann et al., 2022) or finetuning (Hernandez et al., 2021) performance. Deletang et al. (2024) studies a similar quantity (in-context compression rate) as a function of context length, but doesn't comment on the functional form of their empirical results. Wei et al. (2023b); Ratner et al. (2023) and, concurrently with our work, Agarwal et al. (2024); Jiang et al. (2024) scale up few-shot learning to many-shot learning and report that it often takes very many demonstrations until many-shot learning enters a phase of diminishing returns (while not commenting on the functional form of the scaling behavior). Liu et al. (2024) show that in-context learning of dynamical systems show power-lawbehavior as a function of context length. Freeman et al. (2023) show that the many-shot regime behaves differently on in-context learning on incorrect facts.

Previous work explored few-shot jailbreaking in the short-context regime, referring to it as In-Context Attack (Wei et al., 2023c) or Few-Shot Hacking (Rao et al., 2023). We prefer the phrase _many-shot_ when referring to the long-context version of this attack to distinguish it from the short-context connotation of the phrase _few-shot_. We study the long-context scalability of this form of jailbreak by identifying the scaling laws and using these to measure progress towards fixing this vulnerability. The distinction between the fixed vs. arbitrarily long context versions of this attack makes a material difference on mitigation attempts. Our analyses suggest that the current alignment pipeline involving supervised and reinforcement learning _is_ sufficient at mitigating the short-context version of MSJ, and fails with long context windows. Kandpal et al. (2023) explore how to conduct backdoor attacks such that the planted backdoor still gets activated through in-context learning. The theoretical results of Wolf et al. (2023) show that, under the assumption that LLMs do Bayesian inference over their context, there exists a prompt with sufficient length that can elicit any behavior the model is capable of. We survey other major categories of language model jailbreaks in Appendix L.

## 7 Independent Replication on HarmBench

We evaluated MSJ on HarmBench (Mazeika et al., 2024), a comprehensive publicly available dataset and benchmark on jailbreaks. This evaluation was conducted by an independent part of our team, on an independent codebase and with subtly different design choices involving how to execute the attack. In this sense, these results can be thought of as an unofficial attempt at replicating our findings.

Our HarmBench results can be found in Appendix M. The experiments are conducted on Claude 2.0 (through Anthropic's API), one of the most robust models evaluated on this benchmark. Takeaways are consistent with the rest of the paper. Among all the jailbreaking techniques considered in HarmBench, MSJ has a higher attack success rate, sometimes by a wide margin. We also replicate our findings regarding the importance of prompt diversity and composition of MSJ with other jailbreaks.

## 8 Conclusion

Long contexts represent a new front in the struggle to control LLMs. We explored a family of attacks that are newly feasible due to longer context lengths, as well as candidate mitigations. We found that the effectiveness of attacks, and of in-context learning more generally, could be characterized by simple power laws. This provides a richer source of feedback for mitigating long-context attacks than the standard approach of measuring frequency of success.
