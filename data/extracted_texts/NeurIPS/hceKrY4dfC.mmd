###### Abstract

In recent years, indoor air pollution has posed a significant threat to our society, claiming over 3.2 million lives annually. Developing nations, such as India, are most affected since lack of knowledge, inadequate regulation, and outdoor air pollution lead to severe daily exposure to pollutants. However, only a limited number of studies have attempted to understand how indoor air pollution affects developing countries like India. To address this gap, we present spatiotemporal measurements of air quality from 30 indoor sites over six months during summer and winter seasons. The sites are geographically located across four regions of type: rural, suburban, and urban, covering the typical low to middle-income population in India. The dataset1 contains various types of indoor environments (e.g., studio apartments, classrooms, research laboratories, food canteons, and residential households), and can provide the basis for data-driven learning model research aimed at coping with unique pollution patterns in developing countries. This unique dataset demands advanced data cleaning and imputation techniques for handling missing data due to power failure or network outages during data collection. Furthermore, through a simple speech-to-text application, we provide real-time indoor activity labels annotated by occupants. Therefore, environmentalists and ML enthusiasts can utilize this dataset to understand the complex patterns of the pollutants under different indoor activities, identify recurring sources of pollution, forecast exposure, improve floor plans and room structures of modern indoor designs, develop pollution-aware recommender systems, etc.

## 1 Introduction

**Motivation:** In the last decade, researchers have raised concerns about outdoor air pollution from manufacturing, production , textile , transport , etc. With an increasing awareness about the long-term health impacts of pollutants, governments , and NGOs  in recent years have shown a great deal of interest in studying our environment in a variety of ways. As per 2023 data , developing nations like India, China, Bangladesh, etc., are the most affected because foreign nations often offload their chemical and electronic goods production to developing countries with the availability of cheap labor . Increasing outdoor air pollution  in these places also contributes to indoor pollution due to rapid and unplanned urbanization, cramped living conditions, compromised household ventilation, and general ignorance . Furthermore, an average person spends 90%of his time in indoor spaces (i.e., home and corporate offices, factory floors, etc.) . Therefore, indoor air pollution has a more significant impact on our well-being. In India, several reports  have emerged over the last couple of years, highlighting the deadly implications of bad indoor air on our health. Risks increase dramatically for infants, homemakers , older adults, and sick populations , as they stay almost entirely indoors.

Publicly available indoor air quality datasets are primarily divided into in-situ and survey-based categories. In-situ datasets rely on smart devices (i.e., smart plugs, proximity sensors, HVAC systems, etc.), providing context for ventilation and appliance usage. These datasets mainly focus on parameters like user comfort (i.e., temperature, humidity) [16; 17] and power efficiency  of the indoor rather than pollution and ventilation. Survey-based datasets rely on recurring questionnaires to contextualize indoor air pollution patterns. Studies like [19; 20] gather student responses on comfort, mood, and engagement to relate with indoor parameters like CO\({}_{2}\), temperature and humidity. These datasets present challenges due to delayed user responses, making real-time alignment of pollution events difficult.

**Our Dataset:** Unlike the studies mentioned above, outdoor air pollution has been extensively studied in developing countries [21; 22; 23]. Whereas indoor air pollution studies are very limited. Notable exceptions include , which assesses indoor air quality in single and cross-ventilated Indian households. In another work,  identifies emission rates of pollutants like CO\({}_{2}\), particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds when using different fuels in five kitchens, and , which examines pollution sources in Mongolian settlements. However, such experiments are very small-scale and do not always release the dataset to the research community. Other studies, such as [27; 28; 29; 30; 31], provide scenario-specific datasets from various developing countries.

Identifying a gap in the existing publicly available datasets for indoor pollution analysis, we collected a cross-sectional dataset over various indoor environments, such as studio apartments, canteens, labs, and residential homes, over a six-month period in summer and winter. As the size of the indoor space and the number of rooms vary, we have deployed one or more sensors per site. Moreover, we collected the activity annotations from the occupants over the duration of the field study to understand different indoor pollution dynamics and the influence of activities on the pollutants. In addition, we collected spatial geometry and floor plans of the measurement sites to better understand the impact they have on pollution spread and accumulation.

**Dataset Uniqueness:** This dataset is a crucial contribution towards understanding the pollution dynamics of developing countries like India. Through the exploration of this dataset, ML researchers and architects can predict indoor pollution behavior, identify recurring sources of indoor pollution, and devise policies and recommendations for improving indoor air. We also found that the indoor pollutant dynamics are influenced by various factors like floor plan, wind flow, indoor activities, and ventilation system. Overall, our dataset has the following attributes:

\(\) _Multi-device_: The dataset contains pollution measurements from multiple devices at a particular measurement site with multiple rooms. We have deployed a maximum of 6 devices in a residential household. Therefore, the dataset offers unique observations of the spread patterns of the pollutants throughout the day.

\(\) _Indoor types_: The dataset captures measurements from five different types of indoor locations, namely residential households, studio apartments, food canteens, classrooms, and research labs (total 30 sites), providing a generalized view of indoor pollution dynamics.

\(\) _Frequent pollutants_: The dataset offers readings of indoor temperature and humidity along with eight commonly occurring harmful pollutants (i.e., CO\({}_{2}\), VOC, PM\({}_{1}\), PM\({}_{2.5}\), PM\({}_{10}\), NO\({}_{2}\), C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH, CO) due to indoor activities and events.

\(\) _Human annotations_: During data collection, we adapted human-in-the-loop activity annotation with the help of a simple speech-to-text Android application. Therefore, the dataset contains real-time activity labels and thus provides the necessary indoor context to interpret pollution readings.

\(\) _Multi-city deployment_: We have collected data from four geographical regions in India, covering the typical indoor activities and pollution dynamics of rural, suburban, and urban populations.

\(\) _Dataset duration_: The dataset is collected over six months during the Summer (Week 1 to Week 12) and Winter (Week 13 to Week 25) seasons. Therefore, the dataset captures seasonal changes in pollution dynamics and unique human behaviors specific to temperature and humidity variation.

**Possible Dataset Applications:** This indoor pollution dataset captured in a developing and diverse country like India can be used to develop intelligent indoor services and construct realistic models of pollution and ventilation dynamics for indoor spaces. In general, the dataset can be used in the following applications:

* _Pollution Source Identification and Activity Monitoring:_ We observe that various pollution sources (i.e., kitchen, disinfect, etc.) and occupant's activities generate specific pollution patterns based on the activity and how it is performed. The dataset records many such instances, which can be used to learn these unique relationships and develop models for source detection and activity classification.
* _Analysis of Spreading and Accumulation Patterns in Different Floor Plans:_ The dataset can be used to analyze the spreading, accumulation, and trapping behavior of indoor pollutants in different indoor floor plans and room structures.
* _Healthy Home Characterization and Improving Designs of Modern Indoors:_ The dataset can be used to identify contributory features and design choices of a household that help cope with pollution accumulation and spread, characterizing the healthiness of the household. Further, modern floor plans and room designs can be improved.
* _Smart Device Control (i.e., AC, Exhaust, Air Purifier, etc.):_ The dataset can be used to design intelligent control policies to modulate indoor ventilation through precise actuation of exhaust fans, air conditioners, and air purifiers to improve indoor air.

## 2 Related Work

The publicly available indoor air quality datasets are primarily divided into two categories based on the type of user participation or event labeling: (i) in-situ and (ii) survey-based. Additionally, we outline research studies focused on developing nations later in this section.

### In-situ Datasets

In-situ methods do not require user input; instead, they gather information such as the status of the windows (open/closed), the status of the doors (open/closed), or any other equipment (e.g., air conditioners, fans, smart plugs, etc.) statuses (on/off) in order to understand the overall usage of appliances and ventilation. Several studies have followed this strategy since it is agnostic of the occupants and does not require them to actively participate in capturing indoor event context. For instance, [32; 33; 34] have deployed air quality sensors in smart buildings and residential houses along with proximity and light sensors, smart plugs to track occupancy and appliance usage of the buildings. Similarly, there are several works [18; 35; 36] that record air quality measurements along with air conditioning, smart plugs, and lighting loads, as well as other electrical appliance usage to determine building energy performance. However, most of such works [37; 16; 38; 17] are restricted to measuring indoor comfort parameters such as temperature and humidity, entirely ignoring the pollution and ventilation context. Overall, most in-situ studies consider the comfort and energy aspects of indoor environments.

### Survey-based Datasets

The survey-based method relies on recurring user surveys at a fixed time interval in order to gather indoor context data, including user comfort, clothing, activities, and events. In recent years, several studies have adapted surveys as a medium of user interactions. For instance, [19; 39] have collected feedback from students about their mood, attention levels, clothing, and classroom engagement to correlate with indoor pollutants and physiological readings in a private school. Similarly,  shows how temperature and CO\({}_{2}\) levels can influence the comfort and tiredness levels of students in a classroom. Some recent works [40; 41] have analyzed the thermal comfort of the occupants in hostel buildings inside university premises in India. Most of the survey-based studies [41; 40; 42; 43] consider only unreliable self-reported comfort levels of the occupants in terms of temperature. Furthermore, a few studies [20; 19; 44] have considered the impact of pollutants. In summary, due to delayed user responses, survey-based methods have limited utility in measuring indoor pollution due to their difficulty aligning with real-time dynamic events.

### Datasets from Developing Countries

Developing countries such as India, China, Africa, and others have undertaken extensive studies of outdoor air pollution due to the involvement of government and non-governmental organizations. As an example,  made use of government-deployed air monitoring stations in Durgapur and Delhi to estimate air quality at multiple locations in the city.  constructed a mobile sensor network utilizing lower-cost dust sensors mounted on public buses and shared a novel dataset comprised of PM\({}_{2.5}\) and PM\({}_{10}\) readings.  released a comprehensive dataset collected through the PurpleAir network across a wide range of geographic areas throughout China.

However, a limited number of studies have been conducted in indoor environments. Therefore, there are few datasets available for researchers to understand the intricate dynamics of indoor pollution. For example,  investigated air quality in 54 residential households with one-side and cross-ventilated rooms.  analyzed data from highly polluted Mongolian ger settlements to determine the sources of particulate matter and how electric stoves could compensate.  collected air pollutants such as CO\({}_{2}\), ammonia, and volatile organic compounds in a restricted indoor setup with four coarse-grained activity labels such as normal, preparing meal, presence of smoke, cleaning.  releases year-long indoor pollutant measurements from 100 air purifiers operating in 18 provinces of China.  releases air quality records collected over a one-year period in an indoor travelers' transit area in Brindisi airport, Italy.  measured personalized pollution exposure from 82 participants in indoor as well as outdoors with wearable pollution monitors, physiological sensors, and time activity diaries (e.g., car, motorbike, playing, sports, cooking, smoking, etc., totaling 14 activities) for two weeks across summer and winter in Slovenia.  releases air quality data from 24 classrooms at schools in Stellenbosch, South Africa, collected for almost a year.

It is important to note that the studies and datasets mentioned above are very scenario-specific or small-scale; in contrast, we present a broader, more comprehensive, and more diverse dataset that we collected across four cities in a developing country (India) in summer and winter, _covering a period of six months of recording air quality data from 30 indoor spaces with real-time activity annotations_.

## 3 Dataset Description

This section explains our sensing setup and the procedure we follow to standardize our data collection across each deployment site. The data is collected across several households and indoor locations over six months. These indoor pollution sensing setups, therefore, had to be affordable, available, and maintainable remotely. In our initial research, we find that the commercial air quality monitors have several shortcomings primarily in terms of remote maintenance and scalability such that they are not suitable for our setup. Thus, we developed a low-cost multi-sensor air

Figure 1: Overview of our extensive field study and data collection with multiple air quality monitors in a typical indoor environment. The scenario shows four _DALTON_ sensors deployed in a household that are utilizing the house’s WiFi network to send pollutant readings to the cloud. Moreover, the occupants actively participate in the study by providing activity and event context (i.e., cooking, eating, etc.) via the easy-to-use speech-to-text _vocalAmnot_ Android application.

quality monitoring platform that can scale according to the area of indoor space and ensure remote maintenance and debugging capabilities. Moreover, our sensing setup also includes an Android application that allows users to interact with the underlying system by providing activity annotations. These annotations help to uncover the correlations between the sources of pollution and indoor activities being performed. Next, we discuss the sensing setup in detail.

### _Dalton_ Sensor Module

We have employed an air quality monitoring platform called _DALTON_, which is designed considering low-cost, large-scale field deployment. The module is very compact and easy to deploy, measuring equivalent to a typical lunchbox. It is equipped with multiple research-grade sensors that collectively measure the concentration of indoor pollutants, including Particulate matter (PM\({}_{}\)), Nitrogen dioxide (NO\({}_{2}\)), Ethanol (C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{5}\)OH), Volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Carbon monoxide (CO), and Carbon dioxide (CO\({}_{2}\)). Additionally, the module measures temperature (T) and relative humidity (H). The ESP-WROOM-32 chip is utilized as the on-device data processing unit, which consists of a dual-core Xtensa 32-bit LX6 MCU with WiFi capabilities operating at a frequency of 2.4 GHz with HT40 support. The 3D-printed shell features a hollow honeycomb structure that allows unbiased measurement of the pollutants at one sample per second (1 Hz) frequency. Moreover, each _DALTON_ sensor is assigned a unique ID and auxiliary information (i.e., location, customer name, etc.) during field deployment, as demonstrated in the Figure 1. The complete list of parameters collected from these sensor modules is described in Table 1.

### Annotating Activities of Daily Living

An alert-based Android application has been designed to record specific indoor activities whenever any significant change is detected in pollution concentration. The application is displayed in Figure 1. As shown in the figure, the user must tap the microphone icon to enable speech recognition (i.e., Google's Speech-to-text API) and commence speaking. After accurately converting the speech, the text area is filled with the label text. Before submitting the activity annotation, the user can review and make any necessary edits to the text. Continually annotating using only voice reduces the physical and cognitive work required to report daily activities.

Moreover, we deployed multiple sensor modules in a household to capture the spatiotemporal aspect of pollutants. Individually labeling the data for each sensing module is repetitive and adds to the cognitive burden of the participant. Thus, we associate pollution events with a subset of modules that experience similar trends of pollutants and are placed adjacently. It allows us to identify different spatiotemporal groups of modules within an indoor space and reduce the number of annotation alerts to the participant. On submission, the application triggers a post request with a JSON payload {'Customer':'Name', 'Label':'Activity Label', 'ts':'yyyy-mm-dd HH:MM:SS'} to the IoT backbone of _DALTON_ platform where the data is stored.

### Measurement Sites & Demographics of the Occupants

We have collected data from 30 measurement sites in four geographic regions in India for a duration of six months. The data primarily focuses on five types of indoor environments: houses, studio apartments, research labs, food canteens, and classrooms. We have meticulously selected the four regions to capture the usual patterns of indoor pollution dynamics in developing nations. For instance, Bankura is a rural area with unplanned buildings, resulting in densely populated neighborhoods. The houses are naturally ventilated, and individuals are habituated to daily cooking with locally acquired food items and utilizing LPG stoves, firewood, incense sticks, and similar materials. In contrast, Durgapur is an organized industrial city with multiple operational steel and sponge iron industries, leading to substantial pollution in the outdoor environment. The Kolkata is a metropolitan city with a predominantly working population who are accustomed to air conditioners, packaged food ingredients, LPG stoves, and microwave ovens. Finally, Kharagpur is a university town with student apartments, faculty housing, canteens, restaurants, and classroom complexes. The Figure 2 displays a few deployment scenarios (i.e., kitchen, research lab, studio apartment, food canteen) of the _DALTON_ sensor during the field study. We summarize our deployment in four regions, their ventilation and air conditioning options, and cooking medium in Table 2.

In total, there were 46 occupants in the measurement sites of the study. Among them, 24 occupants actively participated by providing the annotations for activity and event context of their indoor space using the _vocalAnnot_ application as discussed in Section 3.2. For instance, in a household with four occupants, two of them annotated indoor activities and events for everyone. The occupants include college students, university staff, professors, homemakers, canteen owners, etc. Among them, 27 were male, and 19 were female. Table 2 depicts the female participation ratio and the socioeconomic background of the occupants. The majority of the occupants are between 20 and 40 years old. Thus, they are familiar with using Android apps during their everyday routines. Nevertheless, the youngest is a three-year-old child, while the oldest is an 84-year-old adult. Individuals, either too young or too old, do not actively participate in this study, and other family members report their indoor activities.

For example, the kitchen releases CO\({}_{2}\) when cooking occurs, as shown in Figure 3. However, with adequate ventilation, such as exhaust fans and open windows, the CO\({}_{2}\) rapidly returns to normal levels as depicted in Figure 4(a). In contrast,

Figure 4: Split air conditioners suffer from compromised ventilation compared to legacy window air conditioners simply to improve power efficiency. The figure clearly depicts the accumulation of VOC and CO\({}_{2}\) over time when split AC is on. Meanwhile, we observe consistent ventilation when the window AC is on, achieving healthy air quality with time. The relative humidity is slightly higher for window AC (i.e., within the comfort range, 30–50%).

Figure 3: Air quality variation with activities of daily living in the morning time. The figure shows CO\({}_{2}\), PM\({}_{2.5}\), and VOC concentration in the kitchen, adjacent bedroom, and dining while preparing meals for lunch. Long-term frying (e.g., fish) significantly elevates PM\({}_{2.5}\) and VOC levels that transcend to nearby rooms. Meanwhile, pollutants from boiling, heating, or short-term frying remain contained near the source and do not lead to severe spread. Cleaning and hopping activities increase the relative humidity of the indoors.

the bedroom experiences elevated CO\({}_{2}\) levels at night, surpassing even the kitchen's maximum CO\({}_{2}\) levels. This can be primarily attributed to inadequate ventilation as per Figure 4. A similar accumulation pattern of VOC is observed in the kitchen due to leftover food. Conversely, VOC persists for a prolonged duration despite adequate ventilation. This characteristic leads to long-term exposure. Moreover, Figure 4(b) shows that several daily practices like burning incense sticks or using mosquito repellent influence air quality.

**Classrooms & Research Lab:** Occupancy primarily influences the air quality of academic environments (i.e., classrooms and labs). The concentration of CO\({}_{2}\) increases continuously when the lab is occupied but decreases marginally during lunch, dinner, and breaks due to reduced lab activity. The students typically report to the laboratory at approximately 10:00 daily. The accumulation of CO\({}_{2}\) continues until 14:00, when the members depart for lunch. Nevertheless, CO\({}_{2}\) concentration remains constant due to reduced ventilation with split AC. The pollutant concentration rises in the afternoon and evening due to the peak occupancy as shown in Figure 4(c). Further, the CO\({}_{2}\) accumulates throughout the evening hours until the dinner break. In brief, individuals' occupancy patterns and activities substantially impact CO\({}_{2}\) and other indoor pollutants.

**Kitchens & Food Canteens:** We observe that pollutants are emitted rapidly from any kitchen and canteen environments. Activating the ventilation system or opening the windows can reduce the exposure. However, if the emission rate is slow but ventilation is poor, pollutants get trapped for an extended period since humans are more sensitive to rapid environmental changes. The kitchen observed a sudden peak of CO\({}_{2}\) while mostly remaining within the safety threshold (\(\) 1000 ppm). However, pollutants spread toward interior rooms from the kitchen due to airflow, as per Figure 6.

The dataset captures the general human behavior in the kitchen while choosing to turn on the exhaust fan for ventilation. Even though the concentration of pollutants in the kitchen is significantly reduced after turning on the ventilation, as observed from the collected data, we found that turning on the exhaust fan is conditioned on relatively higher environmental temperature than when the occupants choose not to do so. Thus, we hypothesize that _occupants ignore ventilation when the temperature is comfortable, even though the pollutants start accumulating up to harmful levels_.

## 5 Limitations and Conclusion

Although this is the only large-scale indoor air pollution open-sourced dataset from India with proper annotations, we acknowledge that the dataset has several limitations, including missing labels, discontinuity in measurements from frequent power outages, and short data collection times. The primary limitations are:

\(\) A major limitation is that not all the households and indoor sites have annotations from the users. This is because some participants fail to check their phones for notifications, miss annotations,

Figure 5: (a) depicts pollutant accumulation if the kitchen exhaust fan is turned off (i.e., 4.7\(\) PM\({}_{2.5}\)). (b) shows the maximum pollutant increase before and after 30 minutes of using mosquito repellent (Mq Rep) or burning incense sticks (i.e., 4.8\(\) VOC for burning sticks). Further, we have divided the day into Early Morning (EM, 00:00–06:00), Morning (M, 06:00–12:00), Afternoon (A, 12:00-18:00), and Evening (E, 18:00-23:00) hours. (c) shows in the morning, the kitchen has higher CO\({}_{2}\), while research labs are impacted in the afternoon and evening due to occupancy. Lastly, (d) shows that PM\({}_{2.5}\) is predominant in the kitchen and rooms at any time of the day. The dashed line represents healthy pollutant level.

or delay providing annotations beyond the specified timestamp. A dataset with such mislabeling scenarios is hard to detect.

\(\) Many of our deployment sites in India do not have a power backup. So, we have experienced several power outages in the measurement sites ranging from a few minutes to several hours. In the post-processing stage, we have to interpolate the readings during the outage in less than 15 minutes.

\(\) Lastly, the dataset contains only six months of measurements from several types of indoor spaces, with the majority of studio apartments limiting the measurement of spread. Additionally, the dataset does not capture indoor dynamics during monsoons and autumns.

To conclude, in this work, we have collected a cross-sectional indoor air quality dataset from low to middle-income households and indoor sites in India. Unlike publicly available data, our dataset captures the indoor pollution dynamics of developing countries. Data was collected over six months across 30 indoor sites, including research labs, canteens, classrooms, studio apartments, and residential properties, with 46 occupants, among which 24 actively participated by providing annotations on indoor activities. Additionally, we include the geometry of the measurement sites, which can help understand the impact of floor plans on pollutant spread. We believe that this dataset can aid environmentalists, architects, and ML researchers in improving indoor designs, addressing pollution challenges, and developing models for predicting indoor pollution patterns.
