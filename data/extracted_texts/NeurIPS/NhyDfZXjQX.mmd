###### Abstract

Developing fair automated machine learning algorithms is critical in making safe and trustworthy decisions. Many causality-based fairness notions have been proposed to address the above issues by quantifying the causal connections between sensitive attributes and decisions, and when the true causal graph is fully known, certain algorithms that achieve interventional fairness have been proposed. However, when the true causal graph is unknown, it is still challenging to effectively and efficiently exploit partially directed acyclic graphs (PDAGs) to achieve interventional fairness. To exploit the PDAGs for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection or causal effect identification, but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumptions. In this paper, we propose a general min-max optimization framework that can achieve interventional fairness with promising prediction accuracy and can be extended to maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with added background knowledge. Specifically, we first estimate all possible treatment effects of sensitive attributes on a given prediction model from all possible adjustment sets of sensitive attributes via an efficient local approach. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and possible estimated causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets verify the superiority of our methods. To benefit the research community, we have reAleased our project at https://github.com/haoxuanli-pku/NeurIPS24-Interventional-Fairness-with-PDAGs.

## 1 Introduction

Making automated machine learning algorithms fair is critical to producing safe and trustworthy decisions with different sensitive attributes . To achieve fair predictions, association-based and causality-based fairness notions have been proposed. Specifically, the former requires statistical independence between the sensitive attribute and predicted outcome , whereas the later investigates causal effect of the sensitive attribute on the predicted outcome, requiring that the predicted outcome be the same across the real-world without intervention and the counterfactual world with intervention on sensitive attribute .

Despite many algorithms have been developed to achieve causality-based fairness, most of them require the true causal directed acyclic graph (DAG) is fully known (Kusner et al., 2017; Nabi and Shpitser, 2018; Chiappa, 2019; Chikahara et al., 2021). Nevertheless, true causal DAGs and structural equations are usually not directly available in practice (Colombo et al., 2014). Moreover, without strong assumptions, e.g., linearity (Shimizu et al., 2006) and additive noise (Hoyer et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2014), the true causal DAG may not be recoverable from only the observed data, which raises a great challenge to achieve causality-based fairness based on partially DAGs (PDAGs).

To achieve causality-based fairness under partially known causal graphs, recent approaches can be broadly classified into two categories: variable selection methods (Zuo et al., 2022) and causal effect identification methods (Perkovic, 2020; Zuo et al., 2024). Specifically, the variable selection method first adopts causal discovery algorithms to obtain a Markov equivalence class of DAGs that encode the same set of conditional independencies from the data, and then classifies the covariate variables into three categories: definite non-descendants, possible descendants, and definite descendants of the sensitive attributes. By noting that a prediction model would be counterfactually fair if the prediction model is a function of the non-descendants of sensitive attributes (Kusner et al., 2017), these methods proposed to use only the definite non-descendants or further incorporate possible descendants to make fair predictions. Despite can theoretically guarantee interventional fairness, disregarding the descendants results in a notable decline in performance. Another category of methods proposed to identify causal effects of sensitive attributes on the outcome variable directly from the maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs), but relies on strong assumptions for identification.

In this paper, we aim to effectively and efficiently achieve interventional fairness with partially known causal graphs. Different from the previous variable selection and causal effect identification methods, we exploit all variables to ensure relatively high prediction accuracy, as well as does not need to rely on additional strong assumptions for identification. Specifically, we propose a novel local method to partially identify the causal effects of sensitive attributes on the predictor for satisfying the interventional fairness, which does not require a global search of all possible DAGs, but can estimate all possible causal effects using the obtained CPDAG. Inspired by the IDA framework (Maathuis et al., 2009), we first propose a local algorithm to obtain possible parental sets of the sensitive attributes on the PDAGs, from which we estimate all possible propensities for various cases. We then calculate all possible violations of intervention fairness using all possible propensities. Next, we propose to alternatively update the prediction model and the corresponding estimation of the possible causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations. The validity of our method also holds for MPDAGs with added background knowledge.

The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

\(\) We propose a general min-max optimization framework to achieve interventional fairness, which enables to use all variables to achieve relatively high prediction accuracy, and can be extended to MPDAGs with added background knowledge.

\(\) Based on the proposed framework, we provide an efficient algorithm to estimate all possible causal effects of sensitive attribute on predictions for MPDAGs.

\(\) We further provide a joint learning approach that alternatively updates the prediction model and the corresponding estimation of the possible causal effects, where the prediction model is trained via a min-max loss to control the worst-case fairness violations.

\(\) We conduct extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods in achieving interventional fairness with promising accuracy.

## 2 Preliminaries

### DAGs, PDAGs, CPDAGs, and MPDAGs

In a graph \(=(V,E)\), where \(V\) and \(E\) represent the node set and edge set in \(\), we say \(\) is _directed_, _undirected_, or _partially directed_ if all edges in the graph are directed, undirected, or a mixture of directed and undirected edges, respectively. The _skeleton_ of \(\) is an undirected graph obtained by removing all arrowheads from \(\). Given a graph \(\), an \(X_{i}\) is called a _parent_ of \(X_{j}\) and \(X_{j}\) is called a _child_ of \(X_{i}\) if \(X_{i} X_{j}\) in \(\). Also, \(X_{i}\) is a _sibling_ of \(X_{j}\) if \(X_{i}-X_{j}\) in \(\). If \(X_{i}\) and \(X_{j}\) are connected by an edge, they are _adjacent_. The notation \(pa(X_{i},)\), \(ch(X_{i},)\), \(sib(X_{i},)\), and \(adj(X_{i},)\) respectively represent sets of parents, children, siblings, and adjacent vertices of \(X_{i}\) in \(\). A graph is termed _complete_ if all distinct vertices are adjacent. A _path_ is a sequence of distinct vertices \((X_{k_{1}},,X_{k_{j}})\) where any two consecutive vertices are adjacent. A path is called _partially directed_ from \(X_{k_{1}}\) to \(X_{k_{j}}\) if \(X_{k_{i}} X_{k_{i+1}}\) does not occur in \(\) for any \(i=1,,j-1\). A partially directed path is _directed_ (_undirected_) if all edges on the path are directed (undirected). A vertex \(X_{i}\) is an _ancestor_ of \(X_{j}\) and \(X_{j}\) is a _descendant_ of \(X_{i}\) if there is a directed path from \(X_{i}\) to \(X_{j}\) or \(X_{i}=X_{j}\). A directed (undirected) _cycle_ is a directed (undirected) path from a vertex to itself. Particularly, a cycle with the number of edges equal to three is called a _triangle_.

In a directed acyclic graph (DAG), all edges are directed and there is no directed cycle. A partially directed acyclic graph (DAG) may contain both directed and undirected edges without directed cycles. Two DAGs are Markov _equivalent_ if they induce the same set of conditional independence relations [Pearl, 1988]. A _Markov equivalence class_, denoted by \([]\), contains all DAGs equivalent to \(\). A Markov equivalence class can be uniquely represented by a partially directed graph called _completely partially directed acyclic graph_ (CPDAG) \(^{*}\), in which two vertices are adjacent if and only if they are adjacent in \(\), and a directed edge occurs if and only if it appears in all DAGs in \([]\)[Andersson et al., 1997, Chickering, 2002a]. A CPDAG \(^{*}\) can be refined to a maximally oriented partially directed acyclic graph (maximal PDAG or MPDAG) \(\) by giving background knowledge \(_{d}\) consisting of some directed causal relationships between variables in the form \(X_{i} X_{j}\)[Hauser and Buhlmann, 2012, Eigenmann et al., 2017, Wang et al., 2017, Rothenhausler et al., 2018]. Meek  proved that, with a series of orientation rules called Meek's rules, some undirected edges may be further directed (see Algorithm 4 in Appendix for details), and the resulting graph is an MPDAG. Both a DAG and a CPDAG can be viewed as special cases of an MPDAG, where the background knowledge is fully known and unknown, respectively.

### Structural Causal Model

We follow Pearl  to define the structural causal model (SCM) as a triplet \((V,U,F)\) to describe the causal relationships between variables. Specifically, \(V\) is a set of observable endogenous variables, \(U\) is a set of latent independent background variables that cannot be caused by any variable in \(V\), and \(F\) is a set of functions \(\{f_{1},,f_{|V|}\}\), one for each \(V_{i} V\), such that \(V_{i}=f_{i}(pa_{i},U_{i})\), where \(pa_{i} V\{V_{i}\}\) and \(U_{i} U\). Notably, the set of equations \(F\) induces a directed graph over the variables, here assumed to be a DAG, where the directed causes of \(V_{i}\) represents its parent set. A causal DAG model consists of a DAG \(\) and a joint distribution \(P\) over \(V\) such that the distribution can be factorized as \(P(v_{1},...,v_{|V|})=_{v_{i} V}P(v_{i}|pa(v_{i},))\)[Perkovic et al., 2017].

### Interventional Fairness

Given a DAG \(\) and two distinct variables \(X\) and \(Y\), the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) can be interpreted by the post-intervention distribution of \(Y\) intervening on \(X\) via _do_ operator [Pearl, 1995, 2009]. Formally, given a distribution \(P(U)\) over the background variables \(U\), an intervention \(do(X=x)\) that force variable \(X\) to take certain value \(x\) is defined as the substitution of the structural equation \(X=f_{x}(pa_{x},U_{x})\) with \(X=x\), and the post-interventional density of \(Y\) is denoted as \(f(Y=y do(X=x))\). However, if we only know a CPDAG \(^{*}\) or an MPDAG \(\), the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) may not be identifiable from observational data [Perkovic et al., 2015, 2017, Wu et al., 2019,b].

Build on the \(do\) operator, interventional fairness criterion [Kilbertus et al., 2017, Salimi et al., 2019] requires that given the covariates, intervening the value of the sensitive attribute does not affect the output distribution of the output predictor. Formally, let \(A\), \(Y\), and \(X\) denote sensitive attributes, outcomes of interest, and other covariates, and \(\) be a predictor produced by a learning algorithm as a prediction of \(Y\). Without loss of generality2, we say the predictor \(\) is interventionally fair with respect to the sensitive attributes \(A\) if it satisfies the following condition:

**Definition 2.1** (Interventional fairness [Kilbertus et al., 2017]).: We say the prediction \(\) is interventionally fair with respect to the sensitive attributes \(A\) if the following holds:

\[P(=y do(A=a))=P(=y do(A=a^{})),\]

for all possible values of \(y\) and any value that \(A\) can take.

A General Min-Max Optimization Framework

### Motivation and Method Overview

Given only observational data, the underlying true causal DAG may not be recoverable without strong assumptions such as linearity (Shimizu et al., 2006) or additive noise (Hoyer et al., 2008; Peters et al., 2014). Instead, we can use causal discovery algorithms (Spirites and Glymour, 1991; Shimizu et al., 2006; Zhang and Hyvarinen, 2009; Peters et al., 2014) to obtain a CPDAG that contains that true causal DAG. To exploit the obtained CPDAG for achieving interventional fairness, previous methods have been built on variable selection (Zuo et al., 2022) or causal effect identification (Perkovic, 2020; Zuo et al., 2024), but limited to reduced prediction accuracy or strong assumption for identification.

Differing from the above work, we propose a novel local method to partially identify the causal effects of sensitive attributes on the predictor for satisfying the interventional fairness. Interestingly, our approach does not require a global search of all possible DAGs, but can estimate all possible causal effects using the obtained CPDAG. In the following, we first theoretically state the necessary and sufficient condition for discriminating a set to be a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute for CPDAG and MPDAG, respectively, from which we propose a local method for finding all possible parent sets of sensitive attributes and estimating the corresponding propensities (Sec. 3.2). We then calculate the all possible degrees of intervention fairness being violated using all possible estimated propensities (Sec. 3.3). Finally, we further propose a min-max joint learning approach to make the predictor satisfy intervention fairness by controlling for worst-case fairness violation (Sec. 3.4).

### Finding Possible Parental Sets and Estimating Propensities

Given a CPDAG obtained from observational data, since enumerating all DAGs is infeasible when the size of the Markov equivalence class is large (He et al., 2015; Zuo et al., 2022), we propose to adopt a novel framework called IDA (Maathuis et al., 2009; Fang and He, 2020) to only enumerate possible parental sets of the sensitive attribute. This provides a more efficient solution since enumerating possible parental sets only requires the local structure around the sensitive attribute. We further extend the above theoretical results to MPDAGs with background knowledge added, and estimate possible propensities by regressing sensitive attribute on each possible parental set.

**Definition 3.1** (v-structure).: For three distinct vertices \(X_{i},X_{j}\) and \(X_{k}\), if \(X_{i} X_{j} X_{k}\) and \(X_{i}\) is not adjacent to \(X_{k}\) in \(\), then the triplet \((X_{i},X_{j},X_{k})\) is called a v-structure collided on \(X_{j}\).

Pearl (2009) have shown that two DAGs are equivalent if and only if they have the same skeleton and the same _v-structures_. Given a CPDAG \(^{*}\) contains all DAGs equivalent to \(\) and a sensitive attribute \(A\), the local structure around \(A\) can be divided into three cases: parents \(pa(A,^{*}) A\), children \(pa(A,^{*}) A\), and siblings \(sib(A,^{*})-A\) with undirected edges. Let \((A)\) be a subset of \(sib(A,^{*})\), we denote \(^{*}_{(A) A}\) as a DAG that is obtained from CPDAG \(^{*}\) by changing all undirected edges \(\{Z-A, Z(A)\}\) into the directed edges \(\{Z A, Z(A)\}\) as parents, and all of other undirected edges \(\{Z-A, Z(A)\}\) into the directed edges with opposite direction \(\{Z A, Z(A)\}\) as children. We say \((A) A\) is a possible parental set of the sensitive attribute \(A\) for \(^{*}\), if there exists a DAG \(\) in the equivalence class \(^{*}\) with the same directed edges adjacent to \(A\) as \(^{*}_{(A) A}\). Then a sufficient and necessary condition for determining whether a set \((A)(A,^{*})\) is a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute \(A\) is shown in below.

**Lemma 3.2** (Maathuis et al. (2009)).: _Given a CPDAG \(^{*}\), a set \((A)(A,^{*})\) is a possible parent set of the sensitive attribute \(A\), if and only if there is no more v-structure in \(^{*}_{(A) A}\) than \(^{*}\)._

From the above lemma, given any \((A) sib(A,^{*})\), we can determine whether \((A)\) is a possible parental set from a local way. In particular, let the _induced subgraph_ of \(=(V,E)\) over \(V^{} V\) be the subgraph \(^{}=(V^{},E^{})\) by restricting the edges \(E\) on the set of vertices \(V^{}\), where the edge set \(E^{}\) contains all edges with both endpoints in \(V^{}\). Then Lemma 3.2 is equivalent to check whether the induced subgraph of \(^{*}\) over \((A)\) is complete, i.e., all vertices in the induced subgraph of \(^{*}\) over \((A)\) are adjacent. This is because if there are two vertices \(X_{i}\) and \(X_{j}\) in \((A)\) that are not adjacent, then by Definition 3.1, a v-structure is formed as \(X_{i} A X_{j}\).

For MPDAG, a key difference compared with CPDAG is the possible generation of a directed triangular cycle (e.g., \(A X_{i} X_{j} A\)) (Fang and He, 2020), when incorporating the background knowledge and using Meek's rule for orienting undirected edges adjacent to the sensitive attribute \(A\). Motivated by such difference, we entend the theoretical results on CPDAGs to MPDAGs for determining possible parental sets of \(A\), which can also be implemented via a local way.

**Definition 3.3** (Direct triangle structure).: For three distinct vertices \(X_{i},X_{j}\) and \(X_{k}\), if \(X_{i} X_{j} X_{k} X_{i}\), then the triplet \((X_{i},X_{j},X_{k})\) is called a direct triangle structure.

**Lemma 3.4** (Fang and He (2020)).: _Given an MPDAG \(\), a set \((A)(A,)\) is a possible parent set of \(A\), if and only if there is no more direct triangle structure and v-structure in \(_{(A) A}\) than \(\)._

From Lemma 3.4, we can conclude that for a given MPDAG \(\), it is equivalent to checking whether the induced subgraph of \(\) over \((A)\) is complete, as well as there does not exist \(S(A)\) and \(C adj(A,)(pa(A,)(A))\) such that \(C S\), otherwise a direct triangle structrue is formed as \(A C S A\). This provides a efficient way to locally find the possible parental sets of \(A\). Without loss of generality, we denote the set of possible parental sets of \(A\) with a total number \(M\) as

\[_{A}=\{pa(A,)^{(1)}(A),pa(A,)^{(2)}(A),,pa(A,)^{(M)}(A) \}.\]

Next, to estimate \(P(=y|do(A=a))\) in the interventional fairness notion, for each possible parental set \(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\) with \(m=1,,M\), we propose to first estimate the corresponding propensity \(P(A pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\). Specifically, we use the covariates \(X\) restricted on \(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\), denoted as \(X|_{pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)}\), and train the propensity model \(g(X|_{pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)};^{(m)})\) for estimating propensity \(P(A pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\) by minimizing

\[(^{(m)})= -_{i=1}^{N}A_{i} g(X|_{pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)})+(1-A_{i})1-g(X|_{pa(A,) ^{(m)}(A)}),\]

where \(^{(m)}\) is the propensity model parameter and \(^{(m)}_{i}=g(x_{i}|_{pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)};^{(m)})\) is the estimated propensity of unit \(i\) corresponding to the possible parent set \(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\) for \(i=1,,N\) and \(m=1,,M\). Since CPDAGs can be viewed as special cases of MPDAGs, without loss of generality, we summarized the proposed local algorithm on MPDAGs in Alg. 1 (see Alg. 3 in Appendix for implementing the proposed local algorithm on CPDAGs).

### Estimating and Bounding Interventional Fairness

We then aim to estimate and bound all possible causal effects of sensitive attribute \(A\) on the predictor \(\). Note that each parental set \(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\) is a valid back-door adjustment set in the back-door adjustment formula Pearl (1995, 2009), we have the following identification results.

**Lemma 3.5**.: _With observational data, for \(m\{1,,M\}\), if \( pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\)3, then the post-intervention distribution can be calculated from the observational data by:_

\[P(=y|do(A=a))=  P(=y|A=a,pa(A,)^{(m)}(A ))dP(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\] \[= =y,A=a|pa(A,)^{( m)}(A))}{P(A=a|pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))}dP (pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)),\]

_where \(P(A=a|pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\) is estimated via \(g(X|_{pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)};^{(m)})\) in Sec. 3.2._

Proof of Lemma 3.5.: \[P(=y|do(A=a))\] \[=  P(=y|do(A=a),pa(A,)^{( m)}(A))dP(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\] \[=  P(=y|A=a,pa(A,)^{(m)}(A ))dP(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))\] \[= =y,A=a|pa(A,)^{( m)}(A))}{P(A=a|pa(A,)^{(m)}(A))}dP (pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)),\]

where the first and the third equations are from the conditional probability formula.

From Lemma 3.5, for each possible parental set \(pa(A,)^{(m)}(A)\) with \(m=1,,M\), given estimated propensities \(_{i}^{(m)}\) in Sec. 3.2, we can train a treatment effect estimation model \(h(x_{i};^{(m)})=_{i}^{(m)}\) to estimate \(P(=y do(A=1))-P(=y do(A=0))\) by minimizing

\[(^{(m)})= _{i=1}^{N}f(x_{i};)}{ _{i}^{(m)}}-)f(x_{i};)}{1-_{i}^{(m)}}-h(x_{i };^{(m)})^{2},\]

where \(f(x_{i};)=_{i}\) is an outcome predictor parameterized by \(\), and \(h(x_{i};^{(m)})=_{i}^{(m)}\) aims to evaluate the interventional fairness violation of that learned predictor.

### Min-Max Joint Learning Approach

We now aim to train a predictor to satisfy interventional fairness. Since the parental set of the sensitive attribute in the true DAG is unknown, we propose a min-max learning approach to control for the worst-case interventional fairness violations of the predictor. Specifically, given all possible causal effects \(_{i}^{(m)}\) of the sensitive attribute \(A\) on the predictor \(\) in Section 3.3, the prediction model \(=f(x;)\) is trained by minimizing the average prediction error with the worst-case violations of interventional fairness as a penalty term

\[_{}(;^{(1)},,^{(M )})=_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i}-f(x_{i};))^{2}+_{m} _{i=1}^{N}_{i}^{(m)},\] s.t. \[_{i}^{(m)} C+_{i}^{(m)},\;i=1,,N,\;m=1, ,M,\] \[_{i}^{(m)}-C-_{i}^{(m)},\;i=1,,N,\;m=1, ,M,\] \[_{i}^{(m)} 0,\;i=1,,N,\;m=1,,M,\]which is a convex optimization problem when \(_{i}^{(m)}=h(x_{i};^{(m)})\) is linear. It is equivalent to

\[_{}()=_{i=1}^{N}(Y_{i}-f(x_{i}; ))^{2}+_{m}_{i=1}^{N}(-C-_{i}^{(m)})_{+}+(_{i}^{(m)}-C)_{+},\]

where \(\) and \(\) are hyper-parameters for trade-off between prediction accuracy and interventional fairness. Since achieving strict interventional fairness for all individuals, i.e., having zero causal effects of sensitive attribute on the predictor, is usually unrealistic and would come at the cost of much prediction accuracy, we introduce a slack variable \(_{i}^{(m)}\) for each individual and a pre-specified threshold \(C\), which penalizes the loss when the estimated causal effect \(|_{i}^{(m)}|>C\). Note that when implementing the proposed min-max optimization approach, the treatment effect estimation models for evaluating the fairness violations in Section 3.3 and the prediction model controlling for worse-case fairness violations in Section 3.4 should be updated _alternatively_, which can be viewed as an iterative process of _interventional fairness evaluation_ and _policy improvement_ of the prediction model. We summarized the whole min-max optimization algorithm in Alg. 2.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, both synthetic and real-world experiments are conducted to evaluate the prediction accuracy and fairness of our approach. The root mean squared error (RMSE) between \(Y\) and \(\) is used to measure the prediction performance, and the RMSE between \(|do(A=a)\) and \(|do(A=a^{})\) is used to measure the violation of the interventional fairness, named "unfairness".

**Baselines.** We consider six baseline prediction models: (1) **Full** uses all attributes, (2) **Unaware** uses all attributes except the sensitive attribute, (3) **Oracle** uses all attributes that are non-descendants of the sensitive attribute given the ground-truth DAG, (4) **FairRelax** uses all definite non-descendants and possible descendants of the sensitive attribute in a CPDAG (or an MPDAG), (5) **Fair** uses all definite non-descendants of the sensitive attribute in a CPDAG (or an MPDAG), and (6) \(\)**-IFair** uses all attributes and implement the constrained optimization problem.

**Synthetic Study.** Synthetic data are generated from a linear structural equation model based on a ground-truth DAG. Specifically, we first randomly generate a DAG with \(d\) nodes and \(2d\) directed edges according to the Erdos-Renyi (ER) model with \(d\{10,20,30,40\}\) in our experiment. Following the previous studies (Zuo et al., 2022, 2024), the path coefficients \(_{jk}\) of directed edges \(X_{j} X_{k}\) are sampled from a uniform distribution \(([-2,-0.5][0.5,2])\). The data are generated using \(X_{k}=_{X_{j} pa(X_{k})}_{jk}X_{j}+_{i},i=1,,n\), where \(pa(X_{k})\) represents the parent nodes of \(X_{k}\), noise \(_{i} N(0,)\) with \(\{1.5,2.5\}\), and \(n\) is the sample size, which is set to 1,000 in our 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

As \(p\) increases, due to the presence of more backdoor paths, the RMSE performance and unfairness performance of all methods decreases, however, our method still outperforms the baseline methods.

**The Performance on the Classification Problem.** We conduct more experiments to examine if the proposed method can be applied to classification problems. Specifically, we modify the data generation process (DGP) to clip the outcome variable \(Y\) to 1 if \(Y>0\), and to 0 if \(Y 0\), and the rest DGP remains the same. In this scenario, we adopt AUC as the evaluation metric instead of RMSE. The experiment results are shown in Table 4. We find that both **Full** and **Unaware** perform better on AUC, while **Fair**, **FairRelax**, \(\)**-IFair**, and our approach perform better on unfairness. Note that our approach outperforms **Fair**, **FairRelax**, and \(\)**-IFair** in all scenarios for both AUC and unfairness.

**Case Study.** The sensitive attributes contained in many widely used datasets for fair machine learning have no parent nodes, such as sex in the Adult dataset4[Kohavi, 1996] and race in the COMPAS dataset5[Angwin et al., 2022]. Because sex, race, and age cannot be affected by other collected features, we further consider the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) dataset6[Kuzilek et al., 2017], in which disability is treated as the sensitive attribute and final_grade is treated as the outcome. The COMPAS dataset contains 6,172 units with 9 attributes such as gender and number_of_priors, the Adult dataset contains 48,842 units with 14 attributes such as age, education, and race, and the OULAD dataset contains 32,593 units with 11 attributes including demographic information such as gender, age, education_level, etc. For this case study, we first learn a CPDAG from the raw data using the PC algorithm in the causal-learn package and obtain an MPDAG with the background knowledge such as sex can not be caused by other attributes.

we randomly generate a DAG as the ground-truth from the learned MPDAG. After obtaining the DAG, we then divide the data into 100 random batches, and for each batch, we learn an MPDAG from the observed data and background knowledge. The path coefficients are determined based on linear regression and regard the residual of the regression as noise. The subsequent steps are the same as in the synthetic study. The experiment results are shown in Table 5, with density plots in Figure 3. First, both \(\)-**IFair** and our method demonstrate the superiority of our approach in both prediction performance and fairness compared to other baselines. In addition, our method stably outperforms \(\)-**IFair**, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed min-max joint learning approach.

## 5 Conclusion

This paper aims to achieve interventional fairness from observational data when the causal graph is unknown or partially known. Interestingly, we show it is actually sufficient to enumerate all possible parental sets of the sensitive attributes via a local approach, instead of enumerating all DAGs at high computational cost. We then propose a general min-max optimization framework to achieve interventional fairness that is easy applicable to CPDAGs and maximally oriented PDAGs (MPDAGs) with the added background knowledge. One limitation of our approach is due to the proposed approach relying on a CPDAG given by the causal discovery algorithm and estimations of the propensities, which may lead to mild violations of interventional fairness when the CPDAG or estimates are inaccurate. Another possible limitation, which also serves as a future research direction, is to achieve interventional fairness in the presence of hidden variables with partially known DAGs.
