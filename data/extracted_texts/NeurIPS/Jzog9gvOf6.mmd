###### Abstract

The ability to detect aerial objects with limited annotation is pivotal to the development of real-world aerial intelligence systems. In this work, we focus on a demanding but practical sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD) in aerial images, which encompasses a wider variety of aerial scenes with the same number of annotated objects. Although most existing SAOD methods rely on fixed thresholding to filter pseudo-labels for enhancing detector performance, adapting to aerial objects proves challenging due to the imbalanced probabilities/confidences associated with predicted aerial objects. To address this problem, we propose a novel Progressive Exploration-Conformal Learning (PECL) framework to address the SAOD task, which can adaptively perform the selection of high-quality pseudo-labels in aerial images. Specifically, the pseudo-label exploration can be formulated as a decision-making paradigm by adopting a conformal pseudo-label explorer and a multi-clue selection evaluator. The conformal pseudo-label explorer learns an adaptive policy by maximizing the cumulative reward, which can decide how to select these high-quality candidates by leveraging their essential characteristics and inter-instance contextual information. The multi-clue selection evaluator is designed to evaluate the explorer-guided pseudo-label selections by providing an instructive feedback for policy optimization. Finally, the explored pseudo-labels can be adopted to guide the optimization of aerial object detector in a closed-loop progressive fashion. Comprehensive evaluations on two public datasets demonstrate the superiority of our PECL when compared with other state-of-the-art methods in the sparsely annotated aerial object detection task. The code will be available at: https://github.com/SAOD-research/PECL.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, object detection has gained widespread attention, but the demand for a large amount of labeled data is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this challenge, semi-supervised object detection (SSOD) has been proposed to enhance detection performance by utilizing limited labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. SSOD methods [(14; 30; 23; 36)] mainly focus on general images, and cannot consider the unique characteristics of objects in aerial images, such as dense arrangements, rich contextual relationships, and large complex scenes. As shown in Figure 1(a), objects in aerial images are more dense and similar compared to general images. For example, the average objects per image are 68.4 _vs_ 7.7 in the DOTA [(27)] and COCO [(13)] datasets, respectively. Therefore, we address the sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD) task in aerial images, whichlabels a few part of objects in the training set. Compared with the conventional SSOD task, the SAOD can cover more diversity of aerial scenes even with the same number of annotated objects, as illustrated in Figure 1(b).

The SAOD task mitigates the need for expensive instance-level annotations, but also faces severe challenges of detector optimization, especially only with the limited and sparse annotation objects. In general, most existing SAOD approaches have attempted to mine more confidence supervised signals (e.g., pseudo-labels) from a substantial quantity of unlabeled aerial images. For example, Yoon et al. (32) combined an anchor-free object detector with an object tracker to generate dense annotations for training images. Co-mining (26) employed a Siamese network comprising two branches that mutually predict pseudo-label sets. Niitani et al. (18) utilized a part-aware sampling technique to handle instances within primary categories and used pseudo-labels to exclude un-annotated regions. However, existing SAOD methods typically focus on using fixed thresholds to filter pseudo-labels, lacking the ability to adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels. Different from conventional objects, some aerial objects characterized by substantial dimensions and notable features (e.g., planes) exhibit higher predicted probabilities, whereas smaller aerial objects like vehicles are associated with comparatively lower predicted probabilities. Consequently, the discrepancy in probabilities and confidence levels observed in the predicted results poses a severe challenge in identifying pseudo-label instances by setting a rigorous threshold in the sparsely annotated aerial object detection process. Meanwhile, the conformal prediction methodology, as elucidated by Shafer et al. (2008) (20), emerges as a potent approach for quantifying uncertainty by harnessing confidence levels to effectively rectify the challenges stemming from imbalanced data.

In this work, we propose a Progressive Exploration-Conformable Learning (PECL) framework to improve the SAOD performance in aerial images, which can adaptively explore more confident pseudo-labels by considering the imbalance characteristics of different categories. Specifically, we firstly pre-train the detector with these sparsely annotated objects, and employ online clustering to generate class-wise knowledge to assist the pseudo-label exploration. The conformal decision problem of pseudo-label exploration is addressed with two essential components: the conformal pseudo-label explorer and multi-clue selection evaluator. The conformal pseudo-label explorer is responsible for selecting confident pseudo-labels by considering the intrinsic and conformal characteristics of the predicted candidates; while the multi-clue selection evaluator assesses the pseudo-label exploration and provides feedback to guide the optimization of the pseudo-label explorer. Finally, both the detector updating and the conformal pseudo-label exploration are integrated into a closed-loop, mutually reinforcing framework, promoting the SAOD task.

To summarize, the contributions of this work are threefold: i) We propose a progressive exploration-conformable learning framework that integrates the detector updating and the conformal pseudo-label exploration into an iteratively co-enhancing system. ii) We perform the pseudo-label exploration to mine more high-quality pseudo-labels by considering contextual information in large complex scenes, consisting of two modules: the conformal pseudo-label explorer and multi-clue selection evaluator. iii) Comprehensive evaluations on two public datasets, DOTA (27) and HRSC2016 (15), demonstrate the effectiveness of our PECL, which outperforms the baselines and state-of-the-art methods by a large margin in the sparsely annotated aerial object detection task.

**Semi-/weakly-supervised/sparsely-annotated object detection:** Due to the extensive annotations requiring a significant investment of time and labor, SSOD and SAOD have attracted considerable attention in recent years. SSOD aims at the detector optimization by using limited labeled samples and a large number of unlabeled samples. For example, Pseudo labeling (10) has been widely used in semi-supervised learning, which utilizes pre-trained detector to generate labels for unlabeled data. Furthermore, some methods [(2; 28; 11)] combined consistency regularization with pseudo labeling. CSD (9) leveraged consistent predictions of horizontally flipped image pairs, STAC (21) enforced consistency constraints on weakly and strongly augmented image pairs. Unbiased Teacher (14) adopted the focal loss [(12)] to resolve pseudo-label bias caused by class imbalance in real labels. SOOD [(7)] designed rotation-aware adaptive weighting loss and global consistency loss for semi-supervised oriented object detection. Furthermore, considerable efforts have been made in weakly-supervised oriented bounding box detection. H2RBox [(31)] learned object center from horizontal box labels in weak-supervision, used scale and spatial constraints to estimate object dimensions in self-supervision. PointOBB [(16)] and Point2RBox [(34)] used Multiple Instance Learning and Knowledge Combination to learn rotated box regression from single point supervision. While SAOD labels part of instances in each image. Many researchers have explored methods to address this challenge. Nitani et al. [(18)] introduced part-aware sampling that leveraged the logical relationship between parts to guide the sampling process. Co-mining [(26)] involved a Siamese network with two branches that predicted pseudo-label sets for each other. Rambhatla et al. [(19)] treated SAOD as a semi-supervised problem focusing on regions, automatically identifying unlabeled foreground objects. Calibrated Teacher [(25)] calibrated the predicted confidence to match the actual accuracy, ensuring detectors at different training stages share similar confidence distributions and fixed threshold. In contrast, our work focuses on sparsely annotated aerial object detection by adaptively exploring contextual relationships between unlabeled instances in large complex scenes.

**Reinforcement/exploratory learning in computer vision:** Deep reinforcement learning has shown promising results in many decision-making domains. It has also been widely applied in the field of computer vision. Caicedo et al. [(3)] transformed the object detection into a Markov Decision Process to deform bounding boxes for accurate localization. Huang et al. [(8)] proposed an adaptive tracking method, which used reinforcement learning to select the number of network layers. DSN [(37)] treated video summarization as a sequence prediction problem, predicting frame probabilities and selecting frames based on the probability. Yu et al. [(33)] applied reinforcement learning for image restoration, employing a policy network to select suitable repair tools. Walid et al. [(1)] formulated the landmark localization in 3D medical images as a reinforcement learning problem and introduced actor-critic for localization tasks. Tian et al. [(24)] introduced a medical image segmentation method based on reinforcement learning, the reward showed the change between the predictions and the ground truth. IVADC-FDRL [(17)] empowered the agent to learn from real data by integrating detector for anomaly detection and Q-learning for anomaly classification. In this work, we build a progressive exploration-conformal learning process to adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels, thereby enhancing the supervision signal for sparsely annotated aerial object detection.

## 3 The Proposed Method

### Problem Definition

The sparsely annotated aerial object detection is to learn a robust aerial detector by employing these sparsely annotated instances and a large amount of unlabeled images/regions in the training set. Formally, we define \(=\{X_{i},O_{i}\}_{i=1}^{N}\) as the training set, where \(N\) represents the total number of training images, \(X_{i}\) and \(O_{i}\) denote the \(i\)-th image sample and the corresponding sparsely annotated object set, respectively. For the \(i\)-th image, the annotated object set can be represented as \(O_{i}=\{x_{i}^{j},y_{i}^{j},b_{i}^{j}\}_{j=1}^{N_{i}}\), where \(x_{i}^{j},y_{i}^{j},b_{i}^{j}\) denote the image region, the class label, the bounding-box location of the \(j\)-th annotated object, and \(N_{il}\) (i.e., \(N_{il} 0\)) refers to the total number of labeled instances.

In the sparsely annotated aerial object detection task, how to mine more confident supervision (e.g., pseudo-labels) from these unlabeled images/regions is critical to promote the detector optimization. In general, most existing sparsely annotated object detection approaches [(26; 10; 25)] adopted a fixed threshold to select pseudo-labels, which can be used to provide more supervised signals. Unlike these typical objects, certain aerial objects characterized by their large, distinct features (e.g.,planes) exhibit heightened predicted probabilities, whereas aerial objects with small dimensions (e.g., vehicles) tend to have lower predicted probabilities. Therefore, the imbalance in the predicted object probabilities could pose a challenge in pinpointing pseudo-label samples through a strict thresholding in the sparsely annotated aerial object detection problem. Inspired by the conformal prediction technique [(20)], which enables uncertainty quantification and utilizes confidence levels to tackle imbalanced data, we propose a novel Progressive Exploration-Conformable Learning (PECL) framework to address the SAOD task in aerial images.

### PECL framework

Our proposed PECL framework can be built as a close-loop iterative learning process between the conformal pseudo-label exploration and the detector updating. Firstly, we can obtain a pre-trained aerial detector \(\) by employing these sparsely annotated objects in the training set. To provide the confident guide for the subsequent process, we construct class-wise prototypes \(=\{p_{ck}^{d}\}_{c=1,k=1}^{C,K}\) with the fully connected layer features of each annotated instance as in [(38)]. Here \(C\) is the number of classes, \(K\) is the number of prototypes per class, and \(d\) is the feature dimension of the prototype. We can obtain the candidate set of each input sample \(X_{i}\), i.e., \(\{_{i}^{t}\}_{t=1}^{N_{ic}}\), where \(N_{ic}\) represents the number of candidates. We perform the conformal pseudo-label exploration to refine and identify these high-quality candidates as pseudo-labels, which can adaptively consider the distinct characteristics of different categories in the candidate set, especially in the aerial images. Here we develop the conformal pseudo-label explorer to facilitate the creation of an adaptive exploration policy, and the multi-clue selection evaluator to appraise the effectiveness of pseudo-label selection.

#### 3.2.1 Conformal Pseudo-label Explorer

To address the imbalanced prediction probabilities across different categories in the aerial scenes, we specially design the conformal pseudo-label explorer to effectively probe these high-quality pseudo-labels. Specifically, the conformal pseudo-label explorer \(\) is a multi-layer perceptron composed of three fully connected layers. Its objective is to learn an adaptive pseudo-label exploration policy to determine whether to select the current candidate \(_{i}^{t}\). The conformal pseudo-label explorer \(\) takes the current exploratory characteristic \(c_{i}^{t}\) as input, and obtains a two-dimensional selection probability distribution \((c_{i}^{t})^{2}\), representing the probabilities of taking different selections under the current characteristic. The selection decision \(a_{i}^{t}\) is then obtained by sampling from this distribution, i.e., \(a_{i}^{t}(c_{i}^{t})\), where a decision value of 0 indicates not selecting the candidate, a value of 1 represents selecting the candidate as a pseudo-label. To assist the conformal pseudo-label explorer \(\) in performing the rational decision, the important point is how to design a comprehensive exploratory characteristic \(c_{i}^{t}\) by considering multiple aspects of information. Here the characteristic \(c_{i}^{t}=F_{c}\{O_{i},_{i}^{t},_{i}^{t}\}\) is formed by utilizing the characteristics of the sparsely annotated objects \(O_{i}\), the selected pseudo-labels \(_{i}^{t}\), and the current candidate \(_{i}^{t}\) in the current \(i\)-th aerial image. The exploratory characteristic thus provides a rich and accurate scene description for the conformal pseudo-label explorer, facilitating more effective pseudo-label selection.

Taking the candidate \(_{i}^{t}\) as an example, we explain a detailed depiction of constructing the corresponding \(c_{i}^{t}\) at time \(t\). The characteristic of the current candidate \(_{i}^{t}\) can be represented as a feature vector, denoted as \([_{}(_{i}^{t}),pro(_{i}^{t}),f_{sim}( _{i}^{t})]\). \(_{}(_{i}^{t})\) determines the precise level of confidence [(20)] for the candidate \(_{i}^{t}\) to quantify the uncertainty of the predicted probability. Here \(_{}(_{i}^{t})\) can be expressed as a class-conditional probability where the non-conformity scores of all learned prototypes take on a value bigger than or equal to the non-conformity score of this candidate under the condition of the certain class \(_{i}^{t}\). Formally:

\[_{}(_{i}^{t})& =Pro(\{NC(p_{ck})\}_{c=1,k=1}^{C,K} NC(_{i}^{t})| _{i}^{t})\\ &=^{K}[NC(_{i}^{t}|p_{ _{i}^{t}k}) NC(_{i}^{t}|_{i}^{t})]+1}{K+ 1}\] (1)

where \(NC(_{i}^{t}|_{i}^{t})=1-pro(_{i}^{t}|_{i}^ {t})\) represents the non-conformity score of the candidate \(_{i}^{t}\) with the class \(_{i}^{t}\) and \([]\) is the indicator function. A higher non-conformity score indicates a greater dissimilarity between the candidate and the reference class distribution. \(pro(_{i}^{t})\) indicates the predicted probability of candidate \(_{i}^{t}\), inferred by the optimized detector. \(f_{sim}(_{i}^{t})\) computes the 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

where \(\) is a discount factor. Finally, we can continuously update the conformal pseudo-label explorer \(\) and the multi-clue selection evaluator \(Q\) through performing gradient descent on the following objective function:

\[_{ref}=^{t}-Q(c_{i}^{t},a_{i}^{t}))^{2}}_{}\ -^{t},a_{i}^{t})}_{}\] (7)

where the decision \(a_{i}^{t}\) is sampled from \((c_{i}^{t})\). The first term aims to adjust the predicted cumulative reward to approximate the target value for updating the multi-clue selection evaluator \(Q\). The second term aspires to maximize the cumulative reward, enabling the conformal pseudo-label explorer \(\) to refine the exploration policy. These selected high-quality candidates can in turn promote the capability of the aerial object detector. Furthermore, we use an experience replay pool \(D\) to store a series of data \(\{(c_{i}^{t},a_{i}^{t},r_{i}^{t},c_{i}^{t+1})\}\) and sample batches to gradually update the parameters of the conformal pseudo-label explorer and the multi-clue selection evaluator (i.e., \(_{exp}\) and \(_{eva}\)).

#### 3.2.3 Progressive detector updating

The ultimate goal of our progressive exploration-conformable learning framework is to optimize an aerial detector by utilizing the sparse annotation and adaptively exploring these high-quality pseudo-labels in the training set. By employing these explored pseudo-labels \(_{i}^{N_{ic}}\) and the initial sparsely annotated objects \(O_{i}\) as supervision signals, we can progressively acquire a satisfactory detector \(\) by minimizing the loss function using stochastic gradient descent. Formally,

\[_{det}=&_{i}^{N}( _{i}|}_{j=1}^{|O_{i}|}(_{cls}(x_{i}^{j},y_{i }^{j})+_{reg}(x_{i}^{j},b_{i}^{j})+_{pot}(x_{i}^{j}, )))\\ &+_{i}^{N}(_{i}^{N_{ic}}|}_{u=1}^{| _{i}^{N_{ic}}|}(_{cls}(_{i}^{u},_{i }^{u})+_{reg}(_{i}^{u},_{i}^{u})))\] (8)

where \(|O_{i}|\) and \(|_{i}^{N_{ic}}|\) represent the number of sparsely annotated objects and the selected pseudo-labels during the conformal pseudo-label exploration process in the \(i\)-th image. \(_{i}^{u}\) and \(_{i}^{u}\) indicate the class label and bounding-box of the selected pseudo-labels \(_{i}^{u}\). \(_{cls}\) is the standard cross-entropy loss used in ReDet (6) and OR-CNN (29) or the focal loss used in S\({}^{2}\)A-Net (5) for classification, \(_{reg}\) is the SmoothL1 loss for localization. To construct representative class-wise prototypes for providing confident guidance, we adopt the prototype loss \(_{pot}\) as referenced in (38). To mitigate the impact of false negatives, we additionally employ the background weighting reduction strategy during the detector optimization process. Both the detector updating and the reinforced pseudo-label exploration are integrated to address the sparsely annotated aerial object detection task in a closed-loop, mutually reinforcing fashion. The PECL training process is presented in Algorithm 1.

to SOOD and Calibrated Teacher. The reason may be that our approach can explore high-quality pseudo-labels by addressing the imbalanced prediction probabilities across different categories in the aerial scenes, thereby mitigating the limitation of sparse annotation and boosting the detector optimization.

### Ablation study

We conduct comprehensive ablation experiments to evaluate the performance of our framework under different settings. All the experiments are conducted with the ReDet baseline on the DOTA dataset at the 1% label rate for the OBB task, unless stated otherwise.

**Effect of each component:** As shown in Table 5, we give comparative results with three strategies when generating an optimal pseudo-label selection policy, including the conformal pseudo-label explorer, the multi-clue selection evaluator, and the experience replay mechanism. When only using the conformal pseudo-label explorer, we update the policy using the policy gradient method (22) and the detector achieves an mAP of 60.84%. It already outperforms the baseline, verifying the effectiveness of the conformal pseudo-label exploration mechanism. When further adopting the multi-clue selection evaluator, we can achieve more improvement with an mAP of 61.31%. The reason may be that the evaluator provides positive guidance for policy optimization. Moreover, the accumulated experience can alleviate overestimation and bring the best mAP of 63.72%.

**Reward setting in the multi-clue selection evaluator:** We study the effects of three factors of the designed instant exploratory reward, including the information entropy (IE), confidence margin (CM) and value binarization (VB) technique in Eq. (5). As presented in Figure 2, the detection results can be improved with different factors of the exploratory reward to some extent. These results indicate that combining information entropy and confidence margin as the exploratory reward is the most effective way to measure the uncertainty/quality of candidates and evaluate the pseudo-label selection. Besides, the VB technique ensures the stable convergence for policy optimization, further enhancing the detection performance.

**Exploratory characteristic design in the conformal pseudo-label explorer:** To validate the significance of different characteristics when forming the exploratory characteristic, Table 6 presents its comparative results with the predicted probability, feature similarity and confidence level. The predicted probability can measure the accuracy of the candidate, resulting in 1.32% performance boost. The feature similarity indicates the resemblance of the candidate to the class centers, leading to a gain of 2.55%. The confidence level reflects the inconsistency between the candidate and the corresponding prototypes, contributing to 2.82% improvement. These results confirm the rationality of our characteristic design and emphasize the importance of appropriate exploratory characteristic to enhance the performance.

**Action space in the conformal pseudo-label explorer:** We design two sizes of action space (ASS), namely the dimension of the probability vector obtained by the pseudo-label explorer. For 'ASS=1', the explorer outputs the probability of selecting the candidate, while 'ASS=2' gives the likelihood of the candidate being selected or not. Our approach achieves performance of 60.81% ('ASS=1') _vs_ 63.72% ('ASS=2') on the DOTA dataset at the 1% label rate. Moreover, Figure 3 illustrates the loss curves of explorer and evaluator under different action spaces. We can observe when 'ASS=2', the loss values converge faster and reach lower convergence values compared to 'ASS=1'. The reason may be that 'ASS=2' could provide a larger decision space, thereby promoting more flexible decision-making and improving the exploration capability of the pseudo-label explorer.

## 5 Conclusion and Discussion

In this paper, we propose a Progressive Exploration-Conformable Learning (PECL) framework to address the sparsely annotated aerial object detection problem, which can adaptively perform the conformal pseudo-label exploration from the large-scale unlabeled aerial images. By introducing the conformal pseudo-label explorer and the multi-clue selection evaluator, we formulate the pseudo-label exploration as a conformal decision-making problem. It can select these confident pseudo-labels by considering the specific characteristics of different categories and inter-instance contextual relationships. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our PECL framework.

**Limitations.** This work also has some limitations. The first limitation is that our work is built for scenes with densely distributed objects, and its performance in general scenes may be suboptimal. Secondly, the application of reinforcement learning algorithms increases the overall training time. In the future, we will continue to explore the potential of sparsely annotated object detection and extend this PECL framework to other weakly supervised detection/segmentation tasks in general/aerial images to further reduce the annotation costs.
