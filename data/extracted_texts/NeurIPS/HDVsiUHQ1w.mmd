###### Abstract

In this paper, we present SCOREQ, a novel approach for speech quality prediction. SCOREQ is a _triplet loss function for contrastive regression_ that addresses the domain generalisation shortcoming exhibited by state of the art no-reference speech quality metrics. In the paper we: (i) illustrate the problem of L2 loss training failing at capturing the continuous nature of the mean opinion score (MOS) labels; (ii) demonstrate the lack of generalisation through a benchmarking evaluation across several speech domains; (iii) outline our approach and explore the impact of the architectural design decisions through incremental evaluation; (iv) evaluate the final model against state of the art models for a wide variety of data and domains. The results show that the lack of generalisation observed in state of the art speech quality metrics is addressed by SCOREQ. We conclude that using a triplet loss function for contrastive regression improves generalisation for speech quality prediction models but also has potential utility across a wide range of applications using regression-based predictive models.

## 1 Introduction

No-reference speech quality assessment has seen significant advancements in recent years, thanks to supervised learning . Supervised speech quality models learn to map input features (waveform domain, mel spectrograms) to Mean Opinion Score (MOS), a continuous target value derived by averaging individual listener ratings on a predefined Absolute Category Rating (ACR) scale (1=Bad, 2=Poor, 3=Fair, 4=Good, 5=Excellent).

While no-reference deep learning MOS predictors outperform traditional full-reference metrics (e.g, PESQ , POLQA , ViSQOL , CDPAM ), they struggle to generalise to unseen audio degradations. Addressing the domain mismatch in speech quality metrics is urgent given the fast growing research in generative speech e.g., neural speech coding , speech enhancement  and speech synthesis . In Figure 5 we show the significant performance gap of no-reference speech quality metrics between in-domain and out-of-domain test sets.

The difficulty of no-reference speech quality models is the attempt to map high-dimensional data \(^{D}\) to a monodimensional continuous space. Speech data include several entangled factors thatare irrelevant to quality and they make it difficult for models to learn a low-dimensional space e.g., speaker identity, pitch, spoken content, phonetic information, degradation separability, etc. State-of-the-art methods that attempt to improve generalisation are based on either expanding the dataset, developing better architectures, or finetuning pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) methods. However, as we will show in this paper, domain mismatch is still a problem when tested on unseen degradations.

We observe that the majority of no-reference metrics are either trained or finetuned end-to-end by minimising the L2 loss between ground truth MOS and predictions. This approach is simple but it does not induce an ordered representation with respect to the regression targets in the feature space. The same would apply to L1 loss-based regression. Figure 1 (a) shows PCA-projected embeddings of the SSL wav2vec 2.0  model finetuned with the L2 loss. It can be observed how the representation learned by the layer attached to the output layer is fragmented and tends to cluster degradations while MOS is only partially projected along one of the 2 PCA dimensions. Other studies such as RnC , have observed this problem in non-audio regression minimising the L1 loss. When attaching a linear projection layer to representations that are ordered with respect to targets, RnC is able to improve all the baselines trained with the L1 loss across a wide range of regression tasks.

Motivated by the issues above, we present Speech COntrastive REgression for Quality (SCOREQ) assessment. We propose the SCOREQ loss function which is based on contrasting triplets to learn a quality manifold as shown in Figure 1 (b). We adapt the batch-all triplet loss for person re-identification  which addresses a classification task. Since MOS is a continuous label, the batch-all strategy is not trivial. By assuming that closeness is relative in regression, our loss function generates on-the-fly masks that identify valid triplets based on the MOS and are able to contrast all the possible triplet combinations in the batch based on regression targets. In addition, we investigate an alternative version that replaces the fixed margin with an adaptive margin initially proposed in . This study suggests that supervised contrastive learning for regression performs significantly better than L2 loss minimisation for speech quality assessment. Our contributions are (i) We conduct a systematic evaluation to prove that domain mismatch i.e. a lack of robustness to both out-of-distribution (ODS) and out-of-domain (ODM) test sets, is a serious problem in speech

Figure 1: Embeddings of L2 loss (a) vs SCOREQ (b) on TCD VOIP data . Color shows quality labels (MOS) while markers identify the degradations. We compute the Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) between k-Means clusters and degradation labels, as well as the Pearsonâ€™s Correlation (PC) between embedding distance with respect to random clean speech and MOS targets. Higher NMI indicates representations are clustered based on degradations while higher PC means representations are ordered with respect to MOS targets. Results indicate that the L2 loss embeddings tend to capture degradation information (NMI=0.39, PC=0.53) while SCOREQ quality (NMI=0.11, PC=0.80). See Appendix I for more details.

quality metrics; (ii) We propose a _triplet loss function for contrastive regression_ that is based on on-the-fly triplet mining and adaptive margin; (iii) We conduct an extensive statistical analysis on the results showing that our contrastive loss improves significantly results on both ODS and ODM data using two architectures and 11 test sets from several speech domains; (iv) We propose 2 ready-to-use speech quality metrics based on the SCOREQ loss for natural and synthetic speech that both work in two modes: no-reference (NR SCOREQ) and non-matching reference (NMR SCOREQ) mode i.e., where quality is measured with unpaired clean speech.

## 2 Related Work

Speech Quality AssessmentThe earliest no-reference speech quality methods are based on signal processing [38; 29] but showed poor generalisation. Data-driven no-reference metrics improved results. However, often they are trained with quality labels obtained from full-reference speech quality metrics [30; 6; 14] which already suffer from generalisation issues. Other MOS predictors were trained on MOS scores [53; 43; 1] and showed improvement across several databases. Recent methods are based on finetuning pre-trained self-supervised learning (SSL) models [59; 3; 22] such as HuBERT  or wav2vec 2.0 . Although large improvement has been observed, e.g., in out-of-domain languages  we show in this paper that SSL finetuning still suffers from domain mismatch. Other metrics consider predicting speech quality without relying on the MOS. For example, SpeechLMScore  uses a speech-language model, and VQScore  uses vector quantization from clean speech only. The NORESQA framework [41; 39] and the NOMAD model  also propose solutions without MOS and they address the relative nature of quality assessment by using non-matching references. However, as we show in our experiments, both models still suffer from domain generalisation and overfitting of their corresponding training data similar to the no-reference models.

NOMAD vs. SCOREQNOMAD is trained by minimising the contrastive loss in a regression fashion, using the Neurogram Similarity Index Measure (NSIM)  as a proxy for quality. SCOREQ shares the same principle as NOMAD but enhances both training efficiency and performance. A significant drawback of NOMAD is the offline preparation of triplets, which is inefficient because not all triplets are contrasted with each other, leading to suboptimal results. Additionally, offline triplet requires defining _hard_ and _easy_ triplets either by measuring the embedded distance at each epoch or by using labels. NOMAD employs the latter method, using the NSIM space to establish harder triplets. However, the NSIM does not always align with human perception. In this paper, we replicate the NOMAD approach using MOS and demonstrate that it leads to suboptimal results, particularly in out-of-domain evaluations. To address this issue, SCOREQ is trained by learning all valid triplet combinations within the batch and removing the easy triplets. One more issue is that, because NSIM is a relative similarity criterion unlike MOS, triplets are composed only of the same clean reference. This approach is not optimal for learning a quality manifold where data are ordered based on quality, regardless of speech content. Therefore, we replace NSIM with MOS, allowing us to compare any combination of speech samples. Our proposed adapted triplet loss resolves all these issues simultaneously, yielding better results without NOMAD's overhead of preparing triplets offline. While NOMAD does not require human labels such as MOS for training, we use MOS labels to demonstrate that the SCOREQ loss improves generalisation performance and robustness over the L2 loss when MOS labels are available. Unlike NOMAD which targets unsupervised quality prediction, our objective is to present a supervised quality metric as well as to show how the SCOREQ loss improves generalisation and robustness.

Contrastive LearningContrastive learning is a widely adopted technique across various fields, such as computer vision, natural language processing, and audio processing, for self-supervised representation learning [7; 58; 32; 34]. In the speech domain, general-purpose speech representation models based on contrastive learning have emerged to tackle tasks like speech recognition and speaker classification with minimal supervision [2; 44; 42; 45; 24; 9]. This technique is typically framed as a classification task, where categorical labels are defined. Contrastive learning has also been applied to quality prediction, though it remains within a classification framework. For example, in CDPAM, content and acoustic representations are disentangled . Beyond representation learning, some studies have employed contrastive learning for supervised classification tasks. SupCon  demonstrates contrastive learning for image classification, proving more robust than the cross-entropy loss in various scenarios [26; 35; 65].

However, there has been less focus on using contrastive learning for regression tasks. Unlike classification, contrastive regression approaches are primarily supervised, using label distance to determine feature similarity [67; 12; 61]. Rank-and-Contrast (RnC)  is a supervised contrastive learning framework designed for regression problems. Although it is supervised, RnC uses label distance as a pre-training step for feature extraction. Their work suggests that speech quality prediction could benefit from such a representation, given the continuous nature of MOS. Research has shown that contrastive learning pre-training often outperforms end-to-end supervised learning across several domains  and is more robust to data corruptions , making it a suitable approach for addressing domain mismatch issues . Our SCOREQ loss contributes not only to the speech quality domain but also to the relatively unexplored area of contrastive learning for regression.

## 3 Contrastive Regression for MOS prediction

We consider a training dataset \(=\{_{i},y_{i}\}\) where \(_{i}\) are raw representations of the \(i\)-th speech sample and \(y_{i}\) is the corresponding MOS label such that a distance \(r(_{j},_{k})=|y_{j}-y_{k}|\) can be defined between any two samples in the set \(\).

Let us consider an encoder \(g:\), that maps raw audio \(\) to representations \(\) and a projection head \(f:\) that reduces the representations to a low-dimensional embedding space. Given 3 random speech files defined as anchor \(_{a}\), positive \(_{p}\), and negative \(_{n}\) our goal is to learn a continuous-aware feature space where the distance between embeddings \(D\) is ordered based on the similarity criteria \(r(_{j},_{k})\):

\[r(_{a},_{p})<r(_{a},_{n}) D(f(g(_{a })),f(g(_{p})))<D(f(g(_{a})),f(g(_{n})))\] (1)

Since we define the similarity criteria \(r(,)\) as the MOS distance, equation 1 becomes:

\[|y_{a}-y_{p}|<|y_{a}-y_{n}| D(f(g(_{a})),f(g(_{p})))<D (f(g(_{a})),f(g(_{n})))\] (2)

Triplet Loss for RegressionTo induce the defined order in the embedded space \(\), we propose a triplet loss inspired by the classification framework but adapted for regression. Given a training batch of size \(N\), the classification triplet loss is defined as :

\[_{i}^{N}0,||f(g(_{a}^{i}))-f(g(_{p}^{i}))||_{2}^{2 }-||f(g(_{a}^{i}))-f(g(_{n}^{i}))||_{2}^{2}+m\] (3)

The objective of this loss function is to maximise the similarity in the embedded space between the positive sample \(_{p}\) and the anchor \(_{a}\), while minimising the similarity between the negative sample \(_{n}\) and the anchor. The margin \(m\) is a constant that defines the distance threshold between the anchor and the negative sample, beyond which training stops. The classification triplet loss requires categorical labels such that \(y^{a}=y^{p}\) and \(y^{a} y^{n}\). However, the triplet loss can be adapted for regression by considering that the concept of closeness is relative in regression problems. For example, if the MOS of the anchor is 2.0, this should be closer to MOS 1.5 (positive) than to MOS 3.0 (negative). This concept has been successfully applied by the NOMAD speech quality metric  and by the RnC framework with a different contrastive loss function . Nonetheless, as discussed earlier, NOMAD does not leverage the triplet loss efficiently.

Batch All Strategy for RegressionThe SCOREQ loss adapts the batch-all (BA) strategy used in [13; 18] for regression. To achieve this, we compute masks for each batch using the available MOS labels, assuming that every sample can serve as an anchor with potential valid triplets. The masks are generated with the understanding that in regression problems, the concept of closeness is relative, unlike the absolute nature of classification settings. After finding the valid triplets, we also remove the easy triplets i.e., the ones where the positive is closer to the anchor than the negative in the embedding space.

Given a training batch of size \(N\), for every possible distinct triplet combination in the batch \((i,j,k)\), we compute a 3D mask \((i,j,k)\) such that:\[(i,j,k)=1,&(|y_{i}-y_{j}|<|y_{i}-y_{k}|)(i  j k)\\ 0,&\] (4)

The SCOREQ loss for one batch is defined as:

\[=_{i=1}^{N}_{j=1}^{N}_{k=1}^{N}(i,j,k)(|| f(g(_{i}))-f(g(_{j}))||_{2}-||f(g(_{i}))-f(g(_{k}))||_{2}+m)\] (5)

By multiplying by the mask \((i,j,k)\), we ensure that only triplets where the MOS distance between the anchor and the positive is smaller than the MOS distance between the anchor and the negative are used. Figure 2 illustrates an example of the SCOREQ loss function using a batch size of 3. This approach enables the model to compare every possible triplet in the batch in a relative manner, reflecting the human capacity to judge quality by using relative anchors for sensory judgement .

Figure 3: Example of how the mask \(M(i,j,k)\) assigns 0 or 1. If the distance between the anchor and positive is lower than the distance between anchor and negative we consider it as a valid triplet. The inequality condition must also be verified i.e., \(i j k\)

Figure 2: Example of the SCOREQ loss using 3 samples in a training batch with corresponding MOS labels 4.5, 2.0, and 1.5. The distance matrix entries are defined as \(D_{i,j,k}=||f(g(_{i}))-f(g(_{j}))||_{2}<||f(g(_{i}))-f(g( _{k}))||_{2}\). The intuition behind this contrastive loss for regression is shown in how the negative embeddings change in the anchor sample 1 where MOS is 4.5. We observe that the negative (sample 3 with MOS 1.5 ) will be further from the anchor with respect to sample 2. Indeed, because of the anchor 2 loss (where MOS is 2.0), sample 3 embeddings are pushed towards sample 2.

The SCOREQ loss allows for training quality assessment models by sampling random data in the batch and fully utilising fast broadcasting computations. Figure 3 shows examples of valid and invalid triplets, indicating that the validity of training on a specific triplet combination depends on the relative distances concerning the anchor. The mask \((i,j,k)\) ensures that the training process ignores the invalid triplets.

Adaptive MarginSince we are addressing a regression problem, using a fixed margin \(m\) is not optimal. In classification problems, the margin is typically set to a constant to ensure that training stops once the distance in the embedding space between the anchor and the negative exceeds \(m\). However, given our continuous label space, we can leverage the labels to model an adaptive triplet loss. An adaptive margin for the triplet loss was initially proposed in Ha and Blanz . In our paper, we explore combining the adaptive margin from  with our batch all strategy loss for regression. Our experiments demonstrate that the significant performance improvement stems primarily from adopting the batch-all strategy over the offline triplet sampling used in NOMAD. The additional benefit of using an adaptive margin compared to a constant margin is minimal.

The idea behind the adaptive triplet loss is to replace the fixed margin \(m\) with a margin based on the MOS distance, as follows:

\[=_{i=1}^{N}_{j=1}^{N}_{k=1}^ {N}(i,j,k)(||f(g(_{i}))-f(g(_{j}))||_{2}-||f(g( {x}_{i}))-f(g(_{k}))||_{2}+\\ (|y_{i}-y_{j}|-|y_{i}-y_{k}|)/(N-1))\] (6)

The adaptive margin is divided by \(N-1\) to normalise it within the range . The adaptive margin allows training to continue based on the MOS distance. This indicates that training will only stop if the distance between the negative sample and the anchor exceeds at least the normalised MOS distance. This is confirmed by computing the gradient (Appendix J).

SCOREQ TrainingThe SCOREQ model has the flexibility to be used in non-reference (NR) mode to predict interpretable MOS ratings and in non-matching reference (NMR) mode to predict

Figure 4: SCOREQ modes. No-Reference (NR) mode is trained in 2 steps. We first pre-train the encoder \(g()\) with the SCOREQ loss. Next, we learn a linear layer (MOS head) that predicts an interpretable numerical MOS.

a distance from unpaired clean speech. The latter has the advantage of being used as a perceptual training loss [51; 40] since SCOREQ is differentiable. For both approaches, we train an encoder \(g:\) that extracts representations \(h_{i}=g(_{i})\) and a projection head (embedding layer) that maps the representations to the space where the SCOREQ loss is applied: \(f:\) producing \(d\)-dimensional embeddings \(z_{i}=f(_{i})\). For the NMR mode, we do not do further training. When evaluating we take random clean speech and measure the distance in the embedding space as done in NOMAD  as follows: \(D(_{test},_{nmr})=||f(g(_{test}))-f(g(_{nmr}))||_{2}\) where \(_{test}\) is the degraded signal we want to predict quality for, \(_{nmr}\) is a non-matching reference clean speech. For the NR-mode we freeze the encoder \(g()\) trained with SCOREQ and we train a linear layer that maps the embeddings \(_{i}\) to MOS using the L2 loss. Since the encoder is frozen, the L2 loss does not affect the learned representation \(_{i}\) which only depends on the SCOREQ loss. Our NR-mode model is compared with the L2 loss baseline which trains directly the same encoder \(g()\) using the L2 loss. In the baseline, the learned feature representation \(_{i}\) depends only on the L2 loss minimisation. Notice that in the SCOREQ NR mode, we remove the projection head \(f()\) as done in other pre-trained contrastive learning approaches [40; 7]. This also makes sure that the L2 loss baseline architecture is the same as the NR mode SCOREQ architecture.

ArchitectureWe train the SCOREQ loss models with 2 architectures. The first is based on finetuning wav2vec 2.0 (w2v) _BASE_ model as done in NOMAD. The other architecture (w2vlight) is a smaller version of w2v where the transformer network is reduced from 12 to 4 layers and trained from scratch. We evaluate w2vlight to study whether without using the pre-trained transformer and a less powerful architecture we obtain the same effect with SCOREQ. More details in Appendix G. Similar to NOMAD, for SCOREQ the encoder output \(g(_{i})\) is the average of the last transformer layer along the time dimension. The embedding layer \(f()\) is a small network consisting of a ReLU followed by a fully connected layer projecting the encoder representations to a 256-dimensional feature vector. In all experiments, we only finetune the transformer of w2v, leaving the CNN frozen as done in other studies . The best model is found with early stopping on a validation set. More details are in Appendix H.

## 4 Generalisation of Speech Quality Metrics

In this section, we demonstrate that certain no-reference speech quality models do not generalise well. Table 1 lists the metrics and their corresponding training sets used in our experiments. For each quality metric, we compare in-domain (IN), out-of-distribution (ODS), and out-of-domain (ODM) performances. We define ODS as test sets that are within the same domain as the training set but exhibit a distribution shift. For example, with simulated telephone degradations, a set consisting of real phone calls or a subset of degradations is out-of-distribution but within the same training domain. Similarly, a set in another language with the same degradations is considered a distribution shift but remains within the same domain. In contrast, we label test sets designed for other application domains as ODM. For example, speech synthesis is ODM with respect to telephone speech training data. Detailed information about training and test sets used is provided in the Appendix D and E respectively. We selected three domains for our experiments: (i) We train the NISQA metric on the NISQA TRAIN SIM dataset  that includes simulated degradations to telephone speech; (2) The no-reference (NR) versions of PESQ and SI-SDR provided in _TorchAudio-Squim_ that are trained on deep learning-based speech enhancement artifacts and noisy speech; (3) NORESQA-MOS  which was trained on the train partition of the VoiceMOS challenge dataset  that includes text-to-speech and voice conversion speech. We use the version provided in _TorchAudio-Squim_.

### Performance Evaluation

In Table 2 and Figure 5, we report the results on the test datasets using the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PC) to measure the linear relationship between predictions and MOS ground truth. Notice

Table 1: Metrics and corresponding training datasetsthat each test set is ODS or ODM relative to the training set domains D1 (simulated telephone speech), D2 (deep learning-based speech enhancement), and D3 (speech synthesis). We also include one of our SCOREQ loss models in no-reference (NR-SCOREQ) mode. Our proposed method is outlined in the below sections. It is included in Table 2 to show the improvement over ODM and ODS domains.

Comprehensive results, including Spearman's rank correlation (SC) and root mean squared error (RMSE) are similar to PC performance (Appendix L). Our results confirm the hypothesis that speech quality metrics show difficulties in reaching satisfactory results in new domains (ODM) or even within the same domain but with a distribution shift (ODS).

## 5 Experiments

Experiments were conducted to compare L2 loss training against SCOREQ loss and evaluate performance across three scenarios: IN, ODS, and ODM. We assessed two domains: telephone speech degradations using the NISQA TRAIN SIM dataset, and speech synthesis using the VoiceMOS training partition.

### Simulated Degradations: Models

Offline ModelThis model replicates the approach used in the NOMAD speech quality metric but with MOS as a label. We prepared 46783 triplets from the NISQA TRAIN SIM dataset, which were chosen using the "hard" approach reported in the NOMAD paper that improved results. In this approach, for every sampled anchor we take the 10 most difficult triplets based on the MOS i.e., the ones where the MOS distance between anchor-positive difference and the anchor-negative difference is the shortest.

SCOREQ ModelsWe evaluate two variants: SCOREQ _Const_ and SCOREQ _Adapt_ consisting of using the SCOREQ loss with fixed margin (Eq. 5) and adaptive margin (Eq. 6) respectively.

L2 lossThe L2 loss model is the baseline and consists of finetuning the wav2vec 2.0 transformer by attaching an output layer that minimises the L2 loss between MOS targets and predictions.

NOMADWe evaluate this model since is based on a similar principle and uses the same SCOREQ architecture. The original model only comes in NMR mode. However, we train an NR mode with the same SCOREQ approach. We freeze the NOMAD model and train an output layer to map NOMAD representations to an interpretable MOS scale. This is the only NR model where step 1 is trained without using MOS since we use the NOMAD pre-trained model that is unsupervised.

### Simulated Degradations: Results

We evaluate the linearity (PC) and the average precision (RMSE) for NR metrics. For NMR metrics we still use linearity (PC) but also the Spearman's coefficient (SC) since NMR models do not predict MOS magnitude but they learn how to rank based on quality. Results for the RMSE are reported after performing a one-degree polynomial mapping between predictions and ground truth to adjust for the listening test bias in each dataset, as it is typically recommended in quality metric evaluation. NMR performance is calculated by extracting 50 random speech files from the test-clean partition of Librispeech . These are used in all the NMR models found in this paper.

Table 3 illustrates the results for IN, ODS, and ODM scenarios. We observe that both SCOREQ _Const_ and SCOREQ _Adapt_ are the best for both some ODS data and all ODM data. On average, our proposed loss contributes to improving the performance of no-reference speech quality prediction. The _Offline_ model does not perform as well as our, showing inferior results than the L2 loss. We also evaluated the _Offline_ model encoder representations in NMR mode (Appendix M), showing that it does not capture quality as well as SCOREQ. In Table 8 (Appendix) we show that the same improvement trend is confirmed with the w2vlight architecture. This suggests that our loss function can help training more compact networks without a significant performance drop. We notice that NOMAD underperforms SCOREQ but it has been trained with NSIM labels  used as a proxy for MOS quality.

### Speech Synthesis: Results

The same approach is evaluated using the VoiceMOS training sets  to examine the generalisation from speech synthesis to telephone speech degradations. We report results from NORESQA-MOS which has been trained on the same sets. Again, we compare the SCOREQ loss models against the L2 loss. We do not evaluate the _Offline_ model since it did not perform well in the simulated degradations domain. Results in Table 4 show that the SCOREQ representations improve results over the L2 loss. Also, the NMR SCOREQ models significantly improve ODM performances over NORESQA-MOS. No difference can be found for IN sets (Table 3).

### Statistical Analysis and Encoder Representation Performance

We conduct a bootstrap procedure to understand whether the SCOREQ correlation improvement observed above is due to chance. Our results show that the SCOREQ models perform significantly better than the NR L2 loss in most of the ODM and ODS sets (Appendix N). We compare the encoder representations \(g()\) in NMR mode to understand which one explains quality information the best, showing that L2 loss encoders perform significantly worse than encoders trained with SCOREQ (Appendix M).

## 6 Conclusions

This paper presents SCOREQ, a contrastive regression loss to learn continuous representations for speech quality metrics. We have demonstrated that substituting the classic L2 loss with our proposed SCOREQ loss results in consistent performance improvements across 11 datasets and 2 speech domains. The SCOREQ loss can encourage a new research direction to train speech quality metrics. By learning ordered representations that follow the continuous nature of MOS, SCOREQ improves generalisation. In addition, we made available the SCOREQ metric in both no-reference mode and non-matching reference (NMR) mode for both simulated speech degradations and speech synthesis. The NMR models have been shown to be better than other NMR metrics. They can be used as a perceptual training loss and serve better applications where the reference is available (e.g., speech codecs) or quality wants to be measured relative. Finally, we believe that the SCOREQ loss can be applied to any application where models can be trained with regression-based targets.
