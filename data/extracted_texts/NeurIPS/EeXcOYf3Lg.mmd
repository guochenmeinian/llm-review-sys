###### Abstract

This paper studies the challenging task of makeup transfer, which aims to apply diverse makeup styles precisely and naturally to a given facial image. Due to the absence of paired data, current methods typically synthesize sub-optimal pseudo ground truths to guide the model training, resulting in low makeup fidelity. Additionally, different makeup styles generally have varying effects on the person face, but existing methods struggle to deal with this diversity. To address these issues, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method via latent diffusion models. Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, freeing itself from the misguidance of imprecise pseudo-paired data. Furthermore, to accommodate a variety of makeup styles, hierarchical texture details are decomposed via a Laplacian pyramid and selectively introduced to the content representation. Finally, we design a novel Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module that dynamically adjusts the injection condition of the diffusion model, allowing the alignment errors caused by the domain gap between content and makeup representations to be corrected. Extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Our code is available at https://github.com/Snowfallingplum/SHMT.

## 1 Introduction

Recently, makeup transfer has become a popular application in social media and the virtual world. With its significant economic potential in e-commerce and entertainment, this technique is attracting widespread attention from the computer vision and artificial intelligence communities. Given a pair of source and reference face images, makeup transfer involves simultaneously focusing on the realism of the transferred result, the content preservation of the source image, and the makeup fidelity of the reference image. Although previous approaches  have made significant advances in image realism and content preservation, the challenge of achieving high-fidelity transfer of various makeup styles still remains unsolved.

The difficulties of makeup transfer mainly stem from two aspects. On the one hand, makeup transfer is essentially an unsupervised task, which means that there are no real transferred images that can be used as labeled targets for model training. To address this issue, previous methods typically synthesize a "pseudo" ground truth from each input source-reference image pair, as an alternative supervisionsignal. However, as shown in Figure 1(a), current pseudo-paired data synthesis techniques, including histogram matching [21; 29] and geometric distortion [11; 41; 36], fail to produce desirable outcomes. The reason is that histogram-matching-based methods often ignore the spatial properties of makeup styles, thus generating over-smoothed targets that lose most makeup details. And since the warping process in geometric-distortion-based methods relies solely on the shape information (e.g., facial landmarks) of input images, their pseudo targets usually contain undesired artifacts. Consequently, these sub-optimal pseudo-paired data will inevitably misguide the model training. This eventually results in the fact that most existing methods [21; 17; 24; 7; 41; 36; 47] generally exhibit low makeup fidelity, especially for those images with complex makeup details.

On the other hand, the diversity of different makeup styles can also lead to ambiguity in preserving source contents. In practice, makeup styles can range from natural, barely-there looks to elaborate and dramatic ones, each having a different impact on the person face. As shown in Figure 1(b), the content details of a source face (e.g., freckles and eyelashes) usually should be preserved in a simple makeup style, while they may be obscured in some complex ones due to the heavy use of cosmetics. An ideal model should be flexible enough to preserve or discard those source content details according to user preferences. However, all the previous approaches overlook this requirement.

To address the aforementioned dilemmas, we propose a novel Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method, which is built on the recent latent diffusion models . For the first problem, considering the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, we develop a self-supervised learning strategy following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm. Specifically, given a face image, SHMT first extracts its content and makeup representations, and then simulates the makeup transfer procedure by reconstructing the original input from these decoupled information. In SHMT, the content representation of a face image includes its 3D shape and texture details, while the associated makeup representation is captured by destroying the content information from the input image through using random spatial transformations. In this way, SHMT works in a self-supervised manner, thus eliminating the misguidance of pseudo-paired data. To address the second issue, we

(a) Due to the absence of paired data, previous methods utilize histogram matching or geometric distortion to synthesize sub-optimal pseudo-paired data, which inevitably misguide the model training. (b) Some source content details should be preserved in simple makeup styles but be removed in complex ones.

introduce a Laplacian pyramid  to hierarchically decompose the texture information in input image, allowing SHMT to flexibly control the preservation or discard of these content details for various makeup styles, as illustrated in Figure 2. Additionally, we propose an Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module in conjunction with the stepwise denoising property of diffusion models. In each denoising step, IDA utilizes the intermediate result to dynamically adjust the injection condition, which will help to correct the alignment errors caused by the domain gaps between the content and makeup representations. Our main contributions can be summarized as follows:

* We propose a novel makeup transfer method, named SHMT, which employs a self-supervised learning strategy for model training, thus getting rid of the misleading pseudo-pairing data adopted by previous methods.
* A Laplacian pyramid is introduced to hierarchically characterize the texture information, enabling SHMT to flexibly process these content details for various makeup styles.
* A new Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module is proposed, which dynamically adjusts the injection condition in each denoising step, such that the alignment errors caused by the domain gaps between the content and makeup representations can be corrected.
* Extensive qualitative and quantitative results indicate that SHMT outperforms other state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods. And additionally, the ablation studies demonstrate the robustness and the generalization ability of our SHMT method.

### Makeup Transfer

Over the past decade, makeup transfer [38; 12; 19] has gained increasing attention in the field of computer vision. BeautyGAN  designs a histogram matching loss and a dual input/output GAN  to simultaneously perform makeup transfer and removal. PairedCycleGAN  trains additional style discriminators to measure the local makeup similarity between the results and reference images. BeautyGlow  decomposes the latent vectors of face images derived from the Glow  framework into makeup and nonmakeup latent vectors. To address misaligned head poses and facial expressions, PSGAN [17; 24] utilizes an attention mechanism  to adaptively deform the makeup feature maps based on source images, while SCGAN  encodes component-wise makeup regions into spatially-invariant style codes. RamGAN  and SpMT  explore local attention to eliminate potential associations between different makeup components. Considering that histogram matching discards the spatial properties of the makeup styles, FAT  and SSAT [36; 37] design a pseudo-paired data synthesis based on geometric distortion. EleGANt  proposes a more effective pseudo-paired data by assigning varying weights to above two synthesis methods for performance improvement. For complex makeup styles, LAND  leverages multiple overlapping local makeup style discriminators to focus on the high-frequency makeup details. Additionally, CPM  applies a segmentation model to predict the mask of the makeup pattern. This segmented pattern is then pasted into semantically identical locations using UV  space.

Due to the unsupervised nature of makeup transfer, most of the above methods synthesize pseudo-paired data to guide model training. In this strategy, the quality of these pseudo-paired data is critical, leading many works [3; 41; 36; 29; 47] to strive for better synthesis techniques. With the help of the unprecedented generative capabilities of both GPT-4V and Stable Diffusion, a concurrent work Stable-Makeup  produces higher quality pseudo-paired data, thereby improving the performance of makeup transfer. Unlike these methods, our approach works in a self-supervised manner and eliminates the need for cumbersome pseudo-paired data synthesis.

### Diffusion Models

Diffusion models generate realistic images through an iterative inverse denoising process. Recently, as competitors to generative adversarial networks , diffusion models have shown significant progress in numerous generative tasks, including Text-to-Image (T2I) generation [30; 33; 31], controllable editing [28; 51; 48], and subject-driven [9; 32; 5] or human-centric [22; 44; 43] synthesis. DDPM  proves the feasibility of recovering realistic images from random Gaussian noise. DDIM  enables fast and deterministic inference by transforming the sampling process into a non-Markovianprocess. To reduce computational complexity while retaining high quality and flexibility, Latent Diffusion Models (LDM)  apply diffusion model training in the latent space of powerful pretrained autoencoders. With training on large datasets, both Imagen  and Stable Diffusio  elevate T2I synthesis to an unprecedented level.

Inspired by the above approach, we delve into the makeup transfer task based on diffusion models. Compared to previous GAN-based makeup transfer methods, our approach eliminates the need for adversarial training and tedious loss function design, while delivering enhanced performance.

## 3 Our Methodology

### Preliminary

Our method is developed from Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) , which performs the diffusion process in the latent space to reduce the computational complexity of the model. In particular, LDM comprises three key components: an image encoder \(\), a decoder \(\), and an UNet denoiser \(_{}\). Firstly, the encoder \(\) compresses an image \(I\) from the pixel space to a low-dimensional latent space \(z_{0}=(I)\), while the decoder \(\) efforts to reconstruct the original image \(I\) from the latent variable \(z_{0}\) (e.g. \((z_{0})=x_{0} I\)). Then, a UNet denoiser \(_{}\) is trained to predict the applied noise in the latent space. The optimization process can be defined as the following formulation:

\[_{ldm}=_{z_{t},c,(0,1),t (1,T)}[_{}(z_{t},c,t)-_{2}],\] (1)

where \(z_{t}\) is the noisy latent variable at the timestep \(t\), \(c\) is the conditioned signal, \(\) is randomly sampled from the standard Gaussian distribution, and \(T\) is the defined maximum timestep.

During inference, \(z_{T}\) is sampled from a random Gaussian distribution. The UNet denoiser \(_{}\) then iteratively predicts the noise in the latent space at each timestep \(t\) and restores \(z_{0}\) via a sampling process (e.g. DDPM  or DDIM). Finally, \(z_{0}\) is reconstructed by the decoder \(\) to obtain the generated image. See  for more details.

### Overview

The goal of makeup transfer is to generate a new facial image that preserves the content information (e.g., background, facial structure, pose, expression) of a source image while applying the makeup style of a reference image. To achieve this, we propose SHMT, with its framework outlined in Figure

Figure 3: The framework of SHMT. A facial image \(I\) is decomposed into background area \(I_{bg}\), makeup representation \(I_{m}\), and content representation (\(I_{3d}\), \(h_{i}\)). The makeup transfer procedure is simulated by reconstructing the original image from these components. Hierarchica texture details \(h_{i}\) are constructed to respond to different makeup styles. In each denoising step \(t\), IDA draws on the noisy intermediate result \(_{t}\) to dynamically adjust the injection condition to correct alignment errors.

3. In SHMT, we craft a self-supervised strategy for model training in Section 3.3 and design an Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module to correct alignment errors in Section 3.4. The training and inference process of SHMT is presented in Section 3.5.

### Self-supervised Strategy

Following a "decoupling-and-reconstruction" paradigm, we craft a self-supervised strategy for makeup transfer. The main idea is to separate content and makeup representations from a facial image, and then reconstruct the original image from these components.

**Foreground and background segmentation.** Makeup transfer is a localized modification task confined to the facial area. As such, a pre-trained face parsing model  is used to segment the foreground and background areas from the original image \(I\). In makeup transfer, the background area \(I_{bg}\) (which includes hair and clothes) is a known component. Hence, the background area \(I_{bg}\) is input to the latent diffusion model along with the noisy image \(I_{t}\). The goal of the model is to inpaint the unknown facial area, using subsequent content and makeup representations as conditions.

**Makeup Representation.** In our approach, the makeup representation is derived by destroying the image's content information. Specifically, we apply a sequence of spatial transformations to the foreground image \(I_{fg}\). These transformations include random cropping, rotation, and elastic distortion to create variation. As illustrated in Figure 3, the distorted foreground image \(I_{m}\), while losing the majority of the content information, retains the makeup information well. In addition, these transformations effectively mimic semantic misalignment scenarios and facilitate the robustness of the model to poses and expressions [17; 7].

**Content Representation.** Inspired by physical face modeling [12; 19; 20], the content representation of a face is simplified into two main components: face shape and texture details.

_Face Shape_: The face shape, which determines the facial structure, head pose, and expression, is a crucial component to preserve during makeup transfer. In this context, a typical 3D face reconstruction model, known as 3DDFA-V2 , is employed to extract the face shape \(I_{3d}\) from the original image \(I\). To match the resolution of the latent space of LDM, we perform a pixel unshuffle operation  to downsample \(I_{3d}\).

_Texture Details_: Texture details are incorporated to complement the excessively smooth face shape. Considering the ambiguity of texture detail preservation, the Laplace pyramid  is introduced to build _hierarchical texture details_. To prevent color disturbances, the foreground image \(I_{fg}\) is first converted to a grayscale image \(_{fg}\) of \(h w\) pixels. Then we downsample it by applying a fixed Gaussian kernel to produce a low-pass prediction \(l_{1}^{}\). The high-frequency component \(h_{0}\), which is treated as texture details, can be calculated as \(h_{0}=_{fg}-_{1}\), where \(_{1}\) is upsampled from \(l_{1}\). By replacing \(_{fg}\) with \(l_{1}\) and repeating these operations, we obtain a series of hierarchical texture details \([h_{0},h_{1},,h_{L}]\), where \(L\) refers to the decomposition level of the Laplace pyramid. These texture details, whose resolution gradually halves and ranges from fine to coarse, are illustrated in Figure 3. If the resolution of the texture details exceeds that of the latent space, we downsample it using a pixel unshuffle operation . Otherwise, the bilinear interpolation is used for upsampling.

Note that only one texture detail \(h_{i}\) is concatenated to the face shape \(I_{3d}\) as a complete content representation. When \(h_{i}\) is a fine texture detail, our model only needs to distill the low-frequency makeup information from the makeup representation to reconstruct the image. This is suitable for simple makeup styles. When \(h_{i}\) is a coarse texture detail, our model must also distill the high-frequency makeup information from the makeup representation to ensure the recovery of the image. This is suitable for complex makeup styles.

### Iterative Dual Alignment

To reconstruct the original image, spatial attention  is utilized to semantically align distorted makeup representation with content representation. At each timestep, we constructs a pixel-wise correlation matrix \(M\) by calculating the cosine similarity as:

\[M(i,j)=(i)^{T}f_{m}(j)}{\|f_{c}(i)\|_{2}\|f_{m}(j)\|_{2}},\] (2)where \(f_{c}=E_{c}(I_{3d},h_{i})\), \(f_{m}=E_{m}((I_{m}))\) denote the semantic features extracted by encoders \(E_{c}\) and \(E_{m}\). \(f(i)\) represents the feature vector of the \(i\)-th pixel in \(f\) and \(M(i,j)\) indicates the element at the \((i,j)\)-th location of \(M\). We consider the correlation matrix \(M\) as a deformation mapping function, and use it to spatially deform the feature maps \(z_{m}=(I_{m})\) of makeup representations:

\[z_{m}^{{}^{}}=_{j}Softmax(M(i,j)/) z_{m},\] (3)

where \(Softmax()\) denotes a softmax computation along the column dimension, which normalizes the element values in each row of \(M,\) and \(>0\) is a temperature parameter. Theoretically, the deformed feature maps \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\) is semantically aligned with the content representation. However, due to the domain gap between content and makeup representations, we find that alignment errors occur frequently in \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\). Considering the property that noisy intermediate result \(I_{t}\) is gradually moving closer to the real image domain (e.g., the makeup representation domain), we propose a Iterative Dual Alignment (IDA) module to address the above issue. At each timestep, it calculates an extra alignment prediction \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\) between the noisy intermediate result \(_{t}\) and makeup representation \(I_{m}\) to dynamically correct the previous alignment prediction \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\). \(_{t}\) is the result of \(I_{t}\) removing the background area. Since the noise degree of \(_{t}\) is determined by timestep \(t\), a MLP module predicts the percentage \(w\) of two alignment predictions from timestep \(t\):

\[_{m}=(1-w)z_{m}^{{}^{}}+wz_{m}^{{}^{}},\] (4)

where \(w=(t)\) and the MLP module consists of two fully connected layers and ends with a Sigmoid activation layer. Finally, the mixed prediction \(_{m}\) is concatenated with the content representation and injected into the denoiser's encoder through a projection module consisting of \(1 1\) convolution. In addition to correct alignment errors, IDA has two other advantages. First, because \(_{m}\) is semantically aligned with the content representation, IDA can control the makeup style in a spatially-aware manner. Corresponding results are displayed in the supplementary material. Second, IDA is relatively lightweight, with only approximately 11M parameters.

### Training and Inference

During training, the parameters of the pre-trained autoencoder are fixed, the U-net denoiser \(_{}\) and IDA module are jointly optimized from scratch under the original objective function in Equation 1. At inference, the model receives the background area \(I_{bg}\) and content representation (\(I_{3d}\) and \(h_{i}\)) from the source image, as well as the undeformed makeup representation \(I_{m}\) from the reference image, to generate the makeup transfer result.

## 4 Experiments

### Experimental settings

**Datasets.** Following [21; 17], we randomly select 90% of the images from the MT dataset  as training samples and the rest as test samples. In addition, Wild-MT  and LADN  datasets are also used to validate the performance and generalization capability of our model. The images in the Wild-MT dataset contain large pose and expression variations, and the LADN dataset collects a number of images with complex makeup styles.

**Implementation Details.** In our experiments, we discover that the autoencoder with a downsampling factor of 4 preserves texture details better than the one with a factor of 8. Therefore, the autoencoder with a downsampling factor of 4 is selected, and the SHMT model is trained at a resolution of 256 \(\) 256. The specific structure of the UNet denoiser \(_{}\) remains the same as the LDM , with IDA module replacing the original conditional injection module. In Equation 3, \(\) is set to 100. We train the model with Adam optimizer, learning rate of 1e-6 and batch size of 16 on a single A100 GPU. Our model is trained for 250, 000 steps in about 5 days. For sampling, we utilize 50 steps of the DDIM sampler .

**Evaluation Metrics.** In order to comprehensively and objectively compare the different methods, we choose three evaluation metrics, _FID_, _CLS_ and _Key-sim_. Following , _FID_ is calculated between reference images and transferred results to indicate _image realism_. The lower the _FID_, the better. Recently, the work  proves that the _CLS_ token and the self-similarity of keys (abbreviated as _Key-sim_) in DINO's  feature space can represent the appearance and structure of an image, respectively. Inspired by this, we compute the cosine similarity of the _CLS_ token between reference images and transferred results to represent the _makeup fidelity_, and the cosine similarity of _Key-sim_ between source images and transferred results to reflect the _content preservation_. The higher the _CLS_ and _Key-sim_, the better.

**Baselines.** We choose seven state-of-the-art makeup transfer methods as baselines, including PSAGN , SCGAN , EleGANt , SSAT , LADN , CPM and Stable-Makeup. Among them, only Stable-Makeup is a diffusion-model-based method, while the others are GAN-based methods. And LADN, CPM and Stable-Makeup focus on complex makeup styles. In our experiments, the baseline results are derived from official publicly available code or pre-trained models.

### Comparisons

**Qualitative Results.** The qualitative comparison with different GAN-based methods for simple and complex makeup styles are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, respectively. Although PSGAN, SCGAN, EleGANt, and SSAT preserve the content of the source image well, they have low fidelity for reference makeup, especially in complex makeup styles. In addition, they have a tendency to modify

Figure 5: Qualitative comparison with GAN-based baselines on complex makeup styles.

the background color, e.g., the second and fourth rows of Figure 5. LADN's results are accompanied by a large number of artifacts and content distortions. CPM performs relatively satisfactorily in complex makeup, but still fails to reproduce some high-frequency makeup details. Due to the UV space not including the forehead area, the CPM has a noticeable sense of pasting, and there are some artifacts along the facial contour. The results of diffusion-model-based methods are shown in Figure 6 and Figure 7. For simple makeup styles, the results of Stable-Makeup show a noticeable color shift when compared to the reference makeup styles. In addition, these results tend to alter the content information of the source image, including identity and expression. For complex makeup styles, the results of Stable-Makeup still show a significant loss of high-frequency makeup details. In contrast, our SHMT method can naturally and accurately reproduce various makeup styles on the source face by equipping it with different texture details.

**Quantitative Results.** In our experiments, we randomly selected 1000 source-reference image pairs from the test set of each dataset to calculate each evaluation metric. The quantitative results of the different methods are listed in Table 1. SHMT-\(h_{0}\) equipped with fine texture details \(h_{0}\) obtains the highest value on _Key-sim_, indicating better content preservation. SHMT-\(h_{4}\) equipped with coarse texture details \(h_{4}\) achieves the highest values on _FID_, _CLS_, suggesting greater image realism and makeup fidelity. This also demonstrates that there is a tradeoff between content preservation and makeup fidelity in the makeup transfer task.

**User Study**. We also perform a user study to evaluate the performance of different models. We randomly select 50 pairs of images with different types of makeup styles and generate the transferred

Figure 6: Qualitative comparison with the Stable-Makeup baseline on simple makeup styles.

Figure 7: Qualitative comparison with the Stable-Makeup baseline on complex makeup styles.

results using different methods. Then, 8 participants are asked to choose the most satisfactory result, considering image realism, content preservation, and makeup fidelity. To ensure a fair comparison, the transferred results are displayed simultaneously in a random order. The results of the user study are shown in Table 2.

### Ablation Study

**The effectiveness of hierarchical texture details.** Figure 8 (a) illustrates the visual comparison of SHMT with varying texture details in handling both simple and complex makeup styles. SHMT-\(h_{0}\) tends to preserve high-frequency details of the source image, such as subtle expressions, single and double eyelids, eyelashes, and freckles. It is more suitable for simple makeup transfer. On the other hand, SHMT-\(h_{4}\) is more likely to transfer the high-frequency details from the reference image, making it more appropriate for complex makeup transfer. By staggering the timestep and employing a different model to predict the noise, i.e., using SHMT-\(h_{0}\) for [T,t] and SHMT-\(h_{4}\) for (t,0), we can easily achieve a seamless interpolation between the two results.

**The effectiveness of IDA.** To verify the effectiveness of IDA, we remove the additional alignment prediction \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\) and replace \(_{m}\) with \(z_{m}^{{}^{}}\) as an injection condition for the denoiser. We retrain the SHMT-\(h_{4}\) model, and the alignment visualizations and transferred results are shown in Figure 8 (b). As seen, the proposed IDA module effectively corrects alignment errors and enhances makeup fidelity. The quantitative results are displayed in Table 3. In Figure 8 (c), the trend of percentage \(w\) over time is investigated. As timestep \(t\) becomes smaller, the domain gap between the noisy intermediate result \(_{t}\) and makeup representation \(I_{m}\) gets smaller, and \(w\) increases indicating that the model favors more the alignment prediction of these two. In addition, \(w\) of SHMT-\(h_{4}\) is significantly higher than that of SHMT-\(h_{0}\) at each timestep \(t\), which we attribute to the fact that transfering high-frequency texture details requires more precision in semantic alignment.

**Robustness and Generalization.** Further, as shown in Figure 9 (a), calculating the semantic alignment between the source and reference images makes our model insensitive to age, gender, pose and expression variations. To evaluate the generalization ability, we collect some sketch and anime examples which have a significant domain gap with the training samples and have never been encountered by the model before. The results are displayed in Figure 9 (b).

### Limitations

The limitations of our method can be summarized in two aspects. First, our proposed model relies on the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models (face parsing and 3D reconstruction), and the stability of our model suffers when their output is inaccurate. More results and discussion are provided in the supplementary material. Second, compared to previous GAN-based approaches, our model has more parameters and requires more computational resources during inference, taking several seconds to generate an image. Recent accelerated sampling techniques [25; 53; 23] may be able to alleviate this limitation to some extent.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we propose a Self-supervised Hierarchical Makeup Transfer (SHMT) method. It employs a self-supervised strategy for model training, freeing itself from the misguidance of pseudo-paired data employed by previous methods. Benefiting from hierarchical texture details, SHMT can flexibly control the preservation or discarding of texture details, making it adaptable to various makeup styles. In addition, the proposed IDA module is capable of effectively correcting alignment errors and thus enhancing makeup fidelity. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses have demonstrated the effectiveness of our SHMT method.
