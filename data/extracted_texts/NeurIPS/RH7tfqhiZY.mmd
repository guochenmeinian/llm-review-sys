###### Abstract

3D generation guided by text-to-image diffusion models enables the creation of visually compelling assets. However previous methods explore generation based on image or text. The boundaries of creativity are limited by what can be expressed through words or the images that can be sourced. We present YouDream, a method to generate high-quality anatomically controllable animals. YouDream is guided using a text-to-image diffusion model controlled by 2D views of a 3D pose prior. Our method is capable of generating novel imaginary animals that previous text-to-3D generative methods are unable to create. Additionally, our method can preserve anatomic consistency in the generated animals, an area where prior approaches often struggle. Moreover, we design a fully automated pipeline for generating commonly observed animals. To circumvent the need for human intervention to create a 3D pose, we propose a multi-agent LLM that adapts poses from a limited library of animal 3D poses to represent the desired animal. A user study conducted on the outcomes of YouDream demonstrates the preference of the animal models generated by our method over others. Visualizations and code are available at https://youdream3d.github.io/.

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-3D generative modeling using diffusion models has seen fast-paced growth recently with methods utilizing text-to-image (T2I) Poole et al. (2022); Chen et al. (2023); Zhu et al. (2023); Seo et al. (2023), (text+camera)-to-image (TC2I) Shi et al. (2023); Li et al. (2023) and (image+camera)-to-image (IC2I) Liu et al. (2023); Wang and Shi (2023); Ye et al. (2023) diffusion models. These methods are widely accepted by AI enthusiasts, content creators, and 3D artists to create high-quality 3D content. However, generating 3D assets using such methods is dependent on what can be expressed through text or the availability of an image faithful to the user's imagination. In this work, we provide more control to the artist to bring their creative imagination to life. YouDream can generate high-quality 3D animals based on any 3D skeleton, by utilizing a 2D pose-controlled diffusion model which generates images adhering to 2D views of a 3D pose. Using depth, edge, and scribble has also been explored for controllable image generation Zhang et al. (2023). However, in a 3D context, pose offers both 3D consistency as well as room for creativity. Other controls are restrictive as edge/depth/boundary of 2D views of a pre-existing object is used to provide control, thus limiting the generated shape to be very similar to the existing asset. We show that the multi-view consistency offered by our 3D pose prior results in the generation of anatomically and geometrically consistent animals. Creating 3D pose control also requires minimal human effort. To further alleviate this effort, we also present a multi-agent LLM setup that generates 3D poses for novel animals commonly observed in nature.

We show that these creatures cannot be generated faithfully only based on text. Each row depicts a 3D animal generated by HiFA, MVDream, and YouTube(left to right) using the prompt mentioned below the row. We present 3D pose controls used to create these in the Sec. F (results best viewed zoomed in).**

3D generation guided by T2I models involves using the gradient computed by Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) Poole et al. (2022) to optimize a 3D representation such as a NeRF Mildenhall et al. (2021). During any intermediate step of the training, a rendered image captured by a random camera is added to Gaussian noise and passed to a T2I diffusion model, along with a directional prompt. The diffusion model estimates the added noise, which in turn is used to create a denoised image. In effect, this process pushes the rendered image of the NeRF representation slightly closer to the denoised image during each iteration. Thus, any unwanted semantic or perceptual issues arising in the denoised image are also transferred to the NeRF. This is especially problematic for deformable objects such as animals, where variations in pose over views often results in the Janus-head problem, dehydrated assets, and geometric and anatomical inconsistencies.

TC2I diffusion models, which encode camera parameters and train using 3D objects from various views learn multi-view consistency and thus are able to produce better geometries. However, they lack in diversity owing to the limited variation in training data, as compared to text-to-image models. Along with this, methods using IC2I diffusion models also face the problems arising from Novel View Synthesis (NVS), which requires hallucination of unseen regions along with accurate geometric transformation of observed parts. While these camera guided diffusion models perform better than T2I models in many cases, their limited diversity and lack of control limit the creativity of their users. By utilizing a 3D pose prior, YouDream consistently outperforms previous methods that use T2I diffusion models, in terms of generating biologically plausible animals. Despite not being trained on any 3D data, our method also outperforms the 3D-aware TC2I diffusion model MVDream Shi et al. (2023) in text-to-3D animal generation in terms of "Naturalness", "Text-Image Alignment" and CLIP score (see Sec. 4).

3D-consistency for human avatar creation has been explored extensively in recent works Cao et al. (2023); Huang et al. (2024); Kolotouros et al. (2024); Hong et al. (2022); Zhang et al. (2024, 2022). These models rely on a 3D human pose and shape prior, usually the SMPL Loper et al. (2023) or SMPL-X Pavlakos et al. (2019) model. This strategy can represent a variety of geometrically consistent human avatars. However, representing the animal kingdom is challenging owing to its immense diversity which cannot be represented using any existing parametric models. Sizes and shapes vary considerably across birds, reptiles, mammals, and amphibians, hence until now, no single shape or pose prior exists that can represent all tetrapods. Parametric models such as SMAL Zuffi et al. (2017) and MagicPony Wu et al. (2023) suffer from severe diversity issues, and hence cannot be used as pose or shape prior. Thus to circumvent human effort in generating a 3D pose prior for animals prevalent in nature, we present a method for automatic generation of diverse 3D poses using a multi-agent LLM supported by a small library of animal 3D poses. Additionally, we present a method to automatically generate an initial shape based on a 3D pose, which is utilized for NeRF initialization.

In summary, YouDream offers the following key contributions:

* a TetraPose ControlNet, trained on tetrapod animals across various families, that enables the generation of diverse animals at test time, both real and unreal.
* a multi-agent LLM that can generate the 3D pose of any desired animal in a described state, supported by a small library of 16 predefined animal 3D poses for reference.
* a user-friendly tool to create/modify 3D poses for unreal creatures. The same tool automatically generates an initial shape based on the 3D skeleton.
* a pipeline to generate geometrically and anatomically consistent animals based on an input text by adhering to a 3D pose prior.

## 2 Related Work

The field of **3D animal generation** has rapidly advanced due to studies that offer methods and insights for modeling animal structures and movements in 3D. SMAL Zuffi et al. (2017) introduced a method to fit a parametric 3D shape model, derived from 3D scans, to animal images using 2D keypoints and segmentation masks, with extensions to multi-view images Zuffi et al. (2018). The variety of animals able to be represented by SMAL is severely limited. Subsequent efforts, such as LASSIE Yao et al. (2022, 2023, 2024), have focused on deriving 3D shapes directly from smaller image collections by identifying self-supervised semantic correspondences to discover 3D parts. Succeeding work represent animals using a parametric model Jakab et al. (2023); Wu et al. (2023a,b); Li et al. (2024) learnt from images or videos. Despite these advances, these methods are class-specific and lack in the diversity of animals that can be represented. YouDreamis able to generate a great variety of animals including those that have not been observed previously with higher details (Fig. 16).

High quality **text-to-3D asset generation** has been fueled by the availability of large-scale diverse datasets of text-image pairs and the success of text-to-image contrastive and generative models trained on them. Contrastive methods such as CLIP Radford et al. (2021) and ALIGN Jia et al. (2021) learn a common embedding between visual and natural language domains. Generative methods like Imagen Saharia et al. (2022) and Stable Diffusion Bombach et al. (2022) utilize a diffusion model to learn to generate images given text latents. These methods inherently learn to understand the appearance of entities across various views and poses. Text-to-3D generative modeling methods Mohammad Khalid et al. (2022); Jain et al. (2022); Wang et al. (2023); Poole et al. (2022) exploit this information by using these text-image models to guide the creation of 3D representations by NeRFs Mildenhall et al. (2021). The quality of 3D assets produced by these early methods suffer from several issues such as smooth geometries, saturated appearances, as well as geometric issues such as the Janus (multi-head) problem. Subsequent recent methods have ameliorated these problems by the use of modified loss functions Wang et al. (2024); Zhu et al. (2023), using Deep Marching Tetrahedra Shen et al. (2021) for 3D representation Chen et al. (2023a), and modified negative prompt weighing strategies Armandpour et al. (2023). However these methods still fail to produce anatomically correct animals, often producing implausible geometries or even extra or insufficient limbs. Prior work 3DFuse Seo et al. (2023) uses sparse point clouds predicted from images as depth control for T2I diffusion, however still produces anatomically inconsistent animals due to the inaccuracy of image-to-point cloud predictors and a high dependency on the initial generated image (Fig. 4). Recently, 3D-aware diffusion models trained on paired text-3D datasets by encoding camera parameters have been used to generate 3D assets Tang et al. (2023); Shi et al. (2023). As these methods learn using various views of 3D objects, they rarely produce geometric inconsistency. However these methods are limited by the variety of 3D data available, which is quite scarce as compared to image data that T2I diffusion models have been trained on. These are trained using 3D object databases such as Objaverse Deitke et al. (2023) and Objaverse-XL Deitke et al. (2024) which are considerably smaller than text-image paired datasets such as LAION-5B Schuhmann et al. (2022) used for training T2I diffusion models. Thus, they often struggle to follow the text input faithfully in case of complex prompts (Fig. 1). By comparison, our method accurately follows the text prompt owing to the use of T2I diffusion models trained on vast image data. YouDream strictly adheres to input 3D pose priors, thus producing geometrically consistent and anatomically correct animals.

**Large Language Models (LLMs)** have been explored in the context of **3D generation and editing** previously. LLMs have been used Yin et al. (2023); Siddiqui et al. (2023) to generate and edit shapes using an embedding space trained on datasets such as ShapeNet Chang et al. (2015). Prior work have also used LLMs to generate code for 3D modeling software, such as Blender, to create objects Yuan et al. (2024) and scenes Sun et al. (2023); Hu et al. (2024). These methods produce impressive results suggesting at LLMs' 3D understanding capability, but explore limited variety of generation often limited to shapes, or generate layouts/scenes. 3D pose generation with LLMs using text as input has been recently explored for humans. ChatPose Feng et al. (2024) and MotionGPT Zhang et al. (2024) generate pose parameters for a SMPL model based on textual input. LLMs have also been previously shown to accurately reason about anatomical differences of animals Menon and Vondrick (2022); Saha et al. (2024). In this work, we show a novel application of off-the-shelf LLMs for generalized 3D pose generation based on the name of an animal supported by a library of animal 3D poses.

**User-controlled generation** has been introduced in several studies Zhang et al. (2023); Mou et al. (2024), and has gained widespread adoption among artists for crafting remarkable illustrations, including artistic QR codes to interior designs. However, the use of user control in 3D is still under-explored. Recent works such as MVControl Li et al. (2023) and Control3D Chen et al. (2023) guide the 3D generation process using a 2D condition image of a single view. By contrast, the generation process in YouDream is guided using 2D views of a 3D pose which is dependent on the sampled camera pose. This strategy not only allows YouDream to take in specialized user control but also ensures multi-view geometric consistency.

## 3 Method

Multi-view sampling from T2I diffusion models for 3D generation is guided using directional prompt extensions such as "<user_text>, front view" and "<user_text>, side view". Such a control signal is ambiguous due to, 1) directional text remaining unchanged over a range of camera parameters, 2) T2I diffusion models generating deformable entities in various poses for the same view. Thus we utilize 3D pose as a stronger guidance to maintain consistency over different views. To do this in a 3D consistent manner we design 1) a model to generate 2D image samples following the projection \(^{proj}\) of a 3D pose \(\) of an animal, 2) a method to generate the 3D pose \(\) of a novel animal \(y\) using a limited library of 3D poses (\(\)) of commonly observed animals in nature and a multi-agent LLM pose editor, and 3) a method to create 3D animals given an animal name \(y\) and 3D pose \(\). Our 3D model is represented using Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF Mildenhall et al. (2021)).

### TetraPose ControlNet

To train a model to follow pose control we require images of animals with annotated poses. Datasets released by Banik et al. (2021) and Ng et al. (2022) provide 2D pose annotations of animal images spanning a large number of species, compared to the limited diversity available in 3D animal pose datasets Xu et al. (2023); Badger et al. (2020). We thus utilize these 2D pose datasets by learning to map the 2D pose of an animal to its captured image. We define such datasets of animal species \(y_{j}\), corresponding animal images \(x_{j}\), and their 2D pose \(^{proj}_{j}\) as the set \(=\{(x_{j},^{proj}_{j},y_{j})\}_{j=1}^{J}\), where \(J=||\) is the number of image-pose pairs in the dataset. This learned mapping can then be used to generate multi-view image samples consistent with a 3D pose \(\). The mapping is represented by a ControlNet that produces animal images across mammals, amphibians, reptiles and birds following a 2D input pose condition \(^{proj}_{j}\) learned by minimizing the following objective:

\[_{ControlNet}=_{z_{0},t,y_{j},^{proj}_{j}, (0,I)}[\|-_{}(z_{t};t,y_{j},^{ proj}_{j})\|^{2}],\] (1)

where \(z_{0}=x_{j}\). The above objective aims to learn a network \(_{}\) to estimate the noise added to an input image \(z_{0}\) (or \(x_{j}\)) to form a noisy image \(z_{t}\) given time-steps \(t\), text \(y_{j}\) and pose condition \(^{proj}_{j}\). The network \(_{}\) is represented by the standard U-Net architecture of diffusion models (Stable Diffusion in this case) with a trainable copy of the U-Net's encoder attached to it using trainable zero convolution layers. We provide training details in Sec. F.

The trained TetraPose ControlNet can be used to generate pose-controlled images of tetrapods, including mammals, reptiles, birds, and amphibians. The model performs well for out-of-domain 2D pose inputs of animals not seen during training. It also performs well with inputs consisting of modified 2D poses that include extra appendages such as multiple heads, limbs, wings, and/or tails. While T2I diffusion models inherently provide a huge diversity to the generated outputs, the control module provides strong controlling signals to generate appropriate body parts in the right positions, alleviating the problem of T2I diffusion models producing inconsistent multi-view images when prompted using directional texts only.

Figure 2: **Automatic pipeline for 3D animal generation. Given the name of an animal and textual pose description, we utilize a multi-agent LLM to generate a 3D pose (\(\)) supported by a small library of animal names paired with 3D poses. With the obtained 3D pose, we train a NeRF to generate the 3D animal guided by a diffusion model controlled by 2D views (\(^{proj}\)) of \(\).**

### 3D Pose Generation aided by Multi-agent LLM

Generating a 3D pose based on a text is not trivial as text-to-pose is a many-to-many mapping. Existing 3D animal pose datasets are not diverse or vast enough to learn this mapping for a variety of animals. Thus we leverage LLMs which are pre-trained on expansive textual datasets, and thus can reason about anatomical proportions of various animals. We find that LLMs do not produce good 3D poses using only a text input, instead we use LLMs to adapt a input 3D pose to represent a novel animal. We created a limited library consisting of 16 animal 3D poses for this purpose.

Given a library of animals \(=\{(y_{i},_{i})\}_{i=1}^{n}\) consisting of 3D keypoint positions \(_{i}\) and animal names \(y_{i}\), we utilize a multi-agent LLM setup for creating a 3D pose for any desired animal \(y\) and pose description \(p\). The agents include 1) Finder (\(_{F}\)), 2) Observer (\(_{O}\)), and 3) Modifier (\(_{M}\)). Let the keypoint names representing any animal be \(\) and let the bone sequence which defines the skeleton be \(\). Given \(\), the Finder selects the animal in \(\) that is " anatomically closest" to the desired animal \(y\) as \((y_{c},_{c})=_{F}(y,,)\). "Anatomically closest" is defined as the animal whose 3D pose will require minimal modifications/updates to represent \(y\). Given the keypoint definitions \(\), bone sequence \(\), the desired animal name \(y\), the animal \(y_{c}\) selected by \(_{F}\), and the pose description \(p\), the Observer generates \(=_{O}(y_{c},y,p,,)\). \(\) represents a plan describing which keypoints of \(y_{c}\) should be adjusted along with a set of instructions for the Modifier to implement the suggested adjustments to represent the 3D pose of the desired animal \(y\) in the described pose \(p\). Based on the observations \(\), the Modifier updates the 3D positions of the keypoints, \(_{c}\), of the closest animal to \(=_{M}(_{c},)\). Thus we obtain the 3D keypoint positions \(\) of the desired animal \(y\) in the described pose \(p\). We find that this multi-agent procedure is more stable and accurate than using a single LLM for pose generation (see Sec. B). We are able to represent diverse animals observed in nature using this setup. Fig. 3 presents examples of pose editing using our described setup. As ground truth text-to-3D poses for animals do not exist and the described task is a many-to-many problem, quantitative evaluation is difficult to obtain. Thus we conducted a user study to evaluate the efficacy of our method (details in Sec. 4). We describe the contents of our library \(\) and the prompts to LLMs in detail in Sec. G and Sec. H.

### Pose Editor and Shape Initializer

To facilitate easy creation and editing of 3D poses, we present a user-friendly tool to modify, add, or delete joints and bones. We also provide a method in this tool to automatically generate an initial shape based on the 3D skeleton using simple 3D geometries such as cylinders, cones, and ellipses. We use this shape to pre-train our NeRF before fine-tuning using diffusion based guidance. Details of this tool are presented in Sec. F.

### Bringing Bones to Life

We want to create 3D animals given an input text \(y\) and 3D pose \(\). We adopt the Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) method proposed in DreamFusion Poole et al. (2022), adapted for our TetraPose ControlNet. The SDS loss gradient can now be represented as:

\[_{}_{}(,z=(g(,c)))= _{t,c,}[w(t)(_{}(z_{t};t,y(c),^{ proj}(c))-)],\] (2)

Figure 3: **Qualitative examples of pose editing using multi-agent LLM setup. For each example, the green box denotes the desired animal, while the blue box is the animal retrieved from the 3D pose library by Finder LLM (\(_{F}\)). We show the pose modification performed by the joint effort of Observer (\(_{O}\)) and Modifier (\(_{M}\)) for three instances.**where \(\) represents the trainable parameters of the NeRF, \(\) the frozen diffusion model parameters, \(c\) represents the sampled camera parameters, \(t\) is the number of time-steps, and \(w(t)\) is a timestep-dependent weighting function. \(z\) denotes the latent encoded using encoder \(\) for the image rendered from the NeRF \(g(,c)\) for camera \(c\). \(y(c)\) represents the directional text created based on camera \(c\), while \(^{proj}(c)\) is the 2D projection of the 3D pose \(\) for camera \(c\). Additionally, we also utilize an image domain loss weighted by the hyper-parameter \(_{RGB}\) which reduces flickering and produces more solid geometry (Fig.14):

\[_{RGB}=_{RGB}_{t,c,}[w(t) \|g(,c)-()\|^{2}],\] (3)

where \(g(,c)\) is the image rendered from the NeRF and \(()\) is the denoised image decoded using decoder \(\) from the denoised latent \(\).

Since our TetraPose ControlNet is trained on much smaller number of images compared to Stable Diffusion, it loses diversity. To improve diversity and generation capability, we propose to use control scheduling and guidance scheduling. We observe that higher control scale provides strong signal for geometry modeling whereas higher guidance scale provides strong signal for appearance modeling. Since geometry is perfected in the initial stages and appearance in the latter, we propose reduction of control scale and increase of guidance scale over training iterations. This helps us create out-of-domain assets with significant style variety (see Fig. 8). Our strategy is formulated as:

\[=(}{})(_{max}-_{min})+_{ min},\] (4)

\[=}{}( {guidance}_{max}-_{min})+_{min},\] (5)

where train_step is the current training step and max_step is total training iterations. The variables \(_{max}\), \(_{min}\), \(_{max}\), \(_{min}\) are hyperparameters. We show that a linear scheme is better for guidance scheduling, while cosine is better for control scheduling in Sec. B.

Figure 4: **Comparison on generating animals observed in nature.** We compare with baselines which use T2I diffusion (with official open-source code) for the automatic generation of text-to-3D animals. Unlike the baselines, our method produces high quality anatomically consistent animals.

Experiments

In this section, we compare YouDream against various baselines and evaluate the effect of various components of our method. We show qualitative comparison with text-to-3D methods which are guided by T2I diffusion models for common animals observed in nature. We also compare with MVDream - which uses a (text + camera)-to-image diffusion model trained on 3D objects. It should be noted that our method does not use any 3D objects for training, yet is able to deliver geometrically consistent results. We conduct a user study to quantitatively evaluate our method against these baselines. We also compute CLIP score following previous work Shi et al. (2023), shown in Sec. I. Additionally, we present ablations over the various modules that constitute YouDream.

**Generating animals observed in nature.** In Fig. 4, we compare our method against 3DFuse Seo et al. (2023), Fantasia3D Chen et al. (2023), and HiFA Zhu et al. (2023) for generating common animals. HiFA and Fantasia suffer from anatomical inconsistency, while 3DFuse is more consistent in some cases due to the use of depth control. However, 3DFuse is highly dependent on the point cloud prediction leading to the generation of implausible geometry, for example in the case of elephant and T-Rex. It should be noted that generating results using Fantasia3D required extensive parameter tuning, which has also been indicated by the authors in their repository. All results are generated using the same seed 0 for fair comparison. We use the default hyperparameter settings of each baseline except Fantasia3D. The text ", full body" is appended at the end of the prompt for all baselines, as we observed that the methods generate truncated animals in many cases. We generate common animals using our fully automated pipeline, where we use LLM for pose editing sourced by a library of 3D poses. Tiger is generated by our multi-agent LLM based on a German Shepherd, northern cardinal is made from an eagle, while elephant and Tyrannosaurus rex are part of our library. In all cases, our method visibly outperforms baselines in terms of perceptual quality and 3D consistency.

**Generating unreal creatures.** A major advantage of our pipeline is that it can be easily used to generate non-existent creatures, especially those not explainable through text. These can be generated robustly using our method when the user provides a skeleton of their concept. We use our pose editor tool to generate the results shown in Fig. 1, where YouDream produces stunning unreal creatures. We show the pose controls we use in Sec. F. Notably, MVDream Shi et al. (2023) struggled to follow the textual prompt as such creatures are not represented in existing 3D datasets; producing incorrect results such as "Wampus cat", a cat-like creature in American folklore, with three legs instead of six in Fig. 1 row 5. In some aspects HiFA attempted to follow the prompt (owing to its usage of T2I Stable Diffusion) such as producing a couple of tentacles in Fig. 1 row 1 and more than one head in row 3, but produces geometrically inconsistent results in all cases. Again we use seed 0, default hyperparameter settings for baselines and append ", full body" at the end of the prompts except for 'golden ball'.

**Subjective Quality Analysis.** We conducted a voluntary user study2 with 32 participants to subjectively evaluate the quality of our 3D generated assets. The participants were shown side-by-side videos of assets generated using the same prompt input by YouDream(ours), HiFA, Fantasia3D, 3DFuse, and MVDream, and were asked to select the best model under the categories - 1) Naturalness and 2) Text-Image alignment. The participants were instructed to judge naturalness on the basis of geometrical and anatomical consistency/correctness, perceptual quality, artifacts, and details present in the videos.

Figure 5: **User Study.** User preferences on 1) Naturalness and 2) Text-Image alignment averaged over 32 participants and 22 text-to-3D generated assets reveals the superiority of our proposed method.

Text-image alignment preference was self-explanatory. A total of 22 prompts and their corresponding 3D assets generated using each model were shown to each participant, thereby accumulating a total of 1408 user preferences. Of the 22 prompts, 13 involved naturally existing animals while the remaining 9 included unreal and non-existent animals. The collected user preferences are shown in Fig.5. We observe a 60-62% user preference in both the preference categories for our model, strongly indicating the superior robustness and quality of YouDream.

We also tested the efficacy of our multi-agent LLM based pose generator via a subjective study. We request 16 novel 3D poses of different animals from the multi-agent LLM which uses 16 pre-defined animal poses in our animal pose library. The requested animals were such that there was a high chance of using each reference animal pose in the library. The participants were shown paired videos of rotating 3D poses, consisting of the pose taken from the library (left-side video,'reference animal') and the novel pose (right-side video,'requested animal') generated. Since the participants were not experts in animal anatomy, they were also provided multi-view images of each animal under their video. They were asked to mark 'Yes' or 'No' for the question: "If this 3D pose <reference pose video> represents'reference animal' in'reference pose' pose. Could this 3D pose <generated pose video> represent'requested animal' in'requested pose' pose?" The study consisted of the same 32 participants and each subject voted for all the 16 novel poses. Subjects agreed that the generated pose correctly represents'requested animal' 91% of the time. Kangaroo (standing pose) generated by the multi-agent LLM using the pose of T-Rex (standing pose) received the lowest agreement among all pairs with 8 out of 32 votes being 'No'. Detailed description of the pose library, the generated poses, and particulars of the human study are provided in Sec. J.

**Ablation.** We present ablation over the effect of using initial shape and pose control in Fig. 6. Without pose control refers to using vanilla Stable Diffusion. Without using initial shape or control, the Janus head problem occurs. With initial shape but without pose control, the geometry improves but still sees the appearance of another head on the elephant's backside. Using pose control without initial shape produces visibly good results, however using both initial shape and pose control results in much cleaner geometry.

In Fig. 7 we show the effect of our scheduling strategies. Without guidance or control scaling, the result has grassy texture at the feet which could be owing to seeing most elephants on grass during TetraPose ControlNet training on limited animal pose data. Using only one kind of scheduling produces incorrect color, showing that both scaling techniques go hand-in-hand.

Figure 6: **Ablation over the effect of initial shape and pose control. The initial shape helps in producing clean geometry, while the pose control helps to maintain 3D consistency.**

Figure 7: **Ablation over scheduling techniques. Using either guidance or control scaling produces unnatural color, using neither produces artifacts such as grass at feet owing to lower diversity of ControlNet compared to Stable Diffusion.**

Conclusion

We presented YouDream, a method to create anatomically controllable and geometrically consistent 3D animals from a text prompt and a 3D pose input. Our method facilitates the generation of diverse creative assets through skeleton control, which cannot be expressed through language and is difficult to provide as guidance image, especially for unseen creatures. Additionally, we presented a pipeline for automatic generation of 3D pose for animals commonly observed in nature by utilizing a multi-agent LLM setup. Our 3D generation process enjoys multi-view consistency by utilizing a 3D pose as a prior. We quantitatively outperform prior work in terms of "Naturalness" and "Text-Image Alignment" as evidenced in the user study.
