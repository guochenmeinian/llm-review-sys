###### Abstract

While state-of-the-art transformer networks use several hundreds of latent variables per layer, it has been shown that these features can actually be represented locally by relatively low dimensional manifolds. The intrinsic dimension is a geometrical property of the manifold latent representations populate, viz., a minimal number of parameters needed to describe the representations. In this work, we compare the intrinsic dimensions of three image transformer networks for classes of the cifar10 and cifar100 dataset. We find compelling evidence that the intrinsic dimensions differ among classes but are universal across networks. This universality persists across different pretraining strategies, fine-tuning and different model sizes. Our results strengthen the hypothesis that different models learn similar representations of data and show great potential that further investigation of intrinsic dimension could lead to more insights on the universality of latent representations.

## 1 Introduction

According to the manifold hypothesis, high-dimensional real-world datasets populate low-dimensional manifolds. This is thought to be one of the key features leading to generalization in machine learning models. A question that naturally arises from this in the context of similarity in latent representation: Do different models learn the same low-dimensional manifold when presented with the same data? And following this, does the dimensionality of that manifold depend on the data, the different classes in the data and on the model?

One tool to investigate these questions, is measuring the intrinsic dimension (ID) of the latent space. The ID is the minimum amount of variables needed to represent the data without significant information loss. It has been shown, that different models with the same task (e.g. image classification) show similar distibution of ID across layers and also it was found that a low ID in the last layer correlates with higher accuracy . Similar observations were made in self-supervised networks, that exhibit similar 'evolution' of ID even across tasks .

In previous work, ID was reported for supervised learning cases as an average across all data , hence potentially losing important information about ID class differences. As the ID is a local measure and assuming that any given neighborhood is dominated by a single class (i.e., assuming high classification accuracy is possible) we suggest stratifying ID over classes. Differences in ID between classes could, for example, derive from different invariances and symmetry groups. These questions are new and we have developed a workflow to address whether ID is dependent on the classes in a dataset, i.e. whether some classes are represented in a lower or higher-dimensional manifolds than others, and if this is universal across models.

Our results show, that the ID is depended on the classes of the dataset, but not on the model. The ID of different classes compares across models and exhibits the same relative ordering and distinctive shapes. This leads to the conclusion that different networks do learn similar low-dimensional representations of data and the ID of classes is universal across models.

## 2 Methods

### Data and models

We analyze the intrinsic dimension of three image transformer networks: vision transformer (ViT) , data2vec  and BEiT . All models are retrieved from https://huggingface.co, see Table 1 for the exact models. While all models share the base transformer architecture, the pretraining strategy between the models differs. While ViT is pretrained by predicting the next image patch, data2vec and BEiT are trained by masking parts of the image. All models are pretrained on ImageNet-1k  (although not exclusively). Additionally, we investigate a fine-tuned version of each model. For ViT and BEiT we analyze models fine-tuned on cifar10 and for data2vec a model fine-tuned on ImageNet.

To test our hypothesis that the models learn similar representations, despite their different pre-training settings, we compare the intrinsic dimensions and neighbourhoods of the hidden representations of the cifar10 and cifar100 dataset . The cifar10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The cifar100 dataset consists of 100 classes with 600 images each, of which each class belongs to one of 20 super-classes. There are again 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The data is retrieved from https://huggingface.co (cifar10, cifar100). For every model, we extract the mean latent representation after each transformer block for the training images of both datasets. From the latent representations we estimate the ID as described in the following sections.

### Intrinsic dimension

The intrinsic dimension (ID) is a geometrical property of the manifold latent representations populate, viz., a minimal number of parameters needed to describe the representations. We use the 'TwoNN' estimator  to estimate the ID of the data representations, which is based on the local distance between the datapoint and its two nearest neighbours. The estimator is shown to be robust to curvature, density variations, scale and embedding dimensions [1; 6]. Due to its simplicity it's also well suited for large datasets and high embedding dimensions . Estimated IDs over 20 should be interpreted as lower bounds . For each datapoint, calculate the ratio between the distance to the first (\(r_{1}\)) and second neighbour (\(r_{2}\)) as \(=}}{{r_{1}}}\). The probability of \(=(_{1},_{2},...,_{N})\) is given by 

\[P( d)=d^{N}_{i=1}^{N}_{i}^{-(d+1)}\] (1)

For nearest neighbour search we use euclidean distances and employ NN-Descent, an efficient algorithm for approximate k-nearest neighbour graph construction .

### Comparison

For comparison across models, we use Pearson's r for linear correlation and Spearman's rho for rank correlation. These are calculated for the IDs of each class for each layer and for the mean ID of each class. P-values < 0.05 are considered significant.

## 3 Results and Discussion

We investigate how the intrinsic dimension of the different classes behaves across different networks. The hypothesis is that the different models converge to similar latent representations, which should also be reflected in similar intrinsic dimensions.

We extracted the ID of the representations of all classes after each transformer layer and observe similar behavior across models. In Figure 1 the ID for the classes of cifar10 is shown for different layers of the three different models (ViT, BEiT and data2vec) and two things can be observed. The exact ID differs between the models, but follows a very similar pattern across models: The ID increases more in early than in later network layers, which could also seen in . Additionally, the ranking of ID of classes is very similar across models. The models generally have a smaller or higher intrinsic dimension for the same classes.

The correlation between the mean ID of different classes (for cifar10) across the models is shown in Table 2. The correlation for the mean ID of each class is above 0.85 for every comparison (all with p<0.005), the correlation on a layer comparison is above 0.70 for all layers and base-size models. The same can be observed for the cifar100 dataset, when looking at the coarse and fine labels (spearman's rho > 0.84 and 0.85 respectively for all comparisons, see Appendix A for detailed results). This indicates that the complexity of learned representations is relative with respect to the classes and not dependent on the used model. Even some distinct behavior of ID evolution can be observed across models, e.g. the ID of class cat is going up after the middle of the network while the ID of most other classes go down, which can be observed for almost all models (see Figure 1).

Fine-tuning of the models did not change the relative ordering of ID of classes and had only little influence on the general development of ID (see Figure 1). For ViT and BEit fine-tuning on cifar10 reduced the ID of the cifar10 classes but the ID curve shape stayed unchanged. In contrast, an increase in ID and a change in the ID curve shape throughout layers could be observed for data2vec after fine-tuning. The fact that this model was fine-tuned on ImageNet and not cifar could contribute to these differences.

We also investigated different sizes of networks (larger latent dimension and more layers). The change in size also did not affect the relative ordering of IDs of the classes, as it can be seen in high correlations with the base model size and other models (see Table 2, last rows/columns).

## 4 Conclusion and Outlook

In this work, we aimed to investigate the ID of latent representations stratified by classes and compare its evolution and behavior across different models. We showed that the ID of representations of data is dependent on the class and this dependency is universal across models. This supports the hypothesis that models learn similar representations when presented with the same stimuli. The universality in ID is consistent when comparing different model-sizes and also remains after fine-tuning models.

These findings lead to several potential research questions, which we plan to investigate in the future. How can the ID of representations be related to the data? How similar are the manifolds on which the data is represented (in terms of shape, organization,...)? How can these insights be used to align models with each other and foster knowledge transfer between models?
