###### Abstract

Confocal fluorescence microscopy is one of the most accessible and widely used imaging techniques for the study of biological processes at the cellular and subcellular levels. Scanning confocal microscopy allows the capture of high-quality images from thick three-dimensional (3D) samples, yet suffers from well-known limitations such as photobleaching and phototoxicity of specimens caused by intense light exposure, which limits its use in some applications, especially for living cells. Cellular damage can be alleviated by changing imaging parameters to reduce light exposure, often at the expense of image quality. Machine/deep learning methods for single-image super-resolution (SISR) can be applied to restore image quality by upscaling lower-resolution (LR) images to produce high-resolution images (HR). These SISR methods have been successfully applied to photo-realistic images due partly to the abundance of publicly available datasets. In contrast, the lack of publicly available data partly limits their application and success in scanning confocal microscopy. In this paper, we introduce a large scanning confocal microscopy dataset named SR-CACO-2 that is comprised of low- and high-resolution image pairs marked for three different fluorescent markers. It allows to evaluate the performance of SISR methods on three different upscaling levels (X2, X4, X8). SR-CACO-2 contains the human epithelial cell line Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), and it is composed of 2,200 unique images, captured with four resolutions and three markers, that have been translated in the form of 9,937 patches for experiments with SISR methods. Given the new SR-CACO-2 dataset, we also provide benchmarking results for 16 state-of-the-art methods that are representative of the main SISR families. Results show that these methods have limited success in producing high-resolution textures, indicating that SR-CACO-2 represents a challenging problem. The dataset is released under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0), and it can be accessed freely. Our dataset, code and pretrained weights for SISR methods are publicly available: https://github.com/sbelharbi/sr-caco-2.

SR-CACO-2: A Dataset for Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Image Super-Resolution

## 1 Introduction

Confocal fluorescence microscopy is a standard imaging technique in biological and biomedical research . It can resolve cell and tissue structures at a maximum lateral resolution of about 200nm, providing high-quality images at a moderate cost . Point scanning confocal microscopy and spinning disk confocal microscopy are two advanced imaging techniques used forhigh-resolution fluorescence imaging. Point scanning confocal microscopy uses a single laser beam to sequentially scan each point of the specimen, providing high-resolution images with excellent optical sectioning capability. This method is ideal for the detailed examination of thick three-dimensional (3D) specimens and allows for precise control over imaging parameters. However, it can be relatively slow and may cause photobleaching due to prolonged exposure to the laser . In contrast, spinning disk confocal microscopy uses a disk with multiple pinholes to simultaneously scan multiple points of the specimen. This results in much faster image acquisition, making it suitable for live cell imaging and dynamic processes. Spinning disk confocal microscopy also reduces photobleaching and phototoxicity compared to point scanning. However, its optical sectioning capability is generally lower, and it does not provide the same level of detail for thick 3D specimens. Therefore, an ongoing challenge with confocal microscopy of thick 3D samples is optimizing imaging parameters (laser intensity, exposure duration, scanning speed) to obtain high-quality images while minimizing phototoxicity. This is particularly challenging when capturing large 3D image stacks or time-lapse videos, where samples are repeatedly imaged 10s or 100s of times.

The success of microscopy is however limited due to the photobleaching of fluorescent probes caused by the excitation light of the emitted laser. Additionally, long exposure to this light can also cause phototoxicity of cells which leads to their damage and even death, further limiting the usage of such techniques in live cell imaging . Moreover, high-resolution images require long exposure to light which increases the risk of these issues and impedes the observation of instantaneous intercellular events. Different approaches have been considered to limit these issues, such as pulsed excitation , specialized culture media , or more sophisticated techniques such as controlled light exposure microscopy . However, these techniques remain cumbersome, expensive, and less general. Another common and practical approach considers imaging with fluorescence microscopy with short exposure time or low excitation light intensity. This can lead to low-quality images which are subsequently improved using image-enhancing techniques .

Deep learning models have recently provided significant improvements in diverse image analysis tasks  and biosciences . In particular, they have allowed for considerable advances in single-image super-resolution (SISR)  where high-resolution (HR) images are restored from low-resolution (LR) photo-realistic images . However, the success of these models relies heavily on the availability of large-scale public datasets to train a deep SISR model. Few works in microscopy imaging aim to leverage SISR . This extends to different microscopy techniques  including standard fluorescence microscopy such as confocal , Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) , STimulated Emission Depletion (STED) microscopy , Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) such as PhotoActivated Localization Microscopy (PALM) , and Stochastic Optical Reconstruction (STORM) . Some of these works enhance image quality , while others aim to upscale images by a factor . In contrast with standard SISR evaluations on photo-realistic images, where an LR image is typically a synthetic downsampled version of an HR image, SISR models for microscopy images deal with real LR images. This translates into a difficult task since real LR images are produced through a different unknown process than a deterministic interpolation which is relatively easy to learn. Despite the success of these SISR models, the availability of datasets remains an issue in microscopy, where datasets are private and inaccessible. This data unavailability hinders progress in microscopy imaging research and prevents leveraging the potential of deep SISR models.

Our work addresses the lack of public datasets for SISR in fluorescence microscopy. To the best of our knowledge, no public dataset exists for this modality. SR-CACO-2 is a new confocal fluorescence dataset proposed for bio-imaging with pairs of HR and (real) LR images for SISR. It is based on human epithelial cell line Caco-2  (ATCC HTB-37). The imaged tiles (see Fig. 2) capture epithelial cells isolated from colon tissue with colorectal adenocarcinoma. Three different proteins are marked and imaged, yielding different views of a cell: Survivin (CELLO), E-cadherin or Tubulin (CELL1), and Histone H2B (CELL2). The dataset is composed of 2,200 unique images forming 22 tiles with the HR tiles measuring \(9,300 9,300\) pixels. They are captured by laser scanning over a regular raster. Three different LR scales are provided (Fig. 1): /2, /4, and /8 in addition to the HR scale. The SR-CACO-2 dataset is designed for convenient evaluation of machine learning models - patches are cropped to a size \(512 512\) from HR tiles, and their corresponding patches from all LR tiles at different scales. These patches are only comprised of regions of interest (ROI) (_i.e._, cells), while irrelevant regions with black backgrounds are discarded. This allows for the collection of \(9,937\)patches, per scale and cell type, that can be directly employed for the training and testing of deep SISR models.

**Our main contributions are summarized as follows.**

**(1)** A large, diverse, and challenging dataset, SR-CACO-2, for confocal fluorescence SISR microscopy is proposed. It captures an epithelial cell line derived from colorectal adenocarcinoma grown as 3D spheroids. SR-CACO-2 contains 2,200 unique images in HR format and three corresponding real LR versions /2, /4, and /8 covering three separate protein markers: Survivin, E-cadherin or Tubulin, and Histone H2B.

**(2)** A reproducible experimental protocol is introduced to perform machine learning experiments. It allows preparing the dataset for experiments with SISR methods.

**(3)** An extensive benchmarking study on 16 representative SISR methods is provided to assess the quality of super-resolved images. These results show that state-of-the-art SISR methods yield smooth images and fail to correctly produce accurate HR textures across all scales. The full SR-CACO-2 dataset (tiles and patches), code, and pretrained weights of methods are made public. The dataset is freely available under a Creative Commons license (CC BY-NC-SA 4.0).

**(4)** Images produced by all SISR methods are analyzed to assess their efficiency in downstream biology tasks for cell object (nucleus) detection and segmentation. Although they provide poor visual quality, several methods achieve promising results on these tasks compared to LR and HR.

## 2 The SR-CACO-2 Dataset

SR-CACO-2 is a dataset suitable for designing and evaluating machine/deep learning methods that can perform SISR in fluorescence microscopy imaging. In particular, image tiles of size \( 9k 9k\) are comprised of \(10 10\) unique images, and capture the human epithelial cell line Caco-2. These cells are a well-established model for studying mitotic spindle orientation and epithelial cell polarity. As they are cell lines, they can be cultured over long periods without the requirement for repeated re-isolation from tissue. They are also easily modified with lentivectors to overexpress or knock-down proteins of interest, or to introduce fluorescently-tagged proteins for use in live imaging.

The dataset was captured via fixed-cell imaging since it prevents the cells from moving, allowing for accurate capturing of all scales. The captured images allow training of SISR models that can potentially be used for live-imaging videos. Three proteins involved in cell division were used, as cell division is a behavior commonly studied via live imaging. First, **mCherry-Histone H2B** (CELL2, bright): Histone H2B marks chromatin (the DNA inside cells). It is tagged with the red

Figure 1: Illustration of SR-CACO-2 patch content for cells CELLO, CELL1, and CELL2, and for the HR patch and its corresponding three LR patches (/2, /4, /8). The HR patch size is \(512 512\), while the LR patch sizes are \(256 256\), \(128 128\), and \(64 64\) for scales /2, /4, and /8, respectively.

fluorescent protein mCherry. **GFP-tubulin or E-cadherin** (CELL1, medium): Tubulin is a marker for microtubules, which are one of the structural components of cells and can be used to see the cell outline/shape. Microtubules also form the mitotic spindle, which is important during mitosis (cell division) for separating DNA into two new daughter cells. Tubulin is tagged with green fluorescent protein (GFP). E-cadherin is a standard marker for epithelial cells. It is found along the cell-cell contact sites and shows epithelial polarity. It is also useful because it stains the membrane of each cell, so this (or GFP-tubulin), in combination with mCherry-Histone H2B shows the cell shape and the nucleus respectively. **Survivin** (CELL0, dim): Survivin marks the midbody, which is a bridge between cells present during the very last step of cell division.

SR-CAC0-2 is comprised of more than 9k real pairs of LR and HR patches, per scale, and cell type. It is a representative dataset in this field since it is captured using a standard process in fluorescence microscopy. In addition, three different upscaling scenarios are provided, X2, X4, and X8, in addition to HR, allowing a better study of the limit of SISR methods. The process of capturing our SR-CAC0-2 dataset is described in Sec.2.1, while the experimental protocol described in Sec.2.3 allows preparing the dataset for the design and evaluation of SISR models.

### Dataset Capture:

Caco-2 cells (ATCC HTB-37), a colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line, were used for all data collection (Fig.2). These cells were used unmodified, or modified via lentiviral infection for stable overexpression of mCherry-Histone H2B or mCherry-Histone H2B and GFP-tubulin, to label chromosomes and microtubules respectively. Cells were seeded at a density of 12,000 cells per well into \(\)-slide 8 well plates (Ibidi 80826), pre-coated with 12 \(\)L Geltrex basement membrane extract (Gibco A1413202). Cells were cultured at 37\({}^{}\)C in 5% CO\({}_{2}\) in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Wisent 319-005-CL) supplemented with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS) (Wisent 091-150, lot 091150) and 2% Geltrex. Media was changed every 2-3 days. Cells were cultured for a total of 5 days to allow the formation of single-layered 3D epithelial structures (cysts) with the open lumen.

After 5 days, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 10 minutes, followed by immunostaining. Cells were blocked and permeabilized using 10% goat serum, 0.5% fish skin gelatin and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PBS for 1 hour. Primary antibodies were incubated

Figure 2: Methodology for capturing the SR-CAC0-2 dataset follows these steps:

**Step 1**: Lentiviral infection. mCherry-Histone H2B and GFP-tubulin lentivirus are added to a monolayer of Caco-2 epithelial cells. Infection of the monolayer with the viruses results in permanent modification of the cells to expression mCherry-Histone H2B (Magenta circles = red fluorescent chromosomes) and GFP-tubulin (Green rectangles = green fluorescent microtubules).

**Step 2**: Growing 3D epithelial cysts. The Caco-2 monolayer is detached to form a single-cell suspension. Cell culture plates are coated in a layer of Geltrex basement membrane extract (BME), onto which the Caco-2 single-cell suspension is added. After 5 days in culture, the single cells grow to form organized multicellular 3D structures, known as cysts or spheroids.

**Step 3**: Immunostaining. Primary antibodies target survivin (a marker of midbodies, a structure present at the end of cell division) and E-cadherin (a cell membrane marker). Secondary antibodies result in the fluorescence of these markers in either green or far red channels.

**Step 4**: Image acquisition. Tile scans are performed with an LSM700 microscope at 4 resolution levels. All 3 channels are captured with each tile scan: Survivin (CELL0), E-cadherin or GFP-tubulin (CELL1), mCherry-Histone H2B (CELL2).

overnight at 4\({}^{}\)C in the blocking/permeabilization buffer. Primary antibodies used were survivin (midbody marker, Cell Signaling 2808T, 1:300 dilution) and E-cadherin (basolateral cell membrane marker, BD Transduction Laboratories 610181, 1:500 dilution). Secondary antibodies were incubated in the blocking/permeabilization buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. Secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 AffiniPure Donkey anti-Rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 711-545-152, dilution 1:750) and Alexa Fluor 647 AffiniPure Donkey Anti-Mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 715-605-151, dilution 1:200). Following immunostaining, cells were stored in PBS at 4\({}^{}\)C.

Imaging was performed with a Zeiss LSM700 confocal microscope using a 20x/0.8NA objective lens. Each tile was scanned using a \(10 10\) grid at 4 different resolutions. The size of each sub-image in the grid changes with the scale: **HR: 1024x1024 pixels**, scan speed 9, averaging 8; **LR (/2): 512x512 pixels**, scan speed 9, averaging 1; **LR (/4): 256x256 pixels**, scan speed 9, averaging 1; **LR (/8): 128x128 pixels**, scan speed 9, averaging 1. The averaging indicates how many slices are captured and averaged, which reduces noise. Initial images were acquired with HR tile scans completed for each well of cells, before capturing images for subsequent resolutions. Positions were saved using automated Zeiss software, to ensure the same region of interest was imaged at each resolution. Later tiles were acquired with all four resolutions imaged for one well, before imaging subsequent wells.

### Dataset Variability:

During the acquisition of SR-CACO-2, we ensured the technical and biological diversity of samples. To automate the image acquisition, we programmed the microscope to capture multiple sets of 100 images. Each set of 100 images was stitched together (\(10 10\)) to form an image tile. Therefore, each tile represents 100 unique images (fields of view) and the 22 tiles correspond to 2,200 unique images. Each image is captured at four scales and for three markers. The automatic collection of a tile of the 4 different resolutions takes over \(\)12-16 hours. We note that each tile was captured in a multi-well plate. The 22 wells were collected from 4 independent experiments using 5-6 wells per plate/experiment, ensuring adequate and standard biological diversity.

To further assess the diversity of our dataset, we performed an object-based analysis of cellular structures captured in the image dataset. The 2,200 (\(22 10 10\)) unique image fields of view at the high resolution contain \( 16,800\) multi-cellular objects. The cells were cultivated in a three-dimensional protein matrix that allows them to form tissue-like cyst structures that resemble the natural organization of cells in tissues and organs, such as the colon, lung, breast, etc. Cells grown in a three-dimensional matrix exhibit spontaneous variations in cyst size and organization (hollow or solid). We recently  reported multiple cellular phenotypes in Caco2 cells that resemble tissue geometries found in healthy and disease states. Our dataset contains cysts with size variations over 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, shape analysis of the cysts demonstrates substantial variation in aspect ratio and circularity. This reflects cysts covering a spectrum of phenotypes, including single-layered, multi-layered, and solid. This contrasts with cells grown as two-dimensional cultures on plastic or glass surfaces, where there is substantially less variation in size and organization when viewing single cells or confluent patches as is often used in other recently published microscopy datasets. Fig.3 shows the analysis of the cells in the SR-CACO-2 dataset. We can observe from these plots that the cells span a large size range with a relatively circular shape.

Our dataset also includes diverse cellular markers with unique properties. Cells were labeled with Hoechst dye that labels chromatin and is frequently used as a nuclear stain in cell biology. We also include mCherry-Histone, a red-fluorescent protein conjugated to histone H2B that is part of chromatin. This serves as an additional marker of cell nuclei and represents a signal that is often employed in live imaging experiments. mCherry-Histone represents a lower signal than Hoechst

Figure 3: Object-based analysis of cellular structures captured of all the 2,200 high-resolution images (\(22 10 10\)).

because the cells were selected to have a low-to-moderate expression of this protein and are detected by direct fluorescence. The other two markers (E-cadherin and Survivin) represent typical staining obtained with indirect fluorescence methods, using primary and fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies. E-cadherin is expressed in all Caco2 cells and is a cell surface protein. Therefore, this has a distinct expression pattern from the blob-like nuclear labels described above. Despite being expressed in all cells, there is heterogeneity at the cellular level, providing extensive natural variation within our dataset. Survivin is transiently expressed in cells during cell division. This represents an additional unique marker pattern that appears as an intense patch connecting two cells. Survivin is only expressed in a subset of cells during mitosis and cytokinesis, processes that often utilize imaging and machine learning for analysis .

### Experimental Protocol:

**Patches sampling.** Since the imaged tiles are quite large ( \(9k 9k\)), they are not well suited for machine learning models as they usually operate on smaller images. To this end, we pre-processed the tiles to patches as presented in Fig.4. On HR tiles of the brightest cell, _i.e._ CELL2, a sliding window was employed that scans from left to right and from top to bottom of the entire tile. Windows can overlap by \(25\%\) to increase the chance of capturing large patterns and minimize cropping cells. The window size is set to \(576 576\) with \(64\) extra margin at each side that will be useful later for registration. This additional margin was discarded, and only windows of size \(512 512\) were preserved as final patches.

Many of the sampled windows will land on empty regions, _i.e._, black background. Across all the 22 HR tiles of CELL2, \(74.24\%\) of total _pixels_ are background while only \(25.74\%\) are foreground (cells). Windows which are more black will not be helpful in learning or evaluation since they are easy to reconstruct using SISR models. They would introduce an evaluation bias by giving a high level of performance, which does not reflect the true performance of the models to super-resolve relevant regions, _i.e._, cells. For this reason, we discarded the windows without enough cell content. To detect these windows, we apply a threshold to tile with a value of \(4\) which is deemed sufficient to spot the cells without including noise. Only windows with at least \(20\%\) of cell content were preserved.

The aforementioned process is performed over HR tiles of CELL2 to determine useful HR patches. Once done, the coordinates of these patches are used to crop HR patches from HR tiles of CELL1 and CELL0 at the same location. Then, the coordinates of LR patches from LR tiles are estimated using the coordinates of the corresponding HR patches. This is performed by downsizing the coordinates using the corresponding downscale factor. For example, for the LR patch at scale /2 for CELL2 in a specific location, we divide the coordinates of its corresponding HR patch of the same cell and location by \(2\).

Scanning the same tiles at different resolutions can lead to small but detectable shifts (fractions of a micron) due to the physical movement of the microscope stage from the position of tile 100 back to the imaging start position at tile 1. This is a common issue for any type of microscope with a mechanical stage. To mitigate this issue, we align patches once cropped. Given an HR patch and its corresponding LR patches, we perform image registration of each LR patch to be aligned with its corresponding HR patch, where the HR patch is used as the image reference. A _global_ shift between the two patches is estimated using TV-L1 algorithm for optical flow estimation 1. This allows performing a global shift of all the pixels at once while preserving all their neighbouring pixels. Such a shift can lead to artifacts at the patch boundaries. Therefore, we re-crop the patch at the center with size \(512 512\) and discard the extra margin of \(64\) at each side. The final HR patches are \(512 512\) while LR patches of /2, /4, and /8 are \(256 256\), \(128 128\), and \(64 64\), respectively.

**Data split.** First, the 22 tiles are randomly split into 15 for training, 3 for validation, and 4 for testing. This prevents mixing patches of the same tile across different sets. Tiles with identifiers (ID) = ['9', '10', '14', '20'] are assigned to the test set. Tiles with ID ['7', '11', '19'] are used for the validation set. Finally, tiles with ID = ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '8', '12', '13', '15', '16', '17', '18', '21', '22'] are used for training. This is summarized in Tab.1 along with the patch distribution for all subsets.

## 3 Single-Image Super-Resolution Methods

In addition to the proposed dataset, we provide an extensive benchmarking of different SISR methods. In particular, 16 representative SISR methods were selected from 4 common families  are evaluated. We also compare to a simple baseline which is interpolation via the bicubic method. Our results can serve as baselines for future comparisons. We selected the following state-of-the-art methods as follows. **Pre-upsampling SR**: SRCNN , VDSR , DRRN , and MemNet . **Post-upsampling SR**: NLSN , DFCAN , SwinIR , EDSR (LIIF) , ENLCN , GRL , ACT , and Omni-SR . **Iterative up-and-down sampling SR**: DBPN , and SRFBN . **Progressive upsampling SR**: ProSR , and MS-LapSRN . The post-upsampling family is the most recent and dominant approach . Other families have seen less progress mainly due to their high computational cost.

Given the limited space, we provide the training details, ablations, evaluation metrics, and more results in the supplementary materials. In summary, we follow a standard performance evaluation protocol for SISR. Three standard measures were used to evaluate the performance of SISR methods - peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index (SSIM) , and normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) . The evaluation is performed on the full patch, referred to as _full image_, as commonly done in the literature. Moreover, we report refined performance over the cells only, referred to as _ROI only_, to assess the predictive quality without the black background inside the patches. ROIs are determined by thresholding the HR patch using a set of thresholds2. Performance is computed per threshold over the ROI only. The final performance is reported as the average of all per-threshold performances. SISR models are trained on each cell type, and each scale separately.

**Super-Resolution Task**: Table 2 shows results on ROI only. Given the space limitations, we present only one method per family. The full results are in the supplementary materials. Overall, SISR

   & **Tiles** & & **Patches** & \\   Data subsets & Train & Validation & Test & Total & Train & Validation & Test & Total \\  Number & 15 & 3 & 4 & 22 & 7,349 & 1,117 & 1,471 & 9,937 \\  Image size: & & & & & & \\ HR & \( 9,318 9,318\) & & & \(512 512\) & \\ LR /2 & \( 4,658 4,658\) & & & \(256 256\) & \\ LR /4 & \( 2,328 2,328\) & & & \(128 128\) & \\ LR /8 & \( 1,164 1,164\) & & & \(64 64\) & \\  File size: & & & & & \\ HR & 260.5 MB & & & & \\ LR /2 & 65.1 MB & & & & \\ LR /4 & 16.3 MB & & & & \\ LR /8 & 4.1 MB & & & & \\  

Table 1: Split of SR-CACO-2 into the train, validation and test subsets, along with relevant statistics. Numbers are defined per scale (X2, X4, X8, and HR), and per cell type (CELL0, CELL1, and CELL2). Numbers are defined per scale (X2, X4, X8, and HR), and per cell type (CELL0, CELL1, and CELL2).

Figure 4: Pre-processing of tiles to patches. First, the HR tile of cell CELL2 (the brightest) is binarized to allow localizing cells only (_i.e._ ROI). A sliding window of size \(512 512\) is used to scan the entire tile with specific overlap. Only windows with enough cell mass are preserved while the rest are discarded. The same coordinates of the preserved patches are used for CELL1 and CELL2 of HR tiles. Coordinates of LR patches X2, X4, and X8 are computed by scaling down the HR patch coordinates according to the corresponding scale.

methods achieved better results than simple interpolation. As commonly known, the higher the scale factor, the more difficult the task. This is also observed in our results across all methods and performance measures. For instance, SRCNN  yields a PSNR of \(35.08\), \(33.17\), and \(29.19\) for X2, X4, and X8, respectively. Another emerging pattern in these results is the discrepancy performance across cell types: CELL0, CELL1, and CELL2. Over PSNR and SSIM performance, CELL0, _i.e._ dimmest, is the easiest while CELL2 is the most difficult, _i.e._ the brightest. Over NRMSE, results are mixed. Across all four studied SISR families, we observe that pre-upsampling SR yielded better results overall across all metrics and scales. This is unexpected since post-upsampling SR are state-of-the-art approaches . These results may suggest that _upscaling_ our LR images through deep models may fail to reconstruct the details of our HR images. This may be explained by the nature of the details present in our HR images which paradoxically comes from noise. Confocal microscopes perform multiple scans to produce a set of slices that are aggregated to produce a final 2D image. Due to an inherited noise produced by the detectors on microscopes, each slice is different. However, averaging these slices decreases the noise and maintains the true signal. The work of  shows that it is difficult for CNN-based models to reconstruct input images with noise as they tend to filter out that noise even when it is provided as input. Therefore, it is challenging for such models to produce similar images to our HR images. Such results should be considered in designing future SISR methods for this dataset. We provide in Fig.5 typical visual results for scale X2 over CELL2 which illustrate the limited capacity of these methods to produce accurate HR details as they yield blurry images.

In some cases, the methods fail, yielding a decline in performance such as the case of MS-LapSRN . We have analyzed the reason for this decline in performance and found that the model fails to converge properly as the loss does not decrease as expected. This is most clear on CELL0 data leading to a large decline compared to CELL1 and CELL2. We believe that this is caused by the combination of the very low level of brightness for the cell, and the use of residual learning in MS-LapSRN. This model has difficulty producing very small residuals. Instead, it yields large residuals. This can be confirmed when measuring performance over a full image, i.e., by including a dark background where the typical intensity is 0, which leads to a sharp decline in performance. By inspecting some predicted samples, the intensity of these background regions is typically 10. Note that this is not the case for the ProSR model that also uses residual learning. However, ProSR  employs a different architecture than MS-LapSRN which, in this case, is much more efficient due to its depth or its local residual layers. During our experiments, we observed that hyper-parameters do not transfer well across cell types or scales of a model. Therefore, we performed a grid search separately for each model, for each cell type, and each scale. This provides each method with a good and fair chance to perform well. Failure cases are mostly related to the method and the data's nature.

**Downstream Biology Tasks - Object Detection/Segmentation.** To evaluate performance from each SISR model on downstream biology tasks, we evaluated each model at X2, X4, and X8 using an object segmentation problem that is widely used and openly accessible software for image analysis

Images were resized to 512 x 512 pixels without interpolation. Automatic object segmentation was performed using Star-convex Shapes (StarDist) [70; 93; 94] with the following parameters: modelChoice = Versatile (fluorescent nuclei), normalizeInput = TRUE, percentileBottom = 1.1, percentileTop = 100.0, probTresh = 0.6, nmsThresh = 0.4. The resulting output was the number of objects detected. Manual object counting was performed to create the Ground Truth number of objects. Manual comparisons were made to identify over-segmentation and under-segmentation errors for each image. Graphing and statistical analysis were performed using JMP Pro (version 17.0.0)4. Steel's test for non-parametric multiple comparisons using HR as the control group was performed to assess model performance. Our objective was to evaluate model performance relative to HR, not ground truth. Models that perform as well as HR (i.e. not statistically different than HR at p=0.05) are represented in orange. Fig.6 shows the results for CELL2, X2 where the VDSR, DRRN, NLSN, DFCAN, ENLCN, ACT, Omni-SR, DBPN, and ProSR models show promising results. The supplementary materials provide more analysis.

## 4 Ethical Considerations and Dataset Accessibility

The SR-CAC0-2 dataset does not require ethics approval. Caco-2 (_C_ancer _coli_-2) cells were isolated from a 72-year-old white male in the 1970s as part of a collection of gastrointestinal cancer cell lines at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center . The use of Caco-2 cells does not require ethics approval because the cells were established prior to the US Federal Policy for the

## 5 Conclusion

The few existing datasets for SISR microscopy are mostly private which limits research advancements. Our work seeks to address this gap. In particular, we propose a new dataset, SR-CACO-2, for Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy Image Super-Resolution. It contains 3 scales (X2, X4, and X8, in addition to HR) with three protein markers in different lighting conditions and about 9k real pairs of LR/HR patches. The procedure for data capture and the experimental protocol for the evaluation of SISR methods are follow standard practices, in addition of being reproducible. Our benchmarking of state-of-the-art SISR methods indicates that they cannot accurately produce the HR images, making this new dataset extremely challenging. Aside from the evaluation of quality for super-resolved images, we conducted further analysis to assess their performance in downstream biology tasks such as cell segmentation. Several methods achieved promising results compared to LR and HR images over cell detection/segmentation tasks. SR-CACO-2 can contribute to driving progress in the design of SISR models for microscopy. This extends from fixed-imaging to live-imaging. SISR models trained with our dataset can be employed for live-imaging videos captured with low quality under reduced light exposure to preserve cells. This leads to fast imaging which allows for the observation of instantaneous inter-cellular events with less damage to the cells. Accurately upscaling these videos with SISR models may ultimately open the door to performing biological tasks such as cell tracking, counting, and segmentation.
