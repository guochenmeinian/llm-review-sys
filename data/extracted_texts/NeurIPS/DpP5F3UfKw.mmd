###### Abstract

Do machines and humans process language in similar ways? Recent research has hinted at the affirmative, showing that human neural activity can be effectively predicted using the internal representations of language models (LMs). Although such results are thought to reflect shared computational principles between LMs and human brains, there are also clear differences in how LMs and humans represent and use language. In this work, we systematically explore the divergences between human and machine language processing by examining the differences between LM representations and human brain responses to language as measured by Magnetoencephalography (MEG) across two datasets in which subjects read and listened to narrative stories. Using an LLM-based data-driven approach, we identify two domains that LMs do not capture well: **social/emotional intelligence** and **physical commonsense**. We validate these findings with human behavioral experiments and hypothesize that the gap is due to insufficient representations of social/emotional and physical knowledge in LMs. Our results show that fine-tuning LMs on these domains can improve their alignment with human brain responses.1

## 1 Introduction

Language models (LMs) now demonstrate proficiency that may equal or even surpass human-level performance on tasks including generating text [Brown et al., 2020a], answering questions [Lewis et al., 2019], translating languages [Costa-jussa et al., 2022], and even tasks that necessitate reasoning and inference [Dasgupta et al., 2022]. This has inspired researchers to leverage LM representations to investigate and model the human brain's language system, positing that LMs may serve as reliable proxies for human linguistic processes [Abdou, 2022]. Prior studies have found that human neural activity, as measured by neuroimaging techniques such as fMRI [Jain and Huth, 2018, Toneva and Wehbe, 2019], EEG [Hale et al., 2018], MEG [Wehbe et al., 2014a], and ECoG [Goldstein et al., 2022], can effectively be predicted using representations from language models such as BERT [Devlin et al., 2018] or GPT-2 [Radford et al., 2019]. Robust neural prediction is hypothesized to stem from the shared computational objective of both LMs and the human brain: predicting subsequent words based on prior context [Yamins and DiCarlo, 2016, Schrimpf et al., 2021].

Despite the evident behavioral similarities, the extent to which LMs and human brains align functionally for language processing remains an open question. Essentially, the methods that LMs and humans use to acquire language are very different. LMs learn statistical regularities across massive sets of linguistic symbols, whereas humans rely on applying structured linguistic principles across relatively little input. Additionally, LMs that are confined to linguistic data are likely to fail to ground linguistic symbols in real-world contexts [Harnad, 1990, Bender and Koller, 2020, Bisk et al., 2020a]. Furthermore, the learning environments and goals of LMs and humans are markedly different. While humans communicate through active inquiry, expressing needs, directed communication, andscaffolding conversations [Kuhl, 2011], LMs are predominantly trained as passive recipients of raw text data. Consequently, LMs may struggle with comprehending social pragmatics and the nuances of words whose meanings fluctuate across different social contexts [Mahowald et al., 2023].

Previous research exploring the relationship between human and LM language processing has typically focused on the types of linguistic features [Oota et al., 2022a, Sun et al., 2023], neural network architectures [Schrimpf et al., 2021], or training and fine-tuning methods [Sun and Moens, 2023] that may yield better predictions of brain responses. Diverging from this approach, Aw and Toneva  proposed that the divergence between human and LM language processing might stem from LMs' inadequate understanding of texts. They supported this hypothesis by demonstrating that LMs fine-tuned on summarization tasks align more closely with human brain responses. Yet, this hypothesis is only one of many potential explanations. In this work, we adopt a bottom-up, data-driven methodology to systematically investigate the differences between human and machine language processing. Our main contributions are as follows:

1. In contrast to prior studies focusing on the similarities between LMs and human brains, our research emphasizes their differences. We monitor the temporal progression of errors in LM predictions on a word-by-word basis on two datasets with distinct language input modalities (SS2).
2. Explaining the prediction errors for every word is challenging due to the vast amount of text. Instead of manually formulating hypotheses, we adopt an LLM-based method that automatically proposes natural language hypotheses to explain the divergent responses between human brains and language models (SS3). The top candidate explanations are related to social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense (SS4). We validate these hypotheses with human behavioral experiments.
3. We present evidence that fine-tuning LMs on tasks related to the two identified phenomena can align them more closely with human brain responses. This implies that the observed divergences between LMs and human brains may stem from LMs' inadequate representation of these specific types of knowledge (SS5).

## 2 Predictive MEG Model

### Data Preparation and Preprocessing

While many studies investigating the correlation between brain responses and language models utilize fMRI recordings (e.g., [Caucheteux et al., 2023, Jain et al., 2020]), the comparatively low temporal resolution of fMRI hinders its ability to accurately capture the processing of individual words. To

Figure 1: Schematic of our experimental approach. The LM takes as input the current word along with its preceding context to produce the current word’s LM embedding. This embedding is then used as input to a ridge regression model to predict the human brain responses associated with the word. The Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted and actual MEG responses is calculated. Finally, an LLM-based hypothesis proposer is employed to formulate natural language hypotheses explaining the divergence between the predicted and actual MEG responses.

address this limitation, our research employed MEG data. We strategically used two different MEG datasets, each with distinct input modalities, to assess potential variations in the brain's response patterns under these conditions.

The first dataset (Wehbe et al., 2014a) has eight participants reading Chapter 9 of _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_ (5,176 words) and four participants reading Chapter 10 of the same book (4,475 words). Each word was exposed on a screen for a fixed duration of 500ms. MEG data were collected on an Elekta NeuroMag MEG with 306 channels at 102 cranial points, and sampled at a rate of 1 kHz. The acquired data underwent preprocessing procedures using the Signal Space Separation (SSS) method (Taulu et al., 2004) and its temporal extension, tSSS (Taulu and Simola, 2006). The signal was then time-locked with individual words and down-sampled into non-overlapping 25ms time bins. Given the typical low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of MEG, we adopted a denoising technique (Ravishankar et al., 2021) that takes advantage of cross-subject correspondences to get an aggregated, denoised version of MEG responses (refer to Appendix A for more details).

To enhance reproducibility and generalizability of our study, we additionally collected MEG data from one participant who listened to six narratives (11,626 words) from The Moth, a platform featuring personal storytelling. These stories were chosen from the stimuli used in a published story listening fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). Five of these stories were repeated twice, while one story was repeated five times. The data acquisition was performed using a MEGIN scanner equipped with 306 channels at 102 cranial points. The preprocessing pipeline was similar to that applied to the first dataset. Given that all story repetitions were from the same participant, we averaged the MEG responses for each story's repetitions to enhance SNR without using an alignment method.

### Predicting MEG Responses from LM Embeddings

A substantial number of recent studies exploring the correlation between brain responses and LMs have employed GPT-2 (Pasquiou et al., 2022; Caucheteux et al., 2022, 2023; Toneva et al., 2022). To ensure consistency and comparability with these studies, we utilized the pre-trained GPT-2 XL model with 1.5B parameters, sourced from HuggingFace's _transformers_ library (Wolf et al., 2020), as the backbone language model. Following previous work (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019), for every word \(w\), we provided the model with a context consisting of the preceding 19 words. We used the output of hidden layers of the LM, subsequently referred to as LM embeddings, to predict the MEG responses associated with each word (Figure 1). For comparison, we also replicated some analyses on Llama-2 7B (Touvron et al., 2023) (refer to Appendix D for more details).

Building upon established research that demonstrates the capability of LM embeddings to linearly predict MEG responses (Wehbe et al., 2014, Jain and Huth, 2018, Caucheteux and King, 2022), we utilized a linear ridge regression model as the encoding model. Considering the time-correlated nature of MEG data, it was essential to maintain the temporal structure when partitioning the data for training and testing purposes (Yang et al., 2019). Therefore, we implemented a 10-fold cross-validation procedure that splits the MEG data into 10 continuous chunks. We denote the actual MEG responses as \(M\) and LM embeddings as \(L\). For split \(i\), we set aside one fold as the test set \((M^{i,test},L^{i,test})\) and fitted a ridge regression model with weight matrix \(W^{i}\) and bias \(b^{i}\) using the remaining folds, denoted as \((M^{i,train},L^{i,train})\). The regularization parameters were chosen via

Language regions are well predicted in language processing time windows (refer to §2.4 for more details).

nested cross-validation. Following model training, we applied the trained weight matrix and bias to predict the brain responses from the LM outputs for the test set:

\[^{i,test}=L^{i,test}^{i}+^{i}\]

Finally, the test predictions from all folds were concatenated to form the comprehensive prediction of MEG responses from the LM:

\[=concat[^{i,test}]\]

This process is performed for each of the different time windows relative to word onset.

### Best Language Model Layer for Predicting MEG Responses

Prior research has shown that intermediate layers of language models often best predict human brain responses (Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Jain and Huth, 2018; Oota et al., 2022b). Therefore, we selected the layer that best predicts brain responses. Figure 3 illustrates the Pearson correlation between actual MEG responses and those predicted by LM embeddings across layers and time points relative to word onset. We used the average correlation across all words and time windows as the metric to select the best layer. Echoing previous findings, we confirmed that intermediate layers exhibit higher correlations, with layer 7 being the best at predicting brain responses in GPT-2 XL. Similarly, for Llama-2, layer 3 was identified as the most predictive.

### Spatio-temporal Pattern of Predictions

As a sanity check, we examined if the predictive model can effectively predict the brain areas and time course of language processing. These areas include the inferior frontal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus, certain sections of the middle temporal gyrus, and angular gyrus (Blank et al., 2016; Rogalsky et al., 2015; Sahin et al., 2009; Brennan and Pylkkanen, 2012; Friederici, 2002; Visser et al., 2010; Rogalsky and Hickok, 2009).

As shown in Figure 2, we observe a temporal progression of accurately predicted areas after word onset. The prediction performance peaks first in the occipital lobe between 75-100ms. Given that LM embeddings encode information (e.g., word frequency) correlated to the number of letters in a word and MEG is sensitive to abrupt changes in visual inputs, we attribute this early peak to the initial visual perception of a word. This is followed by heightened prediction performance in the bilateral temporal lobe between 175-250ms, when we expect semantic processing to start. This observation aligns with previous research indicating that most language experiments with naturalistic stimuli reveal bilateral language representations (Wehbe et al., 2014; Huth et al., 2016; Deniz et al., 2019; Toneva et al., 2022). Finally, between 250-375ms, the anterior temporal lobe and frontal lobe show increased prediction performance, which is likely related to further semantic processing. This sequential pattern of prediction performance replicates the spatio-temporal dynamics of language processing found in previous literature (Wehbe et al., 2014; Toneva et al., 2022).

Figure 3: Pearson correlation between actual MEG responses and predicted responses from (A) GPT-2 XL and (B) Llama-2 across LM layers and time after word onset on the Harry Potter dataset. Both models exhibit high correlations in early and intermediate layers at around 200ms. Correlation is computed across words and averaged across MEG channels.

## 3 Identifying Phenomena of Interest

Our objective is to investigate the elements of MEG responses that cannot be well explained by the LM. We work with an average of cleaned MEG responses from a group of subjects and multiple trials, which illustrate the common elements of language processing across individuals. Therefore, for words where MEG responses are not well predicted, it is likely that this marks a genuine divergence between human brains and the LM. It is important to clarify that our approach trains an encoding model to predict human brain responses based on language model outputs, rather than the reverse. This means our methodology identifies information that is captured by MEG but is not present in the language model, rather than information captured by the language model but is not present in MEG responses.

Leveraging the high temporal resolution of MEG, we computed the Mean Squared Errors (MSEs) between actual and predicted MEG responses for each individual word on channels that demonstrated statistically significant correlations (one-sided, \(p\)=0.001). For word \(w\),

\[MSE(w)=_{i S}((w)_{i}-M(w)_{i})^{2}\] (1)

where \(S\) is the set of significant channels.

### Automatically Discovering Differences between Brain Responses and LM Predictions

Given the vast amount of text, manual pattern discovery becomes challenging. Figure 7 presents sample sentences color-coded based on prediction error, illustrating the challenges in formulating hypotheses from observations.

To discover subtle differences between MEG responses and LM predictions, we used a method that automatically describes differences between text corpora using proposer and verifier LMs [Zhong et al., 2023]. This system consists of first prompting an LLM (GPT-3; Brown et al. [2020b]) with a

  
**Hypothesis** & **Validity** & \(p\)**-value** \\   have a high level of emotional intensity \\ involve complex sentence structures or grammar \\ include emotional language or descriptions \\ have a high level of tension or conflict \\ have characters using body language or non-verbal cues \\ are emotionally charged, making it challenging for language \\ models to accurately interpret the intended tone or sentiment \\ include conflicts between characters \\ have characters interacting with their environment \\ have complex sentence structures \\ have dialogue between characters with varying emotions \\  & 
 0.250 & 0.010 \\ 0.250 & 0.015 \\ 0.237 & 0.023 \\ 0.225 & 0.032 \\ 0.213 & 0.020 \\ 0.200 & 0.035 \\ 0.188 & 0.059 \\ 0.175 & 0.081 \\ 0.175 & 0.081 \\ 0.175 & 0.022 \\   

Table 1: Top 10 hypotheses generated from the best layer of GPT-2 XL on the Harry Potter dataset

  
**Hypothesis** & **Validity** & \(p\)**-value** \\   contain elements of fiction or exaggeration \\ feature emotional or dramatic language \\ refer to cultural or societal norms \\ include sensory details or imagery \\ have strong emotional or dramatic content \\ show a lack of coherence or logical flow \\ contain elements of surprise and unpredictability \\ contain emotional, personal narratives \\ use idiomatic expressions or figurative language \\ refer to specific events or incidents \\  &

Table 2: Top 10 hypotheses generated from the best layer of GPT-2 XL on the Moth datasetnumber of samples from two corpora (\(D_{0},D_{1}\)) to generate many hypotheses on how the first corpus differs from the second, and then using a fine-tuned validator model (FLAN-T5-XXL; Chung et al. (2022)) to validate how often each proposed hypothesis is true based on pairs from each corpus sampled from a held-out set. Specifically, the verifier is presented with a prompt containing two sentences from \(D_{0}\) and \(D_{1}\), and asked whether or not the hypothesis is true, and this is repeated across the development set for each hypothesis. For the exact prompts used in the proposer and verifier, please refer to Appendix E. Sentences were then ranked based on their mean MSE. The top 100 least-predicted sentences constituted the \(D0\) set, while the 100 well-predicted sentences constituted the \(D1\) set. This process of hypothesis proposal and verification was repeated across 3 cross-validation folds.

### Proposed Hypotheses

The top ten hypotheses from the Harry Potter dataset ranked by validity2 are listed in Table 1. We identified two primary differences between the language model and the human brain: firstly, the processing of social and emotional information, and secondly, the capacity for interaction with the surrounding environment. These are henceforth referred to as **social/emotional intelligence** and **physical commonsense**, respectively. Importantly, these hypotheses resonate with conclusions drawn in prior research, as detailed in SS4. Similarly, we ran the hypothesis proposer on the Moth dataset. This replication produced slightly varied but fundamentally similar topics to those discovered in the Harry Potter dataset (Table 2). This congruence across datasets with different input modalities aligns with previous research showing that after initial sensory processing, the brain's language processing is consistent across reading and listening (Deniz et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2023).

Figure 4: Distribution of human responses for (A) the top 10 and (B) the bottom 10 hypotheses, ranked by the percentage of ‘Divergent Sentence’ responses.

### Manual Hypothesis Verification

We conducted an experiment involving human participants for additional validation of our hypotheses. We gathered data from 10 participants using Qualtrics, resulting in a collection of 1,400 trials. In each trial, participants were presented with a hypothesis selected either from the top 10 or bottom 10 hypotheses generated from the Harry Potter dataset, along with a pair of sentences -- one from \(D0\) and the other from \(D1\) -- in a randomized order. The task for participants was to determine which sentence aligned more closely with the given hypothesis, choosing between "More True for Sentence A", "More True for Sentence B", or "Equally true".

The response distribution for each hypothesis is shown in Figure 4. Note that a given hypothesis is not expected to apply to all divergent sentences (e.g., it might suffice for a sentence to be emotionally intense or grammatically complex to be divergent). If a hypothesis does not align with a sentence from the divergent set, participants should show no preference between the two sentences presented. Chi-square analysis revealed statistically significant differences in the distribution of responses between the top and bottom hypotheses (\(p=0.024\)). A preference towards divergent sentences was observed in the top hypotheses condition while a preference towards "Equally True" was observed in the bottom hypothesis condition. This pattern can be attributed to the role of the proposer, which was instructed to generate hypotheses that effectively distinguish \(D_{0}\) (comprising divergent sentences) from \(D_{1}\). As a result, the bottom hypotheses tend to be those that fail to differentiate between \(D_{0}\) and \(D_{1}\), rather than those that are more explanatory of \(D_{1}\) compared to \(D_{0}\) (refer to Appendix F for more details).

## 4 Selected Phenomena

Comprehending social/emotional and physical commonsense requires humans use a broad spectrum of contextual knowledge. We briefly discuss the insights and challenges highlighted in the existing neuropsychological and NLP literature regarding these domains.

**Human social and emotional intelligence** requires both introspection and predicting the feelings of others (Salovey and Mayer, 1990). Neuropsychological research on social cognition has identified a network of brain regions that support understanding other people's intentions, actions, and emotions (Saxe et al., 2006). Crucially, emotions are intrinsic to the human experience and pervasively interact with other mental facilities, including language (Satpute and Lindquist, 2021). As such, creating agents with social and emotional intelligence has been a longstanding goal of NLP (Gunning, 2018; Paiva et al., 2021). However, LLMs still fall short of human abilities for inferring the mental states and emotions of others ("theory-of-mind" tasks) (Sap et al., 2022).

**Physical commonsense** refers to knowledge about the physical properties of everyday objects and physical phenomena (Forbes et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2020). From a neuropsychological perspective, language is not the primary means through which humans acquire commonsense physical knowledge. Instead, humans rely on sensory inputs and interactions with their environment (Baillargeon, 1994). Notably, the category of a physical object affects which brain regions are recruited when interacting with that object. For example, interacting with people activates the theory of mind areas (Saxe et al., 2006), the visual face areas (Sergent et al., 1992; Kanwisher et al., 1997), and body areas (Downing et al., 2001), interacting with corridors while navigating recruits the visual place (Epstein and Kanwisher, 1998) and spatial navigation areas, and interacting with tools recruits the dorsal object-processing stream (Almeida et al., 2010). Interestingly, reading about these domains has also been found to recruit these same visual regions (Wehbe et al., 2014, Huth et al., 2016). Given how physical commonsense knowledge is acquired, it is not surprising that, within NLP, this domain poses a challenge for language models. While these models can potentially learn representations capturing specific physical properties of the world, such as an object's color or a game board's state (Abdou et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023), it remains unclear whether purely text-based representations can capture the richness and complexity of physical commonsense as exhibited by humans (Forbes et al., 2019; Bisk et al., 2020).

## 5 Improving Brain Alignment via Fine-tuning

We hypothesize that the inability of language models to accurately predict associated brain responses stems from their inadequate representations of social/emotional understanding and physical worldknowledge. Drawing inspiration from Aw and Toneva (2023), we fine-tuned the GPT-2 XL model on datasets specific to the two phenomena to examine if targeted fine-tuning could enhance the model's alignment with brain activity.

Furthermore, we examined whether domain-specific fine-tuning would specifically bolster the model's capability in predicting MEG responses associated with words from that domain, as compared to words outside that domain. To this end, we recruited three raters to annotate Chapter 9 of _Harry Potter_ across the two domains. We release these annotations as a resource for the dataset to facilitate further analysis. Details on the annotation process can be found in Appendix H. Examples of each phenomenon within the _Harry Potter_ text can be found in Appendix I.

### Datasets

**Social/Emotional Intelligence** We study social and emotional intelligence using the Social IQa dataset (Sap et al., 2019). This dataset contains questions about people's feelings and their social implications.

**Physical Commonsense** We study physical commonsense using the PiQA dataset (Bisk et al., 2020). This dataset contains goal-driven questions based on everyday situations. These questions were taken from the website instructables.com, where people share DIY project instructions.

We also provide examples from each dataset in Table 3.

Figure 5: Performance comparison of the base model with models fine-tuned on (A) social and (B) physical datasets. Each panel’s y-axis shows the percentage of channels in the fine-tuned model with better, worse, or non-significantly different performance (measured by Pearson correlation) compared to the base model. Fine-tuned models outperform the base model during language processing time windows. Refer to Appendix K for a detailed view of each MEG channel plotted.

### Fine-tuning Setup

In order to keep the architecture of fine-tuned models consistent with the base model, we format the multiple choice task as \(N\) language modeling tasks, where \(N\) is the number of options. Specifically, for the combined context and question \(x\), we directly concatenate each possible multiple-choice answer \(\{y_{1},...,y_{N}\}\) to \(x\) to form \(N\) different sentences. After passing the concatenated sequences through the model, we sum the logits of all tokens corresponding to each multiple-choice option to obtain a score proportional to its log-likelihood. These scores are then gathered into a size (1, \(N\)) tensor, and cross-entropy loss relative to the correct multiple choice answer is used to train the model. Further details on the fine-tuning setup can be found in Appendix G.

### Comparing Fine-tuned Models with the Base Model

We evaluated the fine-tuned GPT-2 XL model on the Harry Potter dataset. To identify channels with statistically significant differences between the base and fine-tuned model, we calculated empirical \(p\)-values by comparing the true correlation value with 10,000 simulated ones obtained by permuting the brain data. Details of the algorithm can be found in Appendix J.

**Fine-tuned models are better aligned with the brain on both tasks.** As illustrated in Figure 5A, the model fine-tuned on the social dataset exceeds the base model in performance across the majority of channels within the 50ms to 300ms time interval post word onset. Notably, this interval corresponds to the language processing time windows, as identified in SS2.4. In a similar vein, the fine-tuned physical model exceeds the base model's performance in almost all channels during the 50-275ms interval post word onset (Figure 5B). However, interestingly, almost all channels are worse than the base model outside this time window. This time selectivity may indicate that the improvements of the fine-tuned model are tailored towards linguistic comprehension rather than broader brain functionalities.

**Fine-tuning improves alignment more for words annotated with that category.** We compared the reduction in prediction error for words annotated within each category and words outside each category by computing the difference in MSE between the model fine-tuned on the corresponding task and the base model. As demonstrated in Figure 6A, prediction errors for social words exhibit a significant reduction compared to non-social words 200-275ms post word onset. Additionally, there is a significant improvement in MSE for physical words over non-physical words 150-225ms post word onset (Figure 6B). We also ran additional control experiments to check if MSE improvement is specific to words that match the category of the dataset on which the model was fine-tuned. Specifically, we evaluated the prediction improvement of physical words on the model fine-tuned on the social dataset, and vice versa (Appendix L).

**Improvements are not related to increased language-modeling ability.** Prior work has found that LMs with lower perplexity can better predict brain activity (Schrimpf et al., 2021). Therefore, additional fine-tuning may have improved the language model's ability to perform the LM task in general, leading to improved alignment. To rule out this possibility, we performed 3-fold cross-validation on _Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone_, excluding Chapters 9 and 10, which were used as data in this study. We trained the base model, as well as the fine-tuned models, on the train set in each fold with the language modeling objective, and found that the final average losses on the test sets were similar (See Appendix M for details).

## 6 Related Work

Numerous studies have found that LM hidden states can linearly map onto human brain responses to speech and text measured by MEG, EEG, and fMRI (Wehbe et al., 2014; Hale et al., 2018; Jain and Huth, 2018; Abnar et al., 2019; Jat et al., 2019; Gauthier and Levy, 2019; Toneva and Wehbe, 2019; Caucheteux and King, 2022; Jain et al., 2020; Toneva et al., 2022; Aw and Toneva, 2022).

At a more foundational level, studies have identified shared computational principles between LMs and human brains. Evidence suggests that both human brains and LMs are perpetually engaged in predicting the subsequent word (Schrimpf et al., 2021). LM surprisal is found to be positively correlated with brain activation, reaching its peak approximately 400 ms post word onset (Goldstein et al., 2022). This aligns well with N400, which denotes a decline in brain activation upon encountering unexpected words around 400 ms after word onset (Lau et al., 2009; Parviz et al., 2011; Halgren et al.,2002]. Moreover, LM representations can predict the hierarchy of brain responses [Caucheteux and King, 2022b, Caucheteux et al., 2023]. Despite this, Antonello and Huth  have pointed out that a high correlation between brain activity and LMs does not necessarily imply that they operate under similar computational principles.

We not only observe this LM-brain alignment but can also actively intervene in it. Research has demonstrated that the alignment between LMs and human brains can be improved by task-specific fine-tuning. A notable instance is the study by Schwartz et al. , where the fine-tuning of BERT using both fMRI and MEG signals enhanced its ability to predict fMRI responses. Importantly, this improvement was not participant-specific and could be transferred to hold-out individuals. Another study [Aw and Toneva, 2023] showed that task-oriented fine-tuning, particularly for narrative summarization, also facilitated better alignment with brain activity. Furthermore, altering the architecture of BERT such that it aligns better with the brain improves its performance on downstream NLP tasks [Toneva and Wehbe, 2019]. These findings suggest a potentially symbiotic relationship between enhancing task performance in LMs and boosting their alignment with brain responses.

## 7 Conclusions, Limitations, and Future Work

We explore a critical question connecting language models with human neural activity: How do LMs differ from human brains in processing language? We employed an LLM-based approach to automatically propose hypotheses explaining the elements of human brain responses that cannot be well explained by language models. Social/emotional intelligence and physical commonsense emerged as the two dominant themes. After fine-tuning GPT-2 XL on datasets related to these themes, we observed an improved alignment between LM predictions and human brain responses.

Limited by the availability of datasets with aligned brain data, our study was conducted on a relatively narrow range of texts. While we observed consistent patterns across two language modalities, it is important to note that both datasets utilized were exclusively narrative stories. This limited scope raises the possibility that additional, undetected divergences exist, potentially obscured by the quantity of text and the methodology employed for hypothesis generation from the sentences. By developing more robust tools for pattern discovery and incorporating a wider array of textual materials, our approach can be adapted to more comprehensively address the question in future studies.
