###### Abstract

Federated learning (FL) offers a machine learning paradigm that protects privacy, allowing multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model while only accessing their local data. Recent research in FL has increasingly focused on improving the uniformity of model performance across clients, a fairness principle known as egalitarian fairness. However, achieving egalitarian fairness in FL may sacrifice the model performance for data-rich clients to benefit those with less data. This trade-off raises concerns about the stability of FL, as data-rich clients may opt to leave the current coalition and join another that is more closely aligned with its expected high performance. In this context, our work rigorously addresses the critical concern: _Does egalitarian fairness lead to instability?_ Drawing from game theory and social choice theory, we initially characterize fair FL systems as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs) and reveal that the instability issues emerging from the pursuit of egalitarian fairness are significantly related to the clients' altruism within the coalition and the configuration of the friends-relationship networks among the clients. Then, we theoretically propose the optimal egalitarian fairness bounds that an FL coalition can achieve while maintaining core stability under various types of altruistic behaviors. The theoretical contributions clarify the quantitative relationships between achievable egalitarian fairness and the disparities in the sizes of local datasets, disproving the misconception that egalitarian fairness inevitably leads to instability. Finally, we conduct experiments to evaluate the consistency of our theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds with the empirically achieved egalitarian fairness in fair FL settings.

## 1 Introduction

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a significant learning paradigm in which clients utilize their local data to train a global model collaboratively without sharing data and has attracted researchers from various fields, especially in domains where data privacy and security are critical, such as healthcare, finance, and social networks . In vanilla FLs, different clients sharing the same global model may experience varying performance (i.e., error) due to differences in the amount of data contributed by each client. As clients may lack access to significant data resources due to objective or unavoidable factors, such as regional specificity and historical inequalities, recent works  have focused on ensuring that the performance of global model across the clients roughly comparable or even equal, termed as "egalitarian fairness". In FLs complying with egalitarian fairness, the performance of the global model on clients contributing high data resources may decrease to enhance the performance on other clients contributing lower data resources, particularly when local datasets are heterogeneous. This case could potentially cause higher-resource clients to leave the current grand coalition and form a sub-coalition to achieve desired performance, thereby disrupting the core stability  of the FL. In game theory, a coalition is said to be core-stable if no sub-coalition exists such that the players of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff no less than they are allocated in the original coalition and at least one player of that sub-coalition can obtain a payoff greater than it was allocated in the original coalition. Otherwise, the original coalition is said to be blocked.

Prior works  have primarily examined the effects of pursuing performance optimality on the core stability of FLs, leaving the effect of fairness unexplored. These works view the FL process as a hedonic game  and assume that clients are selfish, with clients' utility functions being their own performance and only influenced by other individuals in the same coalition. However, in the real world, clients' behaviors are more complex: clients may form friends-relationships and exhibit altruism towards each other. Various external factors, such as commercial ties, welfare purpose, or shared research interests, etc, influence the relationships between clients. For instance, branches of the same corporation can be considered as _friends_ due to common commercial goals. In contrast, branches from rival companies may be viewed as _non-friend_s. Hospitals collaborating on developing a diagnostic model for welfare purposes can also be regarded as _friend_s. Under altruistic behavior, a player's utility depends not only on their own performance but also on the performance of their friends. Furthermore, altruistic behaviors in FL, which have been largely overlooked in previous work, are particularly crucial when considering the impact of egalitarian fairness on stability. Altruistic behaviors influence the willingness of clients to sacrifice a certain degree from optimal performance . Considering the friend-relationships, Nguyen et al.  introduced altruistic hedonic games (AHGs), wherein players gain utility from their own valuation of the current coalition and the valuation of their friends within the same coalition. However, players who are friends may not be in the same coalition, but they can still influence each other's utility in the coalitions. For instance, altruistic hospital clients might choose to leave one coalition to join another where their friend hospitals are, aiming to enhance each other's performance collaboratively. When the FL process is described as AHGs, which excludes some friends' influence on a player's altruistic behavior, it may lead to a core-stable coalition in terms of local utilities but non-Pareto optimal in local errors. An alternative coalition structure exists where each client encounters an error not higher than that observed within the core-stable coalition structure, with at least one client experiencing a lower error.

In this context, we pose the following open questions: _How does egalitarian fairness affect the stability of FLs? How does this impact vary when clients exhibit altruistic behaviors? What is the optimal egalitarian fairness that a stable FL can achieve?_

**Our contributions.** We initiate discussions to address the above questions by proposing the game model under altruistic behaviors in Section 4. Based on the degree of altruism, we define three types of client behavior: purely selfish (non-altruistic), purely altruistic, and friendly altruistic. Existing research on egalitarian fairness mainly involves two implementations: optimizing the global model towards the worst-performing client  or simultaneously to all clients . Correspondingly, we further distinguish altruism into a min-based and a mean-based aggregation of the friends' performance: welfare altruism and equal altruism. We model the collaborative training involving clients with altruistic behavior as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs), where clients' utilities depend on a network of friends via one of the above cases of altruism. We theoretically demonstrate that the ACFGs result in a core-stable grand coalition, which is also Pareto-optimal in local errors.

In Section 5, we demonstrate in detail that egalitarian fairness does not necessarily lead to instability; rather, it depends on the behaviors of the clients and the topology of the friends-relationship networks. We theoretically propose the optimal egalitarian fairness bounds that a core-stable FL can obtain. These bounds are functions of the disparities between the dataset sizes within the clients' friends network and the global minimal one. The established fairness bounds can be utilized to set a reasonable level of fairness in fair FLs. The proofs for these fairness bounds are modular. Beyondestablishing tight fairness bounds, part of the contribution of this work lies in the analysis methodology used to derive these bounds.

The main contributions in this paper are primarily theoretical. However, we also conduct experiments to assess the consistency of the theoretically proposed fairness bounds with the empirically achieved fairness in fair FLs.

## 2 Related work

**Stability in FL.** Existing results on stability in FL mainly focus on a particular aspect of the entire issue. For instance, Donahue et al.  have first formulated the model sharing problem as a hedonic game, in which each player derives some cost (error) from the coalition they join. The aim of their research is to identify the conditions when the grand coalition or partitions of players are stable for varying federation aggregation mechanisms. In their subsequent work , they have further contributed to calculating an optimal (minimum error) federating arrangement and analyzing the differences between stable arrangements and optimal arrangements using the canonical game-theoretic tools of the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability. Chaudhury et al.  have defined a fairness concept based on core stability, which requires that no subset of agents can benefit significantly than in grand coalition, and proposed CoreFed, an FL protocol to implement a core-stable predictor. Blum et al.  have proposed a stable and envy-free equilibrium-based collaboration protocol to meet the client's learning objectives while keeping their local data collection burden low. However, the impact of fairness on FL stability remains unexplored in existing work. Moreover, current research on the stability of FL is limited to the assumption of selfish individuals who compete with each other to win the game and maximize their own profits.

**Altruism in game theory.** From more background on game theory and social choice theory, altruism [22; 23; 24] has been considered for cooperative games to date, in which the players' payoffs in the resulting game do not only depend on their individual payoffs but also on the neighborhood graph and the aggregation functions that reflect the social context. Numerous studies [25; 26; 27; 28] have highlighted the ubiquity and rationality of human altruism from economic, neural, and evolutionary perspectives. Rothe  has systematically introduced certain notions of altruism into existing game-theoretic models in both non-cooperative and cooperative games. Kerkmann et al.  have formally distinguished three degrees of altruism: selfish-first, equal-treatment, and altruistic-treatment preferences and studied both the axiomatic properties and the computational complexity of stability in altruistic hedonic games. In their other work , they have additionally studied stability notions and computational analysis of altruism in coalition formation games. These works in game theory, where altruistic players only prefer coalitions with more friends, are constrained in the FL setting when additional model performance on both the player and their friends need to be considered.

## 3 Preliminaries

**Model and assumptions.** Let's consider a setup involving \(N\) clients, where the \(i\)-client possesses a local dataset \(_{i}\) of size \(n_{i}\). The local datasets are samples drawn from data distribution \(P_{i}(y|x)\). Each client can train a model \(\) with parameter \(_{i}\) locally, resulting in \(P((x,_{i})|x) P_{i}(y|x)\). In addition to local training, clients can participate in collaborative training with other clients and form an FL coalition, denoted as \(\). Within this coalition, clients share their local model parameters. These shared parameters are then aggregated according to a specific rule, \(=(n_{i}_{i})}{_{i}n_{i}}\).

The above weighted aggregation known as FedAvg  is a widely used FL aggregation mechanism. We measure the aggregated global model's performance on the client's local dataset in the coalition through the expected error \(err_{i}()=_{x,y_{i}}[\|(x, )-y\|]\). A lower \(err_{i}()\) implies that the coalition \(\) is more valuable for the \(i\)-th client. To determine a tight fairness bound, an FL model that gives exact errors for each client is necessary. Therefore, we build our work on the mean estimation task developed by Donahue et al. , which develops the closed-form local errors as in Lemma 1. It's important to note that while we utilize this model, the questions posed by Donahue et al.  significantly differ from the focus of this paper: they focused on developing the error models in FL setting and identifying the stable conditions for selfish-clients forming coalitions, while our work explores the relations between fairness and core-stability in FL settings when clients exhibit altruistic behaviors.

**Lemma 1**: _(Corollary 4.3 in ) In an FL setting with \(N\) clients, each client possesses a local dataset \(_{i}\) of size \(n_{i}\). The local dataset of each client \(_{i}\) is with mean \(_{i}\) and standard deviation \(_{i}\), where \((_{i},_{i}^{2})\). When FL trains a global model for mean estimation and employs FedAvg for aggregation, the expected mean squared error (MSE) for a client with \(n_{i}\) samples within coalition \(\) is as follows,_

\[err_{i}()=}{_{j}n_{j}}+^{2} n_{j}^{2}+(_{j,j i}n_{j})^ {2}}{(_{j}n_{j})^{2}},\] (1)

_where \(_{e}=_{(_{i},_{i}^{2})}[_{i }^{2}]\) denotes the expected value of the variance of the dataset distribution, and \(^{2}=var(_{i})\) denotes the variance between the means of the clients' local datasets._

**Fairness definition.** We explore egalitarian fairness in Definition 1, a fairness notion that assesses whether the global model exhibits equitable performance across clients with varying data resources.

**Definition 1**: _(Egalitarian fairness) For the clients within a coalition \(\) holding datasets of varying sizes \(\{n_{1},n_{2},...,n_{N}\}\) and experiencing errors \(\{err_{1}(),err_{2}(),...,err_{N}()\}\), the coalition structure \(\) satisfy \(\)-egalitarian fairness if there exists a constant \(\) such that,_

\[()}{err_{j}()},n_{i} n_{j}.\] (2)

Here, \(\) is the fairness bound. When \(=1\), the coalition \(\) is said to satisfy strict egalitarian fairness.

## 4 Game model

Before delving into the impact of fairness on the stability of the FL, we first define the concepts from the perspective of game theory and social choice theory. All proofs for this section are in Appendix.

**Definition 2**: _(Value) In the context of collaborative gaming, the value quantifies the payoff accrued to the \(i\)-th player as a result of participating within the current coalition \(\). Within the framework of FL, the value is defined as the error of the global model evaluated on the \(i\)-th client's local dataset as \(v_{i}()=err_{i}()\)._

**Definition 3**: _(Friend) In a broader sociological context, the friend is considered the most intimate, trustful, and voluntarily chosen tie people maintain. Within the framework of FL, the friend set of the \(i\)-th client, denoted as \(F_{i}\), is defined as the clients whose value is also expected to be better when \(i\)-th client makes a coalition participation decision._

**Definition 4**: _(Core stability) The grand coalition \(_{g}\) (the coalition consisting of all players) is considered to be core-stable if there does not exist nonempty sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\) such that \(_{s}_{i}_{g}\) for \( i_{s}\), where \(\) is used to denote a preference relation. In other words, no nonempty sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\) blocks \(_{g}\)._

Based on the above notions, we define _altruism_ in FL as the client's choice to remain within or exit the existing coalition \(\), influenced by the acquired values of their friends \( f F_{i}\). Previous research on egalitarian fairness has primarily focused on two approaches: optimizing the global model towards the worst-performing client  or simultaneously to all clients . Correspondingly, we classify altruism into two categories: _welfare altruism_ and _equal altruism_. In the case of _welfare altruism_, a client's primary concern is for the friend who is in the worst situation. On the other hand, _equal altruism_ implies that a client shows equal concern for all friends. The aggregate values for _welfare_ and _equal altruism_ are defined as \(_{f F_{i}}(\{v_{f}()\})\) and \(|}_{f F_{i}}v_{f}()\), respectively.

### Client behavior

We divide client behavior into three types based on the degree of altruism: _purely selfish (non-altruistic), purely altruistic_ and _friendly altruistic_.

* **Purely selfish**: A _purely selfish_ client opts to stay or leave the current coalition \(\), based solely on its own value, i.e., according to value definition, a _purely selfish_ client prefers to join a coalition that offers a lower value \(v_{i}\) and conversely, to leave a coalition that results in a higher value \(v_{i}\). The utility function of a _purely selfish_ client is defined as \(u_{i}^{ps}()=v_{i}()\).

* **Purely altruistic**: A _purely altruistic_ client chooses to stay or leave the current coalition \(\), only based on the value received by its friends. Corresponding to _welfare_ and _equal altruism_, the utilities of a _purely altruistic_ client are defined as \(u_{i}^{pa}()=_{f F_{i}}(\{v_{f}()\})\) and \(u_{i}^{pa}()=|}_{f F_{i}}v_{f}()\), respectively.
* **Friendly altruistic**: A _friendly altruistic_ client decides whether to stay or leave the current coalition, \(\), based on its own value and the value its friends receive. Corresponding to _welfare_ and _equal altruism_, the utility function of a _friendly altruistic_ client is defined as \(u_{i}^{fa}()=w v_{i}()+(1-w)_{f F_{i}\{i\}}( \{v_{f}()\})\) and \(u_{i}^{fa}()=w v_{i}()+(1-w)|+1} _{f F_{i}\{i\}}v_{f}()\) respectively, where \(w(0,1)\) is selfishness degree parameter.

Given two coalitions \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\), \(_{1}_{i}_{2}\) occurs if and only if \(u_{i}(_{1}) u_{i}(_{2})\). Donahue et al.  have established the sufficient conditions for achieving _core-stability_ under the assumption of selfish clients, as in Lemma 2. Building upon their findings, we further introduce these conditions to cover scenarios of altruistic behaviors, as in Corollary 1.

**Lemma 2**: _(Lemma 10 in ) When clients are purely selfish, for a set of clients with \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\), the grand coalition \(_{g}\) is core-stable._

**Corollary 1**: _For a set of players where \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\), the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable when the clients are either purely altruistic or friendly altruistic. The proof is provided in Appendix A.2._

### Altruism hedonic game vs. altruism coalition formation game

Existing research [12; 14; 32] views FL as a hedonic game, where the players only care about the identity of the players in their coalition. Correspondingly, within the framework of the altruism hedonic game (AHG), the set of friends influencing the \(i\)-th client's participation decision is confined to \(F_{i} F_{i}_{i}\), where \(_{i}\) represents the coalition to which the \(i\)-th client belongs. In AHG, excluding some friends from a client's altruistic behavior can result in a core-stable coalition structure that is non-Pareto optimal in terms of local errors. The non-Pareto optimal indicates that an alternative coalition structure can be established where each client encounters an error not higher than that observed within the core-stable coalition structure, with at least one client experiencing a lower error. Such a core-stable coalition structure contradicts the assumption of rationality among clients. For example, Table 1 shows the error and utility of \(4\) friendly welfare altruistic (\(w=0.5\)) clients in the mean estimation task. In a fully connected friends-relationship network (Relation I in Figure 1), we first employ the AHG model to analyze the FL system. We recognize that the core-stable coalition structure \(}=\{\{1,2\},\{3\},\{4 \}\}\) is non-Pareto optimal in local errors as there exists another alternative structure, i.e., \(_{alter}=\{\{1,2,3\},\{4\}\}\), in which the errors are not greater than in \(_{stable}\) (i.e., \(err_{i}(_{alter}) err_{i}(_{stable}), i\{1,2,3,4\}\)) and at least one client exhibits less error than that in \(_{stable}\) (i.e., \(err_{i}(_{alter}) err_{i}(_{stable}), i\{1,2,3\}\)). To ensure a core-stable coalition structure that guarantees Pareto optimality and adheres to the rationality assumptions of the players, we model the FL process with altruistic behavior as an altruism coalition formation game (ACFG), where a client's utility is derived from the entire friend-network, regardless of whether the friends belong to the same coalition as the client. The ACFG fully captures the impact of altruistic behavior on a client's decision to stay or leave a coalition; for example, a client may opt to leave the current coalition to satisfy the needs of friends in other coalitions, a scenario that AHG can not capture. As shown in Table 1, the core-stable coalition structure of a fully connected friends-relationship network under ACFG, \(}=\{\{1,2,3,4\}\}\), is Pareto-optimal in local errors across clients.

**Proposition 1**: _(Pareto-optimality in error, Appendix A.3) Consider the FL system described as an ACFG, a core-stable coalition structure is also Pareto-optimal in local errors across all clients._

## 5 Egalitarian fairness bound in core-stable federated learning

### Does egalitarian fairness lead to instability?

To achieve egalitarian fairness in FL [4; 5; 20; 6; 7; 8], resource-advantaged clients may sacrifice local error to improve error uniformity of global model across all participants, creating a motivation for these resource-advantaged clients to leave the FL framework. In this part, we initially reveal the factors that impact the emergence of issue "_egalitarian fairness leads to instability_". As demonstrated in Table 1, the most egalitarian fair coalition structure is grand coalition, \(_{G}=\{_{g}\}=\{\{1,2,3,4\}\}\), with a fairness bound \(=1.306/0.734 1.78\). When all clients are purely selfish and focus solely on minimizing their local error, the coalition structure \(_{G}\) is not core-stable. The current core stable coalition structure is \(_{}=\{\{1,2,3\}\,,\,\{4\}\}\) with a fairness bound \(=1.375/0.666 2.06\). However, when clients exhibit altruistic behavior, and the friends-relationship network is fully connected (Relation I), the most egalitarian fair coalition structure \(}=}=\{\{1,2,3,4\}\}\) with a fairness bound \(=1.306/0.734 1.78\) is also core stable. The finding demonstrates whether "_egalitarian fairness leads to instability_" is influenced by the clients' behavior. Furthermore, when the friends-relationship network among the clients changes to partially connected (Relation II), leading to the coalition structure \(_{G}=\{\{1,2,3,4\}\}\) becoming not core-stable anymore and the current core stable coalition structure is \(}=\{\{1,2,3\}\,,\,\{4\}\}\) with a fairness bound \(=1.375/0.666 2.06\). The observation demonstrates that, under altruistic behaviors, the diverse friends-relationship networks also impact whether "_egalitarian fairness leads to instability_".

From the above analysis, we observe a varying optimal fairness achieved within the core-stable coalition under diverse client behaviors and friends-relationship networks, highlighting a significant problem to guide the setting of fairness in FL_: for an FL system, what is the optimal egalitarian fairness that can be achieved without compromising the core-stability of the FL system_?

### Optimal egalitarian fairness bound

We define a distance function to measure the dataset size of a client relative to all other clients within the same coalition \(\),

\[d(,n_{j})=(_{i}n_{i}^{2}-n_{j}^{2})+(_{i}n _{i}-n_{j})^{2}.\] (3)

Given the grand coalition \(_{g}\) in an FL system consists of a set of \(N\) clients with local dataset size \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\) and based on the properties of mean estimation task in Corollary 1, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) is core-stable. In this context, we give the tight egalitarian fairness bound achieved by \(_{g}\) in Proposition 2\(\) 6. For any coalition \(_{s}_{g}\), we unify the common notations to represent the data size within this subset and its complement, as well as the specific individual indices in Table 2.

**Proposition 2**: _(Optimal egalitarian fairness under purely selfish behaviors, Appendix A.4.1) Considering all clients act purely selfish, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}} }^{2} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{{N_{s}}^{2}}\},\; where\;k_{_{s}}=_{i_{s}}\{n_{i}\}.\] (4)

Proposition 2 demonstrates that an increase in the heterogeneity of clients' local dataset sizes--reflected by _the difference between the smallest dataset size overall and those within any given subset coalition_--the achievable egalitarian fairness of a core-stable grand coalition becomes poorer. Furthermore, we can obtain a sufficient condition for achieving strict egalitarian fairness (\(=1\)) in a core-stable coalition with purely selfish clients based on Equation (4).

**Corollary 2**: _The core-stable grand coalition \(_{g}\), comprising all selfish clients, can asymptotically achieve strict egalitarian fairness, provided that the local dataset sizes of all clients are equal. The proof is given in Appendix A.4.2._

**Proposition 3**: _(Optimal egalitarian fairness under purely welfare altruistic behaviors, Appendix A.4.3) Considering all clients act purely welfare altruistic, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{(}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}}}^{2} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{{N _{s}}^{2}}),}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}}}^{2} n _{l}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{{N_{c}} n_{l}+d(_{c},{f_{g}}^{2},2)}\}, \\ where\\ k_{_{s},1}=_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i}_{s}}n_{f} \},k_{_{s},2}=_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i}_ {c}}n_{f}\},\\ f_{_{s},1}^{opt}=_{f F_{_{_{s},1}}_{s}}n_{f},f_{_{s},2}^{opt}=_{f F_{_{_{s},2}}_{c}}n_{f}.\] (5)

Proposition 3 demonstrates that the achieved egalitarian fairness declines as the gap between _the smallest dataset size overall and the smallest dataset size within any given friends-relationship network_ increases. This gap is significantly smaller than that in purely selfish cases, thereby facilitating improved egalitarian fairness and creating a more relaxed condition for achieving strict egalitarian fairness as in Corollary 3.

**Corollary 3**: _The core-stable grand coalition \(_{g}\), consisting of purely welfare clients, can asymptotically achieve strict egalitarian fairness if all clients are friends with the client possessing the smallest dataset size and \(N_{g}\). The proof is given in Appendix A.4.4._

**Proposition 4**: _(Optimal egalitarian fairness under purely equal altruistic behaviors, Appendix A.4.5) Considering all clients act purely equal altruistic, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}(}}}|}^{2}{N_{c}}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}}}^{2} }{{N_{g}}^{2}}}^{2} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{} ),\\ where\\ k_{_{s}}=_{i_{s}}|}(_{f F_{i} _{s}}n_{f}+_{f F_{i}_{c}}n_{f}),\\ =N_{c}^{2}_{f F_{k_{_{s}}}_{s}}({N_{s} } n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{f}))+N_{s}^{2}_{f F_{k_{_{s}}} _{c}}({N_{c}} n_{l}+d(_{c},n_{f})).\] (6)

Proposition 4 shows that the egalitarian fairness bound for purely equal altruistic clients is influenced by the gap between _the smallest dataset size overall and the weighted sum of dataset sizes within any given friends-relationship network_. According to Propositions 5 and 6, the egalitarian fairness bounds in the context of friendly altruism behavior are shaped by two factors: (1) the heterogeneityof clients' local dataset sizes and (2) the difference between the smallest dataset size in the grand coalition and either the smallest dataset size or weighted sum of dataset sizes within established friends-relationship networks. The selfishness degree parameter (\(w\)) balances the relative significance of these two factors.

**Proposition 5**: _(Optimal egalitarian fairness under friendly welfare altruistic behaviors, Appendix A.4.6) Considering all clients act friendly welfare altruistic, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{(^{2}}{N_{g}{}^{2}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{_{1}}}^{2}{N_{s}}^{2}}{N_{g}{}^{2}} n_{l}+d( _{g},n_{m})}{_{2}})\},\\ where\\ k_{s,1}=_{i_{s}}\{w n_{i}+(1-w)_{f F_{i} _{s}\{i\}}n_{f}\},\\ k_{_{s},2}=_{i_{s}}\{w n_{i}+(1-w)_{f F _{i}_{s}}n_{f}\},\\ f_{_{s},1}^{opt}=_{f F_{u_{s,1}}_{s}\{u_{s,1}\}}n_{ f},f_{_{s},2}^{opt}=_{f F_{u_{s,2}}_{c}}{}^{2}n_{f},\\ _{1}=N_{s} n_{l}+w d(_{s},n_{k_{_{s,1}}})+(1-w) d (_{s},f_{_{s,1}}^{opt}),\\ _{2}=N_{c}^{2} w(N_{s} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{k_{ _{s,2}}}))+N_{s}^{2}(1-w)(N_{c} n_{l}+d(_{c},f_{ _{s,2}}^{opt})).\] (7)

**Proposition 6**: _(Optimal egalitarian fairness under friendly equal altruistic behaviors, Appendix A.4.7) Considering all clients act friendly equal altruistic, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}(}|+1}^{2}}^{2}.}{{N_ {g}}^{2}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{}),\\ where\\ k_{_{s}}=_{i_{s}}(w n_{i}+(1-w)|+1}(_{f F_{i}_{s}\{i\}}n_{f}+_{f F _{i}_{c}}n_{f})),\\ _{s}=F_{k_{_{s}}}_{s}\{k_{_{s}}\},_{c}=F_{k_{ _{s}}}_{c},\\ =w(|F_{k_{_{s}}}|+1) N_{c}^{2} (N_{s} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{k_{_{s}}}))+\\ (1-w)(N_{c}^{2}_{f_{c}}(N_{s} n _{l}+d(_{s},n_{f}))+N_{s}^{2}_{f_{c}}( N_{c} n_{l}+d(_{c},n_{f}))).\] (8)

The given propositions establish tight egalitarian fairness bounds in core-stable FLs and demonstrate that the achievable egalitarian fairness for a collection of clients varies depending on the clients' behaviors and friends-relationship networks. Furthermore, these propositions can be adapted to situations where clients exhibit heterogeneous behaviors within an FL system as follows.

### Heterogeneous behaviors

When client behaviors exhibit heterogeneity in an FL system, the achievable egalitarian fairness for a core-stable grand coalition \(_{g}\) is determined by the maximum egalitarian fairness bounds calculated across sub-coalitions formed by clients with homogeneous behaviors.

**Example 1**: _An example to calculate the achievable egalitarian fairness bound under heterogeneous behaviors is as follows: for a set of \(N\) clients, where clients \(i=\{1,2,...,S\}\) act selfishly and the remaining act purely welfare altruistic, the achieved egalitarian fairness of \(_{g}\) is bounded by,_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{\{ }^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})} }{{N_{s}} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{k_{selfish}})},(}^{2}}{{N _{g}}^{2}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}}{{N_{s}} n_{l}+d( _{s},f_{_{_{_{_{_{_{_{_{_{}}}}}}}}})}},  n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}}{{N_{c}} n_{l}+d(_{c},f_{ _{_{_{_{_{_{}}}}}}})}\}\},\\ where\\ k_{selfish}=_{i_{s}}\{n_{i}\},\\ k_{altruistic,1}=_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i} _{s}}n_{f}\},k_{altruistic,2}=_{i_{s} }\{_{f F_{i}_{c}}n_{f}\},\\ f_{altruistic,1}^{opt}=_{f F_{u_{statistic},1}_{s}}n_{f},f_{altruistic,2}^{opt}=_{f F_{u_{statistic},2}_{c}}{}^{2}n_{f}.\] (9)

## 6 Evaluation

In following experiments, we validate the tightness and applicability of the analyzed fairness bounds for the given tasks.

### Settings

To conduct the experiments, we first give a fair FL framework to implement egalitarian fairness, where a coefficient \(p\) is introduced to increase the aggregation weight of clients who received higher local errors: \(_{C}=(n_{i^{}}\ error_{i}^{p}_{i})}{ _{i C}(n_{i}\ error_{i}^{p})}\). The preceding discussions are independent of the fair FL framework chosen. We follow up on the task models proposed by Donahue et al. . The first case is a mean estimation task involving a fixed set of \(4\) players. Each player has a fixed number of samples, specifically \(\{20,40,50,100\}\). Each player draws their local data samples from their true distribution with parameters \(_{i}(_{i},_{i})\), where the samples are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.). Here, \(_{i}(=0,^{2}=1)\) and \(_{i} 125 Beta(a=8,b=2)\). To further validate the adaptability of this theoretical results, we introduce additional linear regression task with a fixed set of \(3\) players. Each player has a fixed number of samples, specifically \(\{50,100,200\}\). Each player draws \(2\)-dimensional input features from their own input distribution, \(_{i}^{1},_{i}^{2}(=0,^{2}=1)\). The output label is drawn from \(_{i} 250 Beta(a=8,b=2)\). All experiments are conducted on Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 5318Y CPU @ 2.10GHz.

### Results

We conduct the effectiveness and tightness validation of the theoretical egalitarian fairness bound across diverse scenarios include (1) different client behaviors (Figure 2), (2) different structures of friends-relationship networks (Figure 3). The results demonstrate the alignment between our theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bound (green dashed line) and the empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line) under both fully connected and partially connected friends-relationship networks.

In Appendix A.5, we conduct additional experiments to further validate the effectiveness of the theoretical results under (3) heterogeneous client behaviors (Figure 4) and (4) additional regression task (Figure 5).

## 7 Discussion and Limitations

In this section, we outline the scope of our work and identify several limitations of our theoretical and experimental results, which could serve as potential starting points for future work.

**More complex task scenarios.** This work paves the way for future research within the domain of FL. Initially, it would be insightful to explore the impact of other notions of fairness, such as proportional fairness --where a client's payoff is proportional to its data contribution--on the stability of FL. Moreover, for theoretical proofs, our work is built upon the exact-error task models developed by Donahue et al. ; future work could be extended to more complex collaborative training tasks. Initially, we chose the maximum and linear weighting of errors to construct the utility functions

Figure 2: Fully connected: theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds (green dashed line) align with empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line) under different client behaviors.

because they are simple and typical examples for theoretical analysis. Moving forward, our key theoretical ideas can be extended to a broader class of utility functions in the form of generalized mean, which encompasses many prominent social welfare functions, i.e., weighted power-mean welfare function  (as in Appendix A.4.8).

**Incentive Mechanisms and Client Behavior Dynamics.** As we discover the bounds of egalitarian fairness that a stable coalition can achieve, a practical question arises: How can we correspondingly design suitable incentive mechanisms to retain clients in the coalition when high egalitarian fairness is a mandatory requirement? Given that altruism is closely related to stability when pursuing fairness, further exploration into how various human behaviors--such as reciprocity, bounded rationality, risk aversion, and risk tolerance--impact the stability of FLs in achieving specific objectives would be of profound interest.

**Overfitting.** Centering on exploring the relationship between egalitarian fairness and stability, we use the stylized model in Lemma 1, which provides a closed-form error to derive precise relations and generate insights into fairness settings in fair FLs. However, overfitting  in machine learning leads to uncertainty in the error outlined in Equation 1, which is influenced by model structure and parameters, choice of training algorithms, and the specific data distributions of clients, etc. Extending our theoretical analysis to establish fairness bounds in specific model states, such as overfitting, is considerably more complex and remains an open area of research; however, our approach may still provide a valuable foundation for further exploration.

## 8 Conclusion

In this work, we have rigorously answered a previously unexplored but critical question: _Does egalitarian fairness lead to instability?_ Through our analysis, we have explored the influence of clients' altruistic behaviors and the configuration of the friend-relationship network on the achievable egalitarian fairness within a core-stable federated learning (FL) coalition. Our research has identified the optimal egalitarian fairness bounds without compromising core stability from a theoretical standpoint. The outcomes of our research can be leveraged to establish appropriate egalitarian fairness in FL implementation, which plays a crucial role in improving the alignment of FL processes with societal welfare and ethical standards.

Appendix

### Monotonicity of error with dataset size

**Lemma 3**: _(Monotonicity) For any two clients within the same coalition, \(i,j\), if \(n_{i}>n_{j}\), \(err_{i}()<err_{j}()\). Conversely, if \(err_{i}<err_{j}\), \(n_{i}>n_{j}\)._

* _Based on the exact errors in Lemma_ 1_, it's natural that if \(n_{i}>n_{j}\), \(err_{i}()<err_{j}()\). Denote \(N_{s}=_{k}n_{k},_{s}=_{k}n_{k}^{2}\), if \(err_{i}<err_{j}\), it holds that,_ \[}{N_{s}}+^{2}_{s}-n_{i }^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{i})^{2}}{N_{s}^{2}}<}{N_{s}}+^{2} {_{s}-n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{j})^{2}}{N_{s}^{2}}\\  N_{s} n_{i}}{N_{s}^{2}}< N_{s} n_{j}}{N_{s}^{2}} n_{i}>n_{j}.\] (10)

### Core-stable conditions

**Corollary 1** For a set of players where \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\), the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable when the clients are either purely altruistic or friendly altruistic.

* _In a grand coalition_ \(_{g}\) _comprising_ \(N\) _clients, each client holds a local dataset with size_ \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\)_. Based on Lemma_ 2_, when_ \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\)_, it holds that_ \(err_{i}(_{g}) err_{i}(_{s})\)_. Whether within_ \(_{g}\) _or a subset_ \(_{s}_{g}\)_, the_ \(i\)_-th purely welfare altruistic client focuses on the same friend, that is, the_ \(k\)_-th client, where_ \(=}{arg}\{n_{f}\}\)_,_

\[err_{k}(_{g}) err_{k}(_{s})}{} (\{err_{f}(_{g})\})}{}(\{err_ {f}(_{s})\}), i,_{s}_{g}.\] (11)

_Therefore, the_ \(_{g}\) _is core-stable for purely welfare altruistic clients. For the purely equal altruistic client, the optimal individual error under_ \(_{g}\) _also leads to the optimality of the average multi-individual error and the following equation holds:_

\[|}_{f F_{i}}err_{f}(_{g})|}_{ f F_{i}}err_{f}(_{s}), i,_{s}_{g}.\] (12)

_Therefore, the_ \(_{g}\) _is core-stable for purely equal altruistic clients._

_The utilities of friendly altruistic clients are a weighted combination of the utilities under selfish and purely altruistic behaviors. According to the established core-stability when clients are selfish and purely altruism, the condition \(n_{i}}{^{2}}\) facilitates utility minimization within the grand coalition \(_{g}\) for clients with selfish and purely altruistic behaviors. Thus, this condition also leads to the utilities within the grand coalition \(_{g}\) being minimized for clients exhibiting friendly altruistic behaviors._

### Pareto-Optimality

**Proportion 1** (Pareto-Optimality in error) Consider the FL system described as an ACFG, a core-stable coalition structure is also Pareto-optimal in local errors across all clients.

* _We prove the Proportion 1 by contradiction. Consider_ \(N\) _clients. Assume that a core-stable coalition structure_ \(_{CS}\) _is not Pareto-optimal. Then, there exists a Pareto-optimal coalition structure_ \(_{PO}\) _that satisfies the following conditions:_ \[err_{i}(_{CS}) err_{i}(_{PO} ), i\{N\},\\ err_{j}(_{CS}) err_{j}(_{PO}), j \{N\}.\] (13)

_For clients exhibit altruism with selfishness degree parameter_ \(w\)_, it holds that:_

\[w v_{j}(_{CS})+(1-w) v_{k F_{j} \{j\}}(_{CS})>w v_{j}(_{PO})+ (1-w) v_{k F_{j}\{j\}}(_{PO}),\] (14)

_which is contradicts the assumption of_ \(_{CS}\) _is core-stable. Based on the above, a core-stable federation structure is also Pareto-optimal under ACFG._

### Egalitarian fairness bound

#### a.4.1 Proof of Proposition 2

**Proposition 2** (Optimal egalitarian fairness under purely selfish behaviors) Considering all clients act purely selfish, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{}^{2}}{{N_{s}}^{2}} }^{2} n_{i}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{{N_{s}} n_{ i}+d(_{g},n_{n_{s}})}\},\]

\[where\]

\[k_{_{s}}=_{i_{s}}\{n_{i}\}.\] (15)

**Proof** _In a coalition structure with \(N\) clients, denoted by \(_{g}=\{1,2,...,N\}\), where each client possesses a local dataset of size \(n_{j}\), the concept of \(\)-egalitarian fairness stipulates that \((_{g})}{err_{j}(_{g})},\ n_{i} n_{j}\). In a context where clients are purely selfish, the coalition \(_{g}\) maintains core-stable if, for any potential sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\), there is at least one client who prefers \(_{g}\) over \(_{s}\), this means that \( i_{s},u_{i}(_{g}) u_{i}(_{s})\), or equivalently, \( i_{s},err_{i}(_{g}) err_{i}(_{s})\). According to the egalitarian fairness definition, it holds that,_

\[err_{i}(_{g})(_{g})\}_{j=1}^{N}}{}.\] (16)

_To satisfy for \(_{s}_{g}\), \( i_{s},err_{i}(_{g}) err_{i}(_{s})\), the lowest \(\) is bounded by Equation (17)._

\[(_{g})\}_{i=1}^{N}}{}_{_{s} _{g}}\{_{i_{s}}\{err_{i}(_{s})\}\}.\] (17)

_Based on Lemma 3, we denote \(m=}{arg}\{err_{i}(_{g})\}=}{arg}\{n_{i}\}\) and \(k_{_{s}}=}{arg}\{err_{i}\}=}{arg}\{n_{i}\}\), then the above equation is equivalent to,_

\[(_{g})}{}_{_{s}_{g}}\{err_{ k_{_{s}}}(_{s})\}.\] (18)

_We first give the lowest fairness bound \(\) for a specific \(_{s}\),_

\[(_{g})}{} err_{k_{_{s}}}(_{s}).\] (19)

_Based on Lemma 1, the above equation can be transformed as,_

\[}{_{i_{g}}n_{i}}+^{2} ,i m}n_{i}^{2}+(_{i_{g},i m}n_{i} )^{2}}{(_{i_{g}}n_{i})^{2}}\\ (}{_{i_{g}}n_{i}}+^{2} ,i h_{_{g}}}n_{i}^{2}+(_{i_{s},i  k_{_{g}}}n_{i})^{2}}{(_{i_{s}}n_{i})^{2}} ).\] (20)

_Denote \(N_{s}=_{i_{s}}n_{i}\) and \(N_{g}=_{i_{g}}n_{i}\), we have,_

\[}{N_{g}}+^{2},i m}n_{i}^{2} +(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2}}{N_{g}^{2}}(} {N_{s}}+^{2},i k_{}}n_{i}^{2}+( N_{s}-n_{k_{_{s}}})^{2}}{N_{s}^{2}}).\] (21)

_Multiplying each side of the above equation by \(N_{g}^{2}N_{s}^{2}\),_

\[_{e} N_{g}}^{2}+^{2}}^{2 }(_{i_{g},i m}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2} )\\ (_{e} N_{s}}^{2}+^{2}}^{2}(_{i_{s},i h_{_{s}}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k _{_{s}}})^{2})).\] (22)

_Thus, the lowest fairness bound \(\) satisfies,_

\[ N_{g}}^{2}+^{2}}^{2 }(_{i_{g},i m}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2} )}{_{e}}^{2}+^{2}}^{2}(_{i _{s},i h_{_{s}}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k_{_{s}}})^{2} )} f_{RHS}.\] (23)_Taking the derivative of \(f_{RHS}\) with respect to \(\), we have:_

\[f^{}_{RHS,}=}N_{g^{}}{N_{s }}^{2}+^{2}}^{2}(_{i_{g},i k_{s}}n_{i} ^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2})}{(_{e^{}}N_{s}}^{2}+ ^{2}}^{2}(_{i_{g},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+ (N_{s}-n_{k_{s}})^{2}))^{2}}\\ =}N_{s}^{2}}^{2}(N_{s}- (_{i_{g},i m}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2})-{N_{g}} (_{i_{g},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k_{s}}) ^{2}))}{(_{e^{}}N_{s}}^{2}+^{2} }^{2}(_{i_{g},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s} -n_{k_{s}})^{2}))^{2}}.\] (24)

_For \(f_{1}=N_{s}_{i_{g},i m}n_{i}^{2}-N_{g}_{i_{s },i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}\), since the growth rate of \(_{i_{s},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}\) is faster than that of \(N_{s}\), it is reasonable to assume that \(f_{1}\) is decreasing with respect to \(N_{s}\). The minimum value occurs when \(_{s}=_{g}\), at which point,_

\[f_{1}=_{i_{g}}n_{i}(_{j_{g}}n_{j}^{ 2}-n_{m}^{2})-_{i_{g}}n_{i}(_{j_{g}}n_{j}^{2}-n _{k_{s}}^{2})\\ =_{i_{s}}n_{i}[(_{j_{g}}n_{j}^{2}-n_{m}^{2} )-(_{j_{g}}n_{j}^{2}-n_{k_{s}}^{2})]>0.\] (25)

_Also, \(f_{2}=N_{s}(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2}-N_{g}(N_{s}-n_{k_{s}} )^{2}>0\):_

\[f_{2}=N_{s}(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2}-N_{g} (N_{s}-n_{k_{s}})^{2}\\ =N_{s}N_{g}(N_{g}-N_{s})-N_{g}n_{k_{s}}^{2}+N_{s}n_{m}^{2}+2N_{g}N_{s}(n_{k_{s _{s}}}-n_{m})\\ =N_{g}(N_{g}N_{s}-N_{s}^{2}-n_{k_{s}}^{2}+n_{m}^{2}+2N_{s}(n_{k_{s_{s}}}-n_{m }))\\ =N_{g}(N_{s}-N_{s}^{2}+(n_{m}-N_{s})^{2}-(n_{k_{s}}-N_{s})^{ 2}}_{>0}).\] (26)

_Based on the above derivation, we can conclude that \(f^{}_{RHS,}>0\). Therefore, the maximum value of \(f_{RHS}\) occurs at the maximum value of \(^{2}\). Given our assumption that \(n_{i}}{^{2}}, i=1,...,N\), the maximum of \(^{2}\) is \(}{n_{1}},l=}{arg}\{n_{i}\}\). Consequently, the Eq. (23) transforms into,_

\[}N_{g^{}}{N_{s}}^{2}  n_{l}+_{e^{}}N_{s}^{2}(_{i_{g},i m}n_{i} ^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2})}{_{e^{}}N_{s} n_{l}+_{e^{}} N_{g^{}}^{2}(_{i_{g},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k_{s}} )^{2})}\\ =^{2}}{N_{g}}^{2}}n_{l}+(_{i _{g},i m}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2})}{N_{s} n_{l}+(_{i _{g},i k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k_{s}})^{2})}. \] (27)

_Above all, we can determine the optimal egalitarian fairness bound to maintain the core stability of the coalition structure \(_{g}\),_

\[_{_{g}_{g}}\{}^{2} }{{N_{g}}^{2}}}^{n_{l}}+(_{i_{g},i m}n_{i} ^{2}+(N_{g}-n_{m})^{2})}{{N_{s}} n_{l}+(_{i_{g},i  k_{s}}n_{i}^{2}+(N_{s}-n_{k_{s}})^{2})}\}\\ =_{_{s}_{g}}\{}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{{N_{s}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{k_{s}})}\}.\] (28)

#### a.4.2 Proof of Corollary 2

**Corollary 2** The core-stable grand coalition \(_{g}\), comprising all selfish clients, can asymptotically achieve strict egalitarian fairness, provided that the local dataset sizes of all clients are equal.

**Proof** _Let's consider a grand coalition \(_{g}\) that consists of \(M\) clients, and a subset \(_{s}_{g}\) that consists of \(m\) clients. According to Proposition 2, when the local dataset sizes of all clients are equal, the optimal egalitarian fairness that can be achieved is:_

\[_{optimal}=_{_{s}_{g}}\{}^{2}}{{N_{g}}^{2}}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{{N_{s}}  n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{k_{s}})}\}\\ =_{_{s}_{g}}\{^{2}(M+M-1+(M-1)^{2} )}{{M}^{2}(m+m-1+(m-1)^{2})}\}=1.\] (29)

_Therefore, it is proven that the grand coalition \(_{g}\) is capable of achieving strict egalitarian fairness._

#### a.4.3 Proof of Proposition 3

**Proposition 3** (Optimal egalitarian fairness under purely welfare altruistic behaviors) Considering all clients act purely welfare altruistic, the grand coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if the achieved egalitarian fairness is bounded by:

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{(_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g}{{}_{2}}^{2}} n_{i}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{N_{s}  n_{i}+d(_{s},f^{opt}_{_{s},1})},_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g}{{}_ {2}}^{2}} n_{i}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{N_{c} n_{i}+d(_{c },f^{opt}_{_{s},2})})\},\\ where\\ k_{_{s},1}=*{arg\,min}_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i} _{s}}n_{f}\},k_{_{s},2}=*{arg\,min}_{i_{s} }\{_{f F_{i}_{c}}n_{f}\},\\ f^{opt}_{_{s},1}=*{arg\,min}_{f F_{k_{_{s},1}}_{ s}}n_{f},f^{opt}_{_{s},2}=*{arg\,min}_{f F_{k_{_{s},2}} _{c}}n_{f}.\] (30)

**Proof** _In a context where clients are purely welfare altruistic, the coalition \(_{g}\) maintains core-stable if, for any potential sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\), there is at least one client who prefers \(_{g}\) over \(_{s}\), this means that \( i_{s},u_{i}(_{g}) u_{i}(_{s})\), or equivalently,_

\[ i_{s},_{f F_{i}}(\{err_{f}(_{g})\}) (_{f F_{i}_{s}}(\{err_{f}(_{s})\}),_ {f F_{i}_{c}}(\{err_{f}(_{c})\})).\] (31)

_where \(_{c}=_{g}_{s}\) is the complement of \(_{s}\). Consequently, to maintain the stability of FL, we can determine the lower bound of \(\) by,_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}((_{i_{s}}\{ _{f F_{i}_{s}}err_{f}(_{s})\},_{i_{s}}\{ _{f F_{i}_{c}}err_{f}(_{c})\})).\] (32)

_The fairness bound \(\) with respect to a specific \(_{s}\) is,_

\[(_{g})}{}(_{f F _{_{s},1}_{s}}err_{f}(_{s}),_{f F_{k_{_{s},2}}_ {c}}err_{f}(_{c}))\\  14.226378pt=(err_{f^{opt}_{_{s},1}}(_{s}),err_{f^{opt}_ {_{s},2}}(_{c})),\] (33)

_where,_

\[m=arg_{i_{g}}\{err_{i}(_{g})\}= arg_{i_{g}}\{n_{i}\},\\ k_{_{s},1}=arg_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i}}err_{f}(_{s}) \}=}{arg}\{_{f F_{i}_{s}} n_{f}\},\\ k_{_{s},2}=arg\{_{f F_{i}_{c}}err_{f}(_{c}) \}=arg_{i_{s}}\{_{f F_{i}_{c}}n_{f}\},\\ f^{opt}_{_{s},1}=arg_{f F_{k_{_{s},1}}_{s}}err_{f}(_{s}) =arg_{f F_{k_{_{s},1}}_{s}}n_{f},\\ f^{opt}_{_{s},2}=arg_{f F_{k_{_{s},2}}_{c}}err_{f}(_{c}) =arg_{f F_{k_{_{s},2}}_{c}}n_{f}.\] (34)

_Following the same derivation as in the proof of Proposition 2, the above equation is equivalent to,_

\[((_{g})}{err_{f^{opt}_{ _{s},1}}(_{s})},(_{g})}{err_{f^{opt}_{_{s},2}}(_{c})})\\  14.226378pt=(_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g}{{}_{2}}^{2}}  n_{i}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{N_{s} n_{i}+d(_{s},f^{opt}_{ _{s},1})},_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g}{{}_{2}}^{2}} n _{i}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{N_{c} n_{i}+d(_{c},f^{opt}_{_{s},2})} ),\] (35)

_where_

\[l=arg_{i_{g}}\{n_{i}\},N_{g}=_{i_{g}}n_{i},N_{s}= _{i_{s}}n_{i},N_{c}=_{i_{c}}n_{i}.\] (36)

_Above all,we can determine the optimal egalitarian fairness bound to maintain the core stability of the coalition structure \(_{g}\),_

\[_{_{s}_{g}}\{(_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g }{{}_{2}}^{2}} n_{i}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{N_{s} n_{i}+d( _{s},f^{opt}_{_{s},1})},_{2}}^{2}}{N_{g}{{}_{2}}^{2}}  n_{i}+d(_{s},n_{m})}{N_{c} n_{i}+d(_{c},f^{opt}_{ _{s},2})})\}.\] (37)

#### a.4.4 Proof of Corollary 3

**Corollary 3** The core-stable grand coalition \(_{g}\), consisting of purely welfare clients, can asymptotically achieve strict egalitarian fairness if all clients are friends with the client possessing the smallest dataset size and \(N_{g}\).

**Proof** _When all clients are friends with the client possessing the smallest dataset size, it holds that \(f_{_{s}}^{opt}=m\) or \(f_{n_{c}}^{opt}=m\). Assume that \(f_{_{s}}^{opt}=m\), Corollary 3 can be proven by mathematical induction as follows. Define the hypothesis \(H_{0}\) as:_

\[H_{0}: n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{N_{g} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{m} )} 1,_{s}_{g}.\] (38)

_When \(_{s}\) contains only one player \(_{s}=\{n_{j}\}\), we have,_

\[}^{2}}{N_{g}} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{n_{j}  n_{l}+,n_{m})}_{}} }{=}}{N_{g}}}_{}+}{n_{l}} }n_{i}^{2}-n_{m}^{2}}{(_{i_{g}}n_{i} )^{2}}}_{}+}{n_{l}} -n_{m})^{2}}{N_{g}^{2}}}_{} 1.\] (39)

_Assume that the hypothesis \(H_{0}\) holds when \(_{s}\) contains \(k\) players, for \(_{s}^{}=\{_{s},n\}\) containing \(k+1\) players where the new player has a dataset size of \(n\), it holds that,_

\[&}^{2}(N_{g} n_{l}+d(_{ g},n_{m}))+n^{2}(N_{g} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m}))+2N_{g} n(N_{g}  n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m}))}{{N_{g}}^{2}(N_{s} n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{m})) +N_{g}^{2}(n n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m}))+2N_{s} n(N_{g} n_{l}+d( _{g},n_{m}))},\\ \] (40)

_where \(N_{s}^{}=_{i_{s}^{}}n_{i}\). As \(N_{g}\), we have,_

\[ n(N_{g} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m}))}{2N_{s} n  N_{g}^{2}}}{=}}{N_{g}}+ }n_{i}^{2}-n_{m}^{2}}{N_{g}^{2}}+-n_{m})^{2} }{N_{g}^{2}} 1.\] (41)

_Since \(H_{0}\) holds for any \(_{s}\), the terms in the numerator are each smaller than the corresponding terms in the denominator. Thus, it follows that,_

\[}^{2} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m})}{N_{g}^{2} n _{l}+d(_{g}^{2},n_{m})}}{{N_{g}}^{2} n_{l}+d(_{g}^{2},n_{m})} 1.\] (42)

_Therefore, the hypothesis \(H_{0}\) is established. A similar mathematical induction process can be applied to \(_{c}\). Thus, \(_{optimal}\) can approach less than \(1\) under the given conditions, proving the Corollary 3._

#### a.4.5 Proof of Proposition 4

_Following the same derivation as in the proof of Proposition 2, the above equation is equivalent to,_

**Proof** _(Proposition 6) In a context where clients are friendly equal altruistic, the coalition \(_{g}\) maintains core-stable if, for any potential sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\), there is at least one client who prefers \(_{g}\) over \(_{s}\), this means that \( i_{s},u_{i}(_{g}) u_{i}(_{s})\), or equivalently,_

#### a.4.8 Fairness Bound Analysis under Generalized-Mean-Form Utility Function

Taking the weighted power-mean welfare function  to construct utility function as an example and considering scenarios where clients exhibit friendly equal altruism, the utility of the \(i\)-th client is:

\[u_{i}(_{g})=(_{i=1}^{|F_{i}|}w_{i}err_{i}^{q}( _{g}))^{}.\] (68)

The coalition \(_{g}\) remains core-stable if, for any potential sub-coalition \(_{s}_{g}\), there is at least one client who prefers \(_{g}\) over \(_{s}\). This implies that \( i_{s},u_{i}(_{g}) u_{i}(_{s})\), or equivalently,

\[(_{i=1}^{|F_{i}|}w_{i}err_{i}^{q}(_{g}))^{ }(w_{i} err_{i}^{q}(_{s})+_{f F_{i} _{s}}w_{f}err_{f}^{q}(_{s})+_{f F_{i}_{c}}w_{f }err_{f}^{q}(_{c}))^{}.\] (69)

Consequently, to maintain the stability of FL, we can determine the lowest fairness bound of \(\) by,

\[(_{i=1}^{|F_{i}|}w_{i}^{q} (_{g})\}_{i=1}^{N}}{})^{}\]

\[_{_{s}_{g}}(_{i_{s}}(w_{i} err_{i}^{q}( _{s})+_{f F_{i}_{s}}w_{f} err_{f}^{q}(_{s})+ _{f F_{i}_{c}}w_{f} err_{f}^{q}(_{c}))^{ }).\] (70)

The lowest fairness bound \(\) with respect to a specific \(_{s}\) is,

\[(_{g})}{}(w_{k_{_{s}}} err_{k_{_{s}}}^{q}(_{s})+ _{f_{r}}w_{f} err_{f}^{q}(_{s})+_{f _{c}}w_{f} err_{f}^{q}(_{c}))^{},\] (71)where,

\[_{c}=_{g}_{s},m=*{arg\,min}_{i_{g}}\{n_{i}\},\]

\[k_{_{s}}=*{arg\,min}_{i_{s}}(w_{i} n_{i}^{q}+ _{f F_{i}_{s}}w_{f} n_{f}^{q}+_{f F_{i}_{e}}w_ {f} n_{f}^{q}),\] (72)

\[_{s}=F_{k_{_{s}}}_{s},_{c}=F_{k_{_{s}}}_{c}.\]

Following the same derivation as in the proof of Proposition 2, the above equation is equivalent to,

\[( N_{2}}{N_{g}{}^{2}})^{q} n_{i}+d(_{g},n_{m}))^{q}}{},\] (73)

where,

\[N_{s}=_{i_{s}}n_{i},N_{c}=_{i_{c}}n_{i},N_{g}=_{i _{g}}n_{i}.\] (74)

\[=w_{k_{_{s}}} N_{2}^{2q}(N_{s}  n_{l}+d(_{s},n_{k_{_{s}}}))^{q}\\ +N_{c}^{2q}_{f F_{c}}w_{f}(N_{s} n_{l}+d( _{s},n_{f}))^{q}\\ +N_{s}^{2q}_{f F_{c}}w_{f}(N_{c} n_{l}+d (_{c},n_{f}))^{q}.\] (75)

Above all,we can determine the optimal egalitarian fairness bound to maintain the core stability of the coalition structure \(_{g}\),

\[_{_{s}_{g}}(( N_{2}}{N_{g}{} ^{2}})^{q} n_{l}+d(_{g},n_{m}))^{q}}{}).\] (76)

### Additional experiments

#### a.5.1 Heterogeneous client behaviors

Experiments under heterogeneous client behaviors involved configuring the two clients to exhibit purely selfish behavior while the rest were modeled as friendly equal altruistic as in Figure 4. The results verified that our theoretical bound (green dashed line) continued to align with the empirical fairness results (red solid line) under heterogeneous client behaviors.

#### a.5.2 Adaptability

Lastly, we examined the adaptability and task-independence of the proposed egalitarian fairness bound through another linear regression task, as illustrated in Figure 5. The experiment underscored that our theoretical bound (green dashed line), independent of task-specific hyperparameters \(_{i}\) or \(_{i}\), consistently matched the actual fairness achieved within a core-stable grand coalition (red solid line).

Figure 4: Heterogeneous clients’ behaviors: theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds (green dashed line) align with empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line).

Figure 5: Linear regression: theoretically derived egalitarian fairness bounds (green dashed line) align with empirically achieved egalitarian fairness within the core-stable grand coalition (red solid line) under different client behaviors.

### NeurIPS Paper Checklist

1. **Claims** Question: Do the main claims made in the abstract and introduction accurately reflect the paper's contributions and scope? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We accurately defined the research scope and contributions in both the abstract and the introduction (Section 1). Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the abstract and introduction do not include the claims made in the paper. * The abstract and/or introduction should clearly state the claims made, including the contributions made in the paper and important assumptions and limitations. A No or NA answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers. * The claims made should match theoretical and experimental results, and reflect how much the results can be expected to generalize to other settings. * It is fine to include aspirational goals as motivation as long as it is clear that these goals are not attained by the paper.
2. **Limitations** Question: Does the paper discuss the limitations of the work performed by the authors? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We discussed the limitations of our paper in the Section 7. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper has no limitation while the answer No means that the paper has limitations, but those are not discussed in the paper. * The authors are encouraged to create a separate "Limitations" section in their paper. * The paper should point out any strong assumptions and how robust the results are to violations of these assumptions (e.g., independence assumptions, noiseless settings, model well-specification, asymptotic approximations only holding locally). The authors should reflect on how these assumptions might be violated in practice and what the implications would be. * The authors should reflect on the scope of the claims made, e.g., if the approach was only tested on a few datasets or with a few runs. In general, empirical results often depend on implicit assumptions, which should be articulated. * The authors should reflect on the factors that influence the performance of the approach. For example, a facial recognition algorithm may perform poorly when image resolution is low or images are taken in low lighting. Or a speech-to-text system might not be used reliably to provide closed captions for online lectures because it fails to handle technical jargon. * The authors should discuss the computational efficiency of the proposed algorithms and how they scale with dataset size. * If applicable, the authors should discuss possible limitations of their approach to address problems of privacy and fairness. * While the authors might fear that complete honesty about limitations might be used by reviewers as grounds for rejection, a worse outcome might be that reviewers discover limitations that aren't acknowledged in the paper. The authors should use their best judgment and recognize that individual actions in favor of transparency play an important role in developing norms that preserve the integrity of the community. Reviewers will be specifically instructed to not penalize honesty concerning limitations.
3. **Theory Assumptions and Proofs** Question: For each theoretical result, does the paper provide the full set of assumptions and a complete (and correct) proof? Answer: [Yes]Justification: For the theoretical results in our paper, including propositions, lemmas, and corollaries, the assumptions are detailed in the Section 3, and the complete (and correct) proofs are provided in the Appendix A. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include theoretical results. * All the theorems, formulas, and proofs in the paper should be numbered and cross-referenced. * All assumptions should be clearly stated or referenced in the statement of any theorems. * The proofs can either appear in the main paper or the supplemental material, but if they appear in the supplemental material, the authors are encouraged to provide a short proof sketch to provide intuition. * Inversely, any informal proof provided in the core of the paper should be complemented by formal proofs provided in appendix or supplemental material. * Theorems and Lemmas that the proof relies upon should be properly referenced.
4. **Experimental Result Reproducibility** Question: Does the paper fully disclose all the information needed to reproduce the main experimental results of the paper to the extent that it affects the main claims and/or conclusions of the paper (regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not)? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided the code to reproduce the experimental results in the supplemental material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * If the paper includes experiments, a No answer to this question will not be perceived well by the reviewers: Making the paper reproducible is important, regardless of whether the code and data are provided or not. * If the contribution is a dataset and/or model, the authors should describe the steps taken to make their results reproducible or verifiable. * Depending on the contribution, reproducibility can be accomplished in various ways. For example, if the contribution is a novel architecture, describing the architecture fully might suffice, or if the contribution is a specific model and empirical evaluation, it may be necessary to either make it possible for others to replicate the model with the same dataset, or provide access to the model. In general. releasing code and data is often one good way to accomplish this, but reproducibility can also be provided via detailed instructions for how to replicate the results, access to a hosted model (e.g., in the case of a large language model), releasing of a model checkpoint, or other means that are appropriate to the research performed. * While NeurIPS does not require releasing code, the conference does require all submissions to provide some reasonable avenue for reproducibility, which may depend on the nature of the contribution. For example 1. If the contribution is primarily a new algorithm, the paper should make it clear how to reproduce that algorithm. 2. If the contribution is primarily a new model architecture, the paper should describe the architecture clearly and fully. 3. If the contribution is a new model (e.g., a large language model), then there should either be a way to access this model for reproducing the results or a way to reproduce the model (e.g., with an open-source dataset or instructions for how to construct the dataset). 4. We recognize that reproducibility may be tricky in some cases, in which case authors are welcome to describe the particular way they provide for reproducibility. In the case of closed-source models, it may be that access to the model is limited in some way (e.g., to registered users), but it should be possible for other researchers to have some path to reproducing or verifying the results.
5. **Open access to data and code**Question: Does the paper provide open access to the data and code, with sufficient instructions to faithfully reproduce the main experimental results, as described in supplemental material? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided the code in the supplemental material. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that paper does not include experiments requiring code. * Please see the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * While we encourage the release of code and data, we understand that this might not be possible, so "No" is an acceptable answer. Papers cannot be rejected simply for not including code, unless this is central to the contribution (e.g., for a new open-source benchmark). * The instructions should contain the exact command and environment needed to run to reproduce the results. See the NeurIPS code and data submission guidelines (https://nips.cc/public/guides/CodeSubmissionPolicy) for more details. * The authors should provide instructions on data access and preparation, including how to access the raw data, preprocessed data, intermediate data, and generated data, etc. * The authors should provide scripts to reproduce all experimental results for the new proposed method and baselines. If only a subset of experiments are reproducible, they should state which ones are omitted from the script and why. * At submission time, to preserve anonymity, the authors should release anonymized versions (if applicable). * Providing as much information as possible in supplemental material (appended to the paper) is recommended, but including URLs to data and code is permitted.
6. **Experimental Setting/Details** Question: Does the paper specify all the training and test details (e.g., data splits, hyperparameters, how they were chosen, type of optimizer, etc.) necessary to understand the results? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided the experimental setting/details in Section 6. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The experimental setting should be presented in the core of the paper to a level of detail that is necessary to appreciate the results and make sense of them. * The full details can be provided either with the code, in appendix, or as supplemental material.
7. **Experiment Statistical Significance** Question: Does the paper report error bars suitably and correctly defined or other appropriate information about the statistical significance of the experiments? Answer: [NA] Justification: The experimental results in this paper ARE NOT influenced by random seed setting, and the error bar is not applicable. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The authors should answer "Yes" if the results are accompanied by error bars, confidence intervals, or statistical significance tests, at least for the experiments that support the main claims of the paper. * The factors of variability that the error bars are capturing should be clearly stated (for example, train/test split, initialization, random drawing of some parameter, or overall run with given experimental conditions).

* The method for calculating the error bars should be explained (closed form formula, call to a library function, bootstrap, etc.)
* The assumptions made should be given (e.g., Normally distributed errors).
* It should be clear whether the error bar is the standard deviation or the standard error of the mean.
* It is OK to report 1-sigma error bars, but one should state it. The authors should preferably report a 2-sigma error bar than state that they have a 96% CI, if the hypothesis of Normality of errors is not verified.
* For asymmetric distributions, the authors should be careful not to show in tables or figures symmetric error bars that would yield results that are out of range (e.g. negative error rates).
* If error bars are reported in tables or plots, The authors should explain in the text how they were calculated and reference the corresponding figures or tables in the text.
8. **Experiments Compute Resources** Question: For each experiment, does the paper provide sufficient information on the computer resources (type of compute workers, memory, time of execution) needed to reproduce the experiments? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided compute resources in Section 6. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not include experiments. * The paper should indicate the type of compute workers CPU or GPU, internal cluster, or cloud provider, including relevant memory and storage. * The paper should provide the amount of compute required for each of the individual experimental runs as well as estimate the total compute. * The paper should disclose whether the full research project required more compute than the experiments reported in the paper (e.g., preliminary or failed experiments that didn't make it into the paper).
9. **Code Of Ethics** Question: Does the research conducted in the paper conform, in every respect, with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics https://neurips.cc/public/EthicsGuidelines? Answer: [Yes] Justification: This paper conformed with the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the authors have not reviewed the NeurIPS Code of Ethics. * If the authors answer No, they should explain the special circumstances that require a deviation from the Code of Ethics. * The authors should make sure to preserve anonymity (e.g., if there is a special consideration due to laws or regulations in their jurisdiction).
10. **Broader Impacts** Question: Does the paper discuss both potential positive societal impacts and negative societal impacts of the work performed? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided societal impacts in Section 8. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that there is no societal impact of the work performed. * If the authors answer NA or No, they should explain why their work has no societal impact or why the paper does not address societal impact. * Examples of negative societal impacts include potential malicious or unintended uses (e.g., disinformation, generating fake profiles, surveillance), fairness considerations (e.g., deployment of technologies that could make decisions that unfairly impact specific groups), privacy considerations, and security considerations.

* The conference expects that many papers will be foundational research and not tied to particular applications, let alone deployments. However, if there is a direct path to any negative applications, the authors should point it out. For example, it is legitimate to point out that an improvement in the quality of generative models could be used to generate deepfakes for disinformation. On the other hand, it is not needed to point out that a generic algorithm for optimizing neural networks could enable people to train models that generate Deepfakes faster.
* The authors should consider possible harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended and functioning correctly, harms that could arise when the technology is being used as intended but gives incorrect results, and harms following from (intentional or unintentional) misuse of the technology.
* If there are negative societal impacts, the authors could also discuss possible mitigation strategies (e.g., gated release of models, providing defenses in addition to attacks, mechanisms for monitoring misuse, mechanisms to monitor how a system learns from feedback over time, improving the efficiency and accessibility of ML).
11. **Safeguards** Question: Does the paper describe safeguards that have been put in place for responsible release of data or models that have a high risk for misuse (e.g., pretrained language models, image generators, or scraped datasets)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper posed no such risks. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper poses no such risks. * Released models that have a high risk for misuse or dual-use should be released with necessary safeguards to allow for controlled use of the model, for example by requiring that users adhere to usage guidelines or restrictions to access the model or implementing safety filters. * Datasets that have been scraped from the Internet could pose safety risks. The authors should describe how they avoided releasing unsafe images. * We recognize that providing effective safeguards is challenging, and many papers do not require this, but we encourage authors to take this into account and make a best faith effort.
12. **Licenses for existing assets** Question: Are the creators or original owners of assets (e.g., code, data, models), used in the paper, properly credited and are the license and terms of use explicitly mentioned and properly respected? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We properly credited the uses of existing assets in Section 6 and the license and terms of use were explicitly mentioned and properly respected. Guidelines: * The answer NA means that the paper does not use existing assets. * The authors should cite the original paper that produced the code package or dataset. * The authors should state which version of the asset is used and, if possible, include a URL. * The name of the license (e.g., CC-BY 4.0) should be included for each asset. * For scraped data from a particular source (e.g., website), the copyright and terms of service of that source should be provided. * If assets are released, the license, copyright information, and terms of use in the package should be provided. For popular datasets, paperswithcode.com/datasets has curated licenses for some datasets. Their licensing guide can help determine the license of a dataset. * For existing datasets that are re-packaged, both the original license and the license of the derived asset (if it has changed) should be provided.

* If this information is not available online, the authors are encouraged to reach out to the asset's creators.
* **New Assets*
* Question: Are new assets introduced in the paper well documented and is the documentation provided alongside the assets? Answer: [Yes] Justification: We provided the open-source code in the supplemental material. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not release new assets.
* Researchers should communicate the details of the dataset/code/model as part of their submissions via structured templates. This includes details about training, license, limitations, etc.
* The paper should discuss whether and how consent was obtained from people whose asset is used.
* At submission time, remember to anonymize your assets (if applicable). You can either create an anonymized URL or include an anonymized zip file.
* **Crowdsourcing and Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: For crowdsourcing experiments and research with human subjects, does the paper include the full text of instructions given to participants and screenshots, if applicable, as well as details about compensation (if any)? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Including this information in the supplemental material is fine, but if the main contribution of the paper involves human subjects, then as much detail as possible should be included in the main paper.
* According to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics, workers involved in data collection, curation, or other labor should be paid at least the minimum wage in the country of the data collector.
* **Institutional Review Board (IRB) Approvals or Equivalent for Research with Human Subjects*
* Question: Does the paper describe potential risks incurred by study participants, whether such risks were disclosed to the subjects, and whether Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals (or an equivalent approval/review based on the requirements of your country or institution) were obtained? Answer: [NA] Justification: The paper did not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects. Guidelines:
* The answer NA means that the paper does not involve crowdsourcing nor research with human subjects.
* Depending on the country in which research is conducted, IRB approval (or equivalent) may be required for any human subjects research. If you obtained IRB approval, you should clearly state this in the paper.
* We recognize that the procedures for this may vary significantly between institutions and locations, and we expect authors to adhere to the NeurIPS Code of Ethics and the guidelines for their institution.
* For initial submissions, do not include any information that would break anonymity (if applicable), such as the institution conducting the review.
