###### Abstract

Modelling the propagation of electromagnetic signals is critical for designing modern communication systems. While there are precise simulators based on ray tracing, they do not lend themselves to solving inverse problems or the integration in an automated design loop. We propose to address these challenges through differentiable neural surrogates that exploit the geometric aspects of the problem. We first introduce the Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer (Wi-GATr), a generic backbone architecture for simulating wireless propagation in a 3D environment. It uses versatile representations based on geometric algebra and is equivariant with respect to \((3)\), the symmetry group of the underlying physics. Second, we study two algorithmic approaches to signal prediction and inverse problems based on differentiable predictive modelling and diffusion models. We show how these let us predict received power, localize transmitters, and reconstruct the 3D environment from the received signal. Finally, we introduce two large, geometry-focused datasets of wireless signal propagation in indoor scenes. In experiments, we show that our geometry-forward approach achieves higher-fidelity predictions with less data than various baselines.

## 1 Introduction

Modern communication is wireless: more and more, we communicate via electromagnetic waves through the antennas of various devices, leading to progress in and adoption of mobile phones, automotive, AR/VR, and IoT technologies . All these innovations build upon electromagnetic wave propagation. Therefore, modelling and understanding wave propagation in space is a core research area in wireless communication, and remains crucial as we are moving toward new generations of more efficient and spatially-aware wireless technologies.

Wireless signal propagation follows Maxwell's equations of electromagnetism and is often accurately modelled by state-of-the-art ray-tracing simulation software. However, these simulators take substantial time to evaluate for each scene, cannot be fine-tuned on measurements, and are (usually ) not differentiable. This limits their usefulness for solving inverse problems.

In contrast, neural models of signal propagation can be evaluated cheaply, can be trained on real measurements in addition to simulation, and are differentiable and thus well-suited for solving inverse problems. Several such approaches have been proposed recently, often using image-based representations of the inputs and outputs and off-the-shelf vision architectures . However, wireless surrogate modelling faces various challenges. Realistic training data is often scarce, requiring surrogate models to be data efficient. Wireless environments can consist of complex meshes. Finally, input and output data consist of a variety of data types, including the shape of extended 3D objects, point coordinates and spatial orientation of antennas, and information associated with the transmitted signal.

In this work, we present a new approach to modelling wireless signal propagation. It is grounded in the observation that wireless propagation is inherently a geometric problem: a directional signal is transmitted by an oriented transmitting antenna, the signal interacts with surfaces in the environment, and the signal eventually impinges an oriented receiving antenna. We argue that it is critical for neural surrogates to model and flexibly represent geometric aspects (e. g. orientations, shapes) in the propagation environment. We therefore develop surrogate models based on flexible geometric representation and strong geometric inductive biases.

We first propose the _Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer_ (Wi-GATr), a backbone architecture for wireless signal propagation problems. A key component is a new tokenizer for the diverse, geometric data of wireless scenes. The tokens are processed with a Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr) network . This architecture is equivariant with respect to the symmetries of wireless channel modelling, but maintains the scalability of a transformer architecture.

Second, we study Wi-GATr models as differentiable, predictive surrogates for the simulator (see Fig. 1a). Here the network predicts observables such as the received power as a function of transmitter position, receiver position, and 3D environment. We show how this enables forward modelling, and in addition, inverse problem solving due to Wi-GATr's differentiability.

Next, we propose an alternative, more versatile probabilistic approach to prediction and inference tasks: training Wi-GATr diffusion models (Fig. 1b) on the joint distribution of transmitter, receiver, channel information, and 3D environment. At test time, the model can be flexibly conditioned on any available information to predict the received power, localize a transmitter or receiver (Fig. 1c), or even reconstruct the (full or partial) 3D geometry from the wireless signal (Fig. 1d).

To enable machine learning development for wireless problems, we finally introduce two new datasets, Wi3R and WiPTR. Each dataset consists of thousands of indoor scenes of varying complexity and include all the geometric information that characterizes a wireless scene.

Finally, we demonstrate the predictive and the probabilistic models on these datasets. Our experiments show that the Wi-GATr approach gives us a higher-fidelity predictions than various baselines, generalizes robustly to unseen settings, and requires up to 20 times less data for the same performance than a transformer baseline.

## 2 Background and related work

Wireless signal propagation.How do wireless signals propagate from a transmitting antenna (Tx) to a receiver antenna (Rx) in a (static) 3D environment? While the system is fundamentally described by Maxwell's equations, for many realistic problems the ray approximation of geometric optics suffices . It approximates the solution to Maxwell's equations as a sum of planar waves propagating in all directions from Tx. Each planar wave is represented as a ray, characterized by various attributes (e. g., power, phase, delay) since transmission. As a ray reaches an object--that is,

Figure 1: **Geometric surrogates for modelling wireless signal propagation.****(a)**: Predictive modelling of channels from 3D geometry, transmitter, and receiver properties. Wi-GATr is a fast and differentiable surrogate for ray tracers. **(b)**: A probabilistic approach with diffusion models lets us reconstruct 3D environments **(c)** and antenna positions **(d)** from the wireless signal.

it intersects with its mesh--the interaction is modelled as reflection, refraction, or diffraction. During such interactions, the power, phase, polarization, and propagation direction of the wave can change in complex, material-dependent ways. In addition, new rays can emanate from the point of interaction. After multiple interactions, the rays eventually reach the receiving antenna. The Tx and Rx are then linked by a connected path \(p\) of multiple rays. The effects on the received signal are described by the channel impulse response (CIR) \(h()=_{p}a_{p}(-_{p})\), where \(a_{p}\) is the complex gain and \(_{p}\) the delay of the incoming rays .

Maxwell's equations and in extension ray propagation are highly symmetric. The received signal does not change under rotations, translations, and reflections of the whole scene, as well as the exchange of transmitter and receiver. The latter property is known as reciprocity .

Wireless simulators.Wireless propagation models play a key role in design and evaluation of communication systems, for instance by characterizing the gain of competitive designs in _realistic_ settings or by optimizing systems performance as in base station placement for maximal coverage. Statistical approaches  represent propagation as a generative model where the parameters of a probabilistic model are fitted to measurements. On the other hand, wireless ray-tracing approaches  are increasingly popular due to their high accuracy and because they do not require expensive field measurement collection campaigns.

Neural wireless simulations.Both statistical and ray-tracing simulation techniques are accompanied by their own shortcomings, subsequently mitigated by their neural counterparts. Neural surrogates for statistical models  reduce the amount and cost of measurements required. Neural ray tracers  address the non-differentiability of simulators using a NeRF-like strategy  by parameterizing the scene using a spatial MLP and rendering wireless signals using classic ray-tracing or volumetric techniques. While these techniques are faster than professional ray tracers, they are similarly bottlenecked by expensive bookkeeping and rendering steps (involving thousands of forward passes). In contrast, we propose a framework to simulate wireless signals with a single forward pass through a geometric transformer that is both sample-efficient and generalizes to novel scenes.

Geometric deep learning.The growing field of geometric deep learning  aims to incorporate structural properties of a problem into neural network architectures and algorithms. A central concept is _equivariance_ to symmetry groups : a network \(f(x)\) is equivariant with respect to a group \(G\) if its outputs transform consistently with any symmetry transformation \(g G\) of the inputs, \(f(g x)=g f(x)\), where \(\) denotes the group action. Of particular interest to us is the Euclidean group \((3)\) of isometries of 3D space, that is, transformations that leave Euclidean distances invariant. This group includes spatial translations, rotations, reflections, and their combinations. As we argued above, the physics of wireless signal propagation are invariant under this group.

GATr.The Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr)  is an \((3)\)-equivariant architecture for geometric problems. Among equivariant architectures, it stands out in two ways. First, it uses geometric (or Clifford) algebras  as representations. For a rigorous introduction to these algebras, we refer the reader to Dorst . From a practical machine learning perspective, these algebras define embeddings for various geometric primitives like 3D points, planes, or \((3)\) transformations. We will show that this representation is particularly well-suited for wireless channel modelling. Second, GATr is a transformer architecture . It computes the interactions between multiple tokens through scaled dot-product attention. With efficient backends like FlashAttention , the architecture is scalable to large systems, without any restrictions on the sparsity of interactions like in message-passing networks.

Diffusion models.Diffusion models  are a class of generative models that iteratively invert a noising process. They have become the de-facto standard in image and video generation . Recently, they have also shown to yield promising results in the generation of spatial and sequential data, such as in planning  and puzzle solving . Aside from their generative modelling capabilities, diffusion models provide a flexible way for solving inverse problems  through multiplication with an appropriate likelihood term . Furthermore, by combining an invariant prior distribution with an equivariant denoising network, one obtains equivariant diffusion models . These yield a sampling distribution that assigns equal probability to all symmetry transformations of an object, which can improve performance and data efficiency in symmetry problems like molecule generation  and planning . We will demonstrate similar benefits in modelling wireless signal propagation.

The Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer (Wi-GATr)

### Problem formulation

Our goal is to model the interplay between 3D environments, transmitting and receiving antennas, and the resulting transmitted wireless signals. More precisely, we consider _wireless scenes_ consisting of:

* The 3D geometry \(F\) of the environment. We specify it through a triangular mesh with a discrete material class associated with each mesh face.
* A set of transmitting antennas \(t_{i}\) for \(i=1,,n_{t}\). Each \(t_{i}\) is characterized by a 3D position, an orientation, and any antenna characteristics. We will often focus on the case of a single Tx and then omit the index \(i\).
* Analogously, a set of receiving antennas \(r_{i}\) for \(i=1,,n_{r}\).
* The channel or signal \(h_{ij}\) between each transmitter \(i\) and each receiver \(j\), which can be any observable function of the CIR.

In this setting, we consider various downstream tasks:

* _Signal prediction_ is about predicting the signal received at a single antenna from a single receiver, \(p(h|F,t,r)\) with \(n_{t}=n_{r}=1\). This is exactly the task that ray-tracing simulators solve. Often, the signal is modelled deterministically as a function \(h(F,t,r)\).
* _Receiver localization_: inferring the position and properties of a receiving antenna from one or multiple transmitters, \(r p(r|F,\{t_{i}\},\{h_{i}\})\), with \(n_{r}=1\).
* _Geometry reconstruction_ or sensing: reconstructing a 3D environment partially, inferring \(p(F_{u}|F_{k},t,r,h)\), where \(F_{u}\) and \(F_{k}\) are the unknown and known subsets of \(F\), respectively.

The latter two problems are examples of _inverse problems_, as they invert the graphical model that simulators are designed for. They are not straightforward to solve with the simulators directly, but we will show how neural surrogates trained on simulator data can solve them.

### Backbone

Core to our approach to this family of inference problems is the Wireless Geometric Algebra Transformer (Wi-GATr) backbone. It consists of a novel tokenizer and a network architecture.

**Wireless GA tokenizer.** The tokenizer takes as input some subset of the information characterizing a wireless scene and outputs a sequence of tokens that can be processed by the network. A key challenge in the neural modelling of wireless problems is the diversity of types of data involved. As we argued above, a wireless scene consists of the 3D environment mesh \(F\), which features three-dimensional objects such as buildings and trees, antennas \(t\) and \(r\) characterized through a point-like position, an antenna orientation, and additional information about the antenna type, and the characteristics of the channel \(h\).

   Data type & Input parameterization & Tokenization & Channels (\(_{3,0,1}\) embedding) \\ 
3D environment \(F\) & \(\) Triangular mesh & 1 token per mesh face & \(\) Mesh face center (point) \\  & & & \(\) Vertices (points) \\  & & & \(\) Mesh face plane (oriented plane) \\  & \(\) Material classes & & \(\) One-hot material emb. (scalars) \\  Antenna \(t_{i}\) / \(r_{i}\) & \(\) Position & 1 token per antenna & \(\) Position (point) \\  & \(\) Orientation & & \(\) Orientation (direction) \\  & \(\) Receiving / transmitting & & \(\) One-hot type embedding (scalars) \\  & \(\) Additional characteristics & & \(\) Characteristics (scalars) \\  Channel \(h_{ij}\) & \(\) Antennas & 1 token per link & \(\) Tx position (point) \\  & & & \(\) Rx position (point) \\  & & & \(\) Tx-Rx vector (direction) \\  & \(\) Received power & & \(\) Normalized power (scalar) \\  & \(\) Phase, delay, \(\) & & \(\) Additional data (scalars) \\   

Table 1: Wireless GA tokenizer. We describe how the mesh parameterizing the 3D environment and the information about antennas and their links are represented as a sequence of geometric algebra tokens. The mathematical representation of \(_{3,0,1}\) primitives like points or orientated planes is described in Appendix A.

To support all of these data types, we propose a new tokenizer that outputs a sequence of geometric algebra (GA) tokens. Each token consists of a number of elements (channels) of the projective geometric algebra \(_{3,0,1}\) in addition to the usual unstructured scalar channels. We define the GA precisely in Appendix A. Its main characteristics are that each element is a 16-dimensional vector and can represent various geometric primitives: 3D points including an absolute position, lines, planes, and so on. This richly structured space is ideally suited to represent the different elements encountered in a wireless problem. Our tokenization scheme is specified in Tbl. 1.

Network.After tokenizing, we process the input data with a Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr) . This architecture naturally operates on our \(_{3,0,1}\) parameterization of the scene. It is equivariant with respect to permutations of the input tokens as well as \((3)\), the symmetry group of translations, rotations, and reflections. These are exactly the symmetries of wireless signal propagation, with one exception: wireless signals have an additional reciprocity symmetry that specifies that the signal is invariant under an role exchange between transmitter and receiver. We will later show how we can incentivize this additional symmetry property through data augmentation.1 Finally, because GATr is a transformer, it can process sequences of variable lengths and scales well to systems with many tokens. Both properties are crucial for complex wireless scenes, which can in particular involve a larger number of mesh faces.

### Predictive modelling

The Wi-GATr backbone can be used either in a predictive or probabilistic ansatz. We begin with the predictive modelling of the measured channel information as a function of the complete 3D environment and the information characterizing the transmitter and receiver, \(h_{}(F,t,r)\). This regression model is trained in a supervised way on simulated or measured wireless scenes.

Forward prediction.The network thus learns a differentiable, deterministic surrogate for the simulator model \(h_{}(F,t,r)\). At test time, we can use the network instead of a simulator to predict the signals in unseen, novel scenes. Compared to a simulator based on ray tracing, it has three advantages: it can be evaluated in microseconds rather than seconds or minutes, it can be finetuned on real measurements, and it is differentiable.

Inverse problems.This differentiability makes such a surrogate model well-suited to solve inverse problems. For instance, we can use it for receiver localization. Given a 3D environment \(F\), transmitters \(\{t_{i}\}\), and corresponding signals \(\{h_{i}\}\), we can find the most likely receiver position and orientation as \(=_{r}_{i} h_{}(F,t_{i},r)-h^{2}\). The minimization can be performed numerically through gradient descent, thanks to the differentiability of the Wi-GATr surrogate.

### Probabilistic modelling

While a predictive model of the signal can serve as a powerful neural simulator, it has two shortcomings. Solving an inverse problem through gradient descent requires a sizable computational cost for every problem instance. Moreover, predictive models are deterministic and do not allow us to model stochastic forward processes or express the inherent uncertainty in inverse problems.

Equivariant diffusion model.To overcome this, we draw inspiration from the inverse problem solving capabilities of diffusion models using guidance . In this case, we formulate the learning problem as a generative modelling task of the joint distribution \(p_{}(F,t,r,h)\) between 3D environment mesh \(F\), transmitter \(t\), receiver \(r\), and channel \(h\), for a single transmitter-receiver pair. Concretely, we follow the DDPM framework and use a Wi-GATr model as score estimator (denoising network). By using an invariant base density and an equivariant denoising network, we define an invariant generative model. See Appendix B for a detailed description of our diffusion model and the discussion of some subtleties in equivariant generative modelling.

Unifying forward prediction and inverse problems as conditional sampling.A diffusion model trained to learn the joint density \(p_{}(F,t,r,h)\) does not only allow us to generate unconditional samples of wireless scenes, but also lets us sample from various conditionals: given a partial wireless scene, we can fill in the remaining details, in analogy to how diffusion models for images allow for inpainting. To achieve this, we use the conditional sampling algorithm proposed by Sohl-Dickstein et al. : at each step of the sampling loop, we fix the conditioning variables to their known values before feeding them into the denoising network.

This algorithm lets us solve signal prediction (sampling from \(p_{}(h|F,t,r)\)), receiver localization (from \(p_{}(r|F,t,h)\)), geometry reconstruction (from \(p_{}(F_{u}|F_{k},t,r,h)\)), or any other inference task in wireless scenes. We thus unify "forward" and "inverse" modelling in a single algorithm. Each approach is probabilistic, enabling us to model uncertainties. This is important for inverse problems, where measurements often underspecify the solutions.

In principle, the unconditional diffusion objective should suffice to enable test-time conditional sampling. In practice, we find that we can improve the conditional sampling performance with two modifications. First, we combine training on the unconditional diffusion objective with conditional diffusion objectives. For the latter, we randomly select tokens to condition on and evaluate the diffusion loss only on the remaining tokens. Second, we provide the conditioning mask as an additional input to the denoising model. See Appendix B for details.

## 4 New datasets

While several datasets of wireless simulations and measurements exist [3; 4; 41; 57], they either do not include geometric information, are not diverse, are at a small scale, or the signal predictions are not realistic. To facilitate the development of machine learning methods with a focus on geometry, we generate two new datasets of simulated wireless scenes.2 Both feature indoor scenes and channel information generated with a state-of-the-art ray-tracing simulator  at a frequency of 3.5 GHz. They provide detailed characteristics for each path between Tx and Rx, such as gain, delay, angle of departure and arrival at Tx/Rx, and the electric field at the receiver itself, which allows users to compute various quantities of interest themselves. See Appendix C for more details.

Wi3R dataset.Our first dataset focuses on simplicity: each of 5000 floor plans has the same size and number of rooms, and all walls have the same material across layouts. They differ only in their layouts, which we take from Wi3Rooms, Tx positions, and Rx positions. In Appendix C we define training, validation, and test splits as well as an out-of-distribution set to test the robustness of different models.

Figure 2: **Qualitative signal prediction results.** We show a single floor plan from the WiPTR test set. The black lines indicate the walls and doors, the colors show the received power as a function of the transmitter location (brighter colours mean a stronger signal). The transmitting antenna is shown as a black cross. The \(z\) coordinates of transmitter and receiver are all fixed to the same height. We compare the ground-truth predictions (top left) to the predictions from different predictive models, each trained on only 100 WiPTR floor plans. Wi-GATr is able to generalize to this unseen floor plan even with such a small training set.

WiPTR dataset.Next, we generate a more varied, realistic dataset based on the floor layouts in the ProcTHOR-10k dataset for embodied AI research . We extract the 3D mesh information including walls, windows, doors, and door frames and assign 6 different dielectric materials for different groups of objects. Our dataset consists of 12k different floor layouts, split into training, test, validation, and OOD sets as described in Appendix C. Not only does WiPTR stand out among wireless datasets in terms of its level of detail and scale, but because it is based on ProcTHOR-10k, it is also suited for the integration with embodied AI research.

## 5 Experiments

### Predictive modelling

We focus on the prediction of the time-averaged non-coherent received power \(h=_{p}|a_{p}|^{2}\), disregarding delay or directional information that may be available in real measurements. We train predictive surrogates \(h_{}(F,t,r)\) that predict the power as a function of the Tx position and orientation \(t\), Rx position and orientation \(r\), and 3D environment mesh \(F\), on both the Wi3R and WiPTR datasets. All models are trained with reciprocity augmentation, i. e., randomly flipping Tx and Rx labels during training. This improves data efficiency slightly, especially for the transformer baseline.

In addition to our Wi-GATr model, described in Sec. 3, we train several baselines. The first is a vanilla transformer , based on the same inputs and tokenization of the wireless scene, but without the geometric inductive biases. Next, we compare to the \((3)\)-equivariant SEGNN , though we were only able to fit this model into memory for the Wi3R dataset. In addition, we train a PLViT model, a state-of-the-art neural surrogate for wireless scenes  that represent wireless scenes as an image centered around the Tx position. Finally, we attempt to compare Wi-GATr also to WiNeRT , a neural ray tracer. However, this architecture, which was developed to be trained on several measurements on the same floor plan, was not able to achieve useful predictions on our diverse datasets with their focus on generalization across floor plans. Our experiment setup and the baselines are described in detail in Appendix D.

Signal prediction.In Fig. 2 we illustrate the prediction task on a WiPTR floor plan. We show signal predictions for the simulator as well as for surrogate models trained on only 100 floor plans. Despite this floor plan not being part of the training set, Wi-GATr is able to capture the propagation pattern well, while the transformer and ViT show memorization artifacts.

In Tbl. 2 we compare surrogate models trained on the full Wi3R and WiPTR datasets. Both when interpolating Rx positions on the training floor plans as well as when evaluating on new scenes unseen during training, Wi-GATr offers the highest-fidelity approximation of the simulator. Wi-GATr as well as the equivariant baselines are by construction robust to symmetry transformations, while

Table 2: **Signal prediction results. We show the mean absolute error on the received power in dBm (lower is better, best in bold). Top: In-distribution performance. Middle: Generalization under symmetry transformations. Bottom: Generalization to out-of-distribution settings. In almost all settings, Wi-GATr is the highest-fidelity surrogate model.**the performance of a vanilla transformer degrades substantially. All methods but SEGNN struggle to generalize to an OOD setting on the Wi3R dataset. This is not surprising given that the training samples are so similar to each other. On the more diverse WiPTR dataset, Wi-GATr is almost perfectly robust under domain shift.

**Data efficiency.** Next, we study the data efficiency of the different surrogates in Fig. 4. Wi-GATr is more data-efficient than any other method with the exception of the \((3)\)-equivariant SEGNN, which performs similarly well for a small number of training samples. This confirms that equivariance is a useful inductive bias when data is scarce. But Wi-GATr scales better than SEGNN to larger number of samples, showing that our architecture combines the small-data advantages of strong inductive biases with the large-data advantages of a transformer architecture.

**Inference speed.** One of the advantages of neural surrogates is their test-time speed. Both Wi-GATr and a transformer are over a factor of 20 faster than the ground-truth ray tracer (see Appendix D).

**Receiver localization.** Next, we show how differentiable surrogates let us solve inverse problems, focusing on the problem of receiver localization. We infer the Rx position with the predictive surrogate models by optimizing through the neural surrogate of the simulator as discussed in Sec. 3.3. The performance of our surrogate models is shown in Fig. 4 and Appendix D.3 The two neural surrogates achieve a similar performance when only one or two transmitters are available, a setting in which the receiver position is highly ambiguous. With more measurements, Wi-GATr lets us localize the transmitter more precisely.

### Probabilistic modelling

Next, we experiment with our probabilistic approach. We train diffusion models on the Wi3R dataset. In addition to a Wi-GATr model, we study a transformer baseline, as well as a transformer trained on the same data augmented with random rotations. Both models are trained with the DDPM pipeline with 1000 denoising steps and samples from with the DDIM solver . Our setup is described in detail in Appendix D.

**Signal prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction as conditional sampling.** In our probabilistic approach, signal prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction are all instances of sampling from conditional densities: \(h p_{}(h|F,t,r)\), \(r p_{}(r|F,t,h)\), and \(F_{u} p_{}(F_{u}|F_{k},t,r,h)\), respectively. We qualitatively show results for this approach in Figs. 4 and 4. All of these predictions are probabilistic, which allows our model to express uncertainty in ambiguous inference tasks. When inferring Rx positions from a single measurement, the model learns multimodal densities, as shown in the middle of Fig. 4. When reconstructing geometry, the model will sample diverse floor plans as long as they are consistent with the transmitted signal, see the right panel of Fig. 4. Additional results on signal and geometry prediction are given in Appendix D.2.

We quantitatively evaluate these models through the variational lower bound on the log likelihood of test data under the model. To further analyze the effects of equivariance, we test the model both on canonicalized scenes, in which all walls are aligned with the \(x\) and \(y\) axis, and scenes that are arbitrarily rotated. The results in Tbl. 3 show that Wi-GATr outperforms the transformer baseline across all three tasks, even in the canonicalized setting or when the transformer is trained with data augmentation. The gains of Wi-GATr are particularly clear on the signal prediction and receiver localization problems.

## 6 Discussion

Wireless signal transmission through electromagnetic wave propagation is an inherently geometric and symmetric problem. We developed a class of neural surrogates grounded in geometric representations and strong inductive biases. They are based on our new Wi-GATr backbone architecture, consisting of a new tokenization scheme for wireless scenes together with an \((3)\)-equivariant transformer architecture. The proposed backbone is applied in two ways to wireless tasks: first, as a differentiable "forward" prediction model that maps the features to the signals; second, as a probabilistic diffusion model that captures the joint and conditional distributions of features and channels. We employed these designs in experiments on received power prediction, receiver localization, and geometry reconstruction, where our Wi-GATr models enabled precise predictions, outperforming various baselines.

Our analysis is in many ways a first step. The range of materials in our datasets is limited and we only experimented with measurements of the non-coherent total received power, which is a stable signal, but offers less spatial information than measurements of the time delay or angular information. More importantly, we only considered idealized inference tasks. For instance, our receiver localization problem assumed perfect knowledge of the room geometry and materials.

Nevertheless, we hope that we were able to highlight the benefits of a geometric treatment of wave propagation modelling. Augmenting or replacing the image-based or general-purpose representations and architectures prevalent in wireless modelling with geometric approaches has the potential of improving data efficiency, performance, and robustness.
