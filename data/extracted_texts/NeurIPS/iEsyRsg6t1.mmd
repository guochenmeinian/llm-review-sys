###### Abstract

The s-ID problem seeks to compute a causal effect in a specific sub-population from the observational data pertaining to the same sub-population . This problem has been addressed when all the variables in the system are observable. In this paper, we consider an extension of the s-ID problem that allows for the presence of latent variables. To tackle the challenges induced by the presence of latent variables in a sub-population, we first extend the classical relevant graphical definitions, such as c-components and Hedges, initially defined for the so-called ID problem , to their new counterparts. Subsequently, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem with latent variables.

## 1 Introduction

Causal inference, i.e., understanding the effect of an intervention in a stochastic system, is a key focus of research in statistics and machine learning . Scientists, policymakers, business leaders, and healthcare professionals must understand causal relationships to move beyond correlations and make informed, evidence-based decisions. To perform causal inference tasks, it is crucial to differentiate between two types of data: observational and interventional .

**Observational Data.** Figure 1 illustrates a _population_ that pertains to the entire _sample space_ for a study of the causal effect of some intervention. A _sampler_ draws samples from the population. The sampler is unbiased if it draws samples at random such that each individual in the population has

an equal chance of being selected. As a result, the obtained sample is representative of the entire population. In contrast, a biased sampler selects samples based on certain criteria forming a _sub-population_. For each extracted sample, we collect data from a set of observed features denoted by \(\). As depicted in Figure 0(a), when the sampler is unbiased, the observational data comes from the joint distribution \(P()\). For a biased sampler, the observations can be modeled as drawn from a conditional distribution \(P(|S=1)\), where \(S=1\) indicates that the sample belongs to a sub-population.

**Interventional Data.** An _intervention_ on a subset \(\) assigns specific values to the variables in the subset. If performing an intervention results in changes in other variables of interest, it suggests a causal relationship, apart from mere correlation. Interventions are often represented with the \(do()\) operator, highlighting the deliberate change of a variable . For the sake of simplicity in notation, we use \(P_{}()\) to denote the distribution of the variables after an intervention on \(\). Figure 0(b) depicts the population after an intervention on subset \(\), where we seek to understand how changes in \(\) would affect a set of outcome variables \(\). To analyze this causal effect across the entire population, we must compute the distribution \(P_{}()\). On the other hand, if we are merely interested in the results of the intervention on a specific sub-population, it suffices to compute the conditional distribution \(P_{}(|S=1)\) pertaining to the sub-population.

**Causal Effect Identification.** Performing interventions in populations can be challenging due to high costs, ethical concerns, or sheer impracticability. Instead, researchers often use observational methods, leveraging the environment's _causal graph_, a graphical representation that depicts the causal relationships between variables , and observational data to estimate interventional distributions of interest. Various _causal effect identification_ problems in the causal inference literature are concerned with this issue.

**Related Work.** Table 1 lists four causal effect identification problems. The most renowned among them is the ID problem, introduced by , which seeks to determine a causal effect for the entire population using the observational distribution pertaining to the entire population. Specifically, it aims to compute \(P_{}()\) from \(P()\). The c-ID problem, introduced by , extends the ID problem to handle conditional causal effects, i.e., compute the conditional causal effect \(P_{}(|)\) from the observational distribution \(P()\) pertaining to the entire population.  introduced the s-Recoverability problem that focuses on inferring the causal effect of \(\) on \(\) for the entire population using data drawn solely from a specific sub-population.  introduced s-ID, which asks whether a causal effect in a sub-population such as \(P_{}(|S=1)\) can be uniquely computed from the observational distribution pertaining to that sub-population, i.e., \(P(|S=1)\). Another direction of research considers learning a causal effect from multiple datasets . In all aforementioned causal inference problems, the causal graph is assumed to be known. Some recent work relax this assumption  or introduce additional conditions on the causal graph with the goal of identifying a broader range of causal effects . Settings where data samples are dependent introduce new challenges to causal inference, which have been explored in another line of research .

**s-ID Is Not ID.** It is worth emphasizing that the s-ID problem is not a special case of ID problem, where the population is restricted to the target sub-population. The presence of selection bias \(S\) introduces additional dependencies among variables, and ignoring \(S\) in the graph invalidates the application of the rules of do-calculus  (which are the main tools used to tackle the ID problem) on input distribution, i.e., \(P(|S=1)\). Consequently, there are many instances where a causal effect is identifiable in the ID setting but not identifiable in the s-ID setting. In particular, when all the variables in a causal system are observable, all causal effects are identifiable in the setting of

  Problem & Given distribution & Target distribution & Presence of latent variables \\  ID & \(P()\) & \(P_{}()\) & ✓ \\ c-ID & \(P()\) & \(P_{}(|)\) & ✓ \\ s-Recoverability & \(P(|S=1)\) & \(P_{}()\) & ✓ \\ s-ID & \(P(|S=1)\) & \(P_{}(|S=1)\) & \(\) \\   

Table 1: Various causal effect identification problems. \(\) is the set of intervened variables, \(\) is the set of outcome variables, and \(S=1\) corresponds to a sub-population. ID, c-ID, and s-Recoverability have been addressed in the presence of latent variables. s-ID problem has only been studied in causally sufficient cases where all variables are observed.

the ID problem . This is not the case in the s-ID setting, and some causal effects become non-identifiable, as noted by . Moreover, even when a causal effect is identifiable in both the ID and s-ID settings, using the expression from the ID algorithm can lead to erroneous inference. Example 1 illustrates this case.

**Example 1.** Consider an example pertaining to study of the effect of a cholesterol-lowering medication on cardiovascular disease. Figure 2 depicts the causal graph of this example, where \(X\) is the medication choice that directly affects \(Y\), cardiovascular disease. Variable \(Z\) represents the diet and exercise routine of a person. In this scenario, \(X\) and \(Z\) are confounded by the person's socioeconomic status (e.g., income). It can be shown that the causal effect of \(X\) on \(Y\) (in the entire population, for instance, the people around the globe) is identifiable (ID) from \(P(X,Y,Z)\) and can be computed as \(P_{X}(Y)=P(Y|X)\).

However, we might instead be interested in a study that focuses on the people of a specific region. In this case, the target sub-population would correspond to individuals who are biased toward particular diet and exercise routines and possibly have a higher genetic predisposition for heart disease. Let \(S\) be an indicator node for this sub-population, \(Z\) has a directed edge toward \(S\), and \(S\) and \(Y\) are confounded by the latent genetic predisposition of the people of this group. We will show in Section 5 that the causal effect in this sub-population, \(P_{X}(Y|S=1)\), is s-ID and equals \(_{Z}P(Y|X,Z,S=1)P(Z|S=1)\). In this example, the presence of \(S\) introduces a spurious correlation between \(X\) and \(Y\) through the path involving \(Z\) and \(S\). Therefore, if we were to ignore the presence of \(S\) and apply the ID algorithm to the input \(P(X,Y,Z|S=1)\), it would result in incorrect inference: \(P(Y|X,S=1)\) as opposed to the correct value \(P_{X}(Y|S=1)\). In Appendix D, we empirically compare the differences between ID and s-ID settings. We present another example in Appendix A where a causal effect is ID but not s-ID.

In this paper, we consider the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables. Our main contributions are as follows.

* We extend the classical relevant graphical definitions, such as c-components and Hedges, initially defined for the ID problem so that they inherit the key properties of their predecessors but are applicable to the s-ID setting in the presence of latent variables (Section 4).
* We present a sufficient graphical condition to determine whether a causal effect is s-ID (Theorem 5.1). Accordingly, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem (Algorithm 1).
* We show a reduction from the s-Recoverability problem to the s-ID problem (Theorem 6.1), indicating that solving s-ID can also solve the s-Recoverability problem.

**Organization.** In Sections 2 and 3, we cover the preliminaries and review key definitions and results for the ID problem. In Section 4, we formally define the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables and present the proper modifications of the classical graphical notions of interest for the s-ID problem. We present our main results in Section 5. In Section 6, we introduce a reduction from s-Recoverability to s-ID. The appendix includes proofs of our results, as well as a numerical experiment.

## 2 Preliminaries

Throughout the paper, we use capital letters to represent random variables and bold letters to represent sets of variables. Furthermore, to facilitate ease of reading, we have summarized the key notations in Table 2.

**Graph Definitions.** Acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) consist of a mix of directed and bidirected edges and have no directed cycles. Let \(=(,_{1},_{2})\) be an ADMG, where \(\) is a set of variables, \(_{1}\) is a set of directed edges (\(\)), and \(_{2}\) is a set of bidirected edges (\(\)). The set of parents of a variable \(X\), denoted by \(_{}(X)\), consists of the variables with a directed edge to \(X\). Similarly, the set of ancestors of \(X\), denoted by \(_{}(X)\), includes all variables on a

Figure 2: ADMG \(^{}\) in Example 1.

directed_ path to \(X\), including \(X\) itself. For a set \(\), we define \(_{}()=_{X}_{ }(X)\). In an ADMG \(\) over \(\), a subset \(\) is called ancestral if \(_{}()=\).

A path is called bidirected if it only consists of bidirected edges. A non-endpoint vertex \(X_{i}\) on a path \((X_{1},X_{2},,X_{k})\) is called a _collider_ if one of the following situations arises:

\[X_{i-1} X_{i} X_{i+1}, X_{i-1} X_{i}  X_{i+1}, X_{i-1} X_{i} X_{i+1}, X_{i-1}  X_{i} X_{i+1}.\]

Let \(,,\) be three disjoint subsets of variables in an ADMG \(\). A path \(=(X,Z_{1},,Z_{k},Y)\) between \(X\) and \(Y\) in \(\) is called _blocked_ by \(\) if there exists \(1 i k\) such that \(Z_{i}\) is a collider on \(\) and \(Z_{i}_{}()\), or \(Z_{i}\) is not a collider on \(\) and \(Z_{i}\).

Denoted by \((\!\!\!|)_{}\), we say \(\)\(m\)-separates \(\) and \(\) if for any \(X\) and \(Y\), \(\) blocks all the paths in \(\) between \(X\) and \(Y\). Conversely, \((\!\!\!|)_{}\) if there exists at least one path between a variable in \(\) and a variable in \(\) that is not blocked by \(\).

For \(,\), \(_{}}\) denotes the edge subgraph of \(\) obtained by removing the edges with an arrowhead to a variable in \(\) (including bidirected edges) and outgoing edges of \(\) (excluding bidirected edges). Moreover, \([]\) denotes the vertex subgraph of \(\) consisting of \(\) and bidirected and directed edges between them.

**SCM.** A structural causal model (SCM) is a tuple \((,,,P())\), where \(\) is a set of endogenous variables, \(\) is a set of exogenous variables independent from each other with the joint probability distribution \(P()\), and \(=\{f_{X}\}_{X}\) is a set of deterministic functions such that for each \(X\),

\[X=f_{X}(^{X},^{X}),\]

where \(^{X}\{X\}\) and \(^{X}\). This SCM induces a causal graph \(\) over \(\) such that \(_{}(X)=^{X}\) and there is a bidirected edge between two distinct variables \(X,Y\) when \(^{X}^{Y}\). Henceforth, we assume the underlying SCM induces a causal graph that is ADMG, i.e., it contains no directed cycles.

An SCM \(=(,,,P())\) with causal graph \(\) induces a unique joint distribution over the variables \(\) that can be factorized as

\[P^{}()=_{}_{X}P^{ }(X|_{}(X))_{U}P^{ }(U).\]

This property is known as the Markov factorization . Note that \(_{}\) denotes marginalization, i.e., summation (or integration for continuous variables) over all the realizations of the variables in set \(\). We often drop the \(\) in \(P^{}()\) when it is clear from the context.

**Modeling a Sub-Population.** We model a sub-population using an auxiliary variable \(S\) and a biased sampler from a causal environment akin to . Suppose \(\) is the underlying SCM of an environment with the set of observed variables \(\). In this causal environment, an unbiased sampler produces samples drawn from \(P()\). When the sampler is biased, it draws samples from the conditional distribution \(P^{}() P(|S=1)\), where \(S\) is an auxiliary variable defined as

   Notation & Description \\  \(,\) & Sets of observed and unobserved variables \\ \(S\) & Auxiliary vertex (variable) used to model a sub-population \\ \(^{}\) & Augmented ADMG over \(\{S\}\) \\ \(_{}(X)\) & Parents of vertex \(X\) in graph \(\) \\ \(_{}(X),_{}()\) & Ancestors of vertex \(X\) (including \(X\)); the union of ancestors for all \(X\) \\ \(_{},_{}\) & \(_{^{}}(S)\) and its complement, \(_{^{}}(S)\) \\ \([]\) & Subgraph of \(\) induced by the vertices in \(\) \\ \(_{}\) & Subgraph of \(\) after removing incoming edges to \(\) and outgoing edges from \(\) \\ \(P^{}()\) & Sub-population distribution, i.e., \(P(|S=1)\) \\ \(P_{}()\) & Causal effect of \(\) on \(\), i.e., post-interventional distribution \\ \(P_{}^{}()\) & Causal effect of \(\) on \(\) in the sub-population, i.e., \(P_{}(|S=1)\) \\ \(Q[]\) & \(P_{_{}}(|_{ ^{}}(S)\{S\},S=1),\ _{}\) \\   

Table 2: Table of notations.

\(S f_{S}(^{S},^{S}),\) where \(f_{S}\) is a binary function, \(^{S}\), and \(^{S}\) is the set of exogenous variables corresponding to \(S\). Note that \(^{S}\) can intersect with \(\), but the variables in \(^{S}\) are assumed to be independent. In this model, \(S=1\) indicates that the sample is drawn from the target sub-population. Furthermore, we define the augmented SCM \(^{S}=(\{S\},^{S},\{f_{S}\},P(^{S}))\) obtained by adding \(S\) to the underlying SCM \(\). We denote by \(^{S}\), the causal graph of \(^{S}\), which is an augmented ADMG over \(\{S\}\). Note that in \(^{S}\), variable \(S\) does not have any children, but it can have several parents and bidirected edges.

**Intervention.** An _intervention_ on a set \(\) converts \(\) to a new SCM where the equations of the variables in \(\) are replaced by some constants. We denote by \(Q[] P_{}( )\) the corresponding post-interventional distribution, i.e., the joint distribution of the variables in the new SCM. The causal effect of \(\) on \(\) refers to the post-interventional distribution \(P_{}()\), where \(\) and \(\) are disjoint subsets of \(\). Accordingly, the causal effect of \(\) on \(\) in a sub-population is denoted by \(P_{}(|S=1)\).1

**Problem Setup.** Let \((,,,P())\) be an SCM with ADMG \(\) representing its causal graph. Additionally, let \(S\) be an auxiliary variable representing a specific sub-population. In this paper, given the augmented graph \(^{S}\) and two arbitrary, disjoint subsets \(\) and \(\), we address the following question: Can the causal effect \(P_{}^{S}()\) be uniquely identified from the observational distribution \(P^{S}()\)? Please refer to Definition 4.1 for the formal definition of the s-ID problem.

## 3 ID, c-component, and Hedge

Our proposed approach to address the s-ID problem extends certain definitions and properties from the classic ID problem . For the sake of completeness and pedagogical reasons, in this section, we review some definitions and the main results in the ID problem .

**Definition 3.1** (ID).: Suppose \(\) is an ADMG over \(\) and let \(\) and \(\) be disjoint subsets of \(\). Causal effect \(P_{}()\) is said to be identifiable (or ID for short) in \(\) if for any two SCMs \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\) with causal graph \(\) for which \(P^{_{1}}()=P^{_{2}}()>0\), then \(P_{}^{_{1}}()=P_{}^{_{2}}( )\).

Next, we review c-components, a fundamental concept to address the ID problem.

**Definition 3.2** (c-component).: Suppose \(\) is an ADMG over \(\). The c-components of \(\) are the connected components in the graph obtained by considering only the bidirected edges of \(\). Furthermore, \(\) is called a single c-component if it contains only one c-component.

There exist a few different definitions for _Hedge_, another central notion in the ID literature. Here, we provide a somewhat simplified definition that not only suffices to present the main result of the ID problem but also allows us to extend it in the next section to the s-ID setting.

**Definition 3.3** (Hedge).: Suppose \(\) is an ADMG over \(\), and let \(\) such that \([]\) is a single c-component. A subset \(\) is called a Hedge for \(\) in \(\), if \(\), \([]\) is a single c-component, and \(=_{[]}()\).

**Example 2**.: Consider the ADMG \(\) over \(=\{X_{1},X_{2},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) depicted in Figure 2(a). In this case, \(\), \([X_{1},X_{2}]\), and \([Y_{1},Y_{2}]\) are single c-components. The c-components of \([X_{1},X_{2},Y_{1}]\) are \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) and \(\{Y_{1}\}\). Furthermore, \(=\{X_{1},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) is a Hedge for \(=\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) since \([]\) and \([]\) are single c-components and \(_{[]}()=\). Similarly, \(\) is a Hedge for \(\), but there exists no Hedge for either \(\{Y_{1}\}\) or \(\{Y_{2}\}\).

The following theorem, restating the results in  and , outlines a necessary and sufficient condition to determine the identifiability of a causal effect in an ADMG.

**Theorem 3.4** (ID).: _Let \(\) be an ADMG over \(\), and \(\) and \(\) be two disjoint subsets of \(\). Causal effect \(P_{}()\) is ID in \(\) if and only if \(Q[]\) is ID in \(\), where \(=_{[]}()\). Furthermore, let \(\{_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}\) be the c-components of \([]\), then \(Q[]\) is ID in \(\) if and only if there are no Hedge in \(\) for any of the c-components \(\{_{i}\}_{i=1}^{k}\)._

**Example 3**.: Following Example 2, Theorem 3.4 implies that \(P_{X_{1}}(Y_{1})\), \(P_{X_{2}}(Y_{2})\), \(P_{\{X_{1},X_{2}\}}(Y_{1})\), and \(P_{\{X_{1},X_{2}\}}(Y_{2})\) are ID since no Hedge for either \(\{Y_{1}\}\) or \(\{Y_{2}\}\) exists. However, \(P_{X_{1}}(Y_{1},Y_{2})\) is not ID because \(=\{Y_{1},Y_{2},X_{2}\}\) and the c-components of \(Q[]\) are \(_{1}=\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) and \(_{2}=\{X_{2}\}\), and \(\{X_{1},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) (or \(\)) is a Hedge for \(_{1}\). Similarly, we can show that \(P_{\{X_{1},X_{2}\}}(Y_{1},Y_{2})\) is not ID.

## 4 s-ID, s-component, and s-Hedge

We begin by providing a formal definition of the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables, i.e., when the causal graph is an ADMG. Then, we present modifications of the graphical notions from the previous section so that they inherit the key properties of their predecessors and can be applied to the s-ID setting.

To avoid repetition, henceforth, we denote by \(\) the set of observed variables and by \(^{}\) an augmented ADMG over \(\{S\}\). Furthermore, we denote by \(_{}\) and \(_{}\) the ancestors and non-ancestors of \(S\) in \(\), i.e.,

\[_{} Anc_{^{}}( S),_{} Anc_{^{ }}(S).\]

**Definition 4.1** (s-ID).: Let \(\) and \(\) be disjoint subsets of \(\). Conditional causal effect \(P_{}(|S=1)\) (or \(P_{}^{}()\)) is s-ID in \(^{}\) if for any two augmented SCMs \(_{1}^{}\) and \(_{2}^{}\) with causal graph \(^{}\) for which \(P^{_{1}^{}}(|S=1)=P^{_{2}^{} }(|S=1)>0\), then \(P_{}^{_{1}^{}}(|S=1)=P_{}^{ _{2}^{}}(|S=1)\).

Next definition extends \(Q[]\) and introduces \(Q^{}[]\).

**Definition 4.2** (\(Q^{}[]\)).: For \(_{}\), we define \(Q^{}[] P_{_{}}( |An_{^{}}(S)\{S\},S=1).\)

The next definition extends c-components (Definition 3.2) and introduces s-components.

**Definition 4.3** (s-component).: For a subset \(_{}\), let \(_{1},,_{k}\) denote the c-components of \(^{}[ Anc_{^{}}(S)]\). We define the s-components of in \(^{}\) as the subsets \(_{i}_{i}\) which are non-empty. Furthermore, \(\) is called a single s-component in \(^{}\) if it contains only one s-component.

Note that \(Q^{}[]\) and s-components are only defined for the subsets of \(_{}\). Figure 3(a) visualizes the structure of s-components of a subset \(_{}\). In this figure, each blue subset (e.g., \(M_{1}\)) represents a c-component, which means all the nodes within them are connected via bidirected edges. Therefore, according to Definition 4.3, all nodes inside s-components (e.g., \(_{1}\)) of \(\) are connected via bidirected edges in \(^{}[_{}]\). Figure 3(b) shows the structure of a single s-component, where all the nodes of \(\) are connected via bidirected edges in \(^{}[_{}]\).

**Example 4**.: Consider the ADMG \(^{}\) in Figure 2(b) over \(\{S\}\), where \(=\{X_{1},X_{2},Y_{1},Y_{2},Z_{1},Z_{2}\}\). Since \(An_{^{}}(S)=\{Z_{1},Z_{2},S\}\), we have \(_{}=\{Z_{1},Z_{2}\}\) and \(_{}=\{X_{1},X_{2},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\). In this case, the s-components of \(_{}\) are \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) and \(\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\). Moreover, the s-components of \(\{X_{1},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) are \(\{X_{1}\}\) and \(\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\).

We now provide two crucial properties for \(Q^{}[]\).

**Lemma 4.4**.: _Let \(,^{}\) be two subsets of \(_{}\) such that \(^{}\). If \(^{}\) is an ancestral set in \(^{}[]\), then_

\[Q^{}[^{}]=_{^{ }}Q^{}[].\] (1)

Figure 3: ADMGs in Examples of Sections 3, 4, and 5.

**Lemma 4.5**.: _Suppose \(_{}\) and let \(_{1},,_{k}\) denote the s-components of \(\) in \(^{}\). Then,_

* \(Q^{}[]\) _decomposes as_ \[Q^{}[]=Q^{}[_{1}]Q^{}[ _{2}] Q^{}[_{k}].\] (2)
* _Let_ \(m\) _be the number of variables in_ \(\)_, and consider a topological ordering of the variables in graph_ \(^{}[]\)_, denoted as_ \(V_{h_{1}}<<V_{h_{m}}\)_. Let_ \(^{(0)}=\) _and for each_ \(1 i m\)_,_ \(^{(i)}\) _denote the set of variables in_ \(\) _ordered before_ \(V_{h_{i}}\) _(including_ \(V_{h_{i}}\)_). For every_ \(1 j k\)_,_ \(Q^{}[_{j}]\) _can be computed from_ \(Q^{}[]\) _by_ \[Q^{}[_{j}]=_{\{i|V_{h_{i}}_{j}\}}}[^{(i)}]}{Q^{}[^{(i-1)}]},\] (3) _where_ \(Q^{}[^{(i)}]\)_s can be computed by_ \[Q^{}[^{(i)}]=_{^{(i)}}Q ^{}[].\] (4)

The aforementioned lemmas are extensions of similar lemmas for \(Q[]\) to \(Q^{}[]\).

**Example 5**.: Following Example 4, since \(\{Y_{1}\}\) is ancestral in \(^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}]\), Lemma 4.4 implies that \(Q^{}[Y_{1}]=_{Y_{2}}Q^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}]\). Furthermore, since the s-components of \(_{}\) are \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) and \(\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\), Lemma 4.5 implies that \(Q^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}]=}[_{}]}{ _{Y_{1},Y_{2}}Q^{}[_{}]}\). Thus, \(Q^{}[Y_{1}]\) can be computed from \(Q^{}[_{}]\).

Finally, we define s-Hedges, which extends Definition 3.3 for Hedges.

**Definition 4.6** (s-Hedge).: Suppose \(_{}\) is a single s-component in \(^{}\). A subset \(_{}\) is called an s-Hedge for \(\) in \(^{}\), if \(\), \(\) is a single s-component in \(^{}\), and \(=An_{^{}[]}()\).

When \(_{}\) is a single c-component, it is also a single s-component. Therefore, if \(\) is a Hedge for \(\), it will also be an s-Hedge for \(\). Thus, Hedges can be seen as special cases of s-Hedges when \(_{}\). Figure 3(d) shows the structure of \(\), which is a single c-component and forms a Hedge for \(\). Moreover, Figure 3(c) presents the structure of an s-hedge \(\) for \(\). Note that s-hedges are more complex graph structures compared to Hedges. This complexity is required for us to be able to determine whether a causal effect is s-ID.

**Example 6**.: Following Examples 4 and 5, \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) is an s-Hedge for \(\{X_{2}\}\), because both \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) and \(\{X_{2}\}\) are single s-components and \(\{X_{1},X_{2}\}=An_{^{}[X_{1},X_{2}]}(X_{2})\). Similarly, \(\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\) is an s-Hedge for \(\{Y_{2}\}\).

## 5 Main Results

In this section, we provide a sufficient graphical condition for a causal effect to be s-ID in an ADMG. This extends the condition presented in , which assumes that the causal graph is a DAG. Accordingly, we propose a sound algorithm for the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

**Example 8**.: Consider again ADMG \(^{}\) depicted in Figure 2(b), where we want to apply Algorithm 1 for causal effect \(P_{X_{2}}^{}(Y_{2})\). Herein, \(_{}=\{X_{2}\}\), \(_{}=\{Y_{2}\}\), and \(_{}=_{}=\). Function **s-ID** passes the condition in line 6 and defines \(=\{X_{1},Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\), leading to \(_{1}=\{X_{1}\}\) and \(_{2}=\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\). It then defines \(_{i}\)'s in line 12 as \(_{1}=\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) and \(_{2}=\{Y_{1},Y_{2}\}\). In line 13, it uses Lemma 4.5 to compute \(Q^{}[_{1}]=_{Y_{1},Y_{2}}Q^{}[_{ }]\) and \(Q^{}[_{2}]=}[_{}] }{_{Y_{1},Y_{2}}Q^{}[_{}]}\) (See Example 5). It then calls Function **sID-Single**, which returns \(Q^{}[_{1}]=_{X_{2}}Q^{}[_{1}]\) and \(Q^{}[_{2}]=Q^{}[_{2}]\). Finally, in line 20, the function returns

\[P_{X_{2}}^{}(Y_{2})=_{Z_{1},Z_{2}}P^{}(Z_{1},Z_{2}) _{X_{1},Y_{1}}Q^{}[X_{1}]Q^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}],\]

where \(Q^{}[X_{1}]=P^{}(X_{1}|Z_{1},Z_{2})\) and \(Q^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}]=P^{}(Y_{1},Y_{2}|X_{1},X_{2},Z_{1},Z_{2})\).

**Example 9**.: Following the previous example, suppose we want to apply Algorithm 1 for computing causal effect \(P_{X_{1}}^{}(Y_{1},Y_{2})\). In this case, the algorithm needs to compute \(Q^{}[Y_{1},Y_{2}]\) and \(Q^{}[X_{2}]\). However, when the algorithm calls **sID-Single**\((X_{2},\{X_{1},X_{2}\},Q^{}[X_{1},X_{2}])\), Function **sID-Single** returns **sID** returns **sID** returns **sID** returns **sID** returns **sID** for \(P_{X_{1}}^{}(Y_{1},Y_{2})\).

**Remark 5.3**.: Algorithm 1 is sound for the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables. We conjecture that this algorithm is also _complete_, meaning that whenever it returns **sail**, the corresponding causal effect is not s-ID.

## 6 Reduction from s-Recoverability to s-ID

Recall that the objective in s-Recoverability is to compute \(P_{}()\) from \(P^{}()\), while s-ID aims to compute \(P_{}^{}()\) from \(P^{}()\).  proposed RC, a sound algorithm for the s-Recoverability problem. Subsequently,  proved that RC is complete. In this section, we present a reduction from the s-Recoverability problem to the s-ID problem. This indicates that solving s-ID can solve the s-Recoverability problem (but not the other way around).

**Theorem 6.1**.: _For disjoint subsets \(\) and \(\) of \(\), \(P_{}()\) can be uniquely computed from \(P^{}()\) in the augmented ADMG \(^{}\) if and only if_

\[(\!\!\! S|)_{^{}_{}},\] (8)

_and \(P_{}^{}()\) is s-ID in \(^{}\)._

**Remark 6.2**.: Equation (8) is a very restrictive condition, and when it holds, Rule 1 of do-calculus implies that \(P_{}()=P_{}^{}()\).

Theorem 6.1 implies that when Equation (8) does not hold, then \(P_{}()\) is not s-Recoverable. However, this causal effect might be identifiable in the target sub-population, i.e., \(P_{}^{}()\) is s-ID.

As a consequence of Theorem 6.1, we propose Algorithm 2 for computing \(P_{}()\) from \(P^{}()\). The algorithm takes as input two disjoint subsets \(\) and \(\) of \(\) along with an augmented ADMG over \(\{S\}\) and the conditional distribution \(P^{}()\). It first checks Equation (8) in line 3, and then calls Algorithm 1 as a subroutine to compute \(P_{}^{}()\) from \(P^{}()\) when it is s-ID in \(^{}\).

**Example 10**.: Consider the augmented ADMG \(^{}\) in Figure 5. In this graph, \((Y S|X_{1})_{^{}_{X_{1}}}\), thus, Theorem 6.1 implies that \(P_{X_{1}}(Y)\) cannot be uniquely computed from \(P^{}()\). On the other hand, \(P_{X_{2}}(Y)\) can be identified from \(P^{}()\) since \((Y\!\!\! S|X_{2})_{^{}_{X_{2}}}\) and due to Theorem 5.1, \(P_{X_{2}}^{}(Y)\) is s-ID in \(^{}\). In this case, Algorithm 2 returns the following expression for \(P_{X_{2}}(Y)\) in terms of \(P^{}\)

\[P_{X_{2}}(Y)=_{Z_{1},Z_{2}}P^{}(Z_{1},Z_{2})_{X_{1}}}(X_{1},X_{2},Y|Z_{1},Z_{2})}{P^{}(X_{2}|X_{1},Z_{1},Z_{2 })}.\]

## 7 Conclusion

The s-ID problem, introduced by , asks whether, given the causal graph, a causal effect in a sub-population can be identified from the observational distribution pertaining to the same sub-population.  addressed this problem when all the variables in the causal graph are observable. In this paper, we studied the s-ID problem in the presence of latent variables and provided a sufficient graphical condition to determine whether a causal effect is s-ID. Consequently, we proposed a sound algorithm for s-ID. While this paper proves the soundness of our proposed method, we also conjecture that our approach is not only sound but also complete. Finally, by presenting an appropriate reduction, we showed that solving s-ID can solve the s-Recoverability problem.
