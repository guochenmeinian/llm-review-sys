###### Abstract

Collaborative learning techniques have significantly advanced in recent years, enabling private model training across multiple organizations. Despite this opportunity, firms face a dilemma when considering data sharing with competitors--while collaboration can improve a company's machine learning model, it may also benefit competitors and hence reduce profits. In this work, we introduce a general framework for analyzing this data-sharing trade-off. The framework consists of three components, representing the firms' production decisions, the effect of additional data on model quality, and the data-sharing negotiation process, respectively. We then study an instantiation of the framework, based on a conventional market model from economic theory, to identify key factors that affect collaboration incentives. Our findings indicate a profound impact of market conditions on the data-sharing incentives. In particular, we find that reduced competition, in terms of the similarities between the firms' products, and harder learning tasks foster collaboration.

## 1 Introduction

Machine learning has become integral to numerous business functions in the past decade, such as service operations optimization, the creation of new products, consumer service analytics, and risk analysis (Chui et al., 2022). Despite the transformative power of machine learning, its efficacy hinges significantly on the quality and quantity of the training data, making data a key asset corporations can use to increase their profit.

One way to enhance data access and machine learning models is collaboration via data sharing (Rieke et al., 2020; Durrant et al., 2022). Data-sharing schemes can bring benefits in many industries, such as agriculture, finance, and healthcare (Durrant et al., 2022; FedAI; Rieke et al., 2020). However, at least two barriers exist to such collaborations. The first is privacy and the associated regulatory concerns, which can be partially addressed by new collaborative learning techniques, such as federated learning (Kairouz et al., 2021). The second is proper incentives for collaboration. If the entities have no such incentives, they may not collaborate at all, free-ride (Blum et al., 2021; Karimireddy et al., 2022), or attack the shared model (Blanchard et al., 2017).

Such conflicting incentives arise naturally between market competitors. On the one hand, the competitors are an appealing source of data, since they operate on the same market and have data of a similar type. On the other hand, the collaboration could also strengthen the competitors' machine learning models, potentially leading to downstream losses for the company. This concern is especially important for big firms that can influence prices and act strategically by considering how their decisions affect competitors' responses. Strategic actions might increase profits through various channels and produce complex downstream effects. For example, firms might collude to capturemore revenue1 or engage in a price war to win a market.2 Thus, _data sharing between big firms might have a complicated downstream effect on their profits_.

Our contributionsDespite the significance of this data-sharing trade-off, particularly for large, tech-savvy companies, there is limited research on how market competition affects collaborative learning incentives. Our work aims to fill this gap by proposing a framework to investigate data-sharing incentives. The framework is modular and consists of three components: market model, data impact, and collaboration scheme. These components represent the firms' production decisions, the effect of additional data on model quality and the data-sharing negotiation process, respectively.

To investigate the key factors that influence data-sharing decisions, we instantiate our framework using a conventional market model from economic theory and a data impact model grounded in learning theory. We examine three potential collaboration schemes: binary collaboration between two firms, partial collaboration between two firms, and binary collaboration among multiple firms. Our findings consistently indicate a profound impact of market conditions on the collaboration incentives. In the case of two firms, we theoretically demonstrate that collaboration becomes more appealing as market competition, measured by the similarities of the firms' products, decreases or the learning task complexity increases. For multiple firms, we conduct simulation studies that reveal similar trends.

## 2 Related work

Data sharing incentives in machine learningIncentives for collaboration in machine learning constitute an important research topic, especially in the context of new learning paradigms, such as federated learning (Kairouz et al., 2021). Some notable lines of work concern incentives under data heterogeneity (Donahue and Kleinberg, 2021; Werner et al., 2022); compensation for computation, energy, and other costs related to training (Yu et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2022); fair distribution of the benefits resulting from collaboration (Lyu et al., 2020, 2021; Blum et al., 2021); and free-riding (Richardson et al., 2020; Karimireddy et al., 2022). We refer to Zeng et al. (2021); Yang et al. (2020); Zhan et al. (2021) for a detailed overview.

A fundamental difference between our work and the research described above is that we explicitly consider the downstream market incentives of the firms and their effects on data-sharing decisions. These incentives are orthogonal to those previously studied in the literature. For instance, the data-collection game of Karimireddy et al. (2022) can be included in our framework as an additional stage of the game after our coalition formation stage. In addition, our framework is not specific to federated learning, as it can be applied regardless of the learning procedure used on the shared dataset.

To our awareness, Wu and Yu (2022) is the only work considering data sharing between market competitors. However, the authors do not explain the mechanisms behind the effects of ML models' quality on the market. Therefore, their framework can not predict whether a potential coalition will be beneficial for the company but only indicate the benefits of the coalition post factum. In addition, they use the marketing model of Rust and Zahorik (1993) instead of the classic economic models (Tirole, 1988) to model competition, potentially constraining the applicability. Finally, their notion of the sustainability of coalitions does not arise from standard concepts in game theory. In contrast, we base our analysis on the standard Nash equilibrium concept (Nash, 1951).

Market competition and information sharingCompetitive behavior is a well-studied topic in the economic literature (Tirole, 1988). We refer to Shapiro (1989) for an extensive review of the theory of competition. From a more applied perspective, Reiss and Wolak (2007) discuss how to test the behavior of firms empirically, while Berry et al. (2019) overview the modern empirical studies of industrial organization. A rich economic literature studies the incentives of competing firms to share information (Raith, 1996; Bergemann and Bonatti, 2019). For example, demand (Vives, 1984) or costs (Fried, 1984) might be unobservable, and firms might share information about them to improve their decisions. In contrast to these studies, in our model, firms share information to improve their products or optimize their costs, not to reduce uncertainty. Thus, the mechanisms and conclusions of these earlier works and our work differ.

Data-sharing problem

In this section, we provide a general formulation of the data-sharing problem, consisting of three components: market model, data impact, and collaboration scheme. The market model outlines consumers' and firms' consumption and production decisions. Data impact explains how additional data affects machine learning model quality. Lastly, the collaboration scheme details the data-sharing negotiation process among the competitors. Given a specific application, these three components can be derived/modeled by market research or sales teams, operation management and data scientists, and mediators, respectively.

We begin with an illustrative example that will help us to clarify the abstract concepts used in our framework and then introduce the three framework components in their full generality.

### Running example

Consider a city with a taxi market dominated by a few firms. Each firm collects data (e.g., demand for taxis and traffic situation) to train a machine learning model for optimizing driver scheduling and other internal processes, which is crucial for improving scheduling quality, reducing costs, or enhancing services. Each company can use only its own data or take part in a collaborative training procedure, like federated learning, with its competitors. Collaboration can substantially improve its machine learning model, but it may also strengthen the models of its competitors. Thus, the company must carefully evaluate the impact of data-sharing on its downstream profits.

### Market model

The market model encompasses consumer actions (demand factors) and firm production actions (supply factors). We consider a market with \(m\) firms, \(F_{1},,F_{m}\), each producing \(q_{i}_{+}\) units of good \(G_{i}\) and offering them to consumers at price \(p_{i}_{+}\), where \(_{+}=[0,)\). In our example, \(G_{1},,G_{m}\) represent taxi services from different companies, with consumers being city travelers, \(q_{i}\) are the total number of kilometers serviced by company \(i\), and \(p_{i}\) are the prices per kilometer.

In this setting, prices and quantities are \(2m\) unknown variables. Correspondingly, we need \(2m\) constraints to describe the consumers' and firms' market decisions, which we derive from the consumers' and the firms' rationality. In contrast to standard market models, our framework allows product utilities and costs to depend on the qualities of the machine learning models of the firms \(=(v_{1},,v_{m})\). This dependence models the impact of the learned models on the services and production pipelines of the firms.

Consumers' behaviorEach consumer \(j\) optimizes their utility \(u^{j}(^{j},^{j},)\) by purchasing goods given the market prices. We assume that consumers cannot influence prices, as there are many consumers and they do not cooperate.

The consumer's utility depends on three factors. The first one is the consumed quantities \(^{j}=(q_{1}^{j},,q_{m}^{j})\) of products \(G_{1},,G_{m}\). The second is the machine learning models' qualities \(\), as these may impact the utility of the corresponding products. The last one is consumed quantities \(^{j}=(g_{1}^{j},,g_{k}^{j})\) of goods outside the considered market (e.g., consumed food in our taxi example). Assuming that each consumer \(j\) can only spend a certain budget \(B^{j}\) on all goods, one obtains the following optimization problem

\[_{^{j},^{j}}u^{j}(^{j},^{j},)_{l=1}^{k}_{l}g_{l}^{j}+_{i=1}^{m}p_{l}q_{i}^{j} B^{j},\] (1)

where \(}\) are the outside products' prices (which we consider fixed). The solution to this problem \(q_{i}^{j,*}(,)\) determines the aggregate demanded quantity of goods

\[q_{i}(,)_{j}q_{i}^{j,*}(,).\] (2)

The functions \(q_{i}(,)\) (known as the demand equations) link the prices \(p_{i}\) and the demanded quantities \(q_{i}\) and constitute the first \(m\) restrictions in our setting.

Firms' behaviorFirms maximize their expected profits, the difference between revenue and cost,

\[_{i}^{e}=_{}(p_{i}q_{i}-C_{i}(q_{i},v_{i})).\] (3)

Here \(C_{i}(q_{i},v_{i})\) is the cost of producing \(q_{i}\) units of good for the firm \(F_{i}\), and the expectation is taken over the randomness in the models' quality, influenced by the dataset and the training procedure. Note that the model quality is often observed only after testing the model in production (at test time). Therefore, we assume that the firms reason in expectation instead. In our running example, \(C_{i}\) depends on driver wages, gasoline prices, and scheduling quality.

The firms may act by either deciding on their produced quantities, resulting in what is known as the Cournot competition model (Cournot, 1838); or on their prices, resulting in the Bertrand competition model (Bertrand, 1883). As the demand equations (2) may interrelate prices and quantities for various products, firms strategically consider their competitors' actions, resulting in a Nash equilibrium. The equilibrium conditions provide another \(m\) constraints, enabling us to solve the market model entirely.

### The impact of data on the market

Each company \(F_{i}\) possesses a dataset \(D_{i}\) that can be used to train a machine learning model (e.g., trip data in the taxi example) and may opt to participate in a data-sharing agreement with some other firms. Denote the final dataset the company acquired by \(D_{i}^{e}\). The company then uses the dataset to train a machine learning model. We _postulate two natural ways that the model quality \(v_{i}\) can impact a company_. The first one is by _reducing the company's production costs \(C_{i}(q_{i},v_{i})\)_, for example, by minimizing time in traffic jams. The second is by _increasing the utility of its products \(q_{i}(,)\)_, for example, by minimizing the waiting time for taxi arrival.

### Collaboration scheme

Following classic economic logic, we posit that _firms will share data if this decision increases their expected profits \(_{i}^{e}\)_. Since firms can not evaluate the gains from unknown data, we assume that they know about the dataset characteristics of their competitors (e.g., their number of samples and distributional information). Although expected profit maximization determines individual data-sharing incentives, forming a coalition necessitates mutual agreement. Therefore, the precise game-theoretic formulation of the data-sharing problem depends on the negotiation process details, such as the number of participants and full or partial data sharing among firms.

Consider our taxi example. If only two firms are present, it is natural that they will agree on sharing their full datasets with each other if and only if they both expect that this will lead to increased profits. Partial data-sharing will complicate the process, leading to an intricate bargaining process between the firms. Finally, if many companies are present, the data-sharing decisions become even more complicated, as a firm needs to reason not only about the data-sharing benefits but also about the data-sharing decisions of other firms.

Legal and training costs considerationsOther considerations can also enter into our framework through the collaboration scheme. In particular, if firms have legal requirements on data usage, they should impose suitable constraints on possible data-sharing agreements. If the collaborative learning procedure involves training large models, the firms should negotiate how to split training costs. For example, they might split the costs equally among all coalition members or proportionally to the sizes of their datasets.

## 4 Example market and data impact models

In this section, we instantiate the general framework using a conventional market model from economic theory and a natural data impact model justified by learning theory. These models allow us to reason quantitatively about the data-sharing problem in the following sections, leading to the identification of several key factors in the data-sharing trade-off. To focus solely on the data-sharing trade-off, we make several simplifying assumptions: the firms' data is homogeneous, training costs are negligible, and legal constraints are not present or are automatically fulfilled.

### Market model

In order to make quantitative statements about the firms' actions and profits within the general model of Section 3.2, one needs to make further parametric assumptions on utilities \(u^{j}\) and cost functions \(C_{i}\) and specify the competition game. To this end, we use a specific utility and cost model standard in the theoretical industrial organization literature (Tirole, 1988; Carlton and Perloff, 1990). Despite its simplicity, this model effectively captures the basic factors governing market equilibrium for many problems and is often used to obtain qualitative insights about them.

#### 4.1.1 Demand

We assume that, in the aggregate, the behavior of consumers (1) can be described by a representative consumer with quasi-linear quadratic utility (QQUM, Dixit 1979)

\[_{g,}u(g,)_{i=1}^{m}q_{i}-(q_{ i}^{2}+2_{i>j}q_{i}q_{j}}{2})+g=^{}- ^{}}{2}+gg+^{} B.\] (4)

Here, \(=(1,,1)^{}\), \(=(1-)+^{}\) and \(g\) is the quantity from a single outside good.

Additionally, \((-,1)\) is a measure of substitutability between each pair of goods: higher \(\) corresponds to more similar goods. In our running example, \(\) describes the difference in service of two taxi companies, such as the difference in the cars' quality or the location coverage. We refer to Chone and Linnemer (2019) for a detailed discussion on the QQUM model and the plausibility of assuming an aggregate consumer behavior.

In this case, the exact form of the demand equations (2) is well-known.

**Lemma 4.1** (Amir et al. 2017).: _Assume that \(^{-1}(-)>0\) and \(^{}^{-1}(-) B\). The solution to the consumer problem (4) is_

\[p_{i}=1-q_{i}-_{j i}q_{j} q_{i}=- (m-2)p_{i}+_{j i}p_{j}}{(1-)(1+(m-1))}.\] (5)

The technical conditions \(^{-1}(-)>0\) and \(^{}^{-1}(-) B\) ensure that the consumers want to buy at least a bit of every product and do not spend all of their money in the considered market, respectively. For completeness, we prove Lemma 4.1 in Appendix A.1.

#### 4.1.2 Supply

We assume that the cost functions (3) are linear in the quantities

\[_{i}^{e}=(p_{i}q_{i}-c_{i}q_{i}),\] (6)

where the parameter \(c_{i}\) depends on the quality of the machine learning model. We denote \(c_{i}^{e}=_{D_{i}^{e}}(c_{i})\).

_Remark 4.2_.: Here we assume that the quality of the machine learning model only affects the production costs, and not the utilities. However, in this market model, it is equivalent to assuming that the machine learning model affects the consumers' utility via increasing the effective quantities of the produced goods. Specifically, assume that each product has an internal quality \(w_{i}\) and it increases the effective amount of good in the consumer's utility (4), resulting in utility \(u(g,w_{1}q_{1},,w_{m}q_{m})\). This model is equivalent to the model above after substituting \(q_{i}\), \(p_{i}\), and \(c_{i}\) with their effective versions \(_{i}=w_{i}q_{i}\), \(_{i}=p_{i}/w_{i}\), and \(_{i}=c_{i}/w_{i}\).

We now derive the remaining constraints on the prices and costs. Note that these equilibria depend on the expected costs \(c_{i}^{e}\) and hence on the quality of the machine learning models.

Cournot competitionEach firm acts by choosing an output level \(q_{i}\), which determines the prices (5) and expected profits (6). The next standard lemma describes the Nash equilibrium of this game.

**Lemma 4.3**.: _Assume that the expected marginal costs are equal to \(c_{1}^{e},,c_{m}^{e}\), and companies maximize their profits (6) in the Cournot competition game. If \( i\,(2-)(1-c_{i}^{e})>_{j i}(c_{i}^{e}-c_{j}^{e})\), Nash equilibrium quantities and profits are equal to_

\[q_{i}^{*}=^{e}+_{j i}c_{j}^{e }}{(2-)(2+(m-1))},\;_{i}^{e}=(q_{i}^{*})^{2}.\]Bertrand competitionEach firm acts by setting the price \(p_{i}\) for their product, which determines the quantities (5) and expected profits (6). The following lemma describes the Nash equilibrium of this game.

**Lemma 4.4**.: _Assume that the expected marginal costs are equal to \(c_{1}^{e},,c_{m}^{e}\), and companies maximize their profits (6) in the Bertrand competition game. If \( i\,d_{1}(1-c_{i}^{e})>d_{3}_{j i}(c_{i}^{e}-c_{j}^{e})\), Nash equilibrium prices and profits are equal to_

\[p_{i}^{*}=+d_{2}c_{i}^{e}+d_{3}_{j i}c_{j}^{e}}{d_{4}},\; _{i}^{e}=^{*}-c_{i}^{e})^{2}}{(1-)(1+ (m-1))},\]

_where \(d_{1},,d_{4}\) depend only on \(\) and \(m\)._

In both lemmas, the technical conditions \( i\,(2-)(1-c_{i}^{e})>_{j i}(c_{i}^{e}-c_{j}^{e})\) and \( i\,d_{1}(1-c_{i}^{e})>d_{3}_{j i}(c_{i}^{e}-c_{j}^{e})\) ensure that every firm produces a positive amount of good in the equilibrium. We prove these Lemmas in Sections A.2 and A.3.

### Data impact model

In order to reason strategically about the impact of sharing data with others, firms need to understand how additional data impacts their costs. Here, we consider the case where all datasets are sampled from the same distribution \(\). While heterogeneity is an important concern in collaborative learning, we focus on the homogeneous case since heterogeneity is orthogonal to the incentives arising from market equilibrium considerations.

Homogeneity allows us to consider the expected costs in form \(c_{i}^{e}=c^{e}(n_{i}^{c})\), where \(n_{i}^{c}=|D_{i}^{c}|\) is the number of points the company \(i\) has access to. Using the examples below, we motivate the following functional form for \(c^{e}(n)\)

\[c^{e}(n)=a+},\;(0,1].\] (7)

In this setting, \(\) indicates the _difficulty of the learning task_, higher \(\) corresponds to a simpler task (Tsybakov, 2004), \(a\) represents the marginal costs of production given a perfect machine learning model, while \(a+b\) corresponds to the cost of production without machine learning optimizations. Additionally, we assume that \(a<1\) and \(\) is small enough, so that the technical requirements of Lemmas 4.1, 4.3, and 4.4 are satisfied (see Equations (10) and (11)). Intuitively, this requirement ensures that firms do not exit the market during the competition stage.

In the examples below, we consider a setting where a company needs to perform action \(^{n}\) during production that will impact its costs. However, there is uncertainty in the production process coming from random noise \(\) valued in \(^{m}\). Thus, the cost of production is a random function \(c(,)^{n}^{m}_{+}\).

Asymptotic normalityAssume that the firms use background knowledge about their production processes in the form of a structural causal model of \(\). However, they do not know the exact parameters of the model and use data to estimate them. Suppose a firm uses the maximum likelihood estimator to find the parameters and chooses the optimal action \(_{}\) based on this estimate. In this case, the result of optimization \(_{}(c(_{},))\) will approximately have a generalized chi-square distribution (Jones, 1983), resulting in the following approximation

\[_{D,}(c(_{},)) a+.\] (8)

We refer to Appendix A.4 for further details. This result implies the same dependence of the expected marginal costs on the total number of samples \(n\) as Equation (7) with \(=1\).

Stochastic optimizationA similar dependence arises when the company uses stochastic optimization to directly optimize the expected cost \(c()=_{}(c(,))\). If the company uses an algorithm with provable generalization guarantees (e.g., SGD with a single pass over the data, Bubeck 2015) and the function \(c()\) is strongly convex, the outcome \(_{}\) will satisfy

\[_{D}(c(_{})-c(^{*}))=,\]

where \(^{*}\) is the optimal action, resulting in the same dependence as in the previous paragraph.

Statistical learning theoryAnother justification for the dependency on the number of data points comes from statistical learning theory. The observations from this subsection are inspired by similar arguments in Karimireddy et al. (2022). Assume that a firm trains a classifier used in the production process. In this case, the cost \(c\) depends on the classifier accuracy \(a\), and the cost overhead will satisfy

\[c(a)-c(a^{*})-c^{}(a^{*})(a^{*}-a),\]

where \(a^{*}\) is the optimal accuracy achievable by a chosen family of classifiers. If the family of classifiers has a finite VC dimension \(d\), a well-known statistical bound (Shalev-Shwartz & Ben-David, 2014) gives

\[a^{*}-a=},\]

motivating the same dependence as Equation (7) with \(=1/2\).

## 5 Data sharing between two firms

Having introduced example market and data impact models, we can specify a negotiation scheme and quantitatively analyze the data-sharing problem. Through this, we aim to obtain qualitative insights into how market parameters impact data-sharing decisions. Following conventional economic logic (Tirole, 1988; Carlton & Perloff, 1990), we start with the simplest possible collaboration scheme, in which two companies make a binary decision of whether to share all their data with each other. In the next sections, we proceed to the more complicated situations of partial data sharing and data sharing between many parties.

Full data sharing between two firmsAccording to our framework, both companies compare their expected profits at the Nash equilibrium (from Lemma 4.3 or 4.4) for two cases, when they collaborate and when they do not. Then _they share data with each other if and only if they both expect an increase in profits from this action_.

_Remark 5.1_.: Notice that we can incorporate some legal requirements into this scheme by redefining full data-sharing action. For example, if sharing consent constraints, raising from copyright or other data ownership constraint, are present, we could assume that the companies will share only a part of their dataset for the collaborative learning. While, previously, the competitor gets access to all data of the firm \(n_{}^{}=n_{-i}+n_{i}\), now they will get access to only data of people who agree with data sharing \(n_{-i}^{}=n_{-i}+n_{i,}\).

For Cournot competition, Lemma 4.3 and Equation (7) give the following collaboration criterion

\[ i_{}^{e}>_{i,}^{e}(2-)(n_{ i}^{-}-(n_{1}+n_{2})^{-})>(n_{-i}^{-}-n_{i}^{-}),\]

where \(n_{-i}\) is the size of the data of the player that is not \(i\), \(_{i,}^{e}\) is the expected profit in collaboration, and \(_{i,}^{e}\) is the expected profit when no collaboration occurs.

Similarly, in the case of Berntrand competition, Lemma 4.4 gives

\[ i_{}^{e}>_{i,}^{e}(2-- ^{2})(n_{i}^{-}-(n_{1}+n_{2})^{-})>(n_{-i}^{-}-n_{ i}^{-}).\]

The theorem below describes the properties of these criteria (see proof in Appendix A.5).

**Theorem 5.2**.: _In the case of \( 0\), it is profitable for the firms to collaborate. In the case of \(>0\), there exists a value \(x_{t}(,)\), where \(t\{,\}\) is the type of competition, such that, for the firm \(i\), it is profitable to collaborate only with a competitor with enough data:_

\[_{}^{e}>_{i,}^{e}}{n_{1}+n_{2}}>x _{t}(,).\]

_The function \(x_{t}\) has the following properties:_

1. \(x_{t}(,)\) _is increasing in_ \(\)_._
2. \(x_{} x_{}\)_._
3. \(x_{t}(,)\) _is increasing in_ \(\)DiscussionThe theorem above indicates that the _firms are more likely to collaborate when either the market is less competitive_ (properties 1 and 2) _or the learning task is harder_ (property 3). Indeed, the threshold \(x\) becomes smaller when the products are less similar (\(\) is bigger), making the market less competitive. Similarly, \(x\) becomes smaller in the Cournot setting since it is known to be less competitive than the Bertrand one (Shapiro, 1989). Finally, when the learning task is harder (\(\) is smaller), \(x\) decreases, making collaboration more likely. Intuitively, it happens because the decrease in cost (7) from a single additional data point is higher for smaller \(\).

In the supplementary material, we explore several extensions for the two firms case. In Appendix C.1 and Appendix C.2, we look at different cost and utility functions, respectively. In Appendix C.3, we consider the case where \(a\), \(b\) and/or \(\) might differ among firms and derive an analog of Theorem 5.2. In Appendix C.4, we consider the data-sharing problem with two companies with heterogeneous data in the context of mean estimation. In Appendix E, we look at the welfare implications of data sharing.

## 6 Partial data sharing

In this section, we study a two-companies model in which companies can share any fraction of their data with competitors. For brevity, we only study this model in the case of Cournot competition. In this setup, each firm \(F_{i}\) chooses to share a fraction \(_{i}\) of data with its competitor and expects its costs to be

\[c_{i}^{e}=c^{e}(n_{i}+_{-i}n_{-i})=a+b(n_{i}+_{-i}n_{-i})^{- },\]

where \(_{-i}\) is the fraction of data shared by the company that is not \(i\).

_Remark 6.1_.: Notice that we can incorporate some legal requirements into this scheme by constraining the action spaces of participants. For example, one can implement sharing consent constraints, araising from copyright or other data ownership constraint, by constraining the firms' choices of \(\). While, previously, the firms were able to share all data \(\), now they can share only data of people who agree with data sharing \([0,_{}]\).

We will use the Nash bargaining solution (Binmore et al., 1986) to describe the bargaining process between the firms. Namely, the firms will try to compromise between themselves by maximizing the following Nash product

\[_{_{i}}(_{1}^{e}(_{1},_{2})-_{1}^{e}(0,0))(_{2}^{e}(_{1},_{2})-_{2}^{e}(0,0)) i\;_{i}^{e}(_{1},_{2})-_{i}^{e}(0,0) 0.\] (9)

The Nash bargaining solution is a commonly used model for two-player bargaining, as it results in the only possible compromise satisfying invariance to the affine transformations of profits, Pareto optimality, independence of irrelevant alternatives, and symmetry (Binmore et al., 1986). The following theorem describes the firms' behavior in this setup (see proof in Appendix A.6).

**Theorem 6.2**.: _W.l.o.g. assume that \(n_{1} n_{2}\). Additionally, assume \((1-a) b\) (in particular, \(b<5(1-a)\)). The solution \((_{1}^{*},_{2}^{*})\) to the problem (9) is_

\[_{1}^{*} =_{1}+,\; _{2}^{*}=1,\;\] \[_{1} =}{n_{1}}1-}{4}}{n_{1}}^{}1-}{n_{1}+n_{2}}^{}^{-1/}-1,&}{n_{1}^{2}}^{2}}+}{(n_{ 1}+n_{2})^{}},\\ 1&.\]

_Moreover, \(_{1}\) is a decreasing function in \(\) and \(\), and \(_{1}=}{4}}{n_{1}} ^{+2}(1+(1))\) when \(n_{2}/n_{1} 0\)._

DiscussionWe can see that the results of Theorem 6.2 are similar to those in Section 5. When there is a big difference between the amount of data (\(n_{1} n_{2}\)), the big firm does not collaborate with the small firm (\(_{1}^{*}=((n_{2}/n_{1})^{+2})\)). However, when the firms have similar amounts of data, the large firm will share almost all of it (\(_{1}^{*} 1\)), and the sharing proportion increases with a decrease in competition (smaller \(\)) and an increase in learning task hardness (smaller \(\)). In contrast to the previous results, the smaller firm always shares all its data with the competitor (\(_{2}^{*}=1\)).

Data sharing between many firms

In this section, we investigate the data-sharing problem for many companies. For brevity, we only consider the case of Cournot competition. The key challenge in the case of many companies is the variety of possible coalitional structures. Moreover, since the companies may have conflicting incentives and data sharing requires mutual agreement, it is not immediately clear how to assess the "plausibility" of a particular structure.

We discuss one possible way to solve this problem using non-cooperative game theory (Koczy, 2018). We assume a coalition formation process between the firms, model it as a non-cooperative game, and study its Nash equilibria. The non-cooperative approach often offers a unique _sub-game perfect equilibrium_, a standard solution notion in sequential games (Mas-Colell et al., 1995). However, this equilibrium depends on the assumptions about the bargaining process. For this reason, in Appendix D we also study alternative formulations: a cooperative setting and two non-cooperative settings with only one non-singleton coalition.

Non-cooperative data-sharing gameWe order the firms in a decreasing data size order so that firm \(F_{1}\) has the largest dataset. In this order, the firms propose forming a coalition with their competitors. First, the largest company makes up to \(2^{m-1}\) proposals. For any offer, each invited firm accepts or declines it in the decreasing data size order. If anyone disagrees, the coalition is rejected, and the first firm makes another offer. Otherwise, the coalition is formed, and all companies in it leave the game. After the first company forms a coalition or exhausts all of its offers, the second firm, in the decreasing data size order, begins to propose, etc.

We use the standard backward induction procedure (Mas-Colell et al., 1995) to calculate the sub-game perfect equilibrium of this game. This method solves the game from the end to the beginning. First, the algorithm looks at all possible states one step before the end of the game. Since the actions of the last player are rational, the algorithm can identify these actions accurately. This way, the algorithm moves one step earlier in the coalition formation process and can now identify the action taken before this state occurred. The procedure iterates until the start of the game is reached.

ExperimentsWe use the procedure described above to empirically test the conclusions of the previous sections. We sample \(m\) dataset sizes, one for each firm, from a distribution \(P=(,^{2})\) clipped at \(1\) form below. Then, we calculate the equilibrium of the resulting data-sharing game and

Figure 1: The dependence of the average coalition size on \(\) (left part) and \(\) (right part) in the synthetic experiments. The \(y\)-axes report the mean of the average size of the coalitions in the equilibrium partition, where mean is taken over \(10000\) Monte Carlo simulations of the game. See the main text for details.

compute the average size (number of companies) of the resulting coalitions at the equilibrium, as a measure of the extend to which companies collaborate.

We repeat the experiment \(10000\) times, for fixed values of \(m,,,,\) and compute the mean of the average coalition size over these runs. Our simulation solves each instance of the data-sharing game exactly and average it over a big number of independent runs, which makes our results very precise.

Repeating the experiment for different values of \(\) and \(\), we can observe the dependence of this average coalition size on the two parameters of interest. In Figure 1 we plot these dependencies, for different values of \(m\{3,4\}\) and \(\{300,600\}\). When varying one of these parameters, the default values for the other one is \(=0.8\) and \(=0.9\). We also provide results for other values of \(m\) and \(\) in Appendix F.

As we can see, the conclusion of Theorem 5.2 transfer to this experiment: the average size of the coalitions and thus cooperation incentives, are decreasing in both \(\) and \(\), across all experimental setups.

## 8 Conclusion

In this work, we introduced and studied a framework for data-sharing among market competitors. The framework is modular and consists of three components--market model, data impact, and collaboration scheme--which can be specified for any particular application. To examine the effects of various parameters, we instantiated the framework using a conventional market model and a natural model of data impact grounded in learning theory. We then studied several data-sharing games within these models.

Our findings indicate that the characteristics of competition may have a significant effect on the data-sharing decisions. Specifically, we found that higher product differentiation generally increases the willingness for collaboration, as does the complexity of the learning task. Interestingly, our results suggests that the firms might not want to participate in the federated learning even in the absence of privacy concerns. On the other hand, we also predict that data-sharing collaborations might emerge between competitors even without any external regulations. We hope our study will inspire further in-depth investigations into the nuanced trade-offs in data sharing, allowing competition and collaboration to coexist in data-driven environments.

Limitations and future workWhile our general framework can describe many data-sharing settings, the quantitative results rely on several important assumptions. First, we assume that the firms' data are homogeneous. We expect that designing a suitable model in the case of significant heterogeneity is a significant challenge orthogonal to the focus of our work (e.g., Gulrajani Lopez-Paz, 2021). Moreover, in some cases, additional data from a different distribution may damage model performance, yielding orthogonal data-sharing considerations (Donahue Kleinberg, 2021).

Second, we assume that legal constraints are not present or are automatically fulfilled in all our settings. However, we see the evaluation of AI regulatory frameworks as an important direction for future work. The same applies to training cost considerations.

Finally, we do not consider sociological aspects, such as reputational effects (e.g., reputation loss due to a refusal to share data or a poorly communicated decision to share data). Due to the inherent non-rivalry of data (Karimireddy et al., 2022), sociological modeling, e.g., the theory of collective action, may provide further valuable insights into the data-sharing problem.

We see our contributions as mostly conceptual and do not aim to provide a fully realistic model that can directly inform practitioners about the benefits of data-sharing decisions. However, we hope our results will remain qualitatively valid in real-world settings since we used a market model widely adopted in the economic theoretical literature (Chone and Linnemer, 2019) and a data impact model motivated by established theoretical frameworks in machine learning (Tsybakov, 2004). Also, we hope that the three-component decomposition of the data-sharing problem will help practitioners leverage their situation-specific knowledge of their market and ML models to build more accurate models for their specific needs.
