###### Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) are being deployed across various domains today. However, their capacity to solve Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges in cybersecurity has not been thoroughly evaluated. To address this, we develop a novel method to assess LLMs in solving CTF challenges by creating a scalable, open-source benchmark database specifically designed for these applications. This database includes metadata for LLM testing and adaptive learning, compiling a diverse range of CTF challenges from popular competitions. Utilizing the advanced function calling capabilities of LLMs, we build a fully automated system with an enhanced workflow and support for external tool calls. Our benchmark dataset and automated framework allow us to evaluate the performance of five LLMs, encompassing both black-box and open-source models. This work lays the foundation for future research into improving the efficiency of LLMs in interactive cybersecurity tasks and automated task planning. By providing a specialized benchmark, our project offers an ideal platform for developing, testing, and refining LLM-based approaches to vulnerability detection and resolution. Evaluating LLMs on these challenges and comparing with human performance yields insights into their potential for AI-driven cybersecurity solutions to perform real-world threat management. We make our benchmark dataset open source to public https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/NYU_CTF_Bench along with our playground automated framework https://github.com/NYU-LLM-CTF/llm_ctf_automation.

## 1 Introduction

### Motivation

Capture-the-Flag (CTF) competitions have evolved into a crucial tool for cybersecurity training since their inception at DEFCON in 1993. These competitions simulate real-world security scenarios, encompassing domains such as cryptography, forensics, binary exploitation, code reverse engineering, and web exploitation. Competitors are tasked with identifying vulnerabilities using state-of-the-art cybersecurity techniques. CTF challenges come in two main types: Jeopardy and Attack-Defense. Jeopardy-style challenges require competitors to uncover and print hidden flags, typically character strings, demonstrating successful challenge completion. Attack-Defense challenges involve participants defending their systems while simultaneously attacking others.

The use of machine learning (ML), particularly large language models (LLMs), in cybersecurity is an emerging area of interest, presenting unique challenges and opportunities for innovation. There is significant interest in understanding the offensive cybersecurity capabilities of LLM agents, ashighlighted by frameworks such as OpenAI's preparedness framework  and discussions from institutions like United States' National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)  and United Kingdom's Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute (AISI) .

Solving CTF tasks requires advanced, multi-step reasoning and the ability to competently take action in a digital environment, making them an excellent test of general LLM reasoning capabilities. These tasks necessitate procedural knowledge, offering a more robust evaluation of what a model can do compared to multiple-choice question evaluations like Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) [22; 49] or Graduate-Level Google-Proof Questions and Answers Benchmark (GPQA) . Additionally, CTF tasks are easy to evaluate automatically by checking if the correct flag is obtained, a valuable property for benchmarks. This also presents opportunities for improving LLM reasoning capabilities through unsupervised learning or reinforcement learning, where models can attempt challenges repeatedly, with success serving as a signal for model improvement.

To date, autonomous cyber-attacks have been largely symbolic [14; 42], employing tools like fuzzers, decompilers, disassemblers, and static code analysis to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities. The 2016 DARPA Cyber Grand Challenge (CGC) highlighted the potential of automated systems in cybersecurity, showcasing machines autonomously detecting and patching software vulnerabilities in real-time . Our research builds on this legacy by creating a comprehensive benchmark dataset for evaluating LLMs in solving CTF challenges. CTFs offer a controlled environment that mimics real-world cyber threats, providing an ideal playground for testing and enhancing the capabilities of LLMs in addressing cybersecurity issues. The successful application of LLMs in software engineering tasks such as code generation [3; 65], bug detection and repair , and interpretability [16; 17] suggests their potential in solving cybersecurity challenges as well. Preliminary studies have shown promise in applying LLMs to solve CTFs [14; 53; 41], but they have been limited in scope, often involving human assistance. We aim to evaluate the ability of LLMs to solve CTFs autonomously, akin to the DARPA CGC. This complex task requires equipping LLMs with access to essential tools such as decompilers and disassemblers.

### Contribution

In this paper, we present _a large, high-quality, public benchmark dataset of CTF challenges and a framework to evaluate a wide array of LLMs on these challenges, integrated with access to eight critical cybersecurity tools_. Our benchmark, comprising 200 CTF challenges from popular competitions, is coupled with an automated framework designed to solve these challenges. This framework leverages LLMs to tackle CTF challenges by analyzing executables, source code, and challenge descriptions.

Our contributions are threefold: (1). An open benchmark dataset of 200 diverse CTF challenges, representing a broad spectrum of topics. (2). An automated framework that leverages both open-source and black-box LLMs to solve CTF challenges, showcasing the potential and limitations of current machine learning models in this domain. (3). A comprehensive toolkit that integrates six distinct tools and function calling capabilities to enhance LLM-based solutions. To foster collaboration and innovation in improving the LLMs' ability to solve CTF challenges, we made our challenge database and the automated solving framework public. This enables researchers to develop, test, and refine machine learning algorithms tailored to cybersecurity applications, driving advancements in AI-driven vulnerability detection and resolution.

### Related Work

Since the inception of CTF competitions, various platforms have been developed to cater to different objectives and environments [10; 11; 12; 37; 30]. These platforms are for human CTF competitions and cannot be used for LLM agents. We develop a framework that deploys the CTFs and provides an environment for LLM agents to solve the challenges. Several studies have assessed CTF platforms. For example, Kucek and Leitner  conducted a review to evaluate the functionality and game configuration of 12 open-source CTF environments. Similarly, Karagiannis et al.  evaluated four well-known open-source CTF platforms, emphasizing their utility in improving education. CTF competitions strengthen cybersecurity across a wide range of topics by providing vulnerable environments that enable participants to assess and enhance their programming skills. They are recognized as educational tools [8; 21; 25; 30; 31; 48], serve as guidelines for application design [7; 27], are used for assessment , and function as social networking platforms . These studies have established the use of CTFs as playgrounds to train cybersecurity professionals in real-world cybersecurity tasks.

AI systems have been used to solve CTF challenges . Tann et al.  manually analyzed the performance of ChatGPT, Google Bard, and Microsoft Bing on seven CTF challenges. Similarly, Yang et al. 's InterCode-CTF manually examined effectiveness of ChatGPT 3.5 and 4.0 on 100 problems from PicoCTF. PentestGPT  was designed for penetration testing using LLMs and was tested with 10 CTF challenges.

Our work presents an open database with 200 CTF challenges spanning cybersecurity domains and difficulty levels. Additionally, we provide a framework for automated CTF challenge solving using LLMs with cybersecurity tool integration. This framework has been tested on five LLMs (both open and closed-source). Table 1 highlights the unique aspects and innovations of our approach.

## 2 NYU CTF Bench

Our benchmark is based on the CTF competition of New York University's (NYU) annual Cybersecurity Awareness Week (CSAW), one of the most comprehensive cybersecurity events globally2. Over 3,000 students and professionals participate in the CSAW preliminary round, with the final competition bringing together 100-plus teams across five global academic centers. Our initial database comprised 568 CTF challenges sourced from the global CSAW CTF competitions . These challenges were created manually and will continue to grow as we gather more challenges from upcoming CSAW CTF events. From this initial pool, we validated 200 challenges across six distinct categories. Table 2 shows the number of validated CTF challenges for each category.

We validated each of the 200 CTF challenges in the database by manually verifying their setup and ensuring they remain solvable despite changes in software package versions. For challenges requiring server-side deployment, we performed manual verification to ensure that the server container can successfully connect from both external and internal devices within the same Docker network. This process simulates a real-world CTF environment. For challenges that do not require server deployment, we checked their configuration files and source code, ensuring that all necessary information about the challenge was present. This process helped us identify any missing files due to maintenance activities since the year they were used.

CTF challenges vary in difficulty level, with more difficult challenges awarded higher points, similar to an examination grading system. For NYU CTF Bench, the points range from 1 to 500. Figure1

shows the distribution of challenge difficulties in the qualifying and final rounds. The qualifying round problems tend to be of lower difficulty, while the final round problems are significantly harder. These points reflect a subjective assessment of problem difficulty, as determined by the experienced challenge creators who design CSAW's CTFs.

### Benchmark Structure

Given the extensive range of CSAW's CTF competition years represented, from 2011 to 2023, we faced the challenge of standardizing the benchmark for consistent use and future expansion. We observed that older CTF challenges often required distinct environments for deployment compared to more recent challenges. Earlier challenges had Dockerfiles that necessitated specific outdated package versions for proper deployment.

To address this, we validated each challenge in the database and ensured that Docker Hub images for each challenge could be loaded with Docker Compose, making necessary adjustments to ensure external connectivity. This deployment leverages Docker containers that can be loaded directly, eliminating the need to build them from scratch. The Docker images encapsulate all necessary environments, allowing each challenge to function seamlessly within a single container. We then integrated these images with their corresponding source code and metadata. For each challenge, our database includes a JSON file containing all essential information and the necessary configuration for deployment. Figure 2 shows the complete structure of the CTF database and its components. For NYU CTF, we organize the challenges in the directory structure: Year/Competition/Event/Category/Challenge Name. Each CTF challenge has two required components: (1) A JSON file, which contains metadata including the name of the challenge (name), initial description of the challenge (description), files needed to solve the challenge (files), and host and port information (box and internal_ports). This part of the information is visible to the model. The JSON file also includes the ground truth of the real CTF flag for the challenge, which is invisible to the model. (2) For challenges requiring a server connection, a docker-compose.yml file is included to pull all necessary images from Docker Hub to build the server container.

All source files for the challenges, including source code, configuration files, original Dockerfiles, and other multimedia files (such as images, slides, or raw text documents containing sensitive information), are included. However, only the files listed in the "files" field of the challenge.json are visible to the model, mimicking the real-world conditions of CSAW CTF competitions. Other files can be used as references by users of the benchmark.

### Benchmark Categories

Tables 3 provides example challenges for each category of CTF challenges in our NYU CTF Bench. These examples illustrate the variety and complexity of tasks that participants encounter. Tables 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 in the Appendix has details of all 200 validated CTF challenges.

**Cryptography (crypto)** challenges involve a mix of encryption methods requiring knowledge of cryptanalysis, mathematical theories, programming, cryptographic protocols, and relevant tools. These challenges range from using antiquated ciphers like RSA to modern encryption techniques where the flag must be recovered by reversing encrypted messages. Challenges are typically arranged as either a local encrypted file or a challenge server hosted in a Docker container, accessible via the netcat command. For server-based challenges, solvers use decrypted messages from the server's output to communicate and send the correct decrypted payload. For local encrypted files, solvers employ current or hinted cryptographic algorithms to decrypt the encoded flag to plaintext. Proficiency in mathematics and familiarity with tools like SageMath and command line execution is crucial.

**Forensics** challenges mimic cybercrime investigations, requiring participants to analyze digital data such as corrupted files and network captures. Essential skills include digital forensics, data recovery, memory and network analysis, reverse engineering, and the use of forensic tools and operating systems. These challenges involve recovering hidden data from various file formats, analyzing malware, and investigating network intrusions, relying on real-world digital data. Solvers must recover hidden messages to capture the flag. They require a diverse skill set and common sense, unlike more specialized categories like Cryptography. Tools used include image scanning and analysis, command line execution, and creating files to send payloads and communicate with servers.

**Binary analysis (pwn)** challenges focus on exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows and use-after-free to gain unauthorized access. Skills required include exploit writing, vulnerability analysis, and reverse engineering binaries using low-level programming, assembly language, and debuggers. The difficulty of pwn challenges varies based on mitigations such as executable stacks and address randomization, often checked with _checksec_. Easier challenges might allow buffer overflows to inject shellcode, while more secure setups may require heap exploitation. Each pwn challenge in our benchmark is implemented using Docker containers with an exposed port. Essential tools include ROP gadgets, assembly code, and debuggers to craft the necessary payload.

**Reverse engineering (rev)** challenges require understanding software systems to extract sensitive information or find exploitable vulnerabilities. This involves decompiling and disassembling binary executables to source code, deciphering custom file formats, and identifying weak algorithm implementations. Without source information like code comments or design diagrams, significant domain-specific knowledge and guesswork are needed. Some challenges are offline and involve analyzing files to reveal hidden information, validated locally by extracting the flag. Others require finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in binaries, validated by interacting with Docker containers to

trigger the vulnerability. Essential tools include Ghidra for decompilation, radare2 for static analysis, and angr for symbolic execution, along with proficiency in assembly and C code.

**Web** challenges involve exploiting vulnerabilities such as injection flaws and cross-site scripting. Essential skills include network protocol exploitation, web app security testing, packet analysis, and both back-end and front-end development. Understanding client-server communication and network protocols is crucial. These challenges often require interacting with CTF challenge servers to access protected data or gain unauthorized capabilities, either through web interface interaction or terminal communication using command line tools. Web challenges in our benchmark are implemented as Docker containers with an exposed port. Solvers send payloads to the simulated website server to reveal the hidden flag. Tools include web code analysis and tools like curl to interact with the web interface.

**Miscellaneous (misc)** challenges encompass a broad range of security tasks, including data analysis, e-discovery, and social engineering. Solving these problems requires skills in data mining, traffic analysis, and scripting for data manipulation and automation. Occasionally, CSAW includes mobile _.apk_ reversing, requiring specific tools and decompilers. These challenges often target emerging vulnerabilities and newer technologies, making them unique compared to other categories. Validation involves applying general CTF principles of identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities, often using Docker containers with exposed ports for server connection or interacting with provided source files. Solvers must research the domain and apply standard exploits. For example, for Android-related challenges, agents need a JDK development environment and the ability to interact with _.dex_ files.

## 3 Automatic CTF Evaluation Framework with LLMs

The framework in Figure 3 includes underlying logic, steps, and the prompt structures used. We discuss input specifications for the models and the methodologies for validating outputs. Critical to maintaining the integrity and robustness of our system, we discuss error handling. This will enable peers to replicate our work and build up on foundational effort. The framework has five modules:

1. Backend Modulefacilitates communication between the local framework and the remote server hosting LLM services. As of the release date, we support three backend configurations: (1). LLM Services from OpenAI: We support the following models: gpt-4-1106-preview, gpt-4-0125-preview, and gpt-3.5-turbo-1106. (2). LLM Services from Anthropic: We support three models: claude-3-haiku-20240307, claude-3-sonnet-20240229, and claude-3-opus-20240229. OpenAI and Anthropic

Figure 3: Architecture of the automated CTF solution framework.

backends operate using an API key, which functions as an authorization key. It is loaded from secret files at the start of the challenge-solving process. The rate limit--the maximum number of tokens that can be sent and received--is determined by the API key. (3). Open-Source models deployed through TGI and VLLMs: They provide a URL for the backend to receive responses from the model. Open-source backend supports five models: mistatalai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1, deepseck-ai/deepsek-coder-33b-instruct, llama3:70b-instruct-fp16, wizardlm2:8x22b-q8_0, and eta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct. Users of our framework can connect to these models by obtaining the URL through these methods or by deploying them on local servers.

2. Data LoaderOur framework uses two methods to load challenges: Docker containers as challenge servers or loading from local challenge files. For challenges using a Docker container on the server side, Docker Compose is employed with the configuration YML file to pull the image from Docker Hub. At the start of the challenge setup, the framework scans the challenge information to determine if a Docker container exists, then loads it from the docker-compose.yml file, pulls the image, and starts it running. With the details provided in the challenge.json metadata, the framework connects to challenge containers using the designated host and port. For reverse engineering challenges requiring local file access, the source code is loaded. Challenge files are transferred to a temporary folder, then mounted in our player container. This setup allows the player container to access these files, either as clues for solving the challenge or for reversing the binary. We implemented a garbage collector to manage resources efficiently. Once the framework solves a CTF challenge, it stops all Docker containers and removes the loaded Docker images from the environment. For challenges loaded via source code, the source code files are mounted in temporary folders, which are cleaned up after use.

3. External ToolsEnhancing LLMs with the capability to utilize external tools can significantly improve their task-solving abilities. Models like ChatGPT and Gemini feature built-in functions such as conducting web searches, performing mathematical calculations, and executing Python code. External tools are integrated through code APIs , which are used in our framework. Newer LLMs offer native function-calling support, such as StarfleetAI'spolaris-small and Trelis. Our research explores the benefits of providing models with access to domain-specific tools to augment their capabilities in solving CTF challenges: **run_command**: Enables the LLM to execute commands within an Ubuntu 22.04 Docker container equipped with essential tools (e.g., compilers, debuggers, Python, pwntools a comprehensive list is available in Appendix B). **createfile** generates a file inside the Docker container, with the option to decode escape sequences for files with binary content. **disassemble and decompile**: Uses Ghidra to disassemble and decompile a specified function in a binary. If no function name is given, it defaults to disassembling the main function or the executable's entry point (_start) if debug symbols are absent. **check_flag**: Allows the LLM to verify the correctness of a discovered flag in a CTF challenge. **give_up**: Allows the LLM to stop its efforts on a challenge, reducing unnecessary work after recognizing that the model can no longer progress effectively. These tools are tailored to the challenge category; all are included for the 'pwn' and'rev' categories, but tools like disassemble and decompile are excluded for others, such as web challenges, to avoid distractions like attempting to decompile a Python script. Most LLMs cannot execute specific tasks or functions within their responses, known as function calling. This involves converting a natural language request into a structured format that enables built-in functions within the toolkit to be invoked and executed locally. Models from OpenAI natively support function calling,

Figure 4: Example of Default Prompt Format Used in the Framework.

and Anthropic models offer partial support. Open-source models such as LLaMA 3 and Mixtral lack this feature. To enable function calling, the formatting module transforms prompt information into a format suitable for function calling (XML and YAML). The formatted information is sent to external tools, allowing LLMs without native function calling to invoke them.

4. Logging SystemOur logging system uses rich text Markdown formats to structure logs categorized into four types: system prompts, user prompts, model outputs, and debugging information. Each solution process begins with a system message that introduces the CTF and specifics of the task. This is followed by a user message describing the challenge sourced from the challenge's JSON, along with commands such as instructions for the LLM to install packages or connect to the container server. The assistant message is a formatted version of the model's response, tailored to the user message, allowing the model to receive feedback from the user input or its own responses. We include debug messages and outputs from external tools. These messages are invaluable for analysis after the solving process is completed, as they can be reviewed by humans for insights into the performance and decision-making process of the framework. Logging occurs in two stages: during the solving process, real-time output is available through system and user prompts, as well as the model's responses and debugging messages. Once the solution process is completed, all logs are saved as JSON files in a designated log folder which can be converted to human-readable html format. The archive includes metadata such as network info, challenge details, model data, and results.

5. Prompt ModuleFigure 4 illustrates how our system arranges the prompts to solve the CTF challenges. The process, from the challenge.json file to the finished solution, is divided into multiple sections. There is a challenge prompt that includes challenge name, category, host, port, description, and files, stored in a JSON file. A prompt template extracts data from the challenge. The system prompt informs the model of the objective and the flag format for the CTF. A user prompt has an initial message with challenge name, category, description, and files (see Initial Message in Figure4). Finally, the model prompt helps the model understand the challenge's content and interpret results obtained from executing its commands. By following these suggestions, we reach the solution for the challenge, which is marked as'solved' in the figure.

## 4 Initial Experiments in Solving CTFs with LLMs

We configured our framework on a local server that hosts the source code, benchmark database, and Docker images for challenges requiring server-side containers. To ensure seamless operation, we installed all necessary packages and securely stored essential keys and URLs, including API keys for models hosted by OpenAI and Anthropic, as well as URLs for open-source models deployed on our inference server. This setup allows our framework to interact with black-box models linked to our OpenAI and Anthropic accounts and open-source models deployed on inference servers, ensuring smooth and accurate execution of experiments. We utilized GPT and Claude models from OpenAI and Anthropic's inference APIs, ensuring our accounts had sufficient credits. For open-source models, we deployed them on our inference server equipped with Nvidia A100 GPUs using the VLLM and TGI frameworks. This setup provided our framework with inference URLs, enabling experiments based on the server environment's capabilities and performance.

We conducted experiments on all validated challenges from Section 2, repeating the solving process five times for each challenge to reduce randomness in model responses. A successful solution required the model to solve the challenge at least once in these five attempts. Instances where the model gave up, executed incorrect commands, or generated incorrect code were considered unsuccessful. Failures also included cases where the model exhausted all attempts without producing the correct flag or failed to use the check flag tool correctly. Our experiments simulated a real-world CTF competition using the benchmark from Section 2. Each LLM had a 48-hour limit to solve the challenges, mirroring the conditions of the CTF competitions from which our database was sourced.

### Baseline Performance and Comparison with Human CTF Players

Table 4 summarizes the results of our evaluation of five LLMs across six categories of CTF challenges, revealing distinct differences in their abilities. GPT-4 performed the best overall, though its success was limited. Claude showed strong performance in some categories, while GPT-3.5

demonstrated reasonable competence in certain tasks. Mixtral and LLaMA did not solve any challenges, highlighting the difficulties faced by open-source models.

The failures of the LLMs were categorized into five types: failure to connect to the challenge, giving up or returning no answer, exceeding the maximum number of rounds without finding the correct solution, exceeding the model's token length limit, and providing an incorrect answer. The percentage of each failure type is also shown in Table 4. GPT-3.5 and Claude 3 have high "Give up" rates, suggesting these models abandon tasks when faced with difficulties. Mixtral and LLaMA show no successes across all categories, with a 100% of failures as "Wrong answer", indicating a limitation in handling specific questions or scenarios. GPT-4 and Claude 3 with larger context length show a drastic reduction in "Token exceeded" failures compared to GPT-3.5 with smaller context length. This analysis reveals the evolution of these models and their strengths and limitations.

To compare the success of LLMs in automatically solving CTFs against human performance, Table 4 summarizes the performance statistics of human participants in CSAW 2022 and 2023. Among the LLMs, GPT-4 performed best in the 2023 qualifiers with a score of 300, but it did not score in the 2022 events or the 2023 finals. GPT-3.5 did not score in the 2023 events but achieved scores of 500 and 1000 in the 2022 qualifiers and finals, respectively. Claude 3 did not score in the 2023 events but _outperformed the median human score in the 2022 finals with a score of 1500_. Claude 3 also scored 500 in the 2022 qualifiers. These results highlight that GPT-4 showed some success in the 2023 qualifiers. GPT-3.5 demonstrated reasonable performance in the 2022 events but struggled in the 2023 events. Claude 3 showed strong performance in the 2022 finals, indicating its potential to exceed average human performance sometimes. From our analysis, the varying scores of different LLMs across events and years is attributed to three factors: (1) the high task complexity leads to different approaches, (2) challenges has varying difficulties and Finals are tougher than Quals, (3) each evaluation uses the default temperature, which adds randomness.

### Ethics Concerning LLMs in Offensive Security

While CTF challenges can be used for benchmarking task planning and automation, they remain rooted in cyber-attack scenarios, making ethics a critical consideration when employing them. The rapid advancement of LLMs has sparked a range of ethical, security, and privacy concerns, underscoring the need for careful deployment strategies. While LLMs have improved their ability to provide accurate and appropriate responses while reducing the likelihood of responding to illegal requests, misuse risks remain. These include exploitation for social engineering or malware creation, revealing the dual nature of AI as both a tool and a potential threat. The legal framework is struggling to keep pace with developments in AI. Researchers advocate for explainable AI to foster transparency in LLM decisions, stressing the importance of robust policy frameworks to prevent AI abuse. In the context of CTFs, integrating LLMs introduces significant ethical considerations. Education tailored to AI ethics is crucial, given the disconnect between current cybersecurity training and rapid advances in AI tools. Furthermore, the misuse of LLMs to launch sophisticated attacks

raises concerns around malicious use. However, the benefit of CTFs in cybersecurity education is well-accepted. In our experiments, we observe no instance where the LLM refuses to solve a challenge due to ethical conflicts, which indicates that current LLMs understand the educational context of CTFs. While this behavior can be misused, further research can help improve LLM alignment and safety.

## 5 Conclusion and Future Work

We developed a scalable, open-source benchmark dataset comprising 200 CTF challenges from seven years of NYU CTF competitions, featuring six categories. This comprehensive dataset is the foundation of our framework for automating CTF-solving using LLMs. By evaluating three black-box models and two open-source models, we demonstrated that LLMs show potential in tackling large-scale CTF challenges within time constraints. However, our analysis also revealed several limitations. First, while the initial database contained 567 challenges, not all are included in the current NYU CTF Bench as we have not finished validating them. Consequently, certain categories, such as Incident Response (IR)--which simulates real-world cybersecurity incidents and is more challenging to validate--are not included in our NYU CTF Bench. Additionally, there is an imbalance in the number of challenges across categories. Some categories, like "rev," "crypto," "pwn," and "misc," contain more challenges, while others, such as "forensics," and "web," are underrepresented. Future iterations of this research aim to: (1) Address Dataset Imbalance and Diversity: A balanced distribution of challenges across all categories will enhance the validity of results and allow for fair comparison between different challenge types. Our current database is sourced from a single CTF series, NYU's CSAW. By incorporating challenges from more competitions, we can increase the diversity of challenges. (2) Enhance Tool/Platform Support: Models sometimes use inappropriate tools, such as C/C++ reverse engineering tools on Python code. Expanding tool and platform support will mitigate such issues. (3) Update model support according to the community roadmaps, ensuring that the framework remains current.
