###### Abstract

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technologies enable the exploration of cellular heterogeneity and facilitate the construction of cell atlases. However, scRNA-seq data often contain a large portion of missing values (false zeros) or noisy values, hindering downstream analyses. To recover these false zeros, propagation-based imputation methods have been proposed using \(k\)-NN graphs. However they model only associating relationships among genes within a cell, while, according to well-known genetic evidence, there are both associating and dissociating relationships among genes. To apply this genetic evidence to gene-gene relationship modeling, this paper proposes a novel imputation method that newly employs dissociating relationships in addition to associating relationships. Our method constructs a \(k\)-NN graph to additionally model dissociating relationships via the negation of a given cell-gene matrix. Moreover, our method standardizes the value distribution (mean and variance) of each gene to have standard distributions regardless of the gene. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed method achieves exceptional performance gains over state-of-the-art methods in both cell clustering and gene expression recovery across six scRNA-seq datasets, validating the significance of using complete gene-gene relationships in accordance with genetic evidence.

## 1 Introduction

Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has become one of the most widely used technologies in biomedical research due to its ability to measure genome-wide gene expression at the single-cell level . ScRNA-seq enables us to discover novel cell types , analyze cellular trajectories , and improve understanding human disease . However, scRNA-seq analysis encounters significant challenges due to the high rate of zero values in scRNA-seq data represented by a cell-gene matrix. Specifically, owing to the low RNA capture rate, scRNA-seq data often contain zero values. These zero values represent unobserved gene expression resulting from both technical omissions (referred to as _dropouts_) and true biological absence. Moreover, even non-zero values in scRNA-seq data suffer from various sources of noise, such as cell cycle effects and batch effects .

Figure 1: Within a cell, there are two types of relationships among genes.

To deal with the missing or noisy gene expression in scRNA-seq data, diverse imputation methods have been proposed, which can be categorized into non-graph-based, graph neural network (GNN)-based, and propagation-based methods. Among these methods, propagation-based methods [11; 12] have been favored due to their outstanding performance. The propagation-based methods construct a \(k\)-nearest neighbor (\(k\)-NN) graph on scRNA-seq data represented as a cell-gene matrix, and fill in missing values by propagating nonzero values on the \(k\)-NN graph. Despite their effectiveness, they overlook well-known genetic evidence [13; 14], which means that there are two types of relationships between genes: associating relationship and dissociating one. As shown in Figure 1, associating relationships represent genes that co-occur, whereas dissociating relationships represent genes that avoid co-occurrence.

However, the existing methods cannot model the dissociating gene-gene relationship by constructing a simple \(k\)-NN graph to connect only the associating genes with similar occurrence patterns. Consequently, these methods fail to connect dissociating genes. Within a cell, when considering the value to be imputed for gene Q, the value for its associating gene can assist in inferring the value for gene Q. However, its dissociating gene can also provide crucial information: if its dissociating gene has a high value, the value for gene Q may be low, as they tend to avoid each other. Additionally, the value distribution of a gene often differs significantly from that of other genes . Therefore, the sum of propagated values from other genes may lead to the mixing of values at various scales, which is not suitable for data recovery.

To resolve the aforementioned problems, we propose a novel propagation-based imputation scheme called Single-Cell Complete Relationship (scCR) for scRNA-seq data, which models both associating and dissociating gene-gene relationships. scCR concatenates a given cell-gene matrix and its negation, then standardize the value distribution (mean and variance) in each column (_i.e._, gene) of the concatenated matrix. Subsequently, we construct a \(k\)-NN graph on this concatenated and standardized matrix to connect both associating and dissociating genes within a cell. Through a propagation process on this \(k\)-NN graph, scCR effectively denoises scRNA-seq data by capturing complete gene-gene relationships. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that scCR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both gene expression recovery and cell clustering. Through experiment, we further confirm that scCR can model dissociating gene-gene relationships inherent in scRNA-seq data.

The main contributions of our work are summarized as follows: (1) We newly propose an effective imputation method for scRNA-seq data, which is based on the genetic evidence. Our method can model complete gene-gene relationships, including both associating and dissociating relationships; (2) We employ a standardization step before propagation among genes for additional performance improvement in downstream tasks on scRNA-seq data; (3) By modeling dissociating gene-gene relationships and utilizing the standardization step, our scCR significantly improves performance in various downstream tasks, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin.

## 2 Related Work

**Handling noise in scRNA-seq data.** Approaches for handling noise in scRNA-seq data can be categorized into non-graph-based, GNN-based, and propagation-based methods. As pioneering efforts to impute zero values, non-graph-based methods predominantly employ either statistical techniques [16; 17] or autoencoder frameworks [17; 18]. Building on this foundation, graph-based approaches, including GNN-based and propagation-based methods, have received significant attention due to their ability to model relationships among cells and genes through graph structures. scGNN  leverages cell-cell relationships by constructing a cell-cell similarity matrix within a graph autoencoder framework. scGCL  is a graph autoencoder framework that exploits contrastive learning to capture cell-cell relationships. scTAG  is a clustering method that employs a graph autoencoder framework using a cell-cell \(k\)-NN graph, which jointly optimizes clustering loss and reconstruction loss.

**Propagation-based imputation in scRNA-seq data.** Propagation-based imputation methods have shown their superiority in scRNA-seq data imputation. They promote greater similarity in gene expression among cells that are already similar through iterative propagation steps. While MAGIC  utilizes a diffusion mechanism to denoise scRNA-seq data, updating values through the diffusion of both zero values and observed nonzero values may be significantly affected by false zero values (_i.e._, dropouts). To address this issue, Feature Propagation (FP)  can be a good solution because FP preserves observed values during diffusion while updates unobserved values through diffusion. Propagation-based imputation methods have shown their superiority in scRNA-seq data imputation. scFP  adopts FP developed for graph-structured data to resolve imputation for scRNA-seq data. scFP constructs a cell-cell \(k\)-NN graph and applies FP for the imputation of zero values. Very recently,  proposes scBFP to utilize gene-gene relationships as well as cell-cell relationships. scBFP consists of two stages, and in each stage, it applies FP using a gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph and a cell-cell \(k\)-NN graph, respectively. Although scBFP is designed to leverage gene-gene relationships, the simple addition of FP using a gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph cannot effectively exploit gene-gene relationships due to the following two reasons: **(1)** a gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph can connect only associating genes which have co-occurrence relationships while overlooking the presence of dissociating gene-gene relationships; **(2)** Since the distributions for each gene significantly varies, propagation without additional processing will degrade recovery performance.

## 3 Preliminaries

**Notation.** A graph can be represented as \(=(,)\), where \(=\{v_{1},,v_{N}\}\) is the set of \(N\) nodes and \(\) is the set of edges. The connectivity of \(\) can be represented by the adjacency matrix \(\{0,1\}^{N N}\) with \(_{i,j}=1\) iff \((v_{i},v_{j})\) and \(_{i,j}=0\) otherwise. Given an arbitrary matrix \(^{a b}\), we let \(k():^{a b}\{\}^{a a}\) be a function that generates a normalized adjacency matrix \(}\) of the row-row \(k\)-NN graph based on cosine similarity. Here, the normalized adjacency matrix \(}\) is obtained by \(}=^{-1/2}^{-1/2}\) where \(\) is the adjacency matrix of the \(k\)-NN graph and \(\) is a degree matrix with diagonal entries \(_{i,i}=_{j}_{i,j}\). Consequently, while \(k()\) yields \(}^{cell}\{0,1\}^{C C}\) of the cell-cell \(k\)-NN graph from \(\), \(k(^{})\) produces \(}^{gene}\{0,1\}^{G G}\) of the gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph from \(\). We let \(_{i,:}\) and \(_{:,j}\) denote the \(i\)-th row vector of \(\) and the \(j\)-th column vector of \(\), respectively.

**Feature Propagation.** FP-based algorithms [23; 24] are proposed to impute missing features in graph-structured data. The core idea of FP is to impute missing values by diffusing observed values while preserving these observed values. Assume that a given graph \(=(,)\) has a feature matrix \(^{N F}\) with missing values, where rows and columns correspond to nodes and \(F\) feature channels, respectively. We use \(}^{N N}\) to denote a normalized adjacency matrix of the graph. To preserve known features during the diffusion process, we mark the positions of the features to be

preserved with \(1\) in the mask matrix \(\{0,1\}^{N F}\); here, values of \(1\) in \(\) indicate the location of observed features. We express FP as a function by \(}=(,},)\) where \(}^{N F}\) is an output matrix. A detailed explanation of FP is provided in Appendix A. In summary, FP fills in missing values in \(\) through diffusion using \(\) while preserving features corresponding to values of \(1\) in \(\). It is noteworthy that \((,,)\) performs propagation among the rows of \(\). In scRNA-seq data imputation, FP-based imputation methods treat zero values as missing values to be imputed via features diffused from non-zero values.

## 4 Proposed Method

### Overview of scCR

In this paper, we design a novel imputation framework for scRNA-seq data, namely scCR, which utilizes complete gene-gene relationships. Unlike existing work, scCR exploits both associating and dissociating relationships, which contain valuable biological information. Given highly noisy scRNA-seq data, especially having a high number of false zeros, the goal of scCR is to recover scRNA-seq data by imputing zero values. As shown in Figure 2, our proposed framework consists of three stages: pre-imputation, complete relation, and denoising. Throughout these three stages, we enhance a gene expression matrix by gradually integrating complete gene-gene and cell-cell relationships.

### Pre-Imputation Stage

We consider a cell-gene matrix \(^{C G}\), where \(C\) and \(G\) represent the number of cells and genes, respectively. We let \(^{cell}\{0,1\}^{C C}\) denote an adjacency matrix of a cell-cell graph. Similarly, we let \(^{gene}\{0,1\}^{G G}\) denote an adjacency matrix of a gene-gene graph. Building a \(k\)-NN graph directly on \(\) can lead to performance degradation in downstream tasks due to the noisy nature of \(\). Therefore, scCR begins with the pre-imputation stage, which creates a pre-imputed matrix to be used for \(k\)-NN graph construction in the complete relationship stage. In this stage, scCR imputes zero values through intercellular (_i.e._, cell-cell) propagation.

**Cell-cell FP.** We first construct a cell-cell \(k\)-NN graph by \(}^{cell(1)}=k()\). scCR then employs FP to impute zero values by the diffusion of nonzero values among cells. We let \(^{}\{0,1\}^{C G}\) be a mask matrix with \(^{}_{i,j}=1\) iff \(_{i,j} 1\) and \(^{}_{i,j}=0\) otherwise, which indicates the positions of the nonzero features in \(\) to be preserved during the diffusion. Cell-cell FP using \(}^{cell(1)}\) is performed as follows,

\[}^{(1)}=(,}^{cell (1)},^{})\] (1)

where \(}^{(1)}^{C G}\) is an output of the pre-imputation stage, which is utilized in the following complete relationship stage.

### Complete Relationship Stage

In the complete relationship stage, we refine \(}^{(1)}\) through gene-gene and cell-cell propagation. ScBFP  adopts gene-gene FP on the \(k\)-NN graph constructed based on cosine similarity. However, it overlooks two key issues: **(1)** The similarity-based gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph can connect only associating (or co-occurring) genes, excluding highly correlated dissociating (or avoiding) genes, which can offer important biological information for imputation. This occurs because associating genes may have high cosine similarity due to their co-occurrence. These genes with high cosine similarity may become connected in the cosine-similarity-based \(k\)-NN graph. **(2)** As shown in Figure 3, since each gene has the distinct distribution within a gene expression matrix , the value distribution for a gene varies significantly among genes. Although imputation methods for scRNA-seq generally normalize a gene expression matrix in a cell-wise manner, varying scales across genes still remain after the cell-wise normalization. Therefore, propagation across genes may degrade accurate recovery by mixing values with different scales.

Figure 3: A subset of the gene expression matrix in the Baron Human dataset.

**Concatenation.** To address these key issues, we propose a novel propagation scheme called gene-gene standardized FP. The gene-gene standardized FP first produces \(^{com}^{C 2G}\) by concatenating \(}^{(1)}\) and its negative matrix along columns, _i.e._, \(^{com}=[}^{(1)},-}^{(1)}]\).

**Standardization.** Subsequently, to enable every gene to have the same scale during propagation among genes, we standardize \(^{com}\) in a column-wise manner. For \(b\{1,,2G\}\), we standardize \(^{com}\) to \(}^{com}^{C 2G}\) as follows,

\[}^{com}_{a,b}=^{com}_{a,b}-_{b})}{ _{b}}\ \ _{b}=_{a=1}^{C}^{com}_{a,b}\,\ _{b}=_{a=1}^{C}(^{com}_{a,b}-_{b})^{2}}.\] (2)

Here, \(_{b}\) and \(_{b}\) denote the mean and standard deviation of the \(b\)-th column (_i.e._, gene) of \(^{com}\). Since all the columns in \(}^{com}\) are standardized, SFP can effectively perform propagation-based imputation without the mixing of values at various scales, addressing the aforementioned issue **(2)**. Furthermore, by concatenating \(}^{(1)}\) with its negative matrix before the construction of \(}^{com}\), SFP can connect not only associating but also dissociating gene-gene relationships. As demonstrated in Figure 4, assume that the \(i\)-th gene and the \(j\)-th gene have strong dissociating relationships, where \(i,j\{1,,G\}\). Within any \(a\)-th cell (\(a\{1,,C\}\)), \(}^{(1)}_{a,i}\) will be very high when \(}^{(1)}_{a,j}\) is very low and vice versa. After the standardization, the cosine similarity between the \(i\)-th gene and the \(j\)-th gene will have a large negative value, which cannot be connected in a \(k\)-NN graph. However, through the concatenation, \(}^{com}_{:,(G+j)}\) corresponds to \(-}^{(1)}_{:,j}\). Thus, the cosine similarity between \(}^{com}_{:,i}\) and \(}^{com}_{:,(G+j)}\) has a large positive value, which will be connected in a \(k\)-NN graph. Therefore, through gene-gene propagation using this \(k\)-NN graph constructed by using \(}^{com}\), we can effectively exploit complete gene-gene relationships, including associating and dissociating relationships.

**Gene-gene FP.** We build a gene-gene \(k\)-NN graph on \((}^{com})^{}\) by \(}^{gene}=^{gene}}{k}(( }^{com})^{})\) where \(}^{gene}^{2G 2G}\). We then perform the gene-gene standardized FP using \(}^{gene}\) as follows:

\[}^{com}=(((}^{com})^{},^{gene},[^{},^{}]^{}))^ {}\] (3)

where \(}^{com}^{C 2G}\). Since each gene in \(}^{com}\) does not have its original scale due to the standardization, we return all the columns in \(}^{com}\) to their original scale as follows:

\[}^{com}_{a,b}=_{b}}^{com}_{a,b}+_ {b}\] (4)

where \(}^{com}^{C 2G}\) is the rescaled matrix. We then reduce \(}^{com}\) by retaining the first \(G\) columns, and we denote this reduced matrix as \(}^{*}^{C G}\). \(}^{*}\) is a final output of the gene-gene standardized FP.

**Cell-cell FP.**\(}^{*}\) containing information from complete gene-gene relationships plays a crucial role in scCR by contributing the formation of all subsequent cell-gene matrices. To perform additional

## 5 Experiments

### Experimental Setup

We performed comparative evaluation of scCR on six widely used scRNA-seq datasets with gold-standard cell type information: Baron Mouse , Pancreas , Mouse Bladder , Zeisel , Worm Neuron , and Baron Human . We compared our scCR with eight state-of-the-art methods handling noise in scRNA-seq data: (1) non-graph-based methods: DCA  and AutoClass ; (2) GNN-based methods: scTAG , scGNN 2.0 , and scGCL ; (3) propagation-based methods: MAGIC , scFP , and scBFP . We evaluated scTAG only on cell clustering, since scTAG is a clustering method. To evaluate the cell clustering of scCR and baselines, we utilized three standard evaluation metrics: Adjusted Rand Index (ARI), Normalized Mutual Information (NMI), and Clustering Accuracy (CA). We used KMeans clustering to compare the clustering performance of various imputation methods, including our scCR. For dropout recovery, we employed two standard evaluation metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Median L1 Distance.

**Implementation.** For fair comparisons, we set the hyperparameters of baselines according to specifications in the papers and official codes. We reported the average performance across three independent runs. Experimental details regarding datasets, baselines, evaluation metrics, and hyperparameter settings are provided in Appendix G.

### Results

**scCR enables improved cell clustering.** To validate the effectiveness of scCR in cell clustering, we evaluated its clustering performance. Table 1 presents the performance comparison. While FP-based baselines, including scFP and scBFP, outperformed other baselines, scCR delivered the best or competitive cell clustering performance across all datasets. Specifically, scCR improved ARI by \(25.3\%\), \(1.7\%\), \(6.4\%\), and \(21.6\%\) compared to previous state-of-the-art results on Baron Mouse, Mouse Bladder, Zeisel, and Baron Human, respectively.

**scCR effectively recovers dropout values.** Since dropouts can occur at various rates, we generated false zeros (_i.e._, dropouts) at non-zero values in datasets by applying varying dropout rates. As shown in Figure 5, scCR significantly improved dropout recovery performance in various dropout rates across the datasets. We confirmed that scCR effectively reduced RMSE between imputed values and their original values with large reduction rates, only except for the Pancreas dataset with \(40\%\) dropout. We provided a recovery performance comparison, measured by the median L1 distance in Appendix H.2, which also demonstrates the effectiveness of scCR.

Figure 5: Performance on dropout recovery, measured by RMSE. Figures highlighted in green indicate reduction rates from the most competitive baseline at each setting.

**scCR identifies rare cell types well.** To verify the effectiveness of scCR in identifying rare cell types, we conducted in-depth analysis using the Baron Human dataset. We visualized the two-dimensional UMAP  representations of the raw data and the data with an \(80\%\) dropout rate applied. As shown in the first row in Figure 6, scCR effectively identified rare cell types with few cells, such as 'gamma' and 'Macrophage'. It is noteworthy that even under severe dropouts, scCR separated cell types well (in the second row), whereas compared methods failed.

**Does scCR really model dissociating relationships?** To show that scCR models both associating and dissociating gene-gene relationships, we first investigated the ratio of dissociating relationships to associating relationships. For this investigation, we define that associating or dissociating relationships exist when the absolute values of the correlation coefficients between genes exceed the top \(25\%\). We determine that a positive sign in the correlation coefficients indicates associating relationships, while a negative sign indicates dissociating relationships. We then measured the percentages of

The first row shows the visualization of the raw data and their imputed results. The second row displays the visualization of data subjected to an \(80\%\) dropout rate and their imputed results.

associating and dissociating relationships within gene-gene \(k\)-NN graphs in scBFP and our scCR. As shown in Figure 7, scBFP hardly models dissociating gene-gene relationships. In contrast, scCR effectively models dissociating relationships, enabling the use of complete gene-gene relationships in its imputation.

**scCR is even faster than existing imputation methods.** To show the advantage of scCR in terms of imputation time, we measured the running time of scCR and imputation methods on datasets. As shown in Figure 8, scCR showed the lowest running time across all the datasets, regardless of the number of cells.

An ablation study (See Appendix C), further experimental results (See Appendix H), and the proof of convergence of FP (See Appendix B) are provided in Appendix.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel imputation framework called Single-Cell Complete Relationship (scCR) for scRNA-seq data imputation. scCR utilized complete gene-gene relationships by concatenating a given cell-gene matrix with its negation and facilitated effective gene-gene propagation through the standardization of the cell-gene matrix in a gene-wise manner. These processes, grounded in genetic evidence, led to significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art methods in various downstream tasks on scRNA-seq data, with fast imputation times. Furthermore, our work is not limited to simply utilizing genetic evidence to design a framework. We validated this evidence within real scRNA-seq datasets, and confirmed that our scCR effectively leveraged this insight. Like other scRNA-seq imputation methods, scCR is specifically designed for scRNA-seq data. However, since scRNA-seq data are inherently matrix-formatted, scCR can be extended to general tabular data imputation. We expect that the concatenation process will be effective even for general tabular data, as there are often both positive and negative correlation coefficients between channels in such data. The extension of scCR to other domains is left for future work.

## Broader Impacts

Our work provides an important insight that, when applying machine learning to the biomedical domain, it is crucial to approach with biological grounding rather than focusing solely on applying existing cutting-edge machine learning techniques. Since scRNA-seq has opened a new frontier for understanding biological systems [15; 30; 31], we believe that our work will contribute to the biomedical domain by enhancing the analysis of human diseases and the discovery of new genetic observations. We have not identified any negative impacts of our work on society.
