###### Abstract

Deep learning based neural decoding from stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG) would likely benefit from scaling up both dataset and model size. To achieve this, combining data across multiple subjects is crucial. However, in sEEG cohorts, each subject has a variable number of electrodes placed at distinct locations in their brain, solely based on clinical needs. Such heterogeneity in electrode number/placement poses a significant challenge for data integration, since there is no clear correspondence of the neural activity recorded at distinct sites between individuals. Here we introduce segenificant: a training framework and architecture that can be used to decode behavior across subjects using sEEG data. We tokenize the neural activity within electrodes using convolutions and extract long-term temporal dependencies between tokens using self-attention in the time dimension. The 3D location of each electrode is then mixed with the tokens, followed by another self-attention in the electrode dimension to extract effective spatiotemporal neural representations. Subject-specific heads are then used for downstream decoding tasks. Using this approach, we construct a multi-subject model trained on the combined data from 21 subjects performing a behavioral task. We demonstrate that our model is able to decode the trial-wise response time of the subjects during the behavioral task solely from neural data. We also show that the neural representations learned by pretraining our model across individuals can be transferred in a few-shot manner to new subjects. This work introduces a scalable approach towards sEEG data integration for multi-subject model training, paving the way for cross-subject generalization for sEEG decoding.

## 1 Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized many fields ranging from natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), to computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and neural decoding (Azabou et al., 2023). Advances in these fields have shown that performance and generalization benefit from scaling up both datasets and model size, underscoring the importance of integrating data across multiple individuals. Recent work by Azabou et al. (2023) showed that such approaches can achieve excellent generalization in the motor decoding domain, by combining invasive microelectrode array recordings from multiple non-human primates. Despite their promise, however, such approaches have not been used to build scalable decoders for human brain recordings collected with stereotactic electroencephalography (sEEG). Compared to other approaches (e.g., ECoG, microelectrodes), sEEG is minimally invasive and is currently the gold-standard clinical tool for invasive electrophysiology in humans. Therefore, building strong neural decoding models using sEEG promises to be medically relevant.

There are several challenges associated with decoding from sEEG data. A major barrier is the heterogeneity of the sEEG cohorts. SEEG subjects are most often patients suffering from pharmacoresistant epilepsy that are implanted with sEEG electrodes as part of their medical care. Each subject gets implanted with a variable number of electrodes in specific locations in their brain, solely based on clinical needs (Kovac et al., 2017). This heterogeneity makes it hard to identify any correspondence between the neural activity recorded across different subjects. This lack of correspondence poses a significant challenge to combining data across subjects in a meaningful way, resulting in most research groups resorting to within-subject models (Wu et al., 2024; Angrick et al., 2021; Petrosyan et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2021). While somewhat effective, single-subject approaches neither scale nor generalize, suggesting a need to effectively integrate multi-subject data.

Here we introduce segenificant: a scalable framework that can be used to decode behavior from sEEG recordings using multi-session, multi-subject data. Our approach uses a unified feature extraction backbone, designed to extract global behaviorally relevant neural representations that are shared across subjects. It uses personalized task-heads, tailored to the idiosyncrasies of individual participants, that can be used for downstream decoding tasks. To account for the heterogeneous electrode placement across individuals, we use a convolutional tokenizer that operates within electrodes individually. The tokenized latents are then processed by self-attention within the time dimension to capture long-term temporal dependencies within electrodes. Using a novel positional encoding scheme, we then imprint the latents of each electrode with information about their 3D location in the brain, using their MNI coordinates, a standarized 3D coordinate system used to localize brain regions (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988; Collins et al., 1994). The spatially aware latents are then processed by another self-attention that operates within the electrode dimension to capture long-range dependencies across electrodes. The resulting latents, are then compressed into neural representations that capture the spatiotemporal dependencies within and between electrodes that are used for behavioral decoding.

To evaluate our approach, we combine data from 21 subjects, across 29 recording sessions, that performed a behavioral reaction time task, while their sEEG was simultaneously recorded, totaling more that 3600 behavioral trials and 100 electrode-hours (number of electrodes \(\) number of recording hours) of sEEG recording. We demonstrate that using our approach, we are able to extract global neural representations, capable of decoding the response time of the participants during the behavioral task from neural data. Using a leave-one-out cross validation scheme, we also show that by pretraining our model on large amounts of data, we can transfer the learned neural representations to new subjects with minimal training examples. Our work introduces a novel framework designed to train models on multi-session, multi-subject sEEG data for behavioral decoding applications in a scalable way.

Our contributions can be summarized as:

* _A framework for multi-subject training based on sEEG._ We present a novel approach to training transformer based models for neural decoding based on the combined data of multi-subject, multi-session sEEG datasets.
* _Pre-trained models for behavioral decoding based on sEEG._ We trained a multi-session, multi-subject model for response time decoding based on sEEG that can be finetuned to new subjects. We will make the model and code publicly available as a resource for the community.

## 2 Related Work

### Neural decoding using sEEG

Over the past decade, significant progress has been made in the field of neural decoding using sEEG. Angrick et al. (2021) demonstrated effective real-time speech synthesis based on sEEG using a linear discriminant analysis approach, and Petrosyan et al. (2022) showed effective speech decoding using a convolutional architecture. Meng et al. (2021) identified discriminative features for decoding speech perception and overt and imagined speech production from sEEG using a non-deep learning model. Wu et al. (2022) showed that grasp force can be successfully decoded from sEEG signals using a CNN+RNN decoder and subsequently performed a comparative study where they explored the efficacy of using a variety of convolutional architectures to classify different movement based on the sEEG neural activity (Wu et al., 2023, 2024). Unfortunately, all aforementioned works conduct experiments on datasets containing only a few subjects (12 or less, except Wu et al. (2023)) and build within-subject models, with no clear vision towards generalization across subjects. Diverging from within-subject approaches, in this work we combine data from many subjects to build models capable of extracting global neural representations that generalize across subjects. Contrary to previous works which used CNNs and/or RNNs, we build our models using the transformer architecture, which has been shown to excel in capturing long-range dependencies when trained on large and diverse datasets.

### Transformer architectures for neural data

Transformers have attracted a lot of attention in the analysis of non-invasive neural signals. In the context of non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG), multiple works use the attention mechanism for various decoding tasks such as motor-imagery, visual decoding, and emotional recognition (Tang et al., 2024; Kan et al., 2023; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Lan et al., 2020). Song et al. (2023) achieved SOTA performance in a visual decoding task using a convolutional tokenizer that operates within both time and electrode dimensions and is then processed using self-attention. Using the same tokenization approach, Cui et al. (2023) built neuro-GPT, a foundational model for non-invasive EEG based on transformers. However, non-invasive EEG uses a predefined number of electrodes placed at consistent locations of the scalp across subjects. This approach provides a well-defined correspondence across the neural activity recorded between subjects. In sEEG, the number and placement of electrodes across subjects is highly variable and inconsistent between subjects, complicating efforts to translate approaches from EEG to sEEG data.

In the context of invasive microelectrode recordings, prior works have attempted to use transformers for neural decoding with success. Ye and Pandarinath (2021) introduced the Neural Data Transformers (NDT) to model neural population activity as an alternative to RNN models (Glaser et al., 2020; Sussillo et al., 2016). Le and Shlizerman (2022) extended the NDT model to process data in both the electrode and time dimensions. However, all aforementioned works trained single-subjects models. Azabou et al. (2023) diverged from single subject approaches by combining data from multiple non-human primates and achieved excellent decoding performance in a variety of different motor decoding tasks. However microelectrode recordings have a well-defined tokenization scheme based on extracellular neuronal spikes, which are not detectable by mm-scale sEEG electrodes. Thus, it is unclear how spike-based tokenization approaches can be meaningfully translated to sEEG.

### Shared trunk architectures

Shared trunk architectures are a popular choice for multi task learning applications. They follow a simple outline: a global feature extractor, whose parameters are shared across tasks, followed by task-specific branches, with parameters specific to each task (Crawshaw, 2020). They have been successfully used in multiple domains including facial recognition (Zhang et al., 2014), instance-aware semantic segmentation (Dai et al., 2015), image retrieval (Zhao et al., 2018) and classification (Liu et al., 2018). Their effectiveness stems from their ability to extract shared representations that are common to all tasks. Combining data from multiple different tasks also helps mitigate the large scale data requirements for effective training of deep networks. In this work, while we are not dealing with multiple different tasks, we use a shared trunk architecture to model inter-person differences between subjects in our cohort. Our network is composed of a backbone, common to all subjects, that extracts global representations and subject-specific heads that tailor the model's output to the unique statistical profile of each subject.

## 3 Methodology

SEEG is a neural recording modality capable of recording local field potentials (LFPs) that reflect the coordinated activation of hundreds of thousands of neurons in the vicinity of an electrode, providing a mesoscale measurement of brain activity (Saez and Gu, 2023). Due to the distributed nature of sEEG, subjects typically get implanted with tens to hundreds of electrodes in widespread locations across their brain. The resulting data are multi-variate time series that are typically epoched around a behavioral stimulus of interest (e.g. a visual stimulus presented during each trial of a behavioral task).

Neural activity recorded via sEEG across the electrodes of an individual are, of course, not independent. The captured recordings represent a conversation between thousands of neurons in distributed brain networks. The challenge is to find a way to interpret those recordings in the context of this broader conversation, instead of interpreting them in isolation (Azabou et al., 2023). This challenge is exacerbated when trying to integrate neural recordings across different subjects, each of which has a variable number of electrodes distributed across different brain regions. This is equivalent to monitoring the neural conversation with several microphones placed in different brain locations unique to each subject. For each monitored neural population, we do not know the identity or the functional tuning (what stimuli they respond to).

### Signal processing

Motivated by the lack of correspondence between the neural activity recorded between subjects, we sought to identify the subset of electrodes across subjects that respond to a behavioral stimulus of interest (i.e., share the same functional tuning in the neural conversation) while subjects perform a behavioral task. This can be achieved using the methodology introduced by Coon and Schalk (2016) and refined by Paraskevopoulou et al. (2021). This methodology identifies electrodes whose high-\(\) band activity (narrowband neural activity with frequency content between 70-150 Hz) is modulated by the behavioral stimulus of interest. We note that high-\(\) band activity is used because it has been associated with the instantaneous firing of neuronal populations in the vicinity of an electrode (Miller et al., 2009) and, thus, it likely represents neural computation that is relevant to the behavioral stimulus of interest.

As described by Paraskevopoulou et al. (2021), separately for each electrode, the neural signals are filtered to the high-\(\) band and the envelope is extracted using the Hilbert transform. The high-\(\) envelopes are then epoched around the behavioral stimulus of interest and separated into a baseline period (short time window prior to stimulus) and task period (short time window after the stimulus). The median high-\(\) envelope of the task (\(Median_{task}\)) and baseline (\(Median_{baseline}\)) periods are computed across the trials of the behavioral task. Then for each electrode, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is calculated as

\[SNR=(Median_{task})}{^{2}(Median_{baseline})},\] (1)

where \(^{2}()\) refers to the variance of \(()\). Electrodes whose high-\(\) band activity is significantly modulated by the behavioral stimulus can then be identified using a bootstrap randomization test and subsequently be used for decoding applications.

The implementation details of this analysis can be found in Appendix A.1.

Figure 1: _Outline of our network architecture_. The sEEG signals are converted to vector embeddings through temporal convolutions and then processed by sequential self-attention operations in the time and electrode dimensions in an alternating fashion. The latents are compressed and projected through subject-specific task heads to obtain behavioral predictions.

### Network architecture

#### 3.2.1 Tokenization

To combat the inhomogeneity of the number/placement of electrodes across different individuals, we designed a convolutional tokenizer that operates on the voltage traces of each electrode separately. Instead of performing a two-dimensional convolution across both the time and electrode dimension, which would blend information between the dissimilar electrodes that are randomly placed across individuals, we perform a one-dimensional convolution across the temporal dimension only. This way, each electrode gets assigned a \(K\)-dimensional learnable embedding for chunks of time, defined by the length of the convolutional kernel.

Specifically, let \(x_{e} R^{T_{trial}}\) denote the LFP recorded by electrode \(e\) for a given trial of length \(T_{trial}\). Let \(k_{i}\) denote the \(i^{th}\) convolutional kernel, from a collection of \(K\) kernels. Our approach returns learnable vector embedding \(z_{e} R^{T_{trial} K}\) by performing convolutions of the form,

\[z_{e,i}=x_{e}*k_{i},i 0,1,...,K,\] (2)

on \(x_{e}\) (convolutional kernel weights are shared across all the electrodes of all subjects). After temporal convolutions, batch normalization is applied to the \(K\) features extracted by the convolution followed by average pooling along the time dimension (which reduces the time dimension from \(T_{trial}\) to \(T\)), returning \(z_{e} R^{T K}\).

Stacking the results of these operations across electrodes, we obtain the latent \(z R^{E T K}\), where \(E\) denotes the number of electrodes, \(T\) is the number of time samples, and \(K\) is the number of features extracted by the convolutions. By representing our data in this way, our network is capable of handling inputs with varying numbers of electrodes and time lengths. We do note, however, that the time resolution (i.e., sampling rate) needs to be fixed for the convolutions to be meaningful across subjects.

#### 3.2.2 Capturing long-range spatiotemporal dependencies

The latent \(z R^{E T K}\) semantically represents the cumulative neural activity of all electrodes of a subject, for a given trial. It can also be conceptualized as a separable dual tokenization across the time and electrode dimensions, with electrode-latents \(z_{e} R^{T K}\) and time-latents \(z_{t} R^{E K}\). This separability, enables us to process the vector embeddings separately in the time and electrode dimension, giving us a significant computational advantage to subsequent self-attention layers, whose computational complexity scales quadratically with sequence length.

**Attention in the time dimension.** We first interrogate our data for long-term temporal dependencies within electrodes. To do so, for each electrode separately, we arrange the latents \(z_{e} R^{T K}\) into a sequence of \(T\) tokens, where each token has dimensionality \(K\). The tokens are then projected into equally shaped queries: \(Q=W_{q}z_{e}\), keys: \(K=W_{k}z_{e}\), and values: \(V=W_{v}z_{e}\), and processed using self-attention,

\[(Q,K,V)=(}{}})V.\] (3)

For this operation we used the standard transformer block (Vaswani et al., 2017), preceding the attention operation with normalization layers and following with a feed-forward network. This operation is parallelized across electrodes, and we stack the results to obtain latents of the form \(z_{int} R^{E T K}\).

**Spatial positional encoding.** To account for the inconsistency of electrode locations across individuals, there is a need to inject information about the spatial location of each electrode into our model. To do so, we used radial basis functions to capture the information about each electrode location in the brain based on its MNI coordinates (MacDonald et al., 2000; Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). We discretize the space of each coordinate, into \(n\) bins, with midpoints \(_{0},_{1},,_{n-1}\). For each midpoint, we centered \(m\) univariate gaussians of the form,

\[f_{i,j}(s)=^{2}}}(-)^{2} }{2_{j}^{2}}),\] (4)with variances \(_{j}^{2}\), for \(i=0,1,,n-1\) and \(j=0,1,,m-1\). Separately for the \(x\), \(y\), and \(z\) coordinates, we compute \(f_{i,j}(x)\), \(f_{i,j}(y)\), and \(f_{i,j}(z)\)\(\,i,j\), which we then concatenate into a vector \(p R^{3 m n}\), which represents the positional encoding of an electrode. The positional encodings for each electrode are then projected to \(K\) dimensions (using a linear layer) and added to the latents \(z_{int} R^{E T K}\).

**Attention in the space dimension.** Having captured temporal dependencies within electrodes in our data, and having "stamped" the latents with their spatial positional encodings, we then use self-attention again, this time in the electrode dimension to capture long-range dependencies between the neural activity across electrodes in our data. The latents \(z_{int} R^{E T K}\) are arranged, separately for each timepoint, into \(z_{t} R^{E K}\) as a sequence of \(E\) tokens of dimension \(K\), which are projected into equally shaped queries: \(Q=W_{q}z_{t}\), keys: \(K=W_{k}z_{t}\), and values: \(V=W_{v}z_{t}\). The tokens are processed with self-attention using equation 3. Again, the standard transformer block is used, with appropriate pre-normalization followed by a feed-forward network. This time, the operation is parallelized across timepoints, and the results are stacked to obtain latents of the form \(z_{l} R^{E T K}\).

Multiple layers of self-attention in time and self-attention in space can be stacked back-to-back to enhance the fitting ability of the network, if necessary. Leveraging the versatility of transformers to accept inputs of varying lengths, the attention operation in the both time and space, as described above, does not constrain our model to accept inputs of fixed length in terms of the number of electrodes, or timepoints. In the case where inputs do have unequal number of electrodes or timepoints, computations can be efficiently parallelized by masking tokens that correspond to padded electrodes and timepoints during the self-attention operations.

**Extracting global features.** In behavioral neuroscience, experimenters are usually interested in decoding few behavioral variables, such as a response time or hit rate to a given stimulus (Posner and Petersen, 1990; Galvao-Carmona et al., 2014). With this in mind, the information contained in the latent \(z_{l} R^{E T K}\), will ultimately need to be compressed into a single value. Therefore, following the self-attention operations, we unroll the latents \(z_{l}\) and, using a feed-forward network, we project them to a low dimensional neural representation \(F R^{d}\), where \(d\) denotes the final number of the extracted features, with \(d E T K\), that will be used for the downstream decoding tasks.

#### 3.2.3 Personalizing to individual subjects

Our architecture is built around the idea of extracting neural representations that are common across sEEG subjects. We also, however, need to take into account that performance to behavioral tasks is intrinsically different between individuals (Fozard et al., 1994; Davranche et al., 2006; Green and Bavelier, 2003; Der and Deary, 2006). Therefore, we designed a separate task head for each individual, composed of a shallow feed-forward network, that maps the extracted neural representations \(F\) to the behavioral outcome of a given trial.

## 4 Experiments

In this section, we test and validate our approach for multi-session, across-subject behavioral decoding using sEEG on a large and diverse cohort of sEEG subjects performing a behavioral task.

### Experimental setup

**Dataset.** The core design constraint of our approach is to enable the unified training of our architecture (see Fig. 1) on a diverse, multi-session, multi-subject sEEG dataset despite the inhomogeneity of electrode number/placement in each subject. Towards that goal, we built a large and diverse dataset of subjects that performed a repetitive reaction time task, while their sEEG was simultaneously recorded. Contrary to most studies, which collected a few hundred behavioral trials from few subjects, _we collected more than 3600 behavioral trials and more than 100 electrode-hours of recording from 21 subjects over 29 recording sessions_. Our dataset is composed of 13 females and 8 males, with ages ranging from 16 to 57 years old, with unique electrode number/placement for each subject, solely based on clinical needs. Across subjects electrodes span white and grey matter; cortical, subcortical, and deep structures (see Fig. 2).

**Behavioral task.** Subjects performed the color-change detection task (see Fig. 2A & Appendix A.1). In each trial, a visual stimulus was presented. After a variable foreperiod delay, the stimulus changed color. At that time, the participant responded by pressing a button as fast as they could. _Our goal was to decode the trial-wise response time of the subjects using their sEEG_.

**Design choices**. Throughout all experiments, we use the neural data from a window of  msec after the stimulus color change to train models and make behavioral predictions. All models were trained with \(N_{t}=105\) temporal tokens within each electrode and \(N_{e}\) electrode tokens within each timepoint, which varied based on the number of electrodes for each participant. The dimensionality of each token was fixed to \(K=2\). All training details are provided in Appendix A.2.

### Training within-subject models

To test whether our modeling approach would be able to decode the trial-wise response time from sEEG data, we began with a within-subject approach and tested whether our architecture was capable of decoding the response times for each subject. We trained a separate model for each subject in our cohort, combining data across sessions for participants that had multiple behavioral sessions. The experimental setup and the preprocessing of the sEEG data was kept the same for all subject. _Across the 21 single-subject models, the average test set \(R^{2}\) was 0.30 \(\) 0.05 (mean \(\) sem)_.

### Training a multi-session, multi-subject model

To investigate whether training on more data, despite the heterogeneity (see Fig. 2B, C), would improve response time decoding performance, we trained a unified model on the combined neural data of all the behavioral trials across all participants in our dataset. This effectively increased the number of training samples 21-fold compared to the data available for the single-subject models.

This model achieved a test set \(R^{2}\) of 0.54 \(\) 0.01 (mean \(\) sem) on the combined data of all participants. The root mean square error (RMSE) for all predicted response times in the test set, across subjects, was RMSE = 82 \(\) 2 (mean \(\) sem) msec. For reference, the mean response time in the test set, across subjects, is 410 \(\) 5 (mean \(\) sem) msec, which is an order of magnitude greater than the RMSE. Since the response time profiles of each subject are distinct, we also evaluated the model performance within-subjects. _Across subjects, the average per-subject test set \(R^{2}\) was 0.39 \(\) 0.05 (mean \(\) sem)_. Compared to training on single-subjects, the multi-subject training approach boosted decoding performance for our proposed architecture by \( R^{2}=0.09\), on average. We then compared the performance of the single-subject models to that of the multi-subject model,

Figure 2: _Overview of behavioral experiment._**A.** Schematic of the color change detection task. **B.** Electrode placement projected onto the MNI brain template for four example subjects in our cohort. Red dots show electrodes used for model training; grey dots show electrodes excluded from model training (see section 3.1). **C.** Electrodes used for model training across all subjects in our cohort projected on an MNI brain template.

head to head (see Fig. 3A). For the majority of subjects, there was a clear performance boost from multi-subject training.

We then explored whether finetuning the multi-session, multi-subject model to individual subjects would further boost the performance gains, compare to the single-subject models. _The finetuned models for each subject achieved an average test set \(R^{2}\) of 0.41 \(\) 0.05, across subjects_, indicating that finetuning the multi-session, multi-subject model to single subjects can further boost the performance gains. Importantly, finetuning the unified model boosted the performance gains of the multi-subject model compared to the single-subject models by \( R^{2}=0.11\), on average (see Fig. 3B for per-subject head to head comparisons). These results suggest that sEEG-based neural decoding benefits from multi-subject joint model training, despite the heterogeneity of electrode number/placement across subjects, demonstrating the power of multi-subject approaches compared to single-subject ones.

### Transferring to new subjects

Having shown that training our model across diverse, multi-subject data boosts decoding performance, we were interested in identifying whether the representations learned by pretraining our models on multiple subjects can efficiently be transferred to new subjects, unseen from the model during training. This is important in any real-world clinical scenario, where only a few number of behavioral trials can be collected from a subject. To test this, we employed a leave-one-out cross validation approach. We trained 21 models, each of which was trained on the combined data of all subjects but one. The average test set \(R^{2}\) of the multi-subject models was 0.48 \(\) 0.006 (mean \(\) sem) across all trials of all subject. This indicates that our training framework is robust to data variations and that our model did not depend on the data of any specific subject to train effectively.

The weights of the pretrained models were then used as the basis for finetuning on the data of each left-out participant, unseen from the models during training. _Across subjects, the models trained on other subjects and transferred to a new one achieved an average test set \(R^{2}\) of 0.38 \(\) 0.05 (mean \(\) sem)_. This is a clear improvement to training single-subject models from scratch and comparable to training multi-session, multi-subject models. Specifically, the transferred single-subject models showed a per-subject decoding performance increase \( R^{2}=0.08\) compared to our single-subject models trained from scratch (see Fig. 4A) and a per-subject decoding performance decrease \( R^{2}=-0.01\), compared to the multi-session, multi-subject model (Fig. 4B)).

This suggests that pretraining models on diverse, multi-subject data and using their weights as a finetune to transfer the learned representations to new subjects is almost as effective as training on

the combined data of all subjects. Given the significant computational benefit of the transferring approach, its implementation in real world medical scenarios might be more likely.

### Comparison with baselines

We were also interested in quantifying the performance benefit of our modeling approach compared to other traditional and state-of-the-art neural decoding approaches. To do so, we trained single-subject baseline models (described in detail in A.3), and compared those with segenificant. We observed that segenificant outperformed the baseline models when trained on single subject, multiple subjects, and when transferred (see Fig. 5). Specifically, our single-subject models (section 4.2) outperformed all baselines by an average per-subject test set \( R^{2} 0.03\). Our multi-subject models (section 4.3) outperformed the baselines by a per-subject test set \( R^{2} 0.12\), which could be further increased to \( R^{2} 0.14\) by finetuning to single subjects. Importantly, our transfer-learned single-subject models (section 4.4) also outperformed all baseline models by a per-subject test set \( R^{2} 0.11\), on average.

### Ablations

Last, we sought to identify the contribution of each building block of our proposed architecture to the decoding performance of our models. To investigate this, we performed an ablation study on our proposed architecture when trained on multiple subject (same as in section 4.3). To ensure a fair comparison, all training hyperparameters were kept identical across all training runs.

#### 4.6.1 Model components

In this subsection, we trained our proposed model while ablating its components one by one. The model is composed of: 1. convolutional tokenizer (CT), 2. attention in time dimension (AT), 3. spatial positional encoding (PE), 4. attention in space dimension (AS), 5. multi-layer perceptron (MLP), 6. subject-specific regression heads (RH) (see also Fig. 1). Since there is no straightforward way to process the raw sEEG data with AT without first extracting features, we did not ablate CT. Additionally, since there is no straightforward way to project the output of the AS to the regression heads without a linear layer, we also did not ablate the MLP.

The ablation study results are summarized in Fig. 6A. Inspection of the results suggests that the subject-specific regression heads are key to the model's decoding performance (\( R^{2}=18\)), likely because the response time profiles across subjects are quite diverse. Ablating the attention mechanism

Figure 5: _Decoding performance (mean \(\) sem) for various baselines and our proposed models._

Figure 6: _Summary of ablation results._ (A) Decoding performance (mean \(\) sem) across different model variants. (B) Head-to-head comparison of the decoding performance of our multi-session, multi-subject model vs its 2D attention variant.

in the space dimension also substantially degrades decoding performance (\( R^{2}=0.10\)) suggesting that it might be the main mechanism by which the model is capable of dealing with the heterogenous number/placement of electrodes across subjects.

#### 4.6.2 Model variants

We also compared our architecture with a close variant. Our architecture is designed with two separate attention mechanisms over the time and space dimensions of our data (see section 3.2.2), mainly to reduce computational burden since the computational complexity of attention scales quadratically with sequence length. To ensure that this choice did not negatively affect the model's decoding performance, we compared our architecture against a variant where the two separate attention mechanisms are replaced by a single 2D attention mechanism over the combined time and space dimensions of the data (to enable this, the positional encoding was ablated). _We identified that our proposed architecture outperformed its 2D attention variant by a per-subject, test set \( R^{2}=0.06\), on average_ (see Table 1 and Fig. 6B). We also identified that our proposed architecture trained \( 5.5\) faster.

## 5 Discussion

In this work, we introduce significant: a novel framework and architecture that can be used for multi-session, across subject decoding based on sEEG. We show that training on diverse and large cohorts of sEEG data, despite inter-subject differences in terms of electrode number/placement, is not only possible but also leads to better decoding performance compared to single-subject approaches. We also show that the neural representations learned by pretrained models can be efficiently transferred to new subjects, despite the small number of available trials within-subjects (which is the case in any real-world clinical setting). In fact, this few-shot, transfer learning approach gives a clear benefit to training from scratch and can reach decoding performance levels that are very close to those of multi-subject pretrained models, with a significant computational benefit.

Our results suggest that training on diverse multi-subject sEEG datasets boosts decoding performance compared to single-subject approaches. While our dataset is large compared to other works (Angrick et al., 2021; Petrosyan et al., 2022; Meng et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2022, 2024), scaling up further will inevitably require combining data collected while subjects perform a variety of different behavioral tasks. Advances in other fields have shown that training on multi-task data can improve performance and generalization (Azabou et al., 2023; Ruder et al., 2017). Therefore, investigating whether those performance/generalization gains will hold on sEEG decoding is worth exploring. Training on multi-task datasets would also give insight as to which aspects of neural computations are shared across tasks and which are not. We leave the investigation of multi-task model training as future work.

Given the clinical circumstances under which sEEG is recorded, performance to downstream decoding tasks would likely benefit from pretraining using self-supervised objectives. When patients are admitted in the epilepsy monitoring unit, their sEEG recordings are collected continuously over 5-10 days. In contrast, sEEG study participants perform only a few minutes of a behavioral task. Evidently, the amount of unsupervised data collected is orders of magnitude more than the supervised data. Strategies such as autoencoding, masked modeling, or next token prediction could enable training on the vasts amounts of data that are collected but unused by supervised learning approaches.

Overall, this work advances clinical and human neuroscience research by introducing a framework that enables multi-subject model training based on sEEG. We show that models pretrained on large and diverse sEEG datasets can be easily transferred to new subjects and therefore can be used to accelerate progress in the neural decoding domain. Given that sEEG is currently the gold standard invasive neural recording modality used in humans, our work advances progress towards sEEG-based neural decoding therapeutic interventions, ultimately bringing them closer to clinical translation.
