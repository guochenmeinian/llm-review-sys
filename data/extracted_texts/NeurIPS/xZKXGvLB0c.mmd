###### Abstract

We study the differences arising from merging predictors in the causal and anticausal directions using the same data. In particular we study the asymmetries that arise in a simple model where we merge the predictors using one binary variable as target and two continuous variables as predictors. We use Causal Maximum Entropy (CMAXENT) as inductive bias to merge the predictors, however, we expect similar differences to hold also when we use other merging methods that take into account asymmetries between cause and effect. We show that if we observe all bivariate distributions, the CMAXENT solution reduces to a logistic regression in the causal direction and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in the anticausal direction. Furthermore, we study how the decision boundaries of these two solutions differ whenever we observe only some of the bivariate distributions implications for Out-Of-Variable (OOV) generalisation.

## 1 Introduction

A common problem in machine learning and statistics consists of estimating or combining models or (expert opinions) of a target variable of interest into a single, hopefully better, model . There are several reasons of why this problem is important. For example, experts might have access to different data when creating their models, but might not have access to the data available to other experts, while there might be a modeller who can access the expert's opinions and put them together into a single model. Furthermore, experts might specialise in certain areas of the support of the input space, so that a modeller with access to the expert's opinions could potentially produce a single model exploiting the strengths of each modeller. This problem is commonly known as "mixture of experts", "expert aggregation", "merging of experts" or "expert pooling" .

The merging of experts problem is usually ill-defined, in the sense that there are multiple joint models (that is, models that include _all_ covariates) that after marginalisation would render the same prediction as the individual experts (that is, those which include only _some_ of the covariates). This ill-definedness of the problem requires strong inductive biases. One way to provide this inductive bias in a principled way is through the Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle . In brief, MAXENT suggests finding the distribution with maximum Shannon entropy subject to moment constraints. This turns out to be the same as choosing the distribution closest to the uniform distribution having the same moments as those given by the constraints. In Section 2.2 we introduce MAXENT and Causal MAXENT (CMAXENT) in more detail, the latter being an extension that allows to include causal information when available .

Most of the research on the merging of predictors focuses on finding a meta-predictor that uses the given models and best fits to the data , whereas the focus of the present article is understanding the implications of causal assumptions in the merging of experts instead of aiming for models with best performance. Furthermore, most of this research focuses on predictors that use the same predicting variables for each of the models. To the best of our knowledge, the only exception is the random subspace method, notable for being the basis of random forests .

What if in addition to the different models, a researcher has some causal knowledge of the underlying system? For example, they could know whether a variable or set of variables used in a particular model are causes or effects of the target variable, potentially changing the resulting predictor of interest. Causal knowledge produces asymmetries that have been exploited in the past to understand some common machine learning tasks like transfer learning, semi-supervised learning or distribution shift .

In the present work, we investigate how including causal knowledge produces asymmetric results when merging predictors. In particular, we are interested in how solutions to the CMAXENT principle  differ when we assume different causal relations for the same data. That is, we are interested in the asymmetries produced by _causal_ assumptions on CMAXENT inferences. In particular, we will study the differences in the solutions when we assume the causal data generation process (so that the covariates or predictors are causal parents of our target variable) in contrast with the anticausal generation process (so that the predictors are causal children of our target variable). We are going to study these asymmetries in the case where we do not observe all the variables jointly; one of the differentiating characteristics of this research with respect to other merging of predictors work.

Including the right causal assumptions when merging predictors is relevant, for instance, in the medical domain. Suppose we are interested in the presence or absence of a disease, and we have models from hospitals and labs relating risk factors and symptoms to the disease we are interested in. Combining the predictors would be valuable to predict the disease but it also requires to include the right causal assumptions, if the direction matters for the merging of predictors: risk factors cause diseases and diseases cause symptoms. The literature of merging of predictors has focused on important aspects of the resulting models like generalisation bounds or speed of estimation but the relation to causality has remained largely unexplored.

Previous approaches have considered the problem of merging of experts using MAXENT . However, such research considers the problem from a purely statistical perspective and does not study the ramifications of different causal assumptions. In fact, the way they study the aggregation problem is by merging the probability of the outcome given by each expert without regarding how these probabilities were produced.

The main contributions of this article can be summarised as follows

* We study the differences in causal and anticausal merging of predictors whenever the inductive bias used to merge the predictors allows causal information to be included.
* In particular, we find that CMAXENT with a binary target and continuous covariates, reduces to logistic regression and LDA, two classic classification algorithms, when merging predictors in causal and anticausal directions, respectively.
* Furthermore, we study the implications of these asymmetries Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation whenever we do not observe all the first and second moments as constraints in the CMAXENT problem.

The remainder of the paper is organised as follows. In Section 2 we introduce basic notation and give a brief overview of MAXENT and CMAXENT. Then, in Section 3 we present the optimisation problem in the causal and anticausal direction and give the explicit solutions of the problems, thereby connecting the solutions of CMAXENT to well-known classification algorithms. In addition, we prove that the decision boundary in the causal and anticausal directions, with full knowledge of the moments (as defined in the section itself) renders equal slopes of the predictors. In Section 4 we weaken the assumption of full knowledge of the moments and instead assume knowledge of a subset of the moments in Section 3. Partial knowledge of the moments have implications for Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation and resulting in differences in decision boundaries. We close with Section 5 with some discussion and concluding remarks. All the proofs are left to the appendix for the sake of brevity and clarity of the main text.

## 2 Notation and preliminaries

### Notation

Let \(Y\) be a binary random variable taking values in \(=\{-1,1\}\), and \(=\{X_{1},X_{2}\}\) be a pair of continuous variables, so that \(x_{i}\). Let \(f:^{2}\) be a measurable function, \(\) a measure on \(^{2}\), and \(\) the density of the distribution of a random variable with respect to the Lebesgue measure in the case of real valued random variables, and with respect to the counting measure in the case of discrete random variables. To be precise, \((Y,)\) is a density with respect to the product of the Lebesgue measure and the counting measure. We denote \(_{}[f(Y,)]\) the expectation of \(f\) with respect to \(\). We restrict ourselves to the scenario with two continuous variables and one binary outcome given that we can already observe asymmetries in the merging of experts, and can visualise such asymmetries without having to project such space into 2 dimensions. The results here can be easily generalised into a discrete outcome variable (and indeed we do, in Corollary 7). Throughout the article we will care about finding a predictor of \(Y\) using \(\) as covariates. That is, we are interested in the density \((Y)\).

### Maximum Entropy and Causal Maximum Entropy

The Maximum Entropy (MAXENT) principle was born in the statistical mechanics literature as a way to find a distribution consistent with a set of expectation constraints . That is, given observed sample averages \(=_{i=1}^{N}f(y_{i},x_{i})\) we find the density \((Y,)\) so that the expectations with respect to \((Y,)\) are equal to those observed.

Notice that MAXENT does not attempt to find the 'true' distribution of the data, but instead the distribution closest to the uniform distribution so that the expectation constraints are satisfied. We will see examples of such optimisation problems in subsequent sections. Using the Lagrange multiplier formalism for constrained optimisation, one can prove that the solution to the MAXENT problem belongs to the exponential family. The MAXENT distribution and its properties have been studied widely, see Grunwald and Dawid  and Wainwright et al.  and references therein.

In **Causal MAXENT** (CMAXENT, Janzing ), the optimisation is performed in an assumed causal order; that is, we first find the MAXENT distribution of causes and then the Maximum Conditional Entropy of the effects given the inferred distribution of the causes. As argued in  this typically results in distributions that are more plausible for the respective causal direction. One can think of CMAXENT as usual MAXENT with the distribution of the cause as additional constraint, where the latter has been obtained via separate entropy maximization.

## 3 Known predictor covariances

We will begin by studying the solution of the CMAXENT problem when we observe all the bivariate distributions and summarise them with first and second moments. The restriction to first and second moments has several reasons: First, these simple constraints are already sufficient to explain the interesting asymmetries between causal and anticausal. Second, including higher order moments makes the problem computationally harder and increases the risk of overfitting on noisy finite sample results. Last, including more moments decreases the asymmetries between the causal directions. Mathematically, we have the following (estimated) expectations and their respective sample averages:

\[}[Y] =q, }[Y]== _{1}\\ _{2},\] (1) \[}[] =}=_{1}\\ _{2}=0\\ 0, }[^{}]=_{ }=_{1}^{2}&_{1,2}\\ _{1,2}&_{2}^{2},\] (2)

where we assumed the mean of \(\) is zero.

### The causal direction

Consider the causal graph in Figure 0(a) and the expectations given in Equations (1) and (2). As mentioned on Section 2.2, CMAXENT suggests finding the density \(()\) with maximum entropyconsistent with the first and second moments of \(\), and then finding the density \((Y)\) with maximum entropy, with the estimated \(()\) and the moments that involve \(Y\) as constraints.

These steps can be summarised in the following optimisation problems. First, for \(()\),

\[_{()} H()=-_{^{2}}() ()\,\] s.t. \[[X_{i}]=_{i},i\{1,2\}\] \[[X_{i}^{2}]=_{i}^{2},i\{1,2\}\] \[[X_{1}X_{2}]=_{1,2}\] \[_{^{2}}()\,=1.\]

On the other hand, the Maximum Conditional Entropy optimisation problem is as follows

\[_{(y|)} H(Y)=-_{^{2}}_{y}(y )()(y)\, \] s.t. \[[YX_{i}]=_{i},i\{1,2\}\] (4) \[[Y]=q\] \[_{y}(y)=1, .\]

Where \(()\) is the one we found by solving Equation (3).

**Proposition 1** (Resulting predictor in the causal direction).: _Using the Lagrange multiplier formalism for the optimisation problems in Equations (3) and (4) we obtain: (i) a multivariate Gaussian distribution for \(P()\), and (ii) the density of \(Y\) conditioned on \(\) given by_

\[_{}(y x_{1},x_{2}) =(_{0}y+_{1}yx_{1}+_{2}yx_{2}+ (x_{1},x_{2}))\] (5) \[(x_{1},x_{2}) =_{y}(_{0}y+_{1}yx_{1}+_{2 }yx_{2}),\] (6)

_where \(()\) is a normalising constant._

_The density can be written as_

\[_{}(y=1 x_{1},x_{2})=(1+(_{0}+ _{1}x_{1}+_{2}x_{2})).\] (7)

The proof of this result can be found in (19, Section 3.1 and 3.2).

_Remark 2_ Notice that Equation (7), our predictor of interest, is just a rescaled version of a sigmoid function. That is, we can estimate \((Y)\) with a logistic regression. A similar observation was done in  in the context of using an exponential loss for boosting. This relation was further explored in , where a more direct relation to maximum likelihood and exponential families was established. In Section 5 we discuss how these results in the statistical literature can be interpreted as making causal assumptions about the relation between the predictor and target variables.

### The anticausal direction

Now consider the graph in Figure 0(b). In this scenario, covariates of our predictor of interest are the effects of our target variable. Following the CMAXENT principle, we first find the density \((Y)\) with maximum entropy and is consistent with first moment of \(Y\) and then find the density \(( Y)\) with maximum conditional entropy consistent with the moments that involve \(\) and \((Y)\) found in the previous step. After this two-step process, we are left with the joint density \((Y,)\) from which we can derive a predictor of \(Y\), \((Y)\) using Bayes' Theorem (Section 3.3). The whole procedure can be summarised with the following optimisation problems. For the cause, we have

\[_{(y)} H(Y)=-_{y}(y)(y)\] (8) s.t. \[[Y]=q\] \[_{y}(y)=1.\]

And for the effects,

\[_{( y)} H( Y)=-_{^{2}}_{y}( \ y)(y)( y)d\] s.t. \[[YX_{i}]=_{i},\;\;i\{1,2\}\] (9) \[[X_{i}]=_{i},\;\;i\{1,2\}\] \[[X_{i}^{2}]=_{i}^{2},\;\;i\{1,2\}\] \[[X_{1}X_{2}]=_{1,2}\] \[_{^{2}}( y)d=1, \;y.\]

**Proposition 3** (Resulting predictor in the anticausal direction).: _Using the Lagrange multiplier formalism for the optimisation problems in Equations (8) and (9), we obtain a Bernoulli distribution for \(Y\) with \((y=1)=q\), and \(_{}( y)\) given by_

\[_{}( y) =[_{1}yx_{1}+_{2}yx_{2}+_{3}x_{1}+ _{4}x_{2}\] (10) \[+_{5}x_{1}^{2}+_{6}x_{2}^{2}+_{7}x_{1} x_{2}+(y)]\] \[=[_{k}_{k}h_{k}(,y)+(y)]\] (11) \[(y) =_{^{2}}[_{k}_{k}h_{k}( ,y)]d,\] (12)

_where \(h_{k}\) are the different functions for which we have the sample averages. The density \(_{}( Y)\) is a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions. Both components \(_{}( y=-1)\) and \(_{}( y=1)\) have the same covariance matrix._

For the following sections, we introduce the following notation for the expectations of the mixture of Gaussians.

\[[ y] =_{y}=_{y,1}\\ _{y,2}, [^{} Y] =_{ Y}\] (13)

In addition, we will include the subscripts "causal" and "anticausal" where it might be ambiguous (e.g., \(_{ Y,}\) represents the conditional covariance in the causal scenario and \(_{ Y,}\) in the anticausal scenario). As mentioned in Propostion 3, the conditional covariance \(_{ Y}\) is the same for both values of \(y\). However, we keep the conditional notation to distinguish it from the _marginal_ covariance of \(\), \(_{}\) introduced in Equation (2). In Appendix A we derive the conditional expectations in \(Equation\) (13) and the marginal expectations used as constraints.

_Remark 4_: Even though the causal graph in the anticausal direction implies that the conditional covariance \(_{Y}\) is diagonal, the CMAXENT solution does not result in a diagonal conditionalcovariance. This is true because of the constraints in Equations (1) and (2) and the law of total covariance. Note that the CMAXENT distribution is not necessarily Markov relative to the given DAG. As shown in [17, Section 5], CMAXENT only provides the best guess and may therefore mix over different Markovian distributions such that the result is no longer Markovian.

This relation between the marginal and conditional expectations will be essential in the subsequent sections where we explore the difference in the decision boundaries of the two resulting predictors of \(Y\).

### The predictor of \(Y\) in the anticausal direction

Recall that our main goal is to produce a predictor of \(Y\) as a function of the covariates \(\). In Section 3.1 we obtain the predictor of \(Y\) directly as a result of the CMAXENT principle, given that the predictor is already in the direction of the causal mechanism. On the other hand, in Section 3.2, we have to derive the predictor of \(Y\) using the found conditional distributions and Bayes' rule. The main result of this section is that with the constraints we have used, CMAXENT in the anticausal direction is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis [14, Section 4.3]. Furthermore, we generalise this result to Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, and to an exponential family version of discriminant analysis.

**Theorem 5** (Predictor of \(Y\) using Bayes' rule).: _Using the results from Proposition 3, the density \(_{}(Y=y)\) is the ratio of the product of the Gaussian component with \(_{}(Y=y)\) and the mixture of Gaussians resulting from Propostion 3. Minimising the expected 0-1 loss, the optimal decision rule arising from this density is equivalent to Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)._

**Corollary 6** (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)).: _Quadratic Discriminant Analysis can be interpreted as CMAXENT in the anticausal direction. This is achieved by replacing_

\[[X_{i}^{2}]=_{i}^{2}i\{1,2\}[X_{1}X_{2}]=_{1,2}.\] (14)

_in Equation (9) with the following constraints:_

\[[X_{i}^{2} y]=_{i,y}^{2}i\{1,2\} [X_{1}X_{2} y]=_{1,2,y}.\] (15)

We will now extend this idea, where instead of modelling \(()\) as a mixture of Multivariate Gaussians (with equal covariance in LDA or unequal covariance in QDA), \(()\) now becomes a mixture of distributions, each coming from an exponential family of distributions corresponding to a more general set of constraints.

**Corollary 7** (Exponential family discriminant analysis).: _Let \(f_{i}\) be an arbitrary measurable function and \(\) its corresponding sample average. In the general case where \(Y\) is a discrete variable and we have \(d\) covariates \(\) in the anticausal direction, the CMAXENT problem with constraints of the form:_

\[[f_{i}() y]=_{i,y},\] (16)

_where \(_{i,y}\) are the sample averages of \(f_{i}\) for a specific \(y\) as in Section 2.2, results in \(_{}( Y)\) being a mixture of exponential family distributions which then can be inverted (using Bayes' rule) to a predictor of \(Y\)._

_Remark 8_ In the previous corollary, the functions \(f_{i}\) can be constant on any of the variables in \(\).

This idea has been extended to use kernels as a way to map \(\) into more complex feature spaces. The resulting algorithm is called Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis .

### The geometry of the decision boundaries

Hastie et al. [14, Chapter 4.4.5] conclude that the log-posterior odds of the logistic regression and LDA are both linear in \(\), but with different parameters defining the linear relation. In this section, we revisit these results in more detail and explore whether the CMAXENT solution in causal direction differs from the solution in anticausal direction. From a statistical decision theory perspective, the log-posterior odds correspond to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) rule, the optimal decision boundary of a classifier when minimising the expected 0-1 loss [3, Ch. 4.3.3].

**Proposition 9** (Normal vector to the decision boundaries in causal and anticausal direction).: _Under the 0-1 loss, the normal vector to the decision boundary of the CMAXENT predictor is proportional to_1. \(_{,}^{-1}\) _in the causal direction._
2. \(_{|Y,}^{-1}\) _in the anticausal direction._

We will now prove that in the case where we know all the expectations in Equations (1) and (2), the slope of the decision boundaries in causal and anticausal direction are the same.

**Theorem 10** (Slope of the decision boundary is the same in causal and anticausal direction).: _Using the constraints in Equations (1) and (2), the slope of \(_{}(Y)\) inferred using CMAXENT is the same in causal and anticausal direction._

Although it might seem from the above result that there is no asymmetry between the logistic regression and LDA even when we include causal information, this is not entirely true. To begin with, the decision boundaries may be unequal although they are parallel, but more importantly learning the parameters of certain model might be easier. In the next section we explore the differences that persist even under the light of Theorem 10.

### What are the differences?

In the previous sections we found that the slopes of the decision boundary of CMAXENT in both the causal and anticausal direction are linear and agree, whenever we have the first and second moments as in Equations (1) and (2). This implies that, if the test data will come from the same distribution as the training data, either algorithm will work equally well. Previous research has studied the advantages and disadvantages [14; 33; Chapter 4.4.5] of each method and their properties such as asymptotic relative efficiency , parameter bias , asymptotic error under label noise  and online learning performance . All of these analyses base their results on the fact that the logistic regression does not make an assumption on how the covariates \(\) are distributed, whereas LDA does.

An alternative way of viewing this distinction is through the lens of generative and discriminative models. LDA is a generative model since it models both covariates and target variable and logistic regression only models the target as a function of the input. Ng and Jordan  analyse the difference in efficiency between the Naive Bayes algorithm (a generative model similar to LDA) and logistic regression, and find that both models have regimes in which they perform better than the other. Using the same models, Blobaum et al.  and data from , find empirically that generative models perform better in anticausal than in causal direction.

## 4 Partially known covariances

In this section we explore variations of the solution of the CMAXENT solution in causal and anticausal direction when some of the sample averages are not known. In Section 4.1 we explore the case where the covariance between a particular predictor and the target is not known, and in Section 4.2 the case where we do not know the covariance between the predictors. In both cases we will see that the models we can infer (that is, \((Y)\)) with CMAXENT will depend on the underlying causal assumptions.

### Unknown predictor-target covariance

Without loss of generality, suppose we do not have the sample covariance between \(X_{2}\) and \(Y\), that is, we do not know \(_{2}\) in Equation (1).

In the **causal direction**, the CMAXENT solution of the distribution of the causes \(\) will still be a multivariate normal distribution with expectations given by the constraints relating \(\). The conditional density of the effects is the logistic-like regression of Equation (7), however, \(_{2}\) will be 0, as this is the parameter corresponding to the covariance between \(X_{2}\) and \(Y\). In other words, \(X_{2}\) becomes irrelevant in the estimation of our target predictor.

In the **anticausal direction**, the distribution of the cause \(Y\) is unchanged because \((Y)\) is determined by the constraints and thus does not depend on \(_{2}\). However, using the fact that the Gaussian distribution maximises the entropy over all distributions with the same variance [37, Theorem 8.6.5.], we can derive a bound on \(_{2}\). We use the entropy of the Gaussian distribution because we do not know a closed form expression for the conditional covariance of \((Y)\) as given by Theorem 5.

**Proposition 11** (Bounds on unknown covariance between predictor and target).: _Assuming the causal graph in Figure 0(b) and we do not know \(_{2}\), an upper bound for \(_{2}\) is given by:_

\[_{1,2}_{1}}{q(1-q)_{1}^{2}-_{1}^{2}}.\] (17)

The bound in Propostion 11 is found by differentiating the determinant of the conditional covariance (to which the differential entropy of the multivariate Gaussian is proportional to) with respect to the unknown covariance, \(_{2}\) in this case, and finding the value for \(_{2}\) for which this derivative is 0.

The implication of the previous result is that even when we have not observed any joint data between \(X_{2}\) and \(Y\) we can still build a model of \(Y\) that depends on \(X_{2}\), as long as we can assume the data generation process is anticausal. We can consider this an instance of Out Of Variable (OOV) generalisation studied in [16; 12], where we can exploit causal information and partial data to make models including variables that were never observed jointly with the target.

### Unknown predictor covariance

Now suppose we observe all the sample averages in Equations (1) and (2) but we do not observe \(_{1,2}\).

In the **causal** direction this implies that the multivariate Gaussian distribution resulting from the MAXENT problem on \(\) is diagonal, that is, \(\) are marginally independent. The exponential form of \(_{}(Y X)\) does not change, as we still observed \(q\) and \(\), nevertheless, the parameters of the exponential family do change, as the density of \(\) changed so that the resulting \(_{}(Y)\) needs to adapt in order to match \(\).

Now we will explore the **anticausal** case. We will proceed as in Sections 3.1 and 3.2. First we find \((Y)\) by maximising the entropy subject to the empirical average of \(Y\), which is trivial because \((Y)\) is already determined by its moments, and then we find \(( Y)\) subject to all the moments in Equations (1) and (2) with the exception of \(_{1,2}\). We obtain the following result from solving the CMAXENT optimisation problem

**Proposition 12** (Diagonal conditional covariance in the anticausal direction with unknown predictor covariance).: _The density \(( Y)\) that maximises the conditional entropy subject to the following constraints:_

\[}[Y]=_{1}\\ _{2},}[]=0\\ 0,}[X_{1}^{2}]=_{1}^{2},}[X_{2}^{2}]=_{2}^{2},\] (18)

_and \((Y)\) inferred on the first step of CMAXENT, is independent after choosing a value of \(y\); that is, \(\) is conditionally independent given \(Y\)._

_Remark 13_: This result is reassuring given that under these moment constraints, \(( y)\) turns out to be Markov relative to the DAG in the anticausal direction. Contrary to Remark 4, where we concluded that CMAXENT is not always Markov relative to a DAG.

In Appendix E we derive the slopes of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction when we do not know the covariance between the predictors. We also find necessary and sufficient conditions for which the slopes are the same. From this simple example, we have learned the following: in causal direction, our inductive bias tells us that the covariates are not correlated and hence, the decision boundary depends only on the marginal variance of each \(_{i}\) and the covariance between \(Y\) and \(\). In the anticausal direction, CMAXENT infers \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\) to be marginally correlated because they need to be conditionally independent (this fact can proved using the law of total covariance). Hence, the marginal covariance of \(\), \(_{}\) is different in both scenarios. This is something we did not observe in the case with full information (Section 3).

In addition, we derive the expressions of the decision boundaries in the causal and anticausal direction (see Appendix E). That is, as proved in Propostion 9, we have that the decision boundaries of the predictors in causal and anticausal direction will differ _with the same moments, but different causal assumptions_. In Figure 2, we showcase this phenomenon with synthetic data.

## 5 Discussion

In this article we have studied the differences arising from merging of predictors in the causal and anticausal directions. In particular, we have studied a simple case with a binary target variable andtwo continuous variables. Although in this simple example we have already found connections with classical classification algorithms, and differences in the solutions in causal and anticausal direction, the example can be easily extended to more covariates (where the resulting distribution of the covariates would be a \(d\)-dimensional Gaussian instead of bivariate Gaussian), a discrete target variable (as in Corollary 7), and a causal graph that contains both parents and children as predictors.

As stated at the end of Section 3.1, the relation between merging of experts and logistic regression has been explored in the past. Friedman et al.  interpret the solution to the AdaBoost procedures as additive logistic regression. They arrive at this interpretation starting from an exponential loss function. They then propose likelihood based estimator of the AdaBoost procedure. Thus, since our results align with those in Friedman et al. , we give yet another interpretation of AdaBoost as the solution of the merging of experts in causal direction using the CMAXENT principle.

Even though we have used CMAXENT as inductive bias to merge the predictors throughout the article, we believe that the asymmetries we found here (in particular, the geometry of the decision boundaries) would hold when using any other inductive bias that allows causal information to be included. Whatever method we use to merge predictors, the following asymmetry seems natural: In _anticausal_ direction we try to _explain_ correlations between \(X_{1},X_{2}\) as a result of \(Y\) influencing both components. In _causal_ direction, correlations between \(X_{1}\) and \(X_{2}\) do not tell us anything about the relation between \(X\) and \(Y\), following the principle of Independent Mechanisms (see  for an overview and  for a recent Bayesian view).

The previous observation is useful in straightforward scenarios where we are merging data from different sources for a supervised learning task, say datasets with overlapping variables, or datasets produced from different experimental conditions (also called environments); but also in cases where the merging of data is more subtle, for example, in federated learning where the notion of horizontal and vertical federated learning  coincides precisely with the data sources described above but where causality is underexplored.
