###### Abstract

During natural evolution, the primary visual cortex (V1) of lower mammals typically forms salt-and-pepper organizations, while higher mammals and primates develop pinwheel structures with distinct topological properties. Despite the general belief that V1 neurons primarily serve as edge detectors, the functional advantages of pinwheel structures over salt-and-peppers are not well recognized. To this end, we propose a two-dimensional self-evolving spiking neural network that integrates Hebbian-like plasticity and empirical morphological data. Through extensive exposure to image data, our network evolves from salt-and-peppers to pinwheel structures, with neurons becoming localized bandpass filters responsive to various orientations. This transformation is accompanied by an increase in visual field overlap. Our findings indicate that neurons in pinwheel centers (PCs) respond more effectively to complex spatial textures in natural images, exhibiting quicker responses than those in salt-and-pepper organizations. PCs act as first-order stage processors with heightened sensitivity and reduced latency to intricate contours, while adjacent iso-orientation domains serve as second-order stage processors that refine edge representations for clearer perception. This study presents the first theoretical evidence that pinwheel structures function as crucial detectors of spatial contour saliency in the visual cortex.

## 1 Introduction

The seminal work of Hubel and Wiesel revealed orientation-selective columns in the visual cortex of higher mammals . In higher mammals' primary visual cortex (V1), neurons cluster into "pinwheel" structures around singularities , unlike in some mammals like rodents, which display "salt-and-pepper" organizations  or mini-columns . While there are established theories and experiments for studying the formation of topological organization maps in the visual cortex , the functional significance of pinwheel-like columnar organization remains an unresolved question and is even debated .

Sophisticated visual analyses, such as image pattern extraction , pattern symmetry , material properties , and textures , are crucial for understanding complex visual inputs. Imaging and electrophysiological studies have shown that iso-orientation domains (IODs) undergo cross-orientation suppression , reducing a neuron's response to its preferred orientation when another orientation is also present in the stimulus [13; 19; 20]. This indicates IODs encoding the linear oriented stimuli, which is crucial for detecting edges and contours [21; 22]. Cross-orientation suppression is believed to facilitate the detection of local discontinuities, such as orientation discontinuities [23; 24; 25], leading to perceptual "pop-out" effects and the perception of illusory contours [24; 26; 27]. In contrast, neurons at pinwheel centers (PCs) exhibit greater selectivity for cross-orientation stimuli [12; 13]. This indicates that PCs respond more effectively to multi-orientation patterns, such as pattern symmetry than IODs . This indicates PCs may contribute to encode more complex contour features. However, PCs are less selective but have longer response latency than IODs for stimulus orientation in the hierarchy process within OPMs when it comes to a single stimulus orientation [13; 19; 28]. Some studies indicate that colors , textures , darks and lights , luminance , and mirror symmetry  play a role in salient to visual processing. Despite these insights, the functional implications of how neurons within IODs and PCs of pinwheels process complex contour stimuli--potentially affecting stimulus salience for both IODs and PCs--from bottom-up visual inputs remain poorly understood, particularly from a temporal-spatial neural dynamics standpoint.

In response to these challenges, our research contributes the following:

* We propose a novel 2D self-evolving spiking neural network (SESNN) model that investigates the spiking mechanisms behind orientation preference maps (OPMs), spanning from salt-and-pepper organizations in mice to pinwheel structures in cats and macaques. The SESNN uniquely produces sparse codes through local synaptic plasticity during natural image learning, establishing a new benchmark for neural coding strategies.
* PCs act as first-stage processors, detecting natural images and initiating spiking waves to neighboring IODs, which then process as second-stage neurons. This indicates that early processing involves complex contours, not just edge detection.
* PCs react faster to a variety of orientation features than IODs, indicating their function in detecting complex orientations and serving as geometric saliency detectors. This suggests PCs have an evolutionary advantage due to self-organized pinwheel structures, which improves their ability to process complex contours.

## 2 Results

### Visual overlap underlying pinwheels emergence

Our SESNN model generates diverse OPMs, from salt-and-peppers to pinwheel structures, by adjusting the visual overlap metric \(\). This metric, crucial for the variety of visual topologies across species, is shown in Fig. 0(a) to produce pinwheel structures at high overlap, akin to those in cats and macaques, while low overlap results in salt-and-pepper organizations, typical of mice or rats. High overlap also enables cortical neurons to sample natural scenes more frequently, aiding in generating high-resolution images during decoding [7; 33].

Fig. 0(a) shows how visual input overlap levels from 9 to 15 pixels affect V1 orientation selectivity maps in the model. The top panel illustrates a higher overlap (15 pixels), and the middle, a lower overlap (12 pixels). This comparison reveals the impact of stimulus overlap on pinwheel density and layout in the visual cortex. Below the threshold (10 pixels in our case), salt-and-pepper patterns form, as the bottom panel indicates. Thus, 9 pixels of overlap are excluded from pinwheel analysis, as shown in Fig. 0(b)-0.

We quantitatively analyze the OPMs shown in Fig. 0(a) with several metrics [7; 34]:

**Pinwheel counts**, defined as the number of PCs, can be measured by 2D fast Fourier transform , which are located at the intersection of the real and imaginary components that equal 0 . It exhibits a decreasing trend as the visual input overlap increases (illustrated in Fig. 0(b)), suggesting that a greater overlap in the visual field may lead to a reduction in the number of discrete pinwheel structures.

**The nearest-neighbor pinwheel distance (NNPD)** in millimeter (mm) unit is defined as the distance between the two nearest PCs. The increasing trend of visual input overlap expands the distance between neighboring pinwheels (Fig. 1c).

**The size of hypercolumns** (mm) is defined with periodicity measured by 2D fast Fourier transform and also increases with the visual input overlap (shown in Fig. 1d). This paper does not account for left- and right-eye dominance columns, so the hypercolumn size is defined as the full 180\({}^{}\) cycle of repeating column spacing (\(\)) (mm).

It's noteworthy that pinwheel density is not included as a metric in our analysis. This omission is because the observed pinwheel density, irrespective of the hypercolumn size, approaches \(\) pinwheels/\(^{2}\), conforming to topological constraints [34; 35].

Our findings emphasize the importance of overlap degrees (Fig. 1a). Greater overlap (e.g., \(_{1}=15\) pixels) fosters stronger local clustering, leading to larger hypercolumn sizes, fewer pinwheels, and longer NNPDs, versus lower overlap (e.g., \(_{2}=12\) pixels). Minimal overlap (e.g., \(_{3}=9\) pixels), yields weak clustering, resembling salt-and-pepper organizations. This suggests that shared input among V1 neurons significantly influences OPM and salt-and-pepper formation. We obtain the anatomical data overlap using Eq. 3 and observe a strong positive correlation (\(R^{2}=0.97\)) between the SESNN model and species' visual RF overlaps (mouse, cat, macaque) (Fig. 1e). This relationship highlights the overlap index's key role in spatial organization within orientation maps. The model's predictions on IOD sizes and visual field extent (Fig. 1f) align with empirical data , confirming the SESNN model's robustness in simulating neuroanatomical organization and the biological development of orientation maps.

### Spatial-temporal distributed spiking waves propagate within pinwheels

V1 neurons stimulated by natural images primarily fire within pinwheel structures, particularly within and around PCs (Fig. 2a-b). This pattern is especially pronounced in higher mammals with large IODs, such as macaques and cats.

Relationship between the IOD size and the extent of the visual field in anatomical data (mice, cats, and macaques).

We define the response onset latency as 1 ms for the initial discharge from pinwheel structures, with subsequent firings occurring at 2 ms, based on a 1 ms time unit. Stimulated by natural images, the discharges start at the PCs and exhibit pronounced diffusion within the IODs sequentially, depending on their distance from the center, as suggested in Fig. 2c.

### Visual bottom-up saliency detection: functional role of pinwheel in geometric encoding

In this section, we investigate whether pinwheel structures respond distinctly to salient features in input images. The ground truth boundary from the BSDS 500 dataset  used as binary input represents geometric complexity (edges and curves) (Fig. 3a). The complexity is measured by calculating the local pixel entropy using sliding windows, with a 15x15 pixel neighborhood to assess pixel value dispersion in the binary images. The computation adheres to the following equation:

\[H(i,j)=-_{k=0}^{L-1}p(m_{k})_{2}p(m_{k}),\] (1)

where \(H(i,j)\) denotes the entropy at pixel position \((i,j)\) in the entropy map, \(L\) the count of distinct gray levels within the local neighborhood around pixel \((i,j)\), and \(m_{k}\) the \(k\)th gray level within this specified neighborhood. A large entropy value reflects great unpredictability or complexity in the pixel values, signifying a highly variable pixel value distribution. Conversely, a low entropy value indicates a high degree of predictability, less variation, and reduced complexity in the contours of pixel values. In addition, the saliency map of images is generated based on the classical methodology .

Furthermore, we propose a bimodal ratio analysis to compute the orientation bimodal ratio (OBR) to indicate a neuron's orientation tuning curve as either unimodal (single peak) or perfectly bimodal (two peaks of equal strength). This analysis focuses on identifying the peaks in the orientation tuning curve and quantifying their relative strengths.

\[OBR=,R_{2})}{R_{1}+R_{2}},\] (2)

Figure 2: Spatial-temporal response pattern within pinwheels. **a**. This figure displays the neuronal responses on OPM with a large IOD in a pinwheel structure. The neurons that fire at time \(t_{0}\) are shown as large black dots at PC, and they expand towards the periphery at time \(t_{0}\)+1, also denoted as large black dots. The other small dots represent resting neurons. **b**. Distance between firing neurons and the PC at time \(t_{0}\) and \(t_{0}\)+1. **c**. This panel shows the response onset latency of neurons and the mean distance (\(\) SD) between these neurons within a pinwheel. The distance is measured as the Euclidean distance within a 2D grid, simulating the structure of a 2D V1 area. (Significance: ***p<0.001, Mann-Whitney U test.)

where \(R_{1}\) and \(R_{2}\) represent the normalized firing rates corresponding to the strengths of the two most pronounced peaks in the orientation tuning curve. The OBR ranges from 0, denoting unimodality, to 1, indicating perfect bimodality in the neuron's orientation tuning.

A positive correlation is observed between the saliency map and the geometrical complexity of the BSDS500 dataset (Fig. 3b), demonstrating that higher geometrical complexity correlates with increased saliency. Significantly, in response to the stimulus shown in the BSDS500 image (Fig. 3a), pinwheel structures primarily activate in areas of high contour complexity (regions with the highest saliency in this binary image), which is a response pattern have not been observed in salt-and-peppers (Fig. 3c).

To confirm the disparity in contour complexity responses between pinwheel and salt-and-pepper organizations, we design a star-like binary input (depicted in Fig. 4a), including four identical entities to negate the impact of neuronal positioning within the SESNN model. This approach reaffirms the saliency-complexity correlation (Fig. 4b) and the priority of pinwheel activation over salt-and-peppers in response to heightened complexity (Fig. 4c).

Findings show that PCs exhibit enhanced saliency detection and significantly faster response times than IODs, indicating that PCs respond more quickly and sensitively to geometrically complex stimuli, while IODs are slower and react to simpler geometrical stimuli (see Fig. 4d). Both saliency and latency measurements are normalized to a 0-1 scale for comparison.

The enhanced saliency detection of PCs is due to the complex orientation preference in RFs. As addressed in Fig. 4e, the ordinate represents the OBR, reflecting that neurons near PC generally exhibit bimodal orientation tuning curves with near-equal peak strengths while there is a primary peak and a secondary peak at a relatively far position from PC (\(x=2\)). And the secondary peak is nearly absent at the IODs level (\(x=3\)), leading to an OBR close to 0. Salt-and-peppers, however, show less variation, maintaining a consistent OBR.

In conclusion, PCs demonstrate selectivity for more intricate orientations. This is experimentally supported by , who suggest that PCs are particularly sensitive to specific geometric configurations, such as T junctions. Characterized by multiple orientations and an OBR nearing 1 (Fig. 4e), these neurons tend to initiate action potentials in response to complex orientations. Consequently,

Natural images show a positive correlation between saliency and entropy. **c**. Neuronal response onset latency from pinwheels and salt-and-peppers relates to structural complexity, measured by local pixel entropy. (Data: mean \(\) SD, significance: ****p<0.001, Welch’s t-test.)

this leads to pinwheels being the first to respond. In contrast, neurons in salt-and-peppers do not exhibit a similar responsiveness to complex orientations as observed in pinwheels.

## 3 Methods

### The architecture of SESNN model

Our SESNN model is a two-dimensional network of excitatory (E-) and inhibitory (I-) leaky integrate-and-fire neurons (LIF) (5), stimulated by whitened natural images to mimic the LGN's functions of contrast normalization and edge enhancement without complex modeling . We use 160 whitened natural images as the training dataset, normalized to zero mean and uniform variance, derived from 20 base images (512x512 pixels) . To capture orientation details, each of the base images undergoes a 90-degree clockwise rotation and flip, creating 8 variations per original.

The configuration features E- and I- neurons in recurrent networks with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) (Fig. 5b), simulating a continuous 2D cortical surface. The neural connectivity at initialization is depicted in Fig. 5c (see Eq. 11). Moreover, the connection strengths in the well-trained model align closely with the experimental finding (). Under natural image stimuli, the SESNN forms single neuron RFs and population-level pinwheel structures in the OPM (Fig. 5e-f). To validate the model, we compare its evolution from randomness to organized states against biological data from macaque pinwheel structures and a baseline model , using metrics such as pinwheel density (pinwheels/ \(^{2}\)), NNPD (mm), and hypercolumn size (mm)  (Fig. 5f and Table 1).

   Metric & E-I baseline & SESNN model & Macaque \\  Pinwheel density (pinwheels/\(^{2}\)) & \( 2.941\) & \(3.175 0.397\) & \( 3.327\) \\ NNPD (mm) & N/A & \(0.277 0.043\) & \( 0.242\) \\ Hypercolumn size (mm) & N/A & \(0.839 0.054\) & \( 0.760\) \\

### Experiment-data-justified overlapping visual fields among nearby neurons

In each trial, E-neuron processes 100 different 16\(\)16 patches for 100 milliseconds each, randomly selected from the training dataset to serve as RFs (see Fig. 5a middle and right panels). It is assumed that these visual inputs overlap on the retina (Fig. 5a, middle panel and its inset). To reflect biological conditions, we perform a statistical analysis based on data from cats, macaques, and mice (Table 2), calculating average overlaps of 99.90% for cats, 99.98% for macaques, and 97.23% for mice using (Eq. 3). These results closely align with our SESNN model's configurations (refer to Fig. 1e). RF size in V1 is more related to resolution than orientation map formation. In macaque V1, RF size increases more than tenfold from fovea to periphery, while orientation map properties show little variation [48; 49]. Our study does not focus on RF size variations across the retina, as we expect minimal effects from these shifts across species, provided the overlap remains constant. Since the fovea is key for detailed visual information, we use V1 RFs in the area centralis to modeling.

We propose the visual input overlap metric \(^{}_{}\), which is defined as follows:

\[^{}_{}=}S_{}}-}M^{-1}}{s_{}^{}}}{}S_{}}-1} 100\%\] (3)

where \(S_{}\) represents the unit cortical area mm\({}^{2}\), \(s_{}^{}\) denotes the size of the RF in V1 with unit in degrees, \(_{}\) represents the density of neurons in V1, \(L_{}\) represents the unit of cortical spacing length in unit of mm, and \(M\) refers to the cortical magnification factor (CMF) (mm/degree). We consider only an effective cortical layer composed of output neurons. This is because the apparent overlap within a vertical cortical column primarily contributes to intermediary processing stages for the same input. Therefore, such overlaps should not be conflated with overlaps in the input space.

### Neural dynamics

E-neurons receive stimuli from natural images as well as noise \((0,0.04)\) from other brain areas (noise term). I-neurons indirectly receive natural image stimuli by adjusting E-neurons. The neural spiking dynamics are modeled using biologically inspired LIF neurons, incorporating refractory

Figure 5: Architecture of proposed SESNN model. **a**. The SESNN model comprises 4,900 E- and 1,225 I- neurons [39; 40; 41]. It processes 160 natural images (100 patches each), presenting each 512\(\)512 pixel patch to E-neurons for 100 ms with input overlap. The Feed-forward and E-E connections adhere to the Hebbian-Oja (HO) rule; others follow the Correlation Measuring (CM) rule. **b**.

periods and adaptive firing thresholds . The neural dynamics are iteratively formulated as follows:

\[u_{i}^{(K)}(t+1)=u_{i}^{(K)}(t)e^{-}+h_{ K}(i)_{j} _{ij}^{(image E)}X_{j}\] (4)

\[+_{ K^{*}}_{j}_{ij}^{(K^{*} K)} W_{ij}^{(K^{*} K )} z_{j}^{(K^{*})}(t)+ noise,\]

\[h_{ K}(i)=1,&,\\ 0,&,\] (5)

\[_{i}^{(K)} p_{i}(z_{i}^{(K^{*})}=1)-p_{i}^{(K)},\] (6)

where \(i=1,2,,N th\) (the neuron IDs of E-neurons and I-neurons).

In neural dynamics equation, \(u_{i}^{(K)}(t)\) denotes the membrane potential of neuron \(i\) at time \(t\), applicable to neurons of class \( K\), which includes E- and I- neuron groups. The membrane time constant, symbolized by \(\) in the resistor-capacitor circuit, governs the decay rate of the membrane potential in individual neurons. Notably, inhibitory neurons are configured to fire more rapidly than excitatory neurons [44; 56]. This setup reduces reconstruction error and hastens system convergence, leading to a more efficient and accurate representation of input stimuli. See the section A.2 for detailed neural dynamics.

### Hebbian Learning in SESNN

The learning rules consist of the HO rule  for input weight adjustments and the CM rule [44; 45] for intra-network weight changes (Fig. 5a-c). These facilitate adaptive synaptic weight adjustment based on firing pattern correlations, emulating a key learning mechanism in biological neural networks.

The formula for these adjustments is given by:

\[:\  W_{ij}^{(K^{*} K)} y_{i}x_{j}-y_{i}^{2 }W_{ij}^{(K^{*} K)},\] (7)

\[:\  W_{ij}^{(K^{*} K)} y_{i}x_{j}- y_{i}  x_{j}(1+W_{ij}^{(K^{*} K)} ),\] (8)

where \(x\), \(y\) denote the spike rates of presynaptic and postsynaptic neurons, respectively, with \(\) denotes the lifetime average. After each stimulus presentation of 100 ms, we calculate the network's neuronal instantaneous spike rates using exponential moving averages (EMAs), which aggregate spikes over time to reflect recent activity (see section A.1). Lifetime averages, also computed as EMAs, are crucial for homeostatic stability, helping to modulate neuronal properties or synaptic strengths for consistent activity. See the section A.2 for the hyperparameters.

Our SESNN model reflects experimental findings [57; 47] by representing V1 pyramidal neurons with weaker synaptic strengths, essential for preventing over-excitation and maintaining neural balance. We apply the HO rule  to E-E connections with a normalization factor to keep synaptic weights between 0 and 1, while stronger lateral E-I connections under the CM rule lack this normalization [45; 44]. Post-training synaptic strengths are depicted in Fig. 5d. Stabilizing neural network training requires careful learning rate adjustment. A slower rate for E-E connections compared to others is crucial to prevent E-neuron over-excitation, aligning with empirical data [57; 47; 58].

The HO and CM rules facilitate LTP and LTD mechanisms, common in rate learning rules that do not require precise spike timing. We selected these rules for their ease of tuning and ability to stabilize recurrent excitation.

Related works

**Functional roles of pinwheel structure can be revealed by SESNN model** The classical self-organizing map model  and other computational approaches like on-off models [6; 7; 9; 59] and related ANNs [10; 60; 61] lack the dynamic and temporal fidelity needed to realistically simulate the emergence of pinwheel structures in the visual cortex. To address these shortcomings, we propose the novel SESNN model, integrating retinotopy data [33; 50; 52; 53], detailed morphological data [62; 63; 64], and CMF [51; 52; 54] to enhance biological fidelity. The SESNN model effectively simulates macaque cortical organization and pinwheel development within OPMs (Fig. 5f). Furthermore, our investigations reveal that the degree of overlap--reflecting similar feed-forward inputs from identical RGCs to neighboring neurons--positively correlates with the retino-cortical mapping ratio , aiding in distinguishing between different V1 organizational patterns.

**PCs and IODs in neural processing hierarchies** Our findings show that PCs and IODs exhibit distinct neural activity waves, leading to varied responses to contour complexity from spatial-temporal dynamics: PCs react first to complex contours, having more multi-orientation selective neurons (Fig. 4e, \(x=1\)) before activity spreads to IODs, which process simpler edges (Fig. 4d and e, \(x=3\)). PCs display a stronger correlation with contour saliency, indicating a heightened role in processing visual stimuli over IODs. In rodents with salt-and-pepper organizations, contour saliency is less pronounced (Figs. 3c and 4c). While PCs are thought to indicate higher-order processing due to delayed response [13; 28], this is likely due to the nature of the stimuli. Studies reveal IODs show cross-orientation suppression under complex stimuli , unlike PCs with broader tuning. The SESNN model illustrates a preference for complex stimuli in PCs and simple stimuli in IODs, with activity propagating from PCs to IODs upon encountering complex contours (Fig. 4d and e).

**PCs as geometric saliency detectors** The SESNN model reveals PCs have broader orientation tuning and less selectivity for complex contours, unlike IODs, which show sharper tuning and cross-orientation suppression, preferring simpler edges (\(x=3\) in Fig. 4e) [12; 13; 19; 58; 65; 66; 67]. PCs' excitation leads to reduced cross-orientation suppression. With binary input, PCs correlate more positively with contour complexity than IODs (Figs. 3b and 4b), making them more salient in processing visual stimuli. This differs from rodents with salt-and-pepper organizations that lack distinct contour complexity saliency (Figs. 3c and 4c). Prior studies [12; 13; 28] suggest PCs have delayed response latency, indicative of higher-order processing. This arises from using drifting grating stimuli that activate IODs more readily. Koch et al.  note that IODs show cross-orientation suppression under complex stimuli, narrowing their tuning, unlike PCs. However, these studies omit temporal neural data within pinwheel structures. The SESNN model supports physiological findings that IODs and PCs favor single and complex orientation stimuli, respectively.

## 5 Conclusion and limitations

The advantages of pinwheel structures in visual representation and encoding are not fully understood. To address this, we develop a two-dimensional SESNN model that incorporates Hebbian-like plasticity and empirical morphological data. This model evolves to function as localized, bandpass filters, enhancing its responsiveness to a range of orientations and complex spatial textures in natural images. Our findings reveal that neurons within pinwheel structures respond more effectively to these textures, with stronger and quicker reactions than those in salt-and-pepper configurations. Specifically, PCs act as first-order stage processors with heightened sensitivity and reduced response latency to intricate contours, while IODs function as second-stage processors, refining edge representation for greater clarity. This advanced processing capability of pinwheel structures, particularly in detecting spatial contour saliency, not only deepens our understanding of visual processing in higher mammals but may also inform new strategies for visual saliency algorithms in computational models.

Using sliding windows, local entropy assesses variation and complexity in spatial distributions by capturing local intensity changes, indirectly reflecting geometric complexity through edges, corners, and patterns. Since this method cannot directly measure geometric shapes, we verify the use of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to approximate and directly measure geometric structures (refer to section A.5) . This algorithm simplifies shape contours by reducing vertices while preserving the overall form. The resulting polygon will allow us to calculate the distribution of edge lengths and angles, with geometric entropy defined as the sum of these entropy values. In future studies, we will utilize the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm to enhance our geometric analysis by identifyingand measuring the complexity of specific structural features, such as junctions, sharp corners, and textures, which are essential in complex visual scenes.
