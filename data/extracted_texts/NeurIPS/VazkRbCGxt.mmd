###### Abstract

Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models, when fine-tuned on a few personal images, can generate visuals with a high degree of consistency. However, such fine-tuned models are not robust; they often fail to compose with concepts of pretrained model or other fine-tuned models. To address this, we propose a novel fine-tuning objective, dubbed _Direct Consistency Optimization_, which controls the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models to retain the pretrained knowledge during fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments on subject and style customization, we demonstrate that our method positions itself on a superior Pareto frontier between subject (or style) consistency and image-text alignment over all previous baselines; it not only outperforms regular fine-tuning objective in image-text alignment, but also shows higher fidelity to the reference images than the method that fine-tunes with additional prior dataset. More importantly, the models fine-tuned with our method can be merged without interference, allowing us to generate custom subjects in a custom style by composing separately customized subject and style models. Notably, we show that our approach achieves better prompt fidelity and subject fidelity than those post-optimized for merging regular fine-tuned models.2

## 1 Introduction

Text-to-image (T2I) models are for image generation guided by natural language prompts and have seen rapid progress in recent years [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8]. The compositional nature of the natural language has enabled the creation of novel images, which compose multiple subjects with varying attributes in different backgrounds or styles. However, the ambiguity of natural language in describing the visual world makes it difficult to create an image of a specific subject, style, interaction, or background.

To overcome the lack of accuracy in natural language, there has been an emerging interest in teaching the pretrained T2I models new concepts, such as subject [9; 10], style , interaction , or background , whose precise visual description is given by a small set of reference images. As proposed in DreamBooth , the fundamental idea is to fine-tune the pretrained T2I model on a few images describing a new concept. The adoption of LoRA  or adapter fine-tuning  to T2I models has made the process more accessible, fast and economical [16; 11]. Once fine-tuned, the model can generate images by composing a new concept (_e.g._, my subject) and the knowledge of the pretrained model (_e.g._, background, style). While these methods have shown great success, they still suffer from reduced textual alignment and compositional generation capability , which is problematic particularly when the number of reference images is small, _e.g._, one or two.

We hypothesize that the limitation comes from the knowledge forgetting during low-shot fine-tuning, _i.e._, it fails to recontextualize new concepts with known concepts of pretrained models. Since fine-tuning with regular diffusion training objective suffer from overfitting, DreamBooth  attempted to tackle this issue by adding class-specific prior dataset for training dataset to preserve the prior knowledge (_i.e._, prior preservation loss). However, while this helps retaining the generalization capability, it comes at the cost of less subject fidelity (_e.g._, see Fig. 3). Especially, the loss becomes more significant, when the number of reference images become smaller .

**Contribution.** In this paper, we propose a more principled method to mitigate the forgetting behavior of low-shot fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models without using any additional data. Our method, coined _Direct Consistency Optimization_ (DCO), fine-tunes T2I diffusion models by controlling the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained model to be as minimal as possible in learning new concept. In specific, we show that our objective is equivalent to learning an implicit reward function that is a solution of constrained policy optimization problem [19; 20], which amounts for the consistency between generated images and reference images. Furthermore, we propose consistency guidance sampling which utilizes learned consistency function during inference, so that one can control the tradeoff between subject consistency and textual alignment (_e.g._, see Fig. 5).

We conduct an extensive empirical study on the personalization of T2I diffusion models (see Fig. 1). We show that the proposed method improves upon baselines that uses regular fine-tuning objective or using prior preservation loss  in generation of custom subject with various visual attributes or with the known style of pretrained model. To be specific, we show that our method positions on the superior Pareto frontier than baselines (_e.g._, see Fig. 4(a)). Moreover, our approach is applied to style personalization  and the composition of separately fine-tuned subject and style T2I models to generate an image of _my subject and my style_. Notably, direct merging of DCO fine-tuned models outperforms merging models fine-tuned with regular diffusion loss even using post-optimization method, _e.g._, ZipLoRA , in terms of prompt fidelity and subject fidelity. We believe that the proposed method would enjoy a broader usage in customization diffusion models in various domains.

## 2 Related Work

We briefly review the relevant literatures on personalized T2I synthesis and fine-tuning of T2I diffusion models, especially using rewards. We provide more comprehensive review and discussion on related works in Appendix C.

**Personalized T2I synthesis.** Several works have shown the promise of personalized T2I synthesis from a few images [9; 10; 22; 23; 11]. To improve efficiency, parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as soft prompt tuning [9; 24; 25; 26; 27], LoRA [14; 28] and adapter tuning [15; 11], have been proposed. To preserve the prior knowledge, Ruiz et al.  proposed prior preservation loss, which additionally fine-tunes on a class-specific prior dataset synthesized from pretrained T2I model. We

Figure 1: **Overview. (a) _Direct Consistency Optimization_ (DCO) pushes the Pareto frontier between prompt fidelity and subject fidelity towards upper-right over DreamBooth , and with prior preservation loss (DreamBooth+p.p.). DCO improves generating custom subject with various visual attributes (_e.g._, astronaut otitis and background of Mars), or various styles that pretrained model knows (_e.g._, flat cartoon illustration style). (b) The customized subject and style models fine-tuned with DCO can be merged as is, allowing us to generate _my subject in my style_.**

present a different approach to preserve prior knowledge by regularizing the model with pretrained model without using any prior dataset.

**Fine-tuning T2I diffusion models with rewards.** A line of works has studied fine-tuning T2I diffusion models using reward models such as human preferences [29; 30; 31] or aesthetic scores . Those methods use auxiliary reward models to update diffusion models by weighting with rewards , use reinforcement learning algorithms [33; 34], or differentiate through the reward models [35; 36]. On the other hand, Wallace et al.  have adapted direct preference optimizaton  to fine-tune T2I models with paired preference dataset which do not require explicit reward models. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first to study consistency as a reward function for T2I personalization.

## 3 Preliminaries

**Diffusion models.** For a data point \(\), let \(q()\) be the density of data distribution and \(p_{}()\) be a generative model parameterized by \(\) that approximates \(q\). Given \( q()\), the diffusion model considers a series of latent variables \(_{t}\) for timesteps \(t\). The forward process of diffusion model forms a conditional distribution \(q(_{t}|)\), and the marginal distribution is given by \(_{t}=_{t}+_{t}\), where \((,)\), and \(_{t},_{t}\) are noise scheduling functions. We denote \(_{t}=(_{t}^{2}/_{t}^{2})\) log signal-to-noise ratio (log-SNR), which is a decreasing function of \(t\). For large enough \(_{1}\), \(_{1}\) is indistinguishable from pure Gaussian noise (_i.e._, \(p(_{1})(,)\)), and for small enough \(_{0}\), the \(_{0}\) is identical to the data \(\). The generative process of diffusion models starts off from a random noise \(_{1}(,)\), and sequentially denoise it to recover \(_{0}\). In theory, the generative sampling process is governed by solving SDE [39; 40] or probability flow ODE [41; 42], using the score networks \(_{}(_{t};t)\) that approximates the score function of marginal distribution \( q(_{t})\). When training diffusion models, it is common practice to parameterize score network using the noise-prediction model , _i.e._, \(_{}(;t)=-_{}( ;t)/_{t}\). Then the training objective of diffusion model is given by

\[_{}(;)=_{t (0,1),(,)} -w_{t}_{t}^{}\|_{}( _{t};t)-\|_{2}^{2},\] (1)

where \(w_{t}\) is a weighting function and \(_{t}^{}\) is a time-derivative of \(_{t}\). Note that Eq. (1) is a generalized weighted noise-prediction loss, which includes \(\)-prediction loss  when \(-w_{t}_{t}^{}=1\).

**Text-to-Image diffusion models.** Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models [43; 2; 4] are diffusion models of an image conditioned on text, which is often processed into embeddings using the pretrained text encoders, such as T5  or CLIP . Given a dataset \((,)\) of paired image \(\) and text prompt \(\), the training loss \(_{}(;)\) for T2I diffusion models is given by \(_{}(;)=_{(, )}[_{}(;, )]\), with text conditional noise-prediction model \(_{}(;,t)\). T2I diffusion models are often trained with classifier-free guidance (CFG) , which jointly learns unconditional and conditional models, and interpolates them during inference. The predicted noise with CFG scale \( 1\) is given as:

\[}_{}(_{t};,t)= _{}(_{t};,t)-_{}(_{t};t)+_{}( _{t};t),\] (2)

where \(_{}(_{t};t)\) denotes the unconditional noise prediction, _e.g._, with null text conditioning. It is known that higher CFG scale \(\) improves the image-text alignment at the cost of the image fidelity.

**Personalizing T2I models.** Recent works have shown the potential for personalization of T2I models by fine-tuning the T2I diffusion models on a few samples. DreamBooth  optimizes the diffusion model on a few subject images accompanied with a compact caption composed of rare token identifier and class noun. While fine-tuning with regular diffusion loss (_i.e._, \(_{}\)) works well, the authors proposed the so-called prior preservation loss to retain the prior knowledge of the pretrained model. This is achieved by optimizing the model with auxiliary training images of the same class to the subject of interest. Formally, given reference dataset \(_{}\) and prior dataset \(_{}\), the training loss of DreamBooth with prior preservation loss (DB+p.p.) with hyperparameter \(_{}>0\) is given by

\[_{}()=_{}(; _{})+_{}_{}(; _{}).\] (3)

**Parameter efficient fine-tuning (PEFT).** In practice, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are combined with DreamBooth to enable fast and memory-efficient adaptation of diffusion models. In particular, low-rank adaptation (LoRA)  is a popular choice, where it fine-tunes the residuals \( W^{n m}\) of weight matrix \(W^{n m}\) with low-rank decomposition \( W=AB\) for \(A^{n r}\) and \(B^{r m}\) with rank \(r\{n,m\}\). Alternatively, Textual Inversion (TI)  introduces a new token and corresponding textual embedding \(\) to represent the concept. Then, TI optimizes textual embedding by solving \(^{*}=_{}_{}(;_{})\).

## 4 Method

In this section, we introduce our method for T2I personalization. For presentation clarity, we focus on our demonstration with the subject customization , but the method can be applied to a broader context of personalization, such as style . Throughout the paper, let us denote \(_{},p_{}\) and \(_{},p_{}\) the noise-prediction model and density for each fine-tuning and pretrained diffusion model, respectively.

### Direct Consistency Optimization

**Problem setup.** While fine-tuning based T2I personalization methods have shown great success [10; 23; 16], it is shown that the generation quality heavily depends on the model's fitness. For example, the model suffers from image-text alignment when the model overfits to few images used for fine-tuning, making it difficult to generate images with varying attributes around the subject. On the other hand, the model cannot generate consistent subject images when the model underfits. To find the right balance between overfit vs. underfit, certain heuristics such as early stopping or training with an additional prior dataset (_i.e._, prior-preservation loss) have been popularly used.

**Our approach.** We devise an efficient training objective that seeks for minimal improvement on the ELBO of fine-tuning model \(p_{}\) over the reference model \(p_{}\). Specifically, we seek for \(\) satisfying \(D_{}q()\|p_{}()<D_{ }q()\|p_{}()\), while two quantities are still not far from each other. Since computing the likelihood is intractable for diffusion models, we consider the variational bound over sequence of latents \(_{0:1}\) following [47; 48]. To this end, let us define the deviation as follows

\[(p_{},p_{};,) D_{} q(_{0:1}|)\,\|\,p_{}(_{0:1}|)-D_{}q(_{0:1}|)\,\|\,p_{}( _{0:1}|),\] (4)

where the KL divergence takes expectation over \((,)\) that generates \(_{t}=_{t}+_{t}\) for \(t(0,1)\). To enforce the positiveness of \((p_{},p_{})\), we propose following log-sigmoid loss function:

\[_{}(;,)- \,(p_{},p_{};,),\] (5)

where \((u)=(1+(-u))^{-1}\) and \(>0\) is a temperature that controls the deviation.

**Direct Consistency Optimization.** Now we show that Eq. (5) is equivalent to optimizing reward function derived from the solution of constrained policy optimization problem [19; 20]. Suppose \(f(,;_{}) f(, )\) is a function that measures the consistency between image \(\) and reference dataset \(_{}\) given the prompt \(\). We opt to find \(\) that maximizes the consistency of generated sample \( p_{}(|)\), while penalizing the deviation from the pretrained model \(p_{}\). This can be written by

\[_{}\ _{, p_{}(| )}[f(,)]- D_{}p_{}( |)\,\|\,p_{}(|),\] (6)

where \(>0\) is a temperature that controls the deviation from pretrained model. Since the likelihood of diffusion model is intractable, we consider a consistency function on the latent variables \(_{0:1}\), and solve following relaxation of Eq. (6):

\[_{}\ _{,_{0:1} p_{}( _{0:1}|)}f(_{0:1},)-  D_{}p_{}(_{0:1}|)\,\|\,p_{ }(_{0:1}|).\] (7)Note that the optimal solution to Eq. (7) satisfies

\[p_{}(_{0:1}|) p_{}(_{0:1}| )f(_{0:1},)/.\] (8)

Then, we show that the deviation \((p_{},p_{})\) in Eq. (4) is equivalent to the expected consistency over \(q(_{0:1}|)\) up to constant, _i.e._, the following holds (see Appendix A for derivation):

\[_{q(_{0:1}|)}[f(_{0:1},)]= (p_{},p_{};,)+C\] (9)

for some constant \(C\) that does not depend on \(\). Eq. (9) shows that our training objective can be regarded as optimizing the consistency function with respect to the reference dataset \(_{}\). Remark that one can define explicit consistency function (reward) and fine-tune the diffusion model with such function, _e.g._, by using reward-weighted regression (RWR) [49; 29] or using reinforcement learning (RL) [33; 34]. However, those consistency function for personalized images is hard to obtain as we only have few samples, and RL fine-tuning of diffusion models are expensive. We bypass these issues by directly fine-tuning models with an implicit reward function, similar to those by Rafailov et al.  and Wallace et al. . Thus, we name our approach _Direct Consistency Optimization_ (DCO), as we directly optimize the consistency function in fine-tuning diffusion models.

### Implementation and Analysis

Implementation.Note that computing the term for Eq. (4) is expensive as it requires computation of likelihood over all \(t\). To this end, we derive an upper bound of Eq. (5) that allows efficient implementation using \(\)-prediction loss. In Appendix A, we show that the deviation Eq. (4) can be expressed by the difference between noise-prediction errors of fine-tuning and pretrained model:

\[(p_{},p_{})=_{t(0,1), {}(,)}_{t}^{} \|_{}(_{t};,t)-\|_ {2}^{2}-\|_{}(_{t};,t)-\|_ {2}^{2}.\] (10)

Then by plugging Eq. (10) into Eq. (5) and taking out the expectation outside of logarithm function using Jensen's inequality, we have our final DCO loss at \((,)_{}\) defined as follows:

\[_{}(;,)=_{t,}--_{t}(\|_{}( _{t};,t)-\|_{2}^{2}-\|_{}( _{t};,t)-\|_{2}^{2}),\] (11)

where \(t(0,1)\), \((,)\), and \(_{t}=-_{t}^{}\)3. We use \(_{}\) in our experiments, which is as practical and easy to implement as regular training objective (_i.e._, \(_{}\)). Algorithm 2 and Algorithm 1 present DCO fine-tuning and regular fine-tuning side-by-side, with differences colored in red.

Gradient analysis of DCO loss.We provide a gradient analysis of DCO loss in fine-tuning diffusion models to better understand its effect. Given a data pair \((,)_{}\), \((,)\) and \(t(0,1)\), the gradient of DCO loss with respect to parameter \(\) is given as follows:

\[_{}_{}()(1-(d_{t}))\, _{}\|_{}(_{t};,t)-\|_{2}^{2},\] (12)

where \(d_{t}=-_{t}(\|_{}(_{t};,t)-\|_{2}^{2}-\|_{}(_{t};,t)-\|_{2}^{2})\) with stop-gradient. Remark that Eq. (12) is identical to the gradient of diffusion loss (_i.e._, \(_{}\)), except that is scaled by \(1-(d_{t})\), which measures the incorrect reward modeling. In other words, DCO loss implicitly performs an adaptive loss weighting by computing deviation from the pretrained model; if the deviation between fine-tuning and pretrained models are large, it abstains update.

Comparison to prior preservation loss.While the prior preservation loss  in Eq. (3) has a similar motivation to DCO loss, they work in very different ways. To elaborate, DCO directly regularizes the KL divergence with respect to the samples in \(_{}\), while prior preservation loss does not impose regularization for the reference data. While prior preservation loss may enhance the composition ability, fine-tuning on auxiliary samples from \(_{}\) often causes undesirable model shift, losing consistency to the pretrained model (_e.g._, Fig. 3). On the other hand, DCO is free from such an issue, as it does not require any auxiliary samples besides the reference dataset.

### Consistency Guidance Sampling

During inference, it is common practice to use classifier-free guidance to control text conditioning. Similarly, to gain control over the consistency, we propose _consistency guidance sampling_, which is an additional guidance from implicitly learned consistency function. Specifically, we decompose the guidance term with respect to the text and consistency as follows:

\[}(_{t};,t)=_{}(_{t},t)+ _{}_{}(_{t};,t)-_{}(_{t},t)+_{}_{}(_{t};,t)-_{}(_{t};,t),\] (13)

at each timestep \(t\). Note that for fixed \(_{}\), the fidelity to the reference images increases if using higher \(_{}\), while this comes at the cost of losing prompt fidelity. On the other hand, one can improve prompt fidelity by using small \(_{}\). We show that varying \(_{}\) controls the tradeoff between fidelity to the reference and image-text alignment (_e.g._, see Fig. 5). Note that a similar sampling method was introduced in , but for transformer-based T2I models . While they do not use regularized fine-tuning objectives, the consistency guidance scheme is still valid. Thus, the consistency guidance could be implemented in any fine-tuned model, while we show that it is more effective when combined with a DCO fine-tuned model (_e.g._, Fig. 5).

### Prompt Construction for Reference Images

An important (yet often overlooked) part of the T2I personalization process is the prompt construction of reference images. Recall that Ruiz et al.  have proposed the use of a compact prompt in the form of "a photo of [V] [class]" with a rare token identifier [V]. However, we find that the use of compact caption is prone to learning distractors, such as a background or a style, as part of the fine-tuned model, as illustrated in Fig. 2.

**Comprehensive caption.** Instead, we propose to provide a comprehensive and visually grounded caption that not only describes the subject but also details other visual attributes, backgrounds, and styles of reference images. In Fig. 2, we show an example of a comprehensive caption and compare the synthesized results that use a compact caption. We find that providing detailed descriptions of the undesirable attributes, _e.g._, background, or style, helps anchor desirable attributes in reference images to corresponding texts, making it easier to separate between them. This method not only holds for subject customization, but also for style customization; we provide comprehensive descriptions of the subject so that the model distinguishes style from the subject. Note that the use of comprehensive caption has been considered in practice,4 but has not been investigated from the lens of model shift and concept disentanglement. In our experiments, we use vision-language models such as GPT-4  or LLaVA  (_e.g._, see Fig. 11).

## 5 Experiments

We use Stable Diffusion XL  for our experiments. We conduct experiments on subject (Sec. 5.1), style (Sec. 5.2) personalization, and their combination (Sec. 5.3). Ablative studies are in Sec. 5.4.

### Subject Personalization

**Experimental setup.** We conduct experiments on DreamBooth dataset , containing 30 subjects, with 4-6 images per subject. The examples of images and captions are in Fig. 11 in Appendix D.1.

Figure 2: **Comprehensive caption. We provide examples of compact caption  and our comprehensive caption (top row) and generated images from each method (bottom row). The model fine-tuned with compact caption (left) generates images of a dog sitting on a couch though asked to be on the lake. Our comprehensive caption (right) effectively disentangles unwanted attributes, generating images that follow text prompts more faithfully.**

For baselines, we consider the training with a regular diffusion loss, _i.e._, DreamBooth (DB), and the one with prior preservation loss (DB+p.p.). Note that we additionally optimized textual embeddings, _i.e._, textual inversion , which enhances subject fidelity for all baselines, though we omit for clear context. For all experiments, we fine-tune LoRA of rank \(32\) and textual embeddings using Adam  optimizer with learning rates of 5e-5 and 5e-4, respectively. We use constant \(_{t}\)=1000 for DCO loss.

Following Sec. 4.4, we provide comprehensive and visually grounded caption that not only describes the subject but also details other visual attributes, backgrounds, and styles of reference images, for fine-tuning. Note that this is used for both baselines and ours. We observe that comprehensive captioning improves all the baselines, thus we omit the indications of its usage.

**Qualitative results.** Fig. 3 shows the qualitative comparison of our approach with DreamBooth (DB) and DreamBooth using prior preservation loss (DB+p.p.). We observe that our approach generates images of various visual attributes, _e.g._, outfits and backgrounds, or changing the material, as well as into various styles, _e.g._, in origami style or doodle art style. While DB changes the background, it lacks recontextualization in different outfits or styles, especially due to the overfitting to the photographic style. DB+p.p. is better than DB in prompt fidelity, but it often fails to preserve the subject identity.More qualitative comparisons are demonstrated in Fig. 17.

Figure 4: **Custom style generation. We show selected generations from DreamBooth (DB) and ours (DCO) of custom styles with varying subjects. DB is prone to capturing undesirable attributes, resulting in generation of mixed concepts (_e.g._, the girl’s outfits in the first row, the dog in the second row), whereas DCO mitigates such a concept mixing. Best viewed in color, zoomed in on monitor.**

Figure 3: **Custom subject generation. We show selected generations from DreamBooth (DB), DB with prior preservation (DB+p.p.), and ours (DCO) of custom subjects with varying attributes and styles guided by text prompts. While DB captures subjects well, it does not follow text prompt well. DB+p.p. shows better textual alignment, but falls short in subject fidelity. Ours show the best in both image-text alignment and subject fidelity. Best viewed in color, zoomed in on monitor.**

**Quantitative results.** For quantitative evaluation, we design two types of text prompts: subject customization, where we modify the attributes of the subject or its background, and subject stylization, where we change the visual style of a subject image. For each subject and type, we generate images from 50 text prompts with 2 random seeds. For evaluation metrics, we report the image similarity score using DINOv2  and the image-text similarity score using SigLIP . We also show the results using DINO  and CLIP  in Fig. 9, showing similar trends. See Appendix D for details.

Noting that this is a multi-objective problem (_i.e._, maximizing image similarity and image-text similarity), we report the Pareto curve consisting of scores with varying consistency guidance scale values to show the tradeoff between two scores of each model, instead of reporting scores at one operating point. If two curves overlap, two methods would likely perform similarly and the difference is up to a change in the consistency guidance scale at sampling.

Averaged results are in Fig. 4(a), and the results for each subject customization and stylization are in Fig. 7(a) and Fig. 7(b), respectively. Compared to DreamBooth (DB;red), ours (DCO;blue) positions on the upper-right frontier in both image-text similarity and image similarity, demonstrating its superiority. Compared to DreamBooth with prior preservation loss (DB+p.p.; green), ours (blue) results in significantly improved image similarity, while being comparable in image-text similarity. Interestingly, it (green) does not push the frontier to the upper-right compared to the ones without it (red), but it shifts the operating point to the lower-right while lying on the seemingly similar Pareto frontier. This suggests that the use of prior preservation loss improves prompt fidelity at the cost of losing the subject consistency. In Appendix B.1, we further compare with various design choices for DreamBooth, _e.g._, early stopping or lowering \(_{}\) for prior preservation loss.

### Style Personalization

**Experimental setup.** We experiment on style images from StyleDrop dataset . The examples of style images and captions are in Fig. 12 in Appendix D.1. We fine-tune LoRA of rank 64 using Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 5e-5 and do not train textual embedding. In addition, we add an offset noise  of \(0.1\) during training, which empirically helps learning the solid background color of style images. We use \(_{t}\)=1000 for DCO loss, and compare with DreamBooth (DB).

**Qualitative results.** Fig. 4 shows qualitative comparisons between DreamBooth (DB) and ours (DCO). As seen in , DB captures the style of a reference image, yet it suffers from overfitting to the reference image, _e.g._, the attributes of the subject in style reference appear in generated images. On the other hand, DCO generates images with consistent style without being entangled with contents in the reference images. We provide additional comparisons in Fig. 18.

**Quantitative results.** We choose 10 style images and generate stylized images using 190 text prompts excerpted from Parti prompts , following . We generate 2 images per evaluation prompt, resulting in 380 images in total for each style. For evaluation metrics, we report the image similarity against the style reference image and image-text similarity scores using SigLIP .

Figure 5: **Quantitative results.** We plot Pareto curve between subject / style fidelity (image similarity) and prompt fidelity (image-text similarity) on (a) subject personalization and (b) style personalization tasks. Scores of each point are measured with consistency guidance sampling (dots and lines) of \(_{}=2.0,3.0,4.0,5.0\), and conventional classifier-free guidance sampling (diamond). See Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 5.2 for experimental details, and Appendix B.1 for full comparison.

Fig. 5b shows results. While two models operate in somewhat disjoint regimes, we see that the curve of DCO (ours) is placed on the right of that of DB, showing improved image-text similarity. Nevertheless, as noted in , the image similarity for style personalization is particularly noisy, as the score is not only guided by the style but also by the unexpected appearance of the subject in the style reference image (_e.g._, in Fig. 4) when the model overfits.

### My Subject in My Style

Experimental setup.Following , we combine customized subject and style models to generate images of _my subject in my style_. Specifically, given two LoRAs \( W_{1}\) and \( W_{2}\) for subject and style, respectively, we use an arithmetic merge (Merge) , _i.e._, \( W=_{1} W_{1}+_{2} W_{2}\) with coefficients \(_{1}=_{2}=1\). We use subject and style LoRAs from Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 5.2, respectively, for both baseline (DB) and our method (DCO). We also compare with ZipLoRA , which finds optimal coefficients \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\) for each layer by jointly preserving the subject and style LoRAs. For ZipLoRA, we use DB fine-tuned subject and style models and follow the experimental setup in .

Qualitative results.In Fig. 6, we provide qualitative comparisons between our approach (DCO Merge), and baselines (DB Merge and DB ZipLoRA). As noticed in , DB Merge struggles to generate high-quality images when composing subject and style customized models. While DB ZipLoRA improves the image quality with fewer artifacts, it often loses subject or style consistency. Even using a simple arithmetic merge, DCO Merge (ours) generates images with high subject and style consistency. In addition, Fig. 1 and Fig. 20 in the appendix shows that DCO Merge succesfully generates my subjects in my styles under various contexts, guided by text prompts.

Quantitative results.We use 30 subjects from DreamBooth  dataset and 10 style images from StyleDrop dataset  from Sec. 5.1 and Sec. 5.2, respectively. For each subject and style pair, we generate images of "A [subject] in [style]" and of various text prompts that change attributes, backgrounds, or actions (_e.g._, in Fig. 20). We compute subject similarity scores (Subject) using DINO v2 , style similarity (Style), and image-text similarity (Text) scores using SigLIP .

Tab. 1 reports results. DCO Merge significantly outperforms DB Merge and DB ZipLoRA in subject similarity (\(0.462\) vs. \(0.386\), \(0.406\)) and image-text similarity (\(0.773\) vs. \(0.430\), \(0.729\)), while retaining competitive style similarity (\(0.651\) vs. \(0.672\), \(0.662\)). This aligns with our observation in Fig. 6.

Figure 6: **My subject in my style generation. We show generated images by merging subject and style LoRAs, each trained independently with DB (DB Merge) or DCO (DCO Merge). We also show results of ZipLoRA  using DB models (DB ZipLoRA). DB Merge struggles to generate high quality images. While DB ZipLoRA improves the quality, it less preserves fidelity. DCO Merge produces consistent images in both subject and style. Best viewed in color, zoomed in on monitor.**
