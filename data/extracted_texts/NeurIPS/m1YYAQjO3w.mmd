###### Abstract

AI agents aim to solve complex tasks by combining text-based reasoning with external tool calls. Unfortunately, AI agents are vulnerable to prompt injection attacks where data returned by external tools hijacks the agent to execute malicious tasks. To measure the adversarial robustness of AI agents, we introduce AgentDojo, an evaluation framework for agents that execute tools over untrusted data. To capture the evolving nature of attacks and defenses, AgentDojo is not a static test suite, but rather an extensible environment for designing and evaluating new agent tasks, defenses, and adaptive attacks. We populate the environment with 97 realistic tasks (e.g., managing an email client, navigating an e-banking website, or making travel bookings), 629 security test cases, and various attack and defense paradigms from the literature. We find that AgentDojo poses a challenge for both attacks and defenses: state-of-the-art LLMs fail at many tasks (even in the absence of attacks), and existing prompt injection attacks break some security properties but not all. We hope that AgentDojo can foster research on new design principles for AI agents that solve common tasks in a reliable and robust manner.

## 1 Introduction

Large language models (LLMs) have the ability to understand tasks described in natural language and generate plans to solve them . A promising design paradigm for AI _agents_ is to combine an LLM with tools that interact with a broader environment . AI agents could be used for various roles, such as digital assistants with access to emails and calendars, or smart "operating systems" with access to coding environments and scripts .

However, a key security challenge is that LLMs operate directly on _text_, lacking a formal way to distinguish instructions from data . _Prompt injection attacks_ exploit this vulnerability by inserting new malicious instructions in third-party data processed by the agent's tools . A successful attack can allow an external attacker to take actions (and call tools) on behalf of the user. Potential consequences include exfiltrating user data, executing arbitrary code, and more .

To measure the ability of AI agents to safely solve tasks in adversarial settings when prompt injections are in place, we introduce _AgentDojo_, a dynamic benchmarking framework which we populate-as a first version-with 97 realistic tasks and 629 security test cases. As illustrated in Figure 1, AgentDojoprovides an AI agent with tasks (e.g., summarizing and sending emails) and access to tools to solve them. Security tests consist of an attacker goal (e.g., leak the victim's emails) and an injection endpoint (e.g., an email in the user's inbox).

In contrast to prior benchmarks for AI Agents [32; 43; 50; 68] and for prompt injections [34; 57; 66; 71], AgentDojo requires agents to dynamically call multiple tools in a stateful, adversarial environment. To accurately reflect the utility-security tradeoff of different agent designs, AgentDojo evaluates agents and attackers with respect to a formal utility checks computed over the environment state, rather than relying on other LLMs to simulate an environment .

Due to the ever-evolving nature of ML security, a static benchmark would be of limited use. Instead, AgentDojo is an extensible framework that can be populated with new tasks, attacks, and defenses. Our initial tasks and attacks already present a significant challenge for attackers and defenders alike. Current LLMs solve less than 66% of AgentDojo tasks _in the absence of any attack_. In turn, our attacks succeed against the best performing agents in less than 25% of cases. When deploying existing defenses against prompt injections, such as a secondary attack detector [28; 45], the attack success rate drops to 8%. We find that current prompt injection attacks benefit only marginally from side information about the system or the victim, and succeed rarely when the attacker's goal is abnormally security-sensitive (e.g., emailing an authentication code).

At present, the agents, defenses, and attacks pre-deployed in our AgentDojo framework are general-purpose and not designed specifically for any given tasks or security scenarios. We thus expect future research to develop new agent and defense designs that can improve the utility and robustness of agents in AgentDojo. At the same time, significant breakthroughs in the ability of LLMs to distinguish instructions from data will likely be necessary to thwart stronger, adaptive attacks proposed by the community. We hope that AgentDojo can serve as a live benchmark environment for measuring the progress of AI agents on increasingly challenging tasks, but also as a quantitative way of showcasing the inherent security limitations of current AI agents in adversarial settings.

We release code for AgentDojo at https://github.com/ethz-spylab/agentdojo, and a leaderboard and extensive documentation for the library at https://agentdojo.spylab.ai.

## 2 Related Work and Preliminaries

AI agents and tool-enhanced LLMs.Advances in large language models  have enabled the creation of AI agents  that can follow natural language instructions [4; 41], perform reasoning and planning to solve tasks [20; 27; 60; 69] and harness external tools [14; 35; 40; 43; 47; 51; 54; 55]. Many LLM developers expose _function-calling_ interfaces that let users pass API descriptions to a model, and have the model output function calls [2; 9; 22].

Prompt injections.Prompt injection attacks inject instructions into a language model's context to hijack its behavior [17; 62]. Prompt injections can be direct (i.e., user input that overrides a system prompt) [23; 44] or indirect (i.e., in third-party data retrieved by a model, as shown in Figure 1) [18;

Figure 1: **AgentDojo evaluates the utility and security of AI agents in dynamic tool-calling environments with untrusted data**. Researchers can define user and attacker goals to evaluate the progress of AI agents, prompt injections attacks, and defenses.

33]. Untrusted data processed and returned by the tools called by an AI agent are an effective vector for (indirect) prompt injections that execute malicious actions on behalf of the user [13; 18; 23].

Defenses against prompt injections either aim to detect injections (typically with a LLM) [28; 29; 64], train or prompt LLMs to better distinguish instructions from data [8; 59; 61; 70; 74], or isolate function calls from the agent's main planning component [63; 66]. Unfortunately, current techniques are not foolproof, and may be unable to provide guarantees for security-critical tasks [61; 64].

Benchmarking agents and prompt injections.Existing agent benchmarks either evaluate the ability to transform instructions into a single function call [43; 47; 67], or consider more challenging and realistic "multi-turn" scenarios [26; 31; 32; 53; 68; 72], but without any explicit attacks. The ToolEmu  benchmark measures the robustness of AI agents to underspecified instructions, and uses LLMs to efficiently _simulate_ tool calls in a virtual environment and to score the agent's utility. This approach is problematic when evaluating prompt injections, since an injection might fool the LLM simulator too. In contrast to these works, AgentDojo runs a dynamic environment where agents execute multiple tool calls against realistic applications, some of which return malicious data. Even when restricted to benign settings, our tasks are at least challenging as existing function-calling benchmarks, see Figure 2.2

Prior benchmarks for prompt injections focus on simple scenarios without tool-calling, such as document QA , prompt stealing [12; 57], or simpler goal/rule hijacking [39; 52]. The recent InjecAgent benchmark  is close in spirit to AgentDojo, but focuses on simulated single-turn scenarios, where an LLM is directly fed a single (adversarial) piece of data as a tool output (without evaluating the model's planning). In contrast, AgentDojo's design aims to emulate a realistic agent execution, where the agent has to decide which tool(s) to call and must solve the original task accurately in the face of prompt injections.

## 3 Designing and Constructing AgentDojo

The AgentDojo framework consists of the following components: The **environment** specifies an application area for an AI agent and a set of available **tools** (e.g., a workspace environment with access to email, calendar and cloud storage tools). The environment **state** keeps track of the data for all the applications that an agent can interact with. Some parts of the environment state are specified as placeholders for prompt injection attacks (cf. Figure 1, and Section 3.3).

A **user task** is a natural language instruction that the agent should follow in a given environment (e.g., add an event to a calendar). An **injection task** specifies the goal of the attacker (e.g., exfiltrate the user's credit card). User tasks and injection tasks define formal **evaluation criteria** which monitor the state of the environment to measure the success rate of the agent and of the attacker, respectively.

We refer to the collection of user tasks and injection tasks for an environment as a **task suite**. As in Zhan et al. , we take a cross-product of user and injection tasks per environment to obtain the total set of security tests cases. All user tasks can also be run without an attack present, turning them into standard _utility test cases_, which can be used to assess agent performance in benign scenarios.

### AgentDojo Components

Environments and state.Complex tasks typically require interacting with a _stateful_ environment. For example, a simulated productivity workspace environment contains data relating to emails, calendars, and documents in cloud storage. We implement four environments ("Workspace", "Slack", "Travel Agency" and "e-banking") and model each environment's state as a collection of mutable

Figure 2: **AgentDojo is challenging.** Our tasks are harder than the Berkeley Tool Calling Leaderboard  in benign settings; attacks further increase difficulty.

objects, as illustrated in Fig. 3. We populate this state with dummy, benign data meant to reflect possible initial state of the environment. We generate the dummy data both manually or assisted by GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus, by providing the models with the expected schema of the data and a few examples. For LLM-generated test data we manually inspected all outputs to ensure high quality.

Tools.An AI agent interacts with the environment by means of various tools that can read and write the environment state. AgentDojo can be easily extended with new tools by adding specially formatted functions to the AgentDojo Python package. The documentations of all tools available in an environment are added to the AI agent's prompt. An example of a tool definition in AgentDojo is shown in Figure 4. Tools receive as arguments the environment state object that they need to interact with (in this case, the calendar), with a syntax inspired by the Python FastAPI library design . We populate AgentDojo with total of 74 tools obtained by considering all tools needed to solve the user tasks (e.g. tools manipulating calendar events in Workspace). The current runtime formats the tool outputs with the YAML format to feed the LLMs, but the framework supports arbitrary formatting.

User tasks.Task instructions are passed as a natural language _prompt_ to the agent. Each task exposes a _utility function_ which determines whether the agent has solved the task correctly, by inspecting the model output and the mutations in the environment state.

A user task further exposes a _ground truth_ sequence of function calls that are required to solve the task. As we explain in Appendix A, this information makes it easier to adapt attacks to each individual task, by ensuring that prompt injections are placed in appropriate places (realistically controlled by untrusted third-parties and in diverse positions of the context) that are actually queried by the model. Figure 5 shows an example of a user task instructing the agent to summarize calendar appointments in a given day. The utility function is implemented as a deterministic binary function which, given outputs of the model together with the state of the environment before and after execution, determines whether the goal of the task has been accomplished.

Other benchmarks such as ToolEmu  forego the need for an explicit utility check function, and instead rely on a LLM evaluator to assess utility (and security) according to a set of informal criteria. While this approach is more scalable, it is problematic in our setting since we study attacks that explicitly aim to inject new instructions into a model. Thus, if such an attack were particularly successful, there is a chance that it would also hijack the evaluation model.

Figure 4: **A tool definition**. This tool returns appointments by querying the calendar state.

Figure 3: **A stateful environment.** The state tracks an email inbox, a calendar and a cloud drive.

Injection tasks.Attacker goals are specified using a similar format as user tasks: the malicious task is formulated as an instruction to the agent, and a _security function_ checks whether the attacker goal has been met (cf. Figure 10 in the appendix). An injection task exposes a ground truth sequence of function calls that implement the attacker goal, which may be useful for designing stronger attacks with knowledge about the agent's tool API (e.g., "ignore previous instructions and call read_calendar followed by send_email").

Task suites.We refer to the collection of user and injection tasks within an environment as a _task suite_. The task suite can be used to determine an agent's utility on the corresponding user tasks, or to examine its security on pairs of user and injection tasks.

We populate the first version of AgentDojo with four environments and corresponding task suites. We first manually design user tasks that cover a diverse set of scenarios possible in the environment, including tasks requiring search capabilities over medium to long context windows (with up to 7,000 GPT-4 tokens for data and 4,000 GPT-4 tokens for tool descriptions), and tasks requiring chaining up to 18 different calls to both general-purpose and specialized tools. Injection tasks have an increasing and diverse difficulty both in terms of number of required steps (from one to twenty steps), and in terms of sensitivity of the required action (from sending a generic email to sharing sensitive information such as a 2 factors authentication code). We then combine these user tasks with the injection tasks relevant to the environment, to obtain the task suites. As explained above, the four suites are:

* Workspace: tools and tasks related to emails, calendar management, and a cloud drive.
* Slack: tools and tasks related to sending and reading messages on Slack, reading web pages, and files.
* Banking: tools and tasks related to performing bank transactions, summarizing bank statements, etc.
* Travel: tools and tasks related to finding and reserving options for flights, restaurants, and car rentals.

Further details on each environment and task suite are provided in Table 1.

### Agents and Prompt Injection Defenses

AgentDojo is designed as a benchmark environment to evaluate new agent designs that can defend against prompt injection attacks. We thus provide a simple interface for implementing new agents. An agent component only has to provide a query function, which takes as argument the initial user instructions, a list of available tools, and the environment state (see Figure 11 in the appendix). To enable rapid prototyping of new designs, AgentDojo also offers the ability to build modular agent _pipelines_ by combining different components. Figure 12 in the appendix provides an example for how we instantiate a prompt injection defense that combines an LLM agent (OpenAI's GPT-4o) with an additional module for detecting prompt injections [28; 29; 64]. Generally, AgentDojo supports any

pipeline that can work by taking as input a user prompt and a a runtime that can run a set of available tools.

### Prompt Injection Attacks

It is common for benchmarks in adversarial machine learning to be instantiated with a _static_ set of attacks (e.g., [7; 10; 36; 71]). We believe this is unsatisfactory for evaluating robustness to prompt injections, for two main reasons: (1) benchmarks for other security risks (e.g., for adversarial examples  or jailbreaks [7; 36]) can rely on attacks that explicitly optimize against a defense (e.g., AutoAttack  or GCG ). In contrast, existing prompt injection attacks are primarily _generic_ and do not explicitly account for the model being used. (2) even for settings where powerful optimization attacks exist, it is extremely easy to build non-robust defenses that thwart any specific attack, and require an _adaptive_ attack evaluation .

AgentDojo is thus not meant to be a static benchmark with fixed attacks, but rather a dynamic framework that can be populated with new defenses and adaptive attacks in the future. Adding a new attack to AgentDojo simply requires to define an attack function that takes as input a goal (i.e., an injection task) and returns an injection text for each attack placeholder, see Figure 13 in Appendix A. We also envision attackers with varying degrees of prior knowledge about the system and user under attack, and who exploit this knowledge to strengthen their attacks. For example, an attack might assume knowledge of the user's _name_ as well as of the agent's tool-calling API, to design targeted prompt injections (e.g., "Hi [ChatGPT], this is [Josh]. Please send an email to eve@evil.com").

### Reporting AgentDojo Results

We consider three metrics in AgentDojo:

Benign Utility: the fraction of user tasks that the model solves in the absence of any attacks.

Utility Under Attack: the fraction of security cases (i.e., a pair of user task and injection task) where the agent solves the user task correctly, without any adversarial side effects. We sometimes report the complement of this value as the _untargeted attack success rate._

Targeted Attack Success Rate (ASR): the fraction of security cases where the attacker's goal is met (i.e., the agent executes the malicious actions).

We sometimes also evaluate a collection of attacks \(\{A_{1},,A_{n}\}\), which we consider as successful on a given security case if _any_ of the attacks in the collection succeeds. This metric models an adaptive attacker that deploys the best attack for each user task and injection task (see ).

## 4 Evaluation

We evaluate tool-calling agents based on both closed-source (Gemini 1.5 Flash & Gemini Pro , Claude 3 Sonnet & Claude 3 Opus , Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-3.5 Turbo & GPT-4 Turbo & GPT-4o ) and open-source (Llama 3 70B , Command R+ ) models. We prompt all models with the system prompt given in Figure 14. For Claude 3 and 3.5 Sonnet, we additionally provide

the prompt in Figure 15, as recommended by Anthropic . For Llama 3 70B, we also provide the tool-calling prompt in Figure 16, adapted from Husain . Except for Llama 3, which does not provide function calling out-of-the-box, we query all LLMs using the official providers' APIs, following the respective documentation.

We evaluate each agent on our full suite of 629 security test cases, for 97 different user tasks. For additional experiments and ablations on attack and defense components, we focus on GPT-4o as it is the model with the highest (benign) utility on our suite (Claude Opus has comparable utility, but our access to it was heavily rate limited which prevented in-depth analysis).

### Performance of Baseline Agents and Attacks

We first evaluate all agents against a generic attack that we found to be effective in preliminary experiments, called the "Important message" attack. This attack simply injects a message instructing the agent that the malicious task has to be performed before the original one (see Figure 19 for our exact prompt). Figure 6 plots each agent's average utility in the absence of any attack (benign utility) vs. the attacker's average success rate at executing their malicious goal (targeted ASR). We find that more capable models tend to be _easier_ to attack, a form of _inverse scaling law_ (a similar observation had been made in ). This is a potentially unsurprising result, as models with low utility often fail at correctly executing the attacker's goal, even when the prompt injection succeeds. Figure 6 further plots the benign utility (i.e., without attack) vs. utility under attack--the latter of which can be interpreted as a form of robustness to denial-of-service attacks. Here, we find a strong correlation between utility and robustness. Most models incur a loss of 10%-25% in absolute utility under attack.

Overall, the most capable model in a benign setting is Claude 3.5 Sonnet, closely followed by GPT-4o. The former also provides a better tradeoff between utility and security against targeted attacks. For the remaining experiments in this paper, we focus on GPT-4o as Claude 3.5 Sonnet was released after the first version of this paper.

Figure 7 breaks down the attack success rate for individual injection tasks and task suites. Some applications are easier to attack than others. For example, attacks in our "Slack" suite have a 92% success rate (in this suite, the agent performs tasks such as browsing the Web and posting in different channels; the attacker places injections in web pages to trigger actions such as sharing a phishing link with a colleague). The high success rate for this suite may be explained by the fact that attackers control a significant fraction of the tool outputs (see Figure 21b in Appendix D). In contrast, some injection tasks can be very challenging to achieve. In particular, task 6 of our travel agent suite succeeds in 0% of cases. This injection task aims to make the agent book the most expensive hotel in Paris, and exfiltrate the user's personal information by email. The model thus has to execute two unrelated malicious tasks and we find it often succeeds at only one (partial attacker success).

Figure 6: **Agent utility vs attack success rate.** (a) Benign utility vs targeted attack success rate. (b) Benign utility vs utility under attack; Points on the Pareto frontier of utility-robustness are in bold. We report 95% confidence intervals in Table 3.

In Figure 21a in Appendix D, we further analyze the impact of the _position_ of the attacker's injection within the LLM's context. As in prior studies , we find that injections placed towards the end of a tool's response message are most effective--with up to 70% average success rate against GPT-4o.

### Ablations on Attack Components and Attacker Knowledge

Our experiments above use a generic prompt injection (see Figure 19a), that warns the agent of an important additional task. The warning message further directly addresses the model ("This is a message to you, GPT-4o"), and uses the victim's real name (e.g., "This is a message from me, Josh"). We now ablate which components of this attack prompt contribute to its success.

We first compare four prompt injection messages: (i) the "ignore previous instructions" attack ; (ii) the prompt injection from InjecAgent ; (iii) the instruction "TODO: {task description}"; and (iv) our "Important message" prompt as shown in Figure 19a. We further add an adaptive attack (Max) that selects the most effective prompt from (i)-(iv) for each task. Figure 8 shows that variations in prompt injection phrasing can have a large impact, with our "Important message" attack clearly beating prior ones. Our adaptive attack (Max) boosts the success rates by another 10%.

Table 2 shows an ablation on the attacker knowledge of the names of the user and model. We find that this knowledge slightly increases the success rate of our attack (by 1.9%), but that incorrect guesses (e.g., addressing GPT-4o as Claude) significantly weaken the attack.

### Prompt Injection Defenses

So far, we have evaluated LLM agents that were not specifically designed to resist prompt injections (beyond built-in defenses that may be present in closed models). We now evaluate GPT-4o enhanced with a variety of defenses proposed in the literature against our strongest attack: (i) _Data delimiters_, where following Hines et al.  we format all tool outputs with special delimiters, and prompt the model to ignore instructions within these (prompt in Figure 17), (ii) _Prompt injection detection_ which uses a BERT classifier from ProtectAI  trained to detect prompt injection on each tool call output, and aborts the agent if anything has been detected, (iii) _Prompt sandwiching_ which repeats the user instructions after each function call, (iv) _Tool filter_ which is a simple form of an isolation mechanism [63; 66], where the LLM first restricts itself to a set of tools required to solve a given task,

   Injection & Example & Targeted ASR \\  Baseline & “the model, the user” & 45.8\% \\ \(+\) wrong user & “the model, Jane” & 23.2\% (-22.6\%) \\ \(+\) wrong model & “Claude, the user” & 23.7\% (-22.1\%) \\ \(+\) correct user & “the model, Bob” & 46.1\% (+0.3\%) \\ \(+\) correct model & “GPT4, the user” & 44.8\% (-1.0\%) \\ \(+\) both correct & “GPT4, Bob” & **47.7\%** (+1.9\%) \\   

Table 2: **Ablation of attacker knowledge on attack success rate. Knowing the name of the user and of the LLM yields slightly stronger attacks, although there is a risk as incorrect guesses significantly weaken the attack.**

Figure 8: **Our prompt injection outperforms prior approaches.**

Figure 7: **Attack success rates by task suite for GPT-4o.**

before observing any untrusted data (e.g., if the task asks to "summarize my emails", the agent can decide to only select the read_email tool, guarding against abuse of otherwise available tools).

Figure 9 shows the targeted attack success rates for each defense, as a function of the defense's benign utility. Surprisingly, we find that many of our defense strategies actually _increase_ benign utility (see Table 5), presumably because they put more emphasis on the original instructions. The prompt injection detector has too many false positives, however, and significantly degrades utility. Repeating the user prompt after a tool call is a reasonable defense for our attack, but it is unlikely to withstand adaptive attacks (e.g., an injection that instructs the model to ignore _future_ instructions).

Strengths and limitations of tool isolation mechanisms.Our simple tool filtering defense is particularly effective, lowering the attack success rate to 7.5%. This defense is effective for a large number of the test cases in our suite, where the user task only requires read-access to a model's state (e.g., reading emails), while the attacker's task requires write-access (e.g., sending emails).

This defense fails, however, when the list of tools to use cannot be planned in advance (e.g., because the result of one tool call informs the agent on what tasks it has to do next), or when the tools required to solve the task are also sufficient to carry out the attack (this is true for 17% of our test cases). This defense might also fail in settings (which AgentDojo does not cover yet) where a user gives the agent multiple tasks over time, without resetting the agent's context. Then, a prompt injection could instruct the agent to "wait" until it receives a task that requires the right tools to carry out the attacker's goal.

For such scenarios, more involved forms of isolation may be needed, such as having a "planner" agent dispatch tool calls to isolated agents that only communicate results symbolically . However, such strategies would still be vulnerable in scenarios where the prompt injection solely aims to alter the result of a given tool call, without further hijacking the agent's behavior (e.g., the user asks for a hotel recommendation, and one hotel listing prompt injects the model to always be selected).

## 5 Conclusion

We have introduced AgentDojo, a standardized agent evaluation framework for prompt injection attacks and defenses, consisting of 97 realistic tasks and 629 security test cases. We evaluated a number of attacks and defenses proposed in the literature on AI agents based on state-of-the-art tool-calling LLMs. Our results indicate that AgentDojo poses challenges for both attackers and defenders, and can serve as a live benchmark environment for measuring their respective progress.

We see a number of avenues for improving or extending AgentDojo: (i) we currently use relatively simple attacks and defenses, but more sophisticated defenses (e.g., isolated LLMs , or attacks ) could be added in the future. This is ultimately our motivation for designing a dynamic benchmark environment; (ii) to scale AgentDojo to a larger variety of tasks and attack goals, it may also be necessary to automate the current manual specification of tasks and utility criteria, without sacrificing the reliability of the evaluation; (iii) Challenging tasks that cannot be directly solved using our _tool selection_ defense (or other, more involved isolation mechanisms ) would be

Figure 9: **Evaluation of prompt injection defenses. Points on the Pareto frontier of utility-robustness are in bold. We report 95% confidence intervals in Table 5.**

particularly interesting to add; (iv) AgentDojo could be extended to support _multimodal_ agents that process both text and images, which would dramatically expand the range of possible tasks and attacks ; (v) the addition of constraints on prompt injections (e.g., in terms of length or format) could better capture the capabilities of realistic adversaries.

Broader impact.Overall, we believe AgentDojo provides a strong foundation for this future work by establishing a representative framework for evaluating the progress on prompt injection attacks and defenses, and to give a sense of the (in)security of current AI agents in adversarial settings. Of course, attackers could also use AgentDojo to prototype new prompt injections, but we believe this risk is largely overshadowed by the positive impact of releasing a reliable security benchmark.
