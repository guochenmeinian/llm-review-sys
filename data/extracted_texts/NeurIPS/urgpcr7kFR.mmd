###### Abstract

Millions of abandoned oil and gas wells are scattered across the world, leaching methane into the atmosphere and toxic compounds into the groundwater. Many of these locations are unknown, preventing the wells from being plugged and their polluting effects averted. Remote sensing is a relatively unexplored tool for pinpointing abandoned wells at scale. We introduce the first large-scale dataset for this problem1, leveraging medium-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery from Planet Labs. Our curated dataset comprises over 213,000 wells (abandoned, suspended, and active) from Alberta, a region with especially high well density, sourced from the Alberta Energy Regulator and verified by domain experts. We evaluate baseline algorithms for well detection and segmentation, showing the promise of computer vision approaches but also significant room for improvement.

## 1 Introduction

Across the world, there are millions of abandoned oil and gas wells, left to degrade by the companies or individuals that built them. No longer producing usable fossil fuels, these wells nonetheless have a significant impact on the environment, with many of them leaking significant quantities of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, into the atmosphere. In aggregate, these emissions represent the equivalent of millions of tons of carbon dioxide per year . Abandoned wells also pose health and safety concerns, in particular by leaching toxic chemicals into the groundwater of surrounding communities .

It is possible to plug abandoned wells to mitigate the harms associated with them (with so-called "super-emitter" wells an especially high priority [3; 4]). However, a significant fraction of abandoned wells remain unknown. In Pennsylvania, as much as 90% of abandoned wells are estimated to be unrecorded . In Canada, abandoned wells have been described as the most uncertain source of methane emissions nationally, due to the poor quality of data surrounding them .

With the advent of large-scale remote sensing datasets and powerful machine learning tools to process them, it has become possible to label and monitor the built environment as never before . Many such works have focused on opportunities to use remote sensing to accelerate climate action and environmental protection, and oil and gas infrastructure has increasingly been an object of scrutiny (see e.g. [6; 7]). In this paper, we present the first large-scale machine learning dataset for pinpointing oil and gas wells, encompassing abandoned, suspended, and active wells. Our main contributions are as follows:* We introduce the Alberta Wells Dataset, which includes information on over 200k abandoned, suspended, and active oil and gas wells, together with high-resolution satellite imagery.
* We frame the problem of identification of wells as a challenge for object detection and binary segmentation.
* We evaluate a wide range of deep learning algorithms commonly used for similar tasks, finding promising performance but opportunities for significant improvement.

We hope that this work will represent a step towards scalable identification of abandoned well sites and reduction of their deleterious effects upon the climate and environment.

## 2 Previous Work

Hundreds of satellites continuously monitor the Earth's surface, generating petabyte-scale remote sensing datasets . With advancements in hardware, the quality of remote sensing images has significantly improved in terms of spatial and temporal resolution. High-quality remote sensing data are available through state-funded projects like Sentinel and Landsat, and more recently through private projects such as Planet . Increasingly, machine learning has been used to parse such raw data, including in a wide range of applications for tackling climate change . Benchmark datasets in this area have included tasks in land use and land cover (LULC) estimation , crop classification [10; 11], species distribution modeling , and forest monitoring .

Within this area of research, an increasing body of work has considered the problem of detecting artifacts associated with oil and gas operations. The detection of oil spills using a combination of remote sensing and machine learning has been widely explored [14; 15; 16]. Recently, the detection of oil and gas infrastructure has also been investigated [7; 17], with some studies focusing on the goal of estimating methane emissions [18; 19]. The dataset by  includes 7,066 aerial images, with 149 images of oil refineries. The METER-ML dataset  comprises 86,599 georeferenced images in the U.S. labeled for methane sources. The OGIM v1 dataset  includes 2.6 million point locations of major facilities. A dataset by  features 1,388 images of pipelines in the Arctic, while a dataset by  includes 3,266 images of heavy-polluting enterprises with 0.25 m resolution.

The problem of detection of oil and gas wells has also been proposed by a number of authors. Existing datasets, however, are quite small (500-5,000 samples), and typically are limited to a small region and contain only active wells, limiting their applicability in the context of identifying abandoned or suspended wells. The NEPU-OWOD V1.0 dataset  includes 432 0.41m/px resolution Google Earth Imagery-based high-resolution images from Daqing City, China, containing 1,192 oil wells. The NEPU-OWS V1.0 dataset  consists of 1,200 10m/px resolution Sentinel-2 images from Russia with a resolution of 10 m per pixel, covering 1192 oil wells and V2.0  includes 120 multispectral images from Austin, USA. NEPU-OWOD 3.0  contains 722 images with 3749 oil wells from various locations in China & California, with resolutions of 0.48 m/px. A dataset with 5,895 images from Daqing City, each containing 1-5 oil wells at 0.26 m per pixel, was proposed in  Another dataset of 930 images from the Permian Basin, USA, was introduced in , with resolutions ranging from 15 cm to 1 m per pixel. These various works have largely considered

only simple machine learning algorithms for well detection, without evaluating the more complex approaches which have proven useful in other remote sensing contexts.

## 3 Alberta Wells Dataset

In this paper, we introduce the benchmark **Alberta Wells Dataset** for oil and gas well detection.The dataset is drawn from the province of Alberta, Canada, a region with a substantial number of oil and gas wells and infrastructure present for over a century, including over 94,000 patches of satellite imagery acquired from Planet Labs , covering more than 213,000 individual wells. Each patch is annotated with labels for both segmentation and bounding box localization. The annotations are based on data from the Alberta Energy Regulator, quality-controlled by domain experts.

Our dataset attempts to maximize the amount of data available for learning by including a mixture of active and suspended wells alongside abandoned wells. These types of wells appear overall similar in satellite imagery. In contrast to abandoned wells, "suspended" refers to wells that have merely paused operations temporarily, though this designation can be inaccurate, and some wells are classified as suspended for long enough that they are truly abandoned. Active wells are those that are currently in operation.

To simulate real-world conditions, we ensure a varied density of wells per image, as highlighted in Figure 1. We also include satellite imagery patches with no wells present from areas nearby to areas with wells, ensuring no overlap between the samples. This balanced dataset maintains an equal distribution of well and non-well images. Table 1 details the total sample count in each dataset split, alongside the number of well and non-well patches.

### Well Data Collection, Quality Control & Patch Creation

The Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) oversees the energy industry in the province, ensuring companies adhere to regulations as they develop oil and gas resources. AER publishes AER ST37, a monthly list of all wells reported in Alberta, detailing their geographic location, mode of operation, license status, and type of product being extracted, among other attributes. This data is provided in shapefile format along with metadata. However, this data cannot be used directly because the license status or mode of operation does not always correlate with the actual status of the well. Therefore, we work with domain experts to perform quality control on the dataset.

First, we remove duplicate entries from the well metadata, which often contain multiple instances of the same well identified by duplicate license numbers. We resolve these duplicates by retaining the most recent update.A similar approach is applied to the shapefile, where duplicates are resolved using the license date. Afterward, we merge both datasets and filter the data as shown in Table 2, categorizing the wells as active, abandoned, or suspended based on specific criteria developed in consultation with domain experts. We check for duplicate location coordinates in the dataset and resolve them by retaining the instance with the latest drill date. Finally, we ensure all the well instances in the dataset are indeed within the boundaries of Alberta.

After filtering and performing quality control on the datasets with domain experts, we calculate the geographical bounds covered by the well instances across the province and divide the region into nonoverlapping square image patches, each covering an area of 1.1025 sq km (with sides of 1050m). These images include various numbers of individual wells (see Fig. 1), and we ensure that an approximately equal number of patches exist with and without wells.

### Dataset Splitting

To create a well-distributed dataset that represents various geographical regions and offers a diverse benchmark for evaluation and testing, we developed a splitting algorithm (see Algorithm 1). This method involves forming small clusters \(k_{1i}\) of nearby well patches based on their centroids as illustrated in Figure 1(a). These small clusters are then grouped into larger, non-intersecting super-clusters \(k_{2i}\), with each super-cluster representing a city or larger geographical area. The formation of super-clusters involves calculating a centroid for each \(k_{1i}\) cluster based on the centroids of the well patches it contains as illustrated in Figure 1(b). By clustering wells in this manner, we ensure that \(k_{1i}\) clusters group wells from nearby localities together, while \(k_{2i}\) clusters group wells from the same geographic region as illustrated in Figure 1(c). Thus, each \(k_{2i}\) cluster represents a geographic distribution, with each \(k_{1i}\) cluster within it representing a sample of that distribution. To ensure a diverse and well-distributed evaluation and testing of our machine learning model, we select the \(k_{1i}\) clusters with the two fewest well instances from each \(k_{2i}\) super-cluster for inclusion in the evaluation and test sets. This approach ensures a diverse representation of the dataset as observed in Figure 1(d). Moreover, we maintain an equal distribution of well and non-well patches. In cases of imbalance in non-well images, we exclude such patches from the contributing \(k_{1i}\) clusters as specified in Algorithm 1. For imbalances in well images, we sample non-well patches that are not part of any other clusters. The parameters used in constructing the dataset are \(M=300\) and \(N=30\).

We also assess Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics, including mAP\({}_{50}\) and mAP\({}_{50:95}\), measuring the model's precision-recall trade-off and detection accuracy at various IoU thresholds.

### Results & Analysis

Our tasks involve identifying a roughly circular well region with a 90m diameter in real life, which translates to less than 30 pixels in satellite imagery due to resizing and other augmentations. This poses a challenge for machine learning models given the heterogeneous nature of the background, including various similarly shaped and sized features of the natural and built environment. Additionally, vegetation can occlude wells in RGB channels, highlighting the importance of near-infrared imagery for guiding the model. The wells themselves also vary somewhat in shape, and can be in various states of disrepair as a result of differing ages and maintenance.

For the binary segmentation task framing, we train both CNN-based and Transformer-based backbones, considering the prevalent imbalance in the image data due to the small size of wells. Among our models, as shown in Table 3, the traditional U-Net performs the best, with CNN-based models showing higher IOU, precision, and F1 scores, indicating more accurate predictions of well instances compared to other models. Precision, which reflects the accuracy of our positive detections compared to the ground truth, is crucial. However, a high recall value ensures the model captures most actual well instances, reducing the risk of missing important information. Thus, the Uper-Net model with the highest recall value of 75.3\(\) 0.3, which excels at capturing global context information, appears well-suited for this task.

For the object detection task framing, the IoU metrics measure how accurately the model identifies predicted well locations compared to the actual locations, at different levels of overlap. A higher IoU indicates better alignment between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes. Mean Average Precision (mAP) metrics, including mAP\({}_{50}\) and mAP\({}_{50:95}\), provide a comprehensive assessment of

  Architecture & Backbone & Learning Rate & IoU & F1 Score & Precision & Recall \\  U-Net & ResNet50 & \(10^{-3}\) & 56\(\)0.4 & 59.3\(\)0.2 & 78.5\(\)2.8 & 68\(\)1.8 \\ DeepLabV3+ & ResNet50 & \(10^{-4}\) & 55.1\(\)0.6 & 58.5\(\)0.5 & 77.8\(\)1.7 & 67.3\(\)1.2 \\ Segformer & mit-b0-ade & \(6.10^{-4}\) & 51.3\(\)0.7 & 54.1\(\)0.6 & 74.8\(\)2.4 & 69.8\(\)0.2 \\ UperNet & swin small & \(10^{-4}\) & 51.4\(\) 0.5 & 54.8\(\)0.5 & 69.3\(\)0.2 & 75.3\(\)0.3 \\

the model's precision-recall trade-off. \(_{50}\) considers precision at a single IoU threshold of 0.5, giving an overall measure of the model's accuracy in detecting well instances. On the other hand, \(_{50:95}\) evaluates the model's performance across a range of IoU thresholds from 0.5 to 0.95, providing a detailed understanding of its precision-recall behavior across different levels of detail in the predictions.

Our evaluation, as shown in Table 4 indicates that while all models perform reasonably well in terms of aligning predicted and actual well locations, Faster R-CNN stands out with the highest IoU\({}_{0.5}\) score of \(61.29 0.35\). However, all models perform poorly in terms of mean average precision, with Faster R-CNN achieving the highest score of only \(19.12 3.41\). DETR and RetinaNet perform particularly poorly, with near-zero scores indicating their inability to identify well-bounding box locations accurately. This could be attributed to the fact that these models might not produce region proposals confidently enough, especially considering instances with a large number of wells. While IoU scores are decent with increasing thresholds, the mAP scores indicate that a more complex model may be required for this task.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we have introduced the first large-scale dataset for identifying oil and gas wells, in particular abandoned wells, which represent a major source of greenhouse gases and other pollutants. We combine high-resolution imagery, an extensive database of well locations, and expert verification to create the Alberta Wells Dataset. We frame well identification both in terms of object detection and binary segmentation, and evaluate the performance of a wide range of popular deep learning methods on these tasks. We find that the Uper-Net model in particular represents the most promising baseline for the binary segmentation task, while for object detection all models demonstrate more mixed results, with relatively strong IoU scores but weak mAP. These results show that the Alberta Wells Dataset represents both a challenging as well as a societally impactful set of tasks.

We do not envision any significant negative uses of our work. Localization of wells is primarily of interest to the climate change mitigation community and is not, for example, a primary means whereby fossil fuel companies select new locations for drilling. Therefore, we do not believe this dataset is susceptible to dual use.

One potential limitation of our work is that we rely on well locations listed by the Alberta Energy Regulator. It is likely that many true well locations are missing in this data, leading to the potential for false negatives in the ground-truth data for this problem. However, it is to be expected that this will not significantly affect the training of algorithms since these labels represent a small fraction of the negative locations in the dataset, and deep learning algorithms are known to be robust to moderate amounts of label noise (see e.g. ). Instead the effect may simply be that the reported test accuracy is actually lower than the true value (due to certain correctly predicted well locations being evaluated as false). We hope to investigate such effects further in future work.

Another noteworthy limitation is the exclusive focus on Alberta, which we selected because there is a large amount of labeled data available for this region. Another promising direction for future work will be to assess the capacity for few- or zero-shot transfer learning from the region of Alberta to

other regions with a high expected concentration of abandoned wells, including the Appalachian and Mountain West regions of the United States, as well as a number of former Soviet states.

We hope that our work may be of use to policymakers and other stakeholders involved in climate action and environmental protection, according to the following envisioned steps:

* Use the Alberta Wells Dataset to train algorithms for pinpointing well locations.
* Run these algorithms at scale across a broader region of interest, comparing against any existing databases to identify those wells which may be undocumented.
* Flag abandoned wells for plugging, prioritizing those identified as super-emitters.

We believe that the scalability of machine learning tools for remote sensing will make them an invaluable tool in pinpointing and mitigating the global environmental impact of abandoned oil and gas wells.
