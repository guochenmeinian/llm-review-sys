###### Abstract

Recently, multi-modal entity alignment has emerged as a pivotal endeavor for the integration of Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) originating from diverse data sources. Existing works primarily focus on fully depicting entity features by designing various modality encoders or fusion approaches. However, uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues, such as weak inter-modal associations, description diversity, and modality absence, still severely hinder the effective exploration of aligned entity similarities. To this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Tackling uncertain correspondences method for Multi-modal Entity Alignment (TMEA). Specifically, to handle diverse attribute knowledge descriptions, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. In order to mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we propose to unify all modality features into a shared latent subspace and generate pseudo features via variational autoencoders according to existing modal features. Then, we develop an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints, to address weak semantic associations between modalities. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets validate the effectiveness of TMEA with a clear improvement over competitive baselines.

## 1 Introduction

Multi-Modal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) effectively store a substantial volume of knowledge encompassing diverse modalities including visual, relational, and attribute information in a structured and organized manner . They greatly facilitate the advancement of various downstream tasks such as recommender systems , video understanding , and domain-specific applications . In order to construct a more comprehensive multi-modal knowledge base for supporting external knowledge comprehension and reasoning, the demand for integrating MMKGs from heterogeneous data sources has become extremely urgent. As a result, multi-modal entity alignment to match entities referring to identical real-world concepts from distinct MMKGs has emerged as an increasingly critical task for their integration .

In the literature, early investigations into entity alignment primarily rely on translational models  or graph neural networks  to capture semantic relatedness of aligned entities through the geometrical structures in an embedding space. However, these methods were originally devised fortraditional knowledge graphs and struggle to accommodate diverse multi-modal knowledge, which makes it difficult to fulfill the need for aligning entities across MMKGs. Therefore, recent studies  have introduced diverse modality encoders or fusion approaches tailored to the characteristics of multi-modal knowledge, striving to fully extract information from all modalities so as to effectively portray the features of entities. For modality encoders, MSNEA  develops vision-guided encoders for relational and attribute knowledge to achieve inter-modal enhancement. ACK-MMEA  unifies the encoding of multi-modal features by designing a specialized graph neural network to ensure consistent modal aggregation. Regarding fusion approaches, MMEA  synthesizes multiple representations by transferring each uni-modal embedding into a common space. EVA  incorporates multi-modal features into a combined embedding using an attention-driven modality weighting mechanism.

Although these methods have made remarkable progress in extracting and fusing multi-modal features for entity representation, there still remain many substantial challenges, particularly the limitation of uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities . Figure 1 illustrates a toy example of such uncertain correspondences. Firstly, the weak semantic associations among diverse modal knowledge of entities pose a considerable challenge in inter-modal enhancement. In \(MMKG_{1}\), "Twilight" has attributes "Release Date" and "Runtime Duration" along with an image of a movie poster containing two roles. The poster does not include content that could semantically overlap with these attributes, which makes it hard to capture their feature commonality to perform inter-modal enhancement. Secondly, the distinct descriptive manners of entities across different MMKGs complicate the matching of attributes with the same meanings between aligned entities. For instance, "Release Date" for "Twilight" in \(MMKG_{1}\) and "Debut Date" for "Twilight (film)" in \(MMKG_{2}\) both mean the initial release date of the movie. This requires a more profound semantic understanding to ascertain if they convey the same meanings. Thirdly, MMKGs often lack complete entity knowledge, with certain modalities entirely devoid of data. This impedes the differentiation of whether two entities are aligned, as this distinction can be readily misled by consistent modality features of unaligned entities. Due to missing attributes for "Kristen Stewart" in \(MMKG_{1}\) and images for "KStew" in \(MMKG_{2}\), there is a high chance of erroneous matching "Bella Swan" in \(MMKG_{2}\) based on its visual similarity to "Kristen Stewart". Given the challenges presented above, the exploration of tackling uncertain correspondences is crucial in multi-modal entity alignment task.

To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel **T**ackling uncertain correspondences method for **M**ulti-modal **E**ntity **A**lignment (**TMEA**). Specifically, we encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations in a Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module. In MKE, to handle diverse attribute knowledge descriptions, we particularly design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the Large Language Model  (LLM) and in-context learning  into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the impact of the modality absence, we devise a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs)  according to existing modal features. For the purpose of addressing the weak semantic associations between modalities, we develop an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in another Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE)

module. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets verify the effectiveness and superiority of TMEA with an obvious improvement over competitive baselines 1. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

* In this paper, we focus on tackling uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities for multi-modal entity alignment, including weak inter-modal associations, description diversity, and modality missing.
* We propose a novel TMEA model to address these three issues, by specially designing the inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism, alignment-augmented abstract representation, and pseudo feature generation.
* We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of TMEA, with at least a 32.8% increase in Hits@1 over competitive baselines.

## 2 Related Work

In this section, we introduce the related research categorized into traditional entity alignment and multi-modal entity alignment.

**Traditional Entity Alignment.** Traditional knowledge graphs are composed of textual symbol triples, which often result in information overload . Therefore, entity alignment was proposed to match the identical entities in various KGs for their integration . Existing methods mainly rely on entity embedding techniques, which can be grouped into triple-based embedding [53; 31] and neighborhood embedding [36; 42]. _Triple-based embedding_ defines an energy function to measure the plausibility of triples. For example, MTransE  adopted TransE  as the entity encoder to embed different KGs into independent vector spaces and then learned the transitions between aligned entities. IPTransE  implemented an iterative strategy and employed it to supplement probably aligned entities into the training set. _Neighbor-based embedding_ exploits the subgraph structure organized by partial relations between entities. For instance, GCN-Align  used graph convolutional networks to aggregate the neighborhood information of entities. MixTEA  instructed the graph model learning by an end-to-end mixture teaching of manually labeled mappings and probabilistic pseudo mappings. PEEA  increased the connections between far-away entities and labeled ones by incorporating positional information into the representation learning with a position attention layer. However, they cannot accommodate diverse multi-modal knowledge and satisfy the requirement for multi-modal entity alignment.

**Multi-Modal Entity Alignment.** Due to the urgent demand for the integration of MMKGs, extensive research has been dedicated to multi-modal entity alignment [23; 6; 21; 19]. Initially, multi-modal entity alignment was regarded as a special type of link prediction task, aiming to connect entities through the "SameAs" relation . Subsequently, the first attempt in multi-modal entity alignment introduced the pioneering MMEA  approach, which transferred multi-modal representations into a unified space by minimizing the distance between the fused embeddings and each uni-modal embedding. Later, Liu et al.  believed that visual modality has abundant features as the advantage, thus leveraging visual similarities to augment the training data by iteratively adding aligned pairs. The previous studies employed independent encoders for feature extraction of each modality, without considering interactions between different modalities. Therefore, MSNEA  proposed a modality interaction mechanism to guide relationship learning and attribute selection using visual features, and designed multi-modal contrastive learning to make features of aligned entities more similar. Owing to the impact of contextual gaps on effectiveness, ACK-MMEA  utilized merge and generate operators to build an attribute-consistent MMKG, and aggregated the consistent information through graph neural networks. Despite their remarkable advancement, there still remain some significant challenges like uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities.

## 3 Preliminary

**Multi-Modal Knowledge Graph (MMKG).** A MMKG consists of relational, attribute, and visual knowledge and is formally defined as \(=(,,,,, ,\,)\). Here, \(\), \(\), \(\), \(\), \(\), \(\), \(\) denote the sets of entities, relations, images, attributes, attribute values, triples, and entity-imagepairs, respectively. Specifically, the triple set \(\) includes relational and attribute triples, denoted as \(=_{}_{}\), where \(_{}=\{(e_{h},r,e_{t}) e_{h},e_{t},r \}\) refers to the set of relational triples, and \(_{}=\{(e,a,v) e,a,v \}\) represents the set of attribute triples. \(=\{(e,i) e,i\}\) indicates that the image \(i\) describes the entity \(e\).

**Multi-Modal Entity Alignment (MMEA).** We consider the MMEA task between two MMKGs \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\). The objective of MMEA is to pair 1-to-1 corresponding entities that describe identical concepts in the real world but exist in separate MMKGs. Represented symbolically, the inputs are two MMKGs \(_{1}=(_{1},_{1},_{1},_{ 1},_{1},_{1},_{1})\) and \(_{2}=(_{2},_{2},_{2},_ {2},_{2},_{2},_{2})\), and the output is the set of aligned entity pairs \(=\{(e_{1},e_{2}) e_{1}_{1},e_{2}_{2 },e_{1} e_{2}\}\), where \(\) means the equivalence of two entities.

## 4 Methodology

In this section, we introduce the technical details of our proposed TMEA. As illustrated in Figure 2, TMEA comprises three main modules: 1) _Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder_ (MKE) module to encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations, with alignment-augmented abstract representation to address diverse attribute knowledge descriptions; 2) _Missing Modality Imputation_ (MMI) module to unify diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generate a pseudo feature via VAEs according to existing modal features for completing the missing modality; 3) _Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement_ (MCE) module to enhance semantic associations between modalities by designing an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints. For model optimization strategy, we integrate multi-modal contrastive learning and bi-directional iteration.

### Multi-Modal Knowledge Encoder

In this module, we encode the relational, attribute, and visual modalities of knowledge to acquire their preliminary feature representations. In particular, to address the diversity of descriptive manners of attribute knowledge, we design alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the large language model and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract.

**Relational Knowledge Encoder.** Relational knowledge is composed of a set of relational triples, in the form of \((e_{h},r,e_{t})_{}\). Here, we take TransE  with the swapping strategy  as the relational knowledge encoder to interpret \(r\) as a translation vector from \(e_{h}\) to \(e_{t}\), making relationships captured by simple geometric operations. The score function \(f(e_{h},r,e_{t})\) and the margin-based loss \(_{TranE}\) are defined as follows:

\[f(e_{h},r,e_{t})=\|_{h}^{}+-_{t }^{}\|_{2}^{2},\] (1)

Figure 2: The framework overview of TMEA.

\[_{TranE}=_{_{}}_{^{-} _{}^{-}}(0,+f()-f(^ {-})),\] (2)

where \(_{h}^{}\), \(_{t}^{}\) are initial relational feature vectors of \(e_{h}\) and \(e_{t}\), \(\) is the feature embedding of \(r\), \(\|\|_{2}\) is the \(L_{2}\) norm, \(\) is the margin hyperparameter, and \(_{}\) is the set of negative examples. By this means, we can obtain the initial relational feature of the entity, denoted as \(^{}\).

**Attribute Knowledge Encoder.** An attribute triple can be denoted as \((e,a,v)_{}\). Aligning attributes across different MMKGs is challenging due to the variations in the expression of identical attributes. It necessitates more than a basic lexical comparison and requires a profound semantic understanding to ascertain whether attributes with different labels indeed represent the same concept. Recently, the powerful semantic understanding capabilities of LLMs have been proven across multiple tasks [1; 8; 10]. The pre-existing knowledge within LLMs can help bridge gaps in information that may not be explicitly stated. Moreover, in-context learning [37; 52] is a prompt engineering method where task demonstrations are included in the prompt. With in-context learning, off-the-shelf LLM can solve attribute alignment without fine-tuning. Therefore, we design an alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporates the GPT 3.5  and in-context learning  into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. For attribute alignment, the prompt is devised as shown in Appendix A. As the attributes that cannot be aligned often become noise , we only retain those attributes that can be aligned according to the results of GPT 3.5. Next, we convert the filtered attribute triples into a textual abstract sentence. For an entity \(e\) and its \(n\) filtered attribute triples \((e,a_{1},v_{1}),(e,a_{2},v_{2}),...,(e,a_{n},v_{n})\), the template of abstract sentence \(S\) is "\(a_{1}\) is \(v1\), \(a_{2}\) is \(v2\),..., \(a_{n}\) is \(v_{n}\)". Given two attribute triples ("Twilight", "Release Date", "2008.916") and ("Twilight", "Runtime Duration", "117") related to "Twilight", we construct a abstract sentence of "Release Date is 2008.916, Runtime Duration is 117". Then, we use a pre-trained BERT  model to generate the representation of this sentence, thus forming the attribute embedding of the entity in the following:

\[^{}=_{}_{j=1}^{n}BERT (w_{j})+_{},\] (3)

where \(w_{j}\) denotes the \(j\)-th word in \(S\), \(BERT()\) represents the hidden feature vector in the last layer of BERT, \(_{}\) is the weight matrix, and \(_{}\) is the bias vector.

**Visual Knowledge Encoder.** Visual knowledge is typically comprised of entity-image pairs, denoted as \((e,i)\). We employ a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT)  to extract image features. Specifically, the last fully connected layer and softmax layer are removed to acquire the image embeddings of entities. The initial visual feature embedding \(^{}\) for \((e,i)\) is generated as follows:

\[^{}=_{}ViT(i)+_{},\] (4)

where \(ViT()\) is the backbone of ViT, and \(_{}\), \(_{}\) are the weight matrix and bias vector.

### Missing Modality Imputation

In real-world scenarios, entities in MMKGs often lack the knowledge of certain modalities. This omission can result from limitations in data collection methods or source availability. Incomplete modal knowledge will potentially lead to erroneous alignment. Effectively addressing and compensating for these missing modalities to guarantee accurate integration are able to improve the robustness of entity alignment process.

In this module, we intend to complete the missing modality by unifying the diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) [18; 28] according to existing modal features. VAEs can learn latent representations of data, capturing essential structure and distribution. We utilize VAEs to unify features of one target modality and concatenated features of other modalities into a shared latent subspace. In this latent subspace, data from various modalities become comparable. We can use the latent representation of concatenated features derived from other modalities to approximate that of the target modality, thereby generating pseudo-features.

Typically, entities in MMKGs cannot lack relational knowledge, because entities without relations are isolated nodes, rendering them devoid of the graph's interconnected significance. Therefore, we aim to complete the visual and attribute knowledge for entities. Specifically, we first reduce the dimension of concatenated features of other modalities as follows:

\[^{}=_{ga}Concat(^{ },^{})+_{ga},\] (5)\[^{}=_{gi}Concat(^{}, ^{})+_{gi},\] (6)

where \(Concat()\) is the concatenation operation, \(_{g*}\), \(_{g*}\) are projection matrix and bias vector. Then, we use multiple VAEs to learn the latent representations. For each VAE, \(\) is a feature of target modality, \(\) is the representation of \(\) in the latent space, \(q_{}(\,|\,)\) is a probabilistic encoder, and \(p_{}(\,|\,)\) is a probabilistic decoder. The loss of VAEs is designed as follows:

\[_{VAE}()=_{(,) q_{ }(\,|)}[ p_{}(\,|\, )]-D_{KL}(q_{}(\,|\, )\|p_{}()),\] (7)

\[_{v}=_{VAE}(^{})+_{VAE }(^{})+_{VAE}(^{ })+_{VAE}(^{}),\] (8)

where \(D_{KL}()\) is the KL divergence, \(^{*}\) is the set of entity features of modality \(*\), and \(^{*}\) is the set of concatenated features of relation and modality \(*\). To unify features of one target modality and concatenated features of other modalities into a shared latent subspace, we minimize the distance of their latent representations as follows:

\[_{mse}=MSE(^{},^{ })+MSE(^{},^{}),\] (9)

where \(MSE()\) is the mean-square error. Through this operation, we can use \(^{}\) to approximate \(^{}\), and \(^{}\) to approximate \(^{}\). In the generation stage, we exploit the results of VAEs to complete the missing modality. We input the latent representation \(^{}\), \(^{}\) into the decoders \(p_{}^{}\,|\,^{}\), \(p_{}^{}\,|\,^{}\) to generate a pseudo feature \(}^{}\), \(}^{}\), respectively.

### Multi-Modal Commonality Enhancement

Generally, tenuous semantic associations between disparate modal representations of knowledge significantly hamper efforts toward inter-modal enhancement. In multi-modal tasks, semantic associations between different modalities are often utilized to mutually enhance features across modalities [50; 27]. If the semantic association is weak, mechanisms designed for interactions between different modalities may negatively impact overall performance, potentially resulting in performance worse than that of a single modality.

In this module, we enhance semantic associations between modalities by specially designing an inter-modal commonality enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints, thereby facilitating a more holistic understanding of the entity. Cross-attention architectures have been empirically substantiated to efficiently capture semantic associations between multiple modalities [38; 29]. Specifically, we consider two distinct modal features, denoted as \(\) and \(\). \(\) is designated as the query, while \(\) assumes the roles of both key and value within the attention. The attention mechanism computes a weighted sum over \(\), prioritizing elements that are most relevant to \(\). This process refines \(\) based on the commonality with \(\). The attention is defined as follows:

\[Att(,,)=softmax( ^{T}}{}),head_{j}=Att(_{j}^{Q },_{j}^{K},_{j}^{V}),\] (10)

\[MH(,)=Concat(head_{1},,head_{}) _{h}+_{h},\] (11)

where \(,\), \(\) denote the query, key and value respectively, \(softmax()\) is the activation function, \(d\) is the dimension of key, \(\) is the number of heads, \(_{j}^{Q}\), \(_{j}^{K}\), \(_{j}^{V}\) are projection matrices for \(j\)-th attention head, and \(_{h}\), \(_{h}\) are the projection matrix and bias vector.

Building upon this cross-attention, we concurrently extract the commonalities among relational, attribute, and visual modalities to enhance the overall representation. The operation is as follows:

\[^{+}\!=\!w_{}^{ }+w_{}MH_{}(^{},^{})+w_{}MH_{ }(^{},^{}),\] (12)

\[^{+}\!=\!w_{}^{}+w_{}MH_{}(^{ },^{})+w_{}MH_{}(^{},^{}),\] (13)

\[^{+}\!=\!w_{}^{}+w_{}MH_{}(^{}, ^{})+w_{}MH_{}( ^{},^{}),\] (14)

where \(w_{*\#}\), \(*,\#\{,,\}\) are learnable weights normalized by the Softmax, and \(MH_{*\#}(^{\#},^{*})\) is the result of multi-head cross-attention for commonality extraction between two modalities.

To amplify the commonalities among features, we additionally design an orthogonal constraint loss, which ensures the difference calculated by subtracting the commonality features from the original features, is dissimilar to the query features. For example, \(MH_{}(^{},^{})\) means the refined version of \(^{}\) highly relevant to \(^{}\). The difference can be calculated as \(^{}-MH_{}(^{}, ^{})\)representing the content within \(^{}\) that does not include any elements related to \(^{}\). Hence, it exhibits an orthogonal relationship with \(^{}\). The orthogonal constraint loss is defined as follows:

\[_{orth}(,)=(^{T})^{2}, _{d}(^{*},^{})=^{*}-MH _{*}(^{},^{*}),*, {\#}\{,,\},\] (15)

\[_{o}= _{orth}(_{d}(^{}, ^{}),^{})+_{orth}( _{d}(^{},^{}),^{})+_{orth}(_{d}(^{}, ^{}),^{})+\] (16) \[_{orth}(_{d}(^{}, ^{}),^{})+_{orth}( _{d}(^{},^{}),^{})+_{orth}(_{d}(^{}, ^{}),^{}),\]

where \(_{orth}()\) is the orthogonal constraint function, \(_{d}()\) is the calculation function of difference, \(_{o}\) is designed orthogonal constraint loss for commonality enhancement.

In this way, we can accentuate the commonalities between modalities to distill inter-modal correspondences for a more synergistic and semantically coherent representation.

### Model Optimization

Through the multi-modal knowledge learning in the prior three modules, we can obtain enhanced feature embeddings for relational, visual, and attribute modalities. By directly concatenating the enhanced features, we generate an integrated multi-modal representation of an entity as follows:

\[^{}=Concat(^{+},^{ +},^{+}),\] (17)

where \(_{}\) is the holistic enhanced entity embedding of entity \(e\).

To ensure that features of aligned entities from different MMKGs are more closely in the space and make the overall modeling more robust, we employ the multi-modal contrastive learning [6; 48] as our main optimization objective. Multi-modal contrastive learning contrasts the feature similarity of positive entity pairs with negative entity pairs, from multiple perspectives of holistic multi-modal representations and each uni-modal feature representation. Positive entity pairs refer to two aligned entities, and negative entity pairs refer to two unaligned entities. The main objective of optimization is defined as follows:

\[_{cl}(_{1}^{*},_{2}^{*})=_{( e_{1},e_{2}) H}(1-y)d^{2}(_{1}^{*},_{2}^{*})+y( _{cl}-d(_{1}^{*},_{2}^{*}),0)^{2},\] (18)

\[_{mcl}=_{cl}(_{1}^{},_{ 2}^{})+_{cl}(_{1}^{},_{ 2}^{})+_{cl}(_{1}^{},_{2}^ {})+_{cl}(_{1}^{},_{2}^ {}),\] (19)

where \(_{mcl}\) is the main objective of optimization, \(*\{,,,\}\) denotes the modality, \(_{1}^{*}\), \(_{2}^{*}\) are the sets of entity feature embeddings of modality \(*\) for \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\), \(H\) is the set of sampled entity pairs including positive and negative samples, \(d(,)\) is the function of cosine similarity, \(y\) is the indicator of whether an entity pair can be aligned, and \(_{cl}\) is the margin hyperparameter.

Combining all the designed losses above, the overall objective of optimization \(\) is as follows:

\[=_{TransE}+_{1}_{o}+_{mcl}+ _{v}+_{2}_{mse}.\] (20)

In training stage, we minimize \(\) and update the model parameters via the backpropagation. Owing to the high cost of manual annotations and the expansive scale of MMKGs, the availability of aligned entity pairs is frequently insufficient. Therefore, we adopt a bi-directional iterative strategy  based on the asymmetric nature of alignment directions to boost the training. The specific algorithm of this strategy is described in Appendix B.

## 5 Experiment

In this section, we provide extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. To begin, we offer a brief description of experimental setups. Next, the experimental results and analysis are presented to verify the effectiveness of TMEA. More details and results of experiments are provided in Appendix C.

### Experimental Setups

**Datasets.** Following previous studies [5; 20], we selected two commonly used public datasets, namely FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K , and allocated 20% of the aligned entity pairs as training data. These datasets contain two pairs of aligned MMKGs with relational, attribute, and visual knowledge.

**Evaluation Metrics.** We assessed the alignment probability between entities from different MMKGs based on cosine similarity calculation. Then, we chose H@N (Hits@N), MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank), and MR (Mean Rank) as metrics to evaluate all the models. A higher value for H@N and MRR indicates better performance, whereas a lower value for MR suggests the same.

**Compared Methods** We benchmarked TMEA against a selection of both representative and state-of-the-art approaches. _For traditional KGs_: IPTransE , GCN-Align , BootEA , SEA , RAC , PEEA , and MixTEA . _For MMKGs_: PoE , MMEA , EVA , MSNEA , MCLEA , ACK-MMEA , and MoAlign .

### Performance Comparison

We compared TMEA with several representative and state-of-the-art baselines for multi-modal entity alignment task on FB15K-DB15K and FB15K-YG15K datasets. Table 1 shows the performance of all methods with 20% aligned entity pairs for training. Overall, our proposed TMEA achieves the best performance on both datasets. Specifically, we have the following findings. First, TMEA exhibits significant improvements with a notable margin compared to not only traditional but also multi-modal methods. Compared to the strongest traditional alignment method, BootEA, TMEA achieves at least a 168.4%, 63.0%, and 118.3% improvement in H@1, H@10, and MRR on two datasets, respectively. When assessed against the leading multi-modal method, MSNEA, TMEA attained at least a 32.8%, 16.3%, and 26.4% increase in H@1, H@10, and MRR, respectively. Besides, we test the statistical significance and the results suggest TMEA has significant improvements (\(p\)-\(value<0.001\)) over baselines. Second, comparing multi-modal entity alignment methods to traditional ones, we observe a clear advantage in favor of multi-modal approaches in most cases. TMEA, MSNEA, and MCLEA surpass all traditional approaches, which suggests the effect of leveraging the rich and varied information that multi-modal knowledge provides. This additional context and modeling allow for a more comprehensive depiction of entity features, facilitating a more accurate determination of potential alignments. Third, our TMEA method, leveraging only 20% of aligned entity pairs for training, achieves a remarkable H@10 score of 0.944 and 0.916 on two datasets. This large margin of superiority over other multi-modal entity alignment methods can be attributed to the considering and effective tackling of uncertain correspondences in the alignment process. By addressing these inherent issues, TMEA is demonstrated to enhance the precision and reliability of entity alignment for MMKGs.

### Ablation Study

To verify the influence of each part in TMEA, we conducted two sets of ablation studies, one set for modality ablation and another for component ablation.

modules MMI and MCE, w/o \(_{o}\) and w/o \(_{mse}\) are the removal of constraint losses, w/o AP denotes the absence of preprocessing for attribute knowledge, and w/o IT indicates the exclusion of the iterative strategy. Table 2 shows the results of ablation study, demonstrating the effectiveness of each part in TMEA. In the results of the modality ablation study, it is evident across both datasets that each modality's features apparently contribute to the improvement of entity alignment performance. Furthermore, the most effective modality varies across datasets, which may depend on factors such as data sparsity or noise. Regarding the results of component ablation, the effectiveness of each designed component is validated. First, the considerable drop in performance without MCE module (w/o MCE) underscores the capability of MCE module to bolster the commonality among modalities, mitigating the impact of weak semantic associations. Second, the marked deterioration in performance without attribute preprocessing (w/o AP) verifies the effect of integrating the LLM and in-context learning into filtering and abstract sentence embedding. Third, removing MMI module (w/o MMI) leads to an increase in the MR metric, and the effect is different on two datasets, indicating that the effectiveness of MMI module is contingent on the proportion of missing modalities within the dataset. Last, the absence of the iterative strategy (w/o IT) highlights the strategy's role in boosting the robustness of the model, as evidenced by a marked deterioration in MR upon its removal.

### Modality Sensitivity Analysis

In MMKGs, entities often lack certain modalities of knowledge. Therefore, we address the missing modalities for entities in MMI module. To validate the ability of TMEA to maintain robust performance with missing modalities, we compared TMEA with the strongest baseline, MSNEA, under varying ratios of missing modal knowledge. Figure 3 presents the results of TMEA and MSNEA under scenarios with 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 100% entities having visual and attribute modalities on FB15K-DB15K, respectively. We observe that TMEA outperforms MSNEA at different ratios obviously. In scenarios with missing visual modality, TMEA exhibits a slower performance decline compared to MSNEA. Moreover, when only 20% of entities have visual modality, TMEA achieves an MRR exceeding 0.5, while MSNEA falls below 0.4. For missing attribute modality, both TMEA and MSNEA show a relatively minor performance decline. With only 20% of entities having attribute modality, TMEA achieves an MRR and H@1 close to 0.8. MSNEA remains relatively unchanged across different proportions due to its insufficient attribute learning of adaptive weights, even with a substantial number of attribute features that only yield marginal improvements. This also indicates that our attribute knowledge encoder more efficiently and fully leverages the semantics of attributes.

### Label Dependency Analysis

The availability of aligned entity pairs is frequently insufficient. Importantly, the effective and sufficient exploitation of multi-modal knowledge can significantly mitigate the dependency of methods on alignment labels during training. For the purpose of assessing these methods' reliance on the

quantity of aligned entity pairs, we conducted a series of experiments to train the models using 20%, 50%, and 80% aligned entity pairs. Figure 4 shows the comparison results of all multi-modal entity alignment methods. From the overview, TMEA provides an obviously leading performance with different proportions of training data. Only TMEA achieves H@1, H@10, and MRR scores above 0.8 across various percentages. Moreover, its performance does not show a clear decline even with the reduction of training data proportions, unlike the majority of methods that experience a marked loss in performance. For instance, ACK-MMEA and MoAlign achieve lower H@10 and MRR scores than MCLEA with 50% of training data, yet surpass MCLEA when the training data is increased to 80% on FB15K-YG15K. This indicates their strong dependency on aligned entity pairs. When the aligned sample pairs reach 80%, even though the performance of TMEA and MSNEA on the H@10 metric appears to be close, there is still a noticeable difference in MRR and H@1. This suggests that MSNEA performs poorly in aligning difficult samples.

## 6 Conclusion

In this paper, we proposed a novel TMEA to tackle uncertain correspondences between inter-modal or intra-modal cues of entities for multi-modal entity alignment. Specifically, we first developed a Multi-modal Knowledge Encoder (MKE) module to encode relational, attribute, and visual knowledge into their preliminary feature representations. In MKE, to address the diversity of descriptive manners of attribute knowledge, we particularly designed alignment-augmented abstract representation that incorporated the LLM and in-context learning into attribute alignment and filtering for generating and embedding the attribute abstract. To mitigate the influence of the modality absence, we devised a Missing Modality Imputation (MMI) module to complete the missing modality by unifying diverse modalities into a shared latent subspace and generating a pseudo feature via VAEs based on existing modal features. For enhancing the semantic associations between modalities, we invented an inter-modal community enhancement mechanism based on cross-attention with orthogonal constraints in Multi-modal Commonality Enhancement (MCE) module. Finally, extensive experiments on two real-world datasets were conducted to verify the effectiveness of TMEA with a significant improvement over competitive baselines.
