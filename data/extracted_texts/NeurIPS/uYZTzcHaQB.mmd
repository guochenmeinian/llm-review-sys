###### Abstract

The _influence maximization (IM)_ problem aims to identify a budgeted set of nodes with the highest potential to influence the largest number of users in a cascade model, a key challenge in viral marketing. Traditional _IM_ approaches consider each user/node independently as a potential target customer. However, in many scenarios, the target customers comprise motifs, where activating only one or a few users within a motif is insufficient for effective viral marketing, which, nevertheless, receives little attention. For instance, if a motif of three friends planning to dine together, targeting all three simultaneously is crucial for a restaurant advertisement to succeed. In this paper, we address the motif-oriented influence maximization problem under the linear threshold model. We prove that the motif-oriented IM problem is NP-hard and that the influence function is neither supermodular nor submodular, in contrast to the classical _IM_ setting. To simplify the problem, we establish the submodular upper and lower bounds for the influence function. By leveraging the submodular property, we propose a natural greedy strategy that simultaneously maximizes both bounds. Our algorithm has an approximation ratio of \((1-1/e-)\) and a near-linear time complexity of \(O((k+l)(m+)/^{2})\). Experimental results on diverse datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach in motif maximization.

## 1 Introduction

The utilization of "word-of-mouth" and "viral marketing" techniques has become prevalent in the promotion of new products. In social networks, "viral marketing" is implemented by selecting highlyinfluential users as initial adopters [1; 2]. The ultimate goal of this strategy is to trigger widespread adoption of products along social connections, i.e., "_influence maximization (IM)_" problem . _IM_ serves as a key research problem in network analysis and has received significant attention due to its commercial applications [4; 5; 6]. While most studies perceive each user as a potential target consumer, our paper aims to explore a more general _IM_ problem where the target consumers are represented as motifs, each motif consisting of multiple users [7; 8]. In this scenario, activating only one (or a few) users within a motif may prove ineffective for viral marketing.

Consider the following scenario: A restaurant seeks to attract customers through viral marketing on social networks. In this scenario, a motif of \(k\) friends plans to dine together, and they have three different underlying mechanisms for choosing a restaurant: (a) One user already knows a restaurant and recommends it to others in the motif. Therefore, targeting only one user is sufficient for advertising the restaurant. (b) All users in the group must agree on the restaurant choice, requiring the advertisement to activate every member in the motif. (c) The decision is made through voting, with the restaurant chosen if more than half users in the motif agree. To maximize restaurant profits, advertisements should target entire motifs rather than individual users in social networks. Similar situations arise in other group decision-making scenarios, such as anonymous voting, family parties, and group tours [9; 10; 11]. When it comes to viral marketing aimed at motif consumers, maximizing the number of ultimate activated motifs is the explicit purpose for the _IM_, called motif-oriented IM.

The motif-oriented _IM_ model differs from the classical _IM_ in two key aspects: (a) A user can belong to multiple motifs and consume a product multiple times. (b) Activating the most users in the classical _IM_ may only trigger a few motifs, while activating most motifs might require fewer users than that of the classical _IM_. These factors present challenges in designing an effective strategy to determine the seed nodes. Note that some works investigate the group-oriented _IM_, which is different from our motif-based _IM_. Motifs are the function units of a graph [7; 8] and users are mutually connected within a motif. Whereas users may be not connected (or partially reachable) in groups. In the paper, we provide an efficient solution for motif-based _IM_ with a guaranteed approximation ratio.

This paper introduces an algorithm by optimizing the **l**ower and upper **b**ound of the **m**otif-**o**riented **influence **m**aximization (LBMOIM) to determine a budget set of seed nodes, aiming to maximize the number of activated motifs in social networks under the linear threshold model. In our model, each motif is associated with a threshold number \(r_{i}\), and if the number of activated nodes in the motif exceeds \(r_{i}\), the motif is called activated; otherwise, it remains inactive. Particularly, \(r_{i}=\{1,k,k/2\}\) represents the three different restaurant determination scenarios introduced above. We define the target motif influence as the count of activated motifs. We find that the influence function is monotone, but is neither submodular nor supermodular, making direct optimization challenging. To address this, we establish the lower and upper bounds for the influence function for different \(r_{i}\). The two bounds represent the weighted node-level influence function and both are monotone and submodular. We use a greedy algorithm to optimize the two bounds simultaneously to select the best seed nodes. Experiments in various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our algorithm. In addition, our study demonstrates that LBMOIM can be expanded to accommodate various diffusion models .We introduce a modified version of LBMOIM for the independent cascade model. We provide evidence to confirm the applicability of LBMOIM in different cascade models.

## 2 Related work

_Node-level influence maximization._ Kempe et al.  first introduced an algorithmic study on the _IM_ problem, demonstrating its NP-hardness in general cases. They proposed a greedy algorithm that can approximate an approximation ratio of \(1-1/e\) with time complexity of \(O(knmr)\). The major time-consuming step is the generation of Monte Carlo samples. To address this, various methods have been proposed to utilize _reverse reachable_ (RR) sets rather than Monte Carlo simulation to reduce the time complexity without sacrificing the performance accuracy. These include the IMM , SSA , TIM , and OPTIM-C  techniques. More recently, Guo et al.  devised an efficient RR set generation approach that decreases the sampling time for each RR set. Hao et al.  propose a novel and effective framework for popularity maximization, designed to address the challenges of advertising competition. In the last few years, deep learning-based methods have emerged as alternative solutions. Fan et al.  introduced a deep reinforcement learning framework that learns the graph representation and sequentially selects key nodes one at each step. Ling et al.  developed a novel framework to generate latent representations of node sets and determine the best node set only in a single step, in which the complex interactions among key nodes are encoded in the latent representations. Besides, there exist some other IM variants, such as time-critical IM , robustness IM [20; 21], online IM , and so on [23; 24].

_Group-level influence maximization._ Group-level influence maximization is an emerging field within social network analysis [9; 25; 11]. Groups refer to communities, cliques, and motifs, other kinds of subgraphs. The group-level influence maximization is to pinpoint influential nodes capable of triggering the most groups. Zhu et al. [9; 26; 27] have introduced the problem aimed at selecting key nodes to maximize the number of activated groups. They have also proven the NP-hardness of this problem and provided upper and lower bounds for the objective function. However, it is important to note that the lower bounds are dependent on the graph structure. Nguyen et al.  have proposed a method for identifying key nodes that exert influence over the largest number of communities. Zhong et al. [29; 30] have developed a heuristic approach to maximize the number of activated groups and have empirically demonstrated its effectiveness. Phuong et al. [31; 32] have minimized the cost of group influence maximization in social networks. However, we still lack an effective method to guarantee the approximation ratio of motif influence maximization.

Our study draws parallels with the group influence optimization in references  and . However, our work stands out from prior studies through the following innovative contributions: (a) We first propose the motif-oriented influence maximization under the linear threshold model and explore the unique properties of this problem, which differ from traditional groups in a graph. (b) We propose both upper and lower bounds for the motif-oriented objective function. The two bounds share the same formalisms and can be optimized simultaneously, unlike previous solutions of group-oriented _IM_ where the two bounds are different and cannot achieve the optimal solution simultaneously. (c) In contrast to previous heuristic approaches that cannot guarantee performance, we present a rapid algorithm that guarantees an approximation ratio. Therefore, our paper provides a viable approach to maximize motif-oriented influence in large graphs.

## 3 Problem definition

Let \(G=(V,E)\) be a directed graph \(G\) with \(n\) nodes and \(m\) edges, where a node \(v V\) represents a user and an edge \((u,v) E\) represents the connection between users. \((u,v) E\) means that there is a directed edge from node \(u\) to \(v\). Each edge \((u,v) E\) is associated with a weight \(p(u,v)\). Given a subset of nodes \(S V\), denoted as initial activated seeds, we consider the following cascade process \(\) that allows for both the Linear Threshold (LT) and Independent Cascade (IC) models:

* Initially, all nodes in set \(S\) are activated and the other nodes are inactive.
* At each time step, when a node is activated, it has the opportunity to activate its out-neighbors in the following time step: Each node can activate its out-neighbors only once; Once a node is activated, it will remain active in the subsequent time steps.
* The cascade process terminates when there are no further nodes that can be activated.

Let \(I_{C}(S)\) be the number of activated nodes for an instance \(C\) of the above cascade process \(\) on condition that \(S\) is the initial seed node set. We denote \(_{}(S)=_{}[I_{C}(S)]\) as the expected influence of \(S\) under \(\). The traditional IM aims to find the best \(S\) to maximize \(_{}(S)\). Here, we use motifs as the targeted customers for advertisements. We define a motif as a strongly connected subgraph:

**Definition 1(Motif definition)**. Given a subset of nodes \(g\) in a graph, if there exist mutual paths between any pair of nodes in \(g\), such that the paths only traverse the nodes within \(g\), we denote \(g\) as a motif(strongly connected group).

Roughly speaking, a motif refers to a small, strongly connected set of nodes, distinct from the strongly connected giant component of a graph. Motifs are commonly regarded as the fundamental functional units within graphs, a concept widely studied in the field of network science [27; 8]. In order to facilitate group decision-making, it is essential that nodes within a motif have mutual accessibility, i.e., strongly connected. This requirement aligns well with various real-life scenarios. Establishing an acquaintance chain becomes indispensable to coordinate the activity occurring within the group.

Let \(=\{g_{1},g_{2},...,g_{h}\}\) be the targeted motifs set. Let \((v)=1(0)\) denote whether node \(v\) is activated or not and \((g_{i},r_{i})=1(0)\) denote whether motif \(g_{i}\) is activated or not. Specifically, \((g_{i},r_{i})=1\) indicates that there are more than \(r_{i}\) activated nodes within motif \(g_{i}\) (i.e., the motif is activated), while \((g_{i},r_{i})=0\) indicates that the number of activated nodes in motif \(g_{i}\) is less than \(r_{i}\). Now, let's define \(I_{C}^{^{}}(S)\) as the number of activated motifs resulting from an instance \(C\), given that \(S\) represents the initial seed nodes, \(I_{C}^{^{}}(S)=_{i=1}^{h}(g_{i},r_{i})\). In viral marketing, motifs of different sizes bring about different profits, hence a general motif-oriented influence function is the weighted number of activated motifs, \(I_{C}^{}(S)=_{i=1}^{h}w_{i}(g_{i},r_{i})\), where \(w_{i} 0\) is the weight of motif \(i\). Additionally, we denote \(_{}{}^{}(S)=_{}[I_{C}^{ }(S)]\) as the expected weighted influence of seed nodes \(S\) under the cascade process \(\). Hence the problem in the paper is formalized as:

**Problem Definition 1(Motif-oriented influence maximization)**. Given a graph \(G\), a cascade model \(\), and an integer \(k\), the **Motif-Oriented Influence Maximization** (MOIM) asks for a size-\(k\) seed set with the largest expected activated motifs, i.e.,

\[S_{k}=argmax_{S:|S|=k}_{}{}^{}(S).\] (1)

**Cascade Models**: Our paper primarily focuses on the analysis of the LT model. The LT model requires that \(_{u}p(u,v) 1\). In the LT model, each node is associated with a uniformly random threshold \(_{v}\). When a node \(v\) is inactive at time \(t\), it will become active at time \(t+1\) on condition that \(_{u A_{v}}p(u,v)(u)_{v}\), where \(A_{v}\) represents the activated in-neighbors of node \(v\). Notably, our findings are not limited to the LT model and can be extended to the IC model and the triggering model, which will be discussed in Section 5.

## 4 Complexity analysis of MOIM

**Theorem 1.** The MOIM problem is NP-hard for the linear threshold model.

_Proof._ Given that the classical IM problem can be treated as a particular case of MOIM where each motif consists of a single node, since the classical IM problem is NP-hard , MOIM is also an NP-hard problem. Strict proof details are shown in the appendix C. \(\)

**Theorem 2.** The MOIM problem is neither submodular nor supermodular.

_Proof._ We present two illustrative examples to demonstrate the non-submodular and non-supermodular properties. The submodular property states that the marginal gain of adding a node to a set of more seed nodes should decrease. More formally, for any two sets of nodes \(S,T(S T)\), and a node \(v(v T)\), the inequality \(_{}(S\{v\})-_{}(S)_ {}(T\{v\})-_{}(T)\) should hold.

Case 1: We consider a graph with four nodes and a target motif as shown in Fig. 1(a). When the seed nodes are \(S_{1}=\{1\}\) (or \(\{2\}\)), the expected activated motif is \(_{}(S_{1})=p(1-p)\). On the other hand, when the seed nodes are \(T=\{1,2\}\), the expected activated motif is \(_{}(T)=2p(1-p)+(1-p)^{3}\). As \(p 0\), we observe that \(_{}(\{1\})-_{}() =_{}(S_{1})<_{}(\{1,2\})-_ {}(\{2\})\). Consequently, the MOIM model fails to satisfy the submodular property.

Case 2: We examine the MOIM problem under the specific scenario where a node represents a motif. In this case, the MOIM problem is degenerated into the classical IM problem. Notably, the marginal gain of seed nodes in the IM problem satisfies the submodular property. However, as a result of this reduction, the general MOIM model no longer adheres to the supermodular property.

Combining the two cases, we arrive at the theorem. \(\)

## 5 The proposed solution

### The upper and lower bounds of the objective function

Given that the objective function of \(_{}{}^{}(S)\) does not exhibit submodular or supermodular properties, a feasible approach is to optimize the upper and lower bounds of \(_{}{}^{}(S)\), i.e., the sandwich strategy. The central issue of the sandwich strategy is to obtain the upper and lower bounds. Thus, in the subsequent sections, we consider two cases and derive the upper and lower bounds of \(_{}{}^{}(S)\).

Case 1 (\(r_{i}=1\)): We first consider the IM example in Fig. 1(a) and the scenario where \(r_{i}=1, i=1,2,...,h\). In this case, a motif will be activated if at least one node within the motif is activated. To account for this, we introduce a super node for each motif, as shown in Fig. 1(b). Every node within a motif is then connected to its corresponding super node with an activation probability of \(p=1\) in Fig. 1(b). The activation of the super node follows the independent cascade model, meaning that the super node is activated if at least one node within the motif is activated.

Let \(T\) represent the set of super nodes, \(|T|=h\), and define \((S)=_{}[_{a T}w_{i}(a)]\) as the expected number of activated super nodes weighted by the respective weights \(w_{i}\), given the initially activated seeds \(S\) (\(S T\)). The expectation of activated motifs can then be represented as \(_{}{}^{}(S)=(S)\).

**Remark 1**. When \(r_{i}=1\), the MOIM problem can be reformulated as the modified IM problem, which seeks to determine the optimal seed set \(S\) for maximizing the activation of the designated super node set \(T\). Besides, one node may connect to equal or more than two supper nodes.

Case 2 (\(r_{i}>1\)): We divide the cascade process into two stages for the convenience of analysis: Given a motif \(g_{i}\), the cascade first occurs along the edges outside the motif \(g_{i}\), and then the cascade occurs between nodes within the motif \(g_{i}\). Let \(P_{out}(S,g_{i},A)\) be the joint distribution of the activated node subset \(A\) (\(A g_{i},A\)) in the cascade stage. In the first stage, when the number of activated nodes \(|A|\) is less than \(r_{i}\), in order to ensure the activation of motif \(g_{i}\), there must be at least \(r_{i}-|A|\) active edges connecting the activated nodes in \(A\) and the inactive nodes in \(g_{i} A\).

We define a "semi \(d\)-spanning tree starting from node set \(A\)" as a subset of edges within the motif \(g_{i}\) that connect nodes in \(A\) and \(d\) other nodes in \(g_{i}\) without forming any cycles, denoted as \(E_{d}(A)\). Fig. 1(c) illustrates an example of a semi \(5\)-spanning tree starting from the node set \(A=\{7\}\). Let \(P(E_{d}(A))=_{(u,v) E_{d}(A)}p(u,v)\), and \(P(E_{d}(A))\) represents the realization probability that the edges in set \(E_{d}(A)\) are concurrently activated in the cascade. If \(E_{d}(A)\) is empty, we then set \(P(E_{d}(A))=1\). Let \(P(E_{d}^{(i)})_{min}\) represent the minimal value of \(P(E_{d}(A))\) for semi \(d\)-spanning tree in the motif \(g_{i}\). The activation probability of motif \(g_{i}\) is given by:

\[Pr[(g_{i},r_{i})=1]=_{A}_{d,d r_{i}- |A|}P_{out}(S,g_{i},A) P(E_{d}(A))\] \[_{A}_{d,d r_{i}-|A|}P_{out}(S,g_{i}, A) P(E_{d}^{(i)})_{min}.\] (2)

Since \(A\) and \(d r_{i}-1\), we have \(P(E_{d}^{(i)})_{min} P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min}\). Additionally, it is worth noting that \(Pr[(g_{i},1)=1]=_{A}P_{out}(S,g_{i},A)\) represents the probability that at least one node in motif \(g_{i}\) is activated by the outside nodes of \(g_{i}\). Thus, we have:

\[Pr[(g_{i},r_{i})=1] _{A}_{d,d r_{i}-|A|}P_{out}(S,g_{i}, A) P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min}\] \[ P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min} Pr[(g_{i},1)=1].\] (3)

Recalling that \((S)=_{}[_{a T}w_{i}(a)]\) represents the expected number of activated super nodes weighted by the weights \(w_{i},i=1,2,...,h\). let \(w_{i}^{}=w_{i} P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min}\), \(=min\{P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min},i=1,2,...,h\}\), \(_{1}(S)=_{}[_{a T}w_{i}^{}(a)]\), and \(_{2}(S)=(S)\). we have the following theorem:

Figure 1: (a) An example of a graph containing only one motif. Nodes 1 and 2 are the candidate seed nodes. (b) A super node example(labeled \(a\)) for a motif, which connects to two nodes labeled 2 and 4. (c) 5-spanning tree example (see blue edges).

**Theorem 3(Upper and lower bounds)**. \((S)\) is the upper bound of \(_{^{}}(S)\); \(_{1}(S)\) and \(_{2}(S)\) are two lower bounds of \(_{^{}}(S)\), \(_{2}(S)_{1}(S)_{^{ }}(S)(S)\). Besides, \(_{2}(S)=(S)\).

_Proof_: Since \(Pr[(g_{i},r_{i})] Pr[(g_{i},1)]\) and \(w_{i}\), \(_{^{}}(S)=_{}[_{i}w_{ i}(g_{i},r_{i})]_{}[_{i}w_{i}(g_{i},1)]=(S)\). Hence, \((S)\) is the upper bound of \(_{^{}}(S)\).

Based on Eq. 3, \(_{^{}}(S)=_{}[_{i}w_{ i}(g_{i},r_{i})]_{i}w_{i}(P(E_{r_{i}-1}^{(i)})_{min} Pr[(g_{i},1 )=1])_{1}(S)_{i}w_{i}( Pr[(g_{i},1)=1])= _{2}(S)\).\(\)

### The proposed algorithm LBMOIM

It is noticed that \((S)\), \(_{1}(S)\), and \(_{2}(S)\) share the similar formalism. In the section, we focus on optimizing \((S)\) to calculate the best seeds, which is also capable for \(_{1}(S)\) and \(_{2}(S)\).

**Node selection based on RR set:** In Algorithm 1, we determine the optimal seeds by optimizing the upper and lower bounds. Initially, a certain number \(\) of RR sets are generated (lines 2-6), followed by the standard greedy algorithm to generate a set \(S_{k}^{*}\) of size-\(k\) nodes that covers the maximum number of RR sets in \(\) (lines 7-10). The method is similar to the node-level IM solution (see Appendix A). The only difference is the probability of choosing root nodes in the generation of RR set. The key problem of Algorithm 1 is determining the number \(\). Let \(\) denote the set of all RR sets generated by randomly selecting a super node \(v\) with a probability of \(}{}\), where \(=_{j}w_{j}\). Let \(F_{R}(S)\) be the fraction of RR sets in \(\) covered by \(S\). We have the following lemma:

**Lemma 1**. Assume that \(\) follows

\[(8+2)}+log2 }{OPT^{2}}.\] (4)

Then, for any size-\(k\) set of seeds, the following inequality holds with at least probability \(1-^{l}/\):

\[| F_{}(S)-(S)|< OPT,\] (5)

where \(OPT\) means the best-activated motif expectation of size-\(k\) seeds.

_Proof_: Comparing to Eq. 7, the only difference is replacing \(n\) by \(\) in Eq. 4 because we have \(\) weighted target motifs in our task. Since the modification doesn't influence the proof derivation in reference , please see reference  for the details. \(\)

**Theorem 4 **. Given a \(\) that satisfies Eq. 4, Algorithm 1 returns a \((1-1/e-)\)-approximate solution with at least probability \(1-^{-l}\).

_Proof_: Please see reference  for the details. \(\)

**Parameter estimation**: The major problem lies in the prior evaluation of \(OPT\). To differentiate it from classical IM, we denote the optimal value as \(OPT_{}=max\{(S),|S|=k\}\). In this part, we evaluate the parameters \(\) and \(OPT_{}\). We generalize the estimation of \(OPT\) in TIM  to weighted influence function to estimate a lower bound of \(OPT_{}\), denoted as \(KPT\) (see Algorithm 3 in appendix B). We could estimate \(KPT\) in Algorithm 3\(KPT^{*}[KPT/4,OPT_{}]\) with a probability of at least \(1-^{-l}\) and expected time complexity of \(O(l(m+)log)\) (see the proof in appendix B).

We present Algorithm 2, which optimizes the **L**ower **B**ound of MOIM objective function (LBMOIM) to calculate the best nodes. In Algorithm 2, we initially assess the value of \(\) (lines 1-2) and subsequently compute the best nodes (line 3). Optimizing the lower bound \(_{2}(S)\) also is equivalent to the optimization of the upper bound \((S)\), and hence we do not differentiate them and omit them.

**Lemma 2(time complexity)**. The time complexity of Algorithm 2 is \(O((k+l)(m+)/^{2})\).

_Proof_: Please see the appendix C for the proof details. \(\)

**Lemma 3(Approximation confidence)**. In Algorithm 2, the \(S^{*}\) is \((1-1/e-)\)-approximate solution with a probability of at least \(1-2^{-l}\).

_Proof:_ Given that the objective function \((S)\) is a weighted version of the IM problem that satisfies the submodular property, the greedy algorithm is capable of producing a \((1-1/e-)\)-approximate

methods such as TIM+, OPIM, and DeepIM, which have different target objective functions, also cannot achieve the best performance under the IC model.

**Results of time consumption:** The time consumption of different approaches is compared in Fig. 6. Specifically, the comparison focuses on GIM, GIA, and LBMOIM, as these methods exclusively optimize motif coverage. GIM exhibits the highest time consumption due to the need to optimize two node-level objective functions, in contrast to the other two methods which only optimizes a single objective function. Importantly, it should be noted that the time consumption of our proposed method exhibits a minor increase with respect to \(k\), demonstrating its scalability when applied to large graphs. This observation aligns with the time complexity analysis in Lemma 2.

## 7 Conclusion

In this paper, we have addressed the motif-oriented influence maximization (MOIM) problem. To tackle the non-supermodular and non-submodular MOIM objective function, we have derived simplified submodular upper and lower bounds that make the problem more tractable. We further propose an efficient algorithm capable of optimizing these bounds. The algorithm runs in expected time of \(O((k+l)(m+)/^{2})\) and achieves an approximation ratio of \((1-1/e-)\). We experimentally evaluate our method against the state-of-the-art methods on large real-world social networks using the LT and IC models. Our results consistently demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both motif influence and computational efficiency. These findings highlight the potential value of motif-oriented approaches in viral marketing and social influence scenarios.

In future work, we plan to delve deeper into the intricate structural properties of the motif influence function, aiming to uncover new insights into its mathematical behavior and relationships. This includes exploring more refined and tighter bounds that can guide the development of algorithms with improved performance guarantees. Additionally, we intend to extend our investigation to handle more complex motifs across diverse and heterogeneous network structures, where interactions are dynamic or context-dependent.
