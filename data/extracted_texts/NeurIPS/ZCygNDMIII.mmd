###### Abstract

Internet of Things (IoT) sensing models often suffer from overfitting due to data distribution shifts between training dataset and real-world scenarios. To address this, data augmentation techniques have been adopted to enhance model robustness by bolstering the diversity of synthetic samples within a defined vicinity of existing samples. This paper introduces a novel paradigm of data augmentation for IoT sensing signals by adding fine-grained control to generative models. We define a metric space with statistical metrics that capture the essential features of the short-time Fourier transformed (STFT) spectrograms of IoT sensing signals. These metrics serve as strong conditions for a generative model, enabling us to tailor the spectrogram characteristics in the time-frequency domain according to specific application needs. Furthermore, we propose a set of data augmentation techniques within this metric space to create new data samples. Our method is evaluated across various generative models, datasets, and downstream IoT sensing models. The results demonstrate that our approach surpasses the conventional transformation-based data augmentation techniques and prior generative data augmentation models.

## 1 Introduction

IoT sensing applications aim to detect physical world phenomena in specific environments through time-series data captured by sensors, such as inertial, acoustic, and bioelectrical signals. Given the wide variety of real-world conditions, IoT sensing models often face potential domain shifts and unpredictable variations when deployed . Additionally, collecting and labeling IoT sensing data is expensive because sensing signals are harder for annotators to interpret compared to images, videos, and natural language . Consequently, enhancing model robustness across diverse scenarios with minimal collection overhead becomes a key research focus in the IoT field .

A spectrum of data augmentation techniques has been proposed to reduce the need for extensive data collection. The objective is to diversify existing datasets while preserving a plausible data distribution. Conventional data augmentation methods for IoT sensing signals generally apply manually-crafted transformations to create different perspectives of the same sample . Typical transformations include operations in the time domain (such as jittering, rescaling, rotation, and cropping)  and the frequency domain (such as spectral flipping, warping, and masking) . They are designed to modify the original data to reflect possible real-world variations, guided by domain knowledge in IoT. However, those transformations can be overly simplistic, failing to capture thenuanced low-level features of realistic IoT signal variance. The resultant artifacts may compromise the authenticity of the synthetic samples, thus offering limited benefits for downstream tasks.

Generative data augmentation techniques have recently been introduced to synthesize highly realistic IoT sensing data , such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) , generative adversarial networks (GANs) , and diffusion models . These techniques use inherent labels, such as activity types in human activity recognition (HAR) and vehicle types in vehicle detection tasks as conditions, for generating data. This process creates new samples with diverse characteristics under the same label, thereby enriching the variety of the training dataset. Despite advances in generating high quality signals, most existing works, if not all, fail to incorporate domain knowledge to guide the generation process, often treating generative models as a black-box.

In this paper, we introduce a novel data augmentation paradigm for IoT sensing data that combines domain knowledge control with generative data augmentation methods to advance the synthesis capabilities. We argue that a generative model with fine-grained control over the human-interpretable characteristics of IoT sensing signals can enhance the data augmentation effectiveness on downstream tasks. Our approach begins by leveraging domain expertise in IoT sensing to extract a set of statistical metrics in the time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain, which represent the essential aspects of IoT sensing signals. We call the resultant space determined by those statistical metrics as _metric space_. Subsequently, we develop a suite of data augmentation techniques designed to operate within the metric space.

In Figure 1, we illustrate an application example of our method. Given real data of moderate running in human activity recognition task, we speculate the potential real-world variations of running behaviors and leverage domain knowledge to derive the changes of statistical metrics accordingly. These metrics serve as conditions for a generative neural network to guide the synthetic data generation of other running styles like energetic, cautious and on varied terrain. The generated data is then utilized to augment the original dataset, thereby improving the robustness of downstream IoT sensing model. The strength of our paradigm comes from the precise control over the generation process via the metric space, while ensuring the authenticity of the generated samples through the generative model.

Empirically, we validate the versatility of our augmentation approach with various generative model backbones including a diffusion model and a VAE. We test our approach in three distinct IoT sensing applications: wearable-based human activity recognition, seismic and acoustic-based vehicle detection, and EEG-based harmful brain activity recognition. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms conventional and generative data augmentations across various downstream models in all the evaluated sensing tasks.

## 2 Related Work

**Traditional Data Augmentation for IoT Sensing.** Many traditional data augmentation methods rely on manually crafted transformations to enhance dataset diversity. As IoT sensing signals typically

involve temporal dynamics while exhibiting periodical patterns, transformations are designed in both time domain [58; 12; 29; 39; 50] and frequency domain [58; 11; 38]. Implementing these augmentation techniques requires specific domain knowledge to determine the variation range that can enhance data diversity without compromising relevance to the intended task. Another data augmentation approach involves similarity interpolation, where new samples are created by interpolating between existing samples, maintaining task invariance in the generated outputs. Data space interpolation techniques, which interpolate directly between raw data samples, have been proposed [5; 63; 37]. Additionally, there has been research on feature space interpolation, which occurs after data has been embedded into latent representations [10; 3; 35]. A primary challenge for this line of work lies in the synthetic data quality. The transformations often represent straightforward, linear variations and may introduce artifacts that reduce the realism of the generated data.

**Generative Data Augmentation for IoT Sensing.** Generative data augmentation utilizes generative models to create varied data [48; 60; 64]. These models, including GANs [49; 31; 6], VAEs [36; 14; 53], and diffusion models [43; 44; 57], generate authentic samples that improve the performance of downstream models and significantly lower the costs associated with collecting real data. However, these prior work treat the generative model as a black box, using it to sample from the learned data distribution with minimal control, typically only conditioned by the inherent labels from the dataset. The lost of control makes the generated results unpredictable, and loses the chance to benefit from domain insights and prior experience. This work is inspired by prior research on conditional generation for human speech and singing signals [25; 4; 16; 33]. In these studies, fine-grained conditions in vocal and/or linguistic features are applied to control acoustic signal generation. However, unlike human speech, IoT sensing time series data carries entirely different semantics and encompasses a broader range of modalities. Condition space interpolation involves the application of interpolation techniques within a condition space, which is constituted by statistical metrics. These augmented metrics are then fed into a generative model to synthesize varied data. Our work significantly advances prior research by redesigning the metric space and enhancing data augmentation techniques within it. We also perform extensive evaluations across diverse generative models and IoT sensing tasks, resulting in a more general data augmentation framework.

## 3 Method

### Overview

As shown in Figure 2, our fine-grained controllable generative data augmentation has three stages.

In Stage 1, we extract the predefined spectrogram metrics that reflect the critical characteristics of IoT sensing spectrograms. The selection of these metrics is based on domain knowledge in general IoT sensing, capturing essential facets in the IoT signal semantics. These metrics together define the _metric space_ that conditions the subsequent generative model.

In Stage 2, the metric values, along with the class label, are embedded into a condition tensor. This tensor then conditions the training of the generative model, guiding it to synthesize spectrograms that adhere to the specified metric values.

In Stage 3, we utilize the fine-grained controllable generative model to augment the original dataset within the metric space. The metrics in this space act as control knobs, allowing for the directional

generation of IoT sensing signals with specific characteristics in the spectrogram semantics. This enables the application of domain knowledge about IoT sensing and downstream tasks to strategically augment the original dataset. We introduce several data augmentation techniques that vary in their reliance on domain knowledge. The augmented conditions (metric values) are input into the trained generative model to produce synthetic samples. These samples, combined with the original dataset, form the augmented dataset used to train the downstream IoT sensing models.

We introduce each stage in details in Section 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4.

### Construction of Metric Space

We aim to design a set of statistical metrics which can effectively serve as fine-grained control knobs for data augmentation and easy to be manipulated by the domain experts in IoT sensing.

As IoT sensing signals typically exhibit strong patterns in both time and frequency domain, we convert the original time-series data into 2D spectrograms using short-time Fourier transformation (STFT). We propose metrics as below in three domains: time domain, frequency domain, and time-frequency domain.

**Time domain metric**: Temporal amplitude oscillation commonly exist in IoT sensing signals, which is a strong indicator for the dynamics of the observed physical phenomena. To measure this essential characteristic, we propose using the _temporal amplitude range_ in a spectrogram as a metric for controlling the volatility of the generated signal. It straightforwardly informs on the operational limits of the IoT sensing signal, which is essential for a robust generation that must operate within specific amplitude constraints.

**Frequency domain metric**: We introduce _Fundamental frequency (F0) amplitude_ as the metric to reflect the frequency domain characteristics of IoT sensing spectrograms. The fundamental frequency is pervasive across various IoT sensing signals. It dictates the dominant periodicity of the signal and is thus essential for capturing the signal's primary oscillatory properties. For example, in a signal captured by the accelerometer of a wearable device on the wrist when the human subject is walking, the fundamental frequency corresponds to the walking cycle.

**Time-frequency domain metrics**: The information distribution across the time-frequency domain is strongly correlated to phenomena such as environmental noises, signal interference, and the harmonic characteristics of the signal source. To effectively capture these aspects, we introduce metrics including _contrast_, _flatness_, and _entropy_ that quantify the amplitude distribution and information density within the spectrogram.

_Contrast_ quantifies the difference in amplitude between peaks and valleys within the spectrogram. This metric is critical for identifying the dominant signal patterns, allowing for a more nuanced generation of spectrograms where both signal and noise components are realistically balanced.

_Flatness_ measures how noise-like a spectrogram is by comparing the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean of the power spectrogram values. A high flatness indicates a uniform distribution of power across the spectrogram, typical of stochastic processes and ambient environmental noises. A low flatness indicates concentration of energy at regions. This results in a spectrogram with interleaving of peaks and valleys, reflecting the presence of tones or harmonics.

_Entropy_ measures the randomness of the power distribution within the spectrogram. High entropy suggests a complex, less predictable signal, while low entropy indicates a more structured and tonal signal. This metric is crucial for generating data that mimics the variable information content found in real-world IoT signals, from highly predictable periodic signals to complex, non-periodic disturbances.

The formal definitions of the metrics above can be found in Appendix B.

### Conditional Generative Model Training

Given the original dataset, we extract the metric values vector \(\) from each data sample and embed it with the class label as the condition tensor \(\). During the training of a conditional generative model \(G\), it takes the original data sample \(\) and the condition tensor \(\) as inputs. To enforce the alignment of the generated data \(^{}\) with the characteristics defined by the given metrics \(\), a loss term \(_{metric}\)is taken as a penalty on the difference between the metric values \(}\) calculated from \(^{}\) and \(\):

\[_{metric}=_{i=1}^{M}w_{i}(m_{i}-_{i})^{2},\] (1)

where \(M\) is the total number of metrics, and \(w_{i}\) is a hyperparameter as the weight for a specific metric loss. The total loss \(\) consists of the original generative model loss \(_{G}\) and the metric loss:

\[=_{G}+_{metric}.\] (2)

In practice, to balance the two loss terms, we empirically adjust the weight \(w\) of each metric so that \(_{G}:_{metric}\) approximately equals to 10:1 at the end of the first training epoch.

### Data Augmentation Techniques in Metric Space

To fully leverage the fine-grained controllable generative model to synthesize diverse data samples, effective data augmentation techniques are required. Different from prior approaches, our data augmentation happens in the metric space where the extracted metric values from the original data are manipulated to create variant data. As shown in Figure 3, we propose three data augmentation techniques which require varying levels of IoT domain knowledge, ranging from low to high.

**Interpolation**: A vast amount of prior research has demonstrated that interpolation is an effective data augmentation approach [5; 63; 37; 10; 3]. The intuition is that if the model can correctly classify not only the original samples but also these in-between points, it is likely to perform better on unseen data that fall within the same general manifold. Given a pair of randomly selected samples under the same label \(_{i}\) and \(_{j}\), we extract their metric values \(_{i}\) and \(_{j}\). The interpolated metric value \(_{interp}\) is defined as:

\[_{interp}=_{i}+(1-)_{j},\] (3)

where \(\) is a random number between 0 and 1, independently sampled from a Gaussian distribution for each interpolation. One advantage of interpolation is that it does not require specific domain knowledge to create new data samples.

**Disturbance**: Inheriting from the design of conventional transformation-based data augmentation methods, we disturb the original metric value of a data sample within a predefined varying range \([a,b]\), where \(a\) and \(b\) are the minimum and maximum percentages of the original metric value. During the metric disturbance, a random number \(r\) is sampled from the uniform distribution \(U(a,b)\). Given all the metrics as control knobs for creating new samples, users of this augmentation technique can to define the valid disturbance range grounded by domain insights.

**Domain knowledge instruction**: For many IoT sensing applications, deeper insights are available about the downstream model and the potential diversity of the realistic data distribution. In contrast to disturbance, these domain knowledge instructions provide a more precise scope for metric manipulation. This accuracy allows for the synthesis of data that not only enhances the downstream model but also avoids the production of unnecessary variants. To showcase the benefits of incorporating domain knowledge in IoT sensing data augmentation, we present two case studies in Section 4.3.

In the disturbance method, blue circles indicate the range of disturbance. In the domain knowledge instruction method, the red outline denotes specific metric value ranges derived from domain knowledge.**

Experiments

We evaluate our data augmentation approach on three IoT sensing applications where domain shift issues are prevalent: human-activity recognition, vehicle detection, and harmful brain activity recognition.

### Experimental Setup

**Datasets:** (1) **Human-Activity Recognition (HAR)**: We use RealWorld-HAR dataset , which aims at classifying 5 human activities based on the accelerometer and gyroscope signals. (2) **Vehicle detection**: We detect 5 vehicle types by deploying a seismic and an acoustic sensor on the ground, monitoring the sound and vibration caused by passing vehicles. This dataset is collected by ourselves . (3) **Harmful brain activity recognition**: We adopt Harmful Brain Activity Classification [18; 19] dataset which comprises electroencephalography (EEG) signals from critically ill patients in hospitals. The objective is to classify 5 types of harmful brain activities.

**Generative Model Backbones**: Technically, our fine-grained controllable generative data augmentation approach is compatible with any conditional generative model. We utilize two types of generative model backbones to validate our approach: (1) _Diffusion Model_ (referred to as _Diff_ hereafter), and (2) _VAE_.

**Baselines:** We compare two categories of data augmentation methods as baselines. **1****Traditional data augmentation**: This category includes (1) _data space interpolation_, (2) _feature space interpolation_, and (3) _time and frequency domain transformation-based method_. **2****Label-only conditional generative data augmentation**: We compare with 3 generative models that are only conditioned by the inherent label in the dataset, including (4) _Conditional Diffusion Model_ (cDiff), (5) _Conditional VAE_ (cVAE) and (6) _Conditional GAN_ (cGAN).

**Downstream Models**: We choose the following two downstream models: (1) _DeepSense_ is a deep learning model designed for analyzing IoT signals in the time-frequency domain, featuring multiple convolutional and recurrent layers. (2) _Transformer (Encoder-Only)_, which uses self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data and can capture complex dependencies. We only use the encoder component of the original Transformer architecture for classification tasks.

**Data Augmentation Setup**: Each method produce 5 times of synthetic samples comparative the number of the original training samples. For our methods that utilize _disturbance_ as the augmentation technique, we set the adjustable range for each metric in between -20% to 20%. This range is reasonably chosen to encompass substantial variance while maintaining invariance critical for the downstream task.

More details about the experimental setup can be found in the Appendix C, D, E, and F.

### Overall Performance

Table 1 reports the performance of the 3 variants of our fine-grained controllable generative augmentation comparing with the baselines. _Interp_ uses interpolation for augmentation, _Disturb_ applies metric disturbance, and _Reconst_ generates augmented data by using the actual metric values from the validation set as conditions, showcasing the potential upper bound performance of our method when validation data metrics are perfectly predicted. We highlight the highest-performing cell in the table, excluding the _Reconst_ variant.

Across all datasets and two downstream models, our fine-grained controllable generative augmentation consistently outperforms other methods. Typically, the performance improves with the integration of more domain knowledge into the augmentation process. _Interp_ operates on the premise that interpolating between real samples enhances dataset diversity, requiring no specific domain knowledge. _Disturb_, on the other hand, involves domain expertise to define the disturbance range, leading to better performance than _Interp_. _Reconst_, which utilizes ground truth metric values from the validation set, achieves the highest performance, illustrating the significant benefits of incorporating domain knowledge about IoT sensing signal characteristics through our designed metrics into the generative augmentation process.

Using the same augmentation technique, the diffusion model generally surpasses the VAE as a backbone. As illustrated in Appendix G.1, VAE generates spectrograms that are less crisp and realistic compared to those produced by the diffusion model, a finding supported by numerous previous studies [28; 2]. We hypothesize that the inferior generative quality of the VAE limits the effectiveness of data augmentation. This suggests that the success of our data augmentation method depends significantly on the underlying generative model's ability to synthesize authentic data.

To validate the fine-grained control over the generation process, we visualize examples of the generation results in Figure 4. Results demonstrate the precise fine-grained control of our approach over the IoT sensing signal generation.

We altered a single metric condition while retaining the remaining metrics. **(a)** Increasing contrast enhances the distinction between peak and valley values, while decreasing contrast reduces the differences, making high and low energy areas less pronounced. **(b)** Higher flatness results in a uniform and consistent energy distribution across the spectrum; lower flatness leads to pronounced interleaving between peaks and valleys, exhibiting stronger harmonic patterns. **(c)** Higher entropy creates a more random or chaotic energy distribution, whereas lower entropy results in a simpler and more predictable spectrogram appearance. **(d)** Increasing the temporal amplitude range introduces greater dynamics over time, whereas reducing it leads to a more uniform amplitude distribution throughout the timeline. **(e)** Adjusting the F0 amplitude emphasizes the intensity of the fundamental frequency without affecting the relative amplitudes of other harmonics. Additional visualizations are available in Appendix G.

### Data Augmentation with Domain Knowledge Instruction

We highlight the effectiveness of integrating domain knowledge to enhance data augmentation through three case studies. In each case, we create a domain shifting scenario and aim to increase the downstream model's robustness to variations outside the training set. We utilize the diffusion model as the generative model backbone and DeepSense as the downstream model.

**Case study 1: Various Running Styles in HAR dataset.** We use the RealWorld-HAR dataset for our analysis. For the training set, we select 3 human subjects who demonstrated cautious style during the data collection of the "running" activity. For the validation set, we choose other 3 human subjects who exhibited energetic running patterns. The distinct running patterns of the subjects were assessed by reviewing video footage recorded by an observer holding a camera and following the runners. 2 Based on IoT sensing domain knowledge, we hypothesize that the more forceful arm swings of energetic runners produce more intense and varied acceleration signals. The dominant arm swing frequency and its harmonics are also more pronounced. In spectrograms, these characteristics should manifest as higher contrast, lower flatness, and stronger F0 amplitude compared to the cautious runners. As shown in Figure 4(a), our visual inspections of accelerometer spectrograms from each participant confirmed these assumptions.

We then simulate a scenario where we only have the data from the 3 cautious runners, and need to generalize the activity recognition to the running activity of the energetic runners. In our training set, we have the data of all activities from the cautious runners, while the validation data comprises running activities from the energetic runners. Leveraging our domain insights, we directionally augment the data by intensifying the contrast and fundamental frequency amplitude and reducing the flatness in the spectrograms of the cautious runners. We set the varying range of contrast, flatness, and fundamental frequency amplitude at [10%, 40%], [-40%, -10%], and [10%, 40%] respectively, while keeping the other metrics unchanged. Having these ranges, we employ the perturbation augmentation method to create the augmented data. In Figure 4(b), results show that our domain knowledge instruction (noted as _knowledge_) substantially improves the results, closely approaching the upper performance bound set by _Reconst_. This demonstrates that the generated data can more precisely reflect the true characteristics of the diverse running styles.

**Case Study 2: Various Road Types in Vehicle Detection Dataset.** In the vehicle detection dataset, the same vehicle driving on different road types exhibit various signal patterns. Our domain expertise suggests that the uneven and shifting surface of a gravel road generates sound and vibration profile with higher entropy compared to smoother concrete surface. As presented in Figure 5(a), for the same vehicle type, spectrograms exhibit more complex and disordered patterns when on gravel than on concrete.

In this case study, we simulate a scenario where the training set only includes data collected on the concrete road while the validation set is the data collected on the gravel ground. By applying our knowledge about the effect of gravel surfaces, we generate synthetic data by increasing entropy and flatness and decreasing contrast. We set the varying range of these 3 metrics as [10%, 30%], [10%, 30%], and [-30%, 0] respectively, while keeping the other metrics unchanged. Then we use perturbation augmentation to synthesize the data. In Figure 5(b), the results show that our data

Figure 5: **Case Study 1.** Leveraging our insights into different running styles, our method enables more precise data augmentation and enhances the downstream model’s performance on “running” activity recognition.

augmentation informed by precise domain knowledge, significantly enhances the generalizability of the downstream model from concrete road to gravel road.

**Case Study 3: Various Seizure Patterns in Harmful Brain Activity Dataset**. We observe that the seizure signals from different patients can be divided into two categories regarding the fundamental frequency patterns. One is with clear fundamental frequency, which might be associated with the repetitive firing patterns of neurons in a specific brain region. We call it _Clear Seizure_. The other category has chaotic, noisy signals and blury fundamental frequency, which might be related to different brain regions contribute varying frequencies and patterns simultaneously. We call it _Chaotic Seizure_. In this case study, we manually select 10 patients of clear seizure as the traing set, and select 10 patients of chaotic seizure as the validation set. To augment the training data, we set the varying range of contrast, entropy, and fundamental frequency amplitude at [10%, 25%], [10%, 40%], and [-25%, -10%] respectively, while keeping the other metrics unchanged. We show example spectrograms in Figure 6(a). The experiment results are shown in Figure 6(b). Among all the baselines, our domain knowledge instruction achieves the best performance, again proving the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach.

### Number of Augmentation Data

We investigate the influence of the number of augmentation data on the downstream model performance. Here we use diffusion model as the generative model backbone, and DeepSense as the downstream model. As depicted in Figure 8, even though the ideal augmentation ratio varies in different datasets, a steep climb in performance occurs from 50% to 500%. Among the 3 datasets, human activity recognition has the smallest data volume, which is below 5000 training samples. We envision that the generative capability is fully expressed at a lower augmentation ratio. Harmful brain

activity recognition dataset has the largest number of training samples (\(\) 80,000), where a tendency of performance growing remains even at a higher augmentation ratio.

### Ablation Studies

To investigate the impact of different metrics on our data augmentation approach, we ablate each category of metrics and evaluate their effects using the disturb augmentation method with diffusion model as the generative model backbone. Performance was evaluated using DeepSense as the downstream model. As depicted in Table 2, excluding any metrics consistently results in diminished performance, validating the effectiveness of our selected metrics. The results also indicate varying importance of metrics across different datasets.

## 5 Conclusion

In this paper, we present a method of fine-grained control on generative augmentation in IoT sensing applications. Our novel data augmentation technique merges the advantages of leveraging domain knowledge specific with the production of highly authentic synthetic samples. Compared to traditional transformation-based and generative data augmentation methods, our approach demonstrates superior performance, particularly when domain-specific knowledge is available, which is a common scenario in many IoT sensing tasks. Furthermore, the versatility of our method enables its application across different generative models, allowing it to benefit from the inherent generative capabilities of these models.
