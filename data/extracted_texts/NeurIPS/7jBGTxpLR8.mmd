###### Abstract

We propose photonic integrated circuits augmented with a \(^{(3)}\) nonlinearity - e.g., a semiconductor exciton-polariton nonlinearity - to accomplish two fundamental tasks in quantum processing: quantum state tomography and quantum state generation. We demonstrate in simulations that the design of the circuit can be optimized to great effect and showcase the efficacy of the optimized nonlinear circuits for the quantum machine learning tasks of i) fully identifying a family of emblematic quantum states and ii) stabilizing an accurate train of single photons.

## 1 Introduction

Advancements in quantum computing heavily rely on the manipulation, stabilization, and detection of quantum states . Ever since its conception, the generation and characterization of non-classical quantum states of light have been at the heart of quantum optics , thus paving the way towards large-scale optical quantum computing . While in the classical approach to optical computing  information is captured solely in the relatively easily measurable and modulatable amplitude and/or phase of different components of light, a quantum state of light is fully determined by (i) full-counting photon statistics and (ii) the relative phase of each photon number outcome - features of fundamental importance for quantifying quantum entanglement and state superposition .

Strongly coupled matter-light systems, such as exciton-polaritons , have attracted growing interest in the quantum-computing community. Thanks to the flexible state manipulation provided by the incident laser field and direct access to the emitted light, experiments with exciton-polaritons have accomplished a plethora of impressive results - e.g., the creation of spontaneous long-range coherence (Bose-Einstein condensation) , realization of a superfluid flow , or the stabilization of an optical topologically protected insulator . It is, therefore, not surprising that recently these platforms have also been proposed for optical quantum computing .

In this paper, we introduce a photonic integrated circuit (PIC), built upon a platform of nonlinear photonics, that creates a novel pathway for achieving universal quantum state generation and characterization. See Fig. 1 for a schematic depiction.

Related work.Recently, a series of papers showcased the potential of quantum reservoir computing for the tasks of state tomography - an all-encompassing characterization of a photonic quantum state [20; 21; 22; 23] - and state generation . Although the presented results were innovative and notable from a conceptional point of view, limited efforts were dedicated to the actual implementation, the design, or the potential deployment in state-of-the-art experimental settings. The primary goal of this paper is to do precisely that.

The realization of polaritonics  in integrated photonics  served as a motivational cornerstone for this work. We demonstrate a feasible implementation of both quantum tomography and quantum state generation using polaritonic PICs. Moreover, while reservoir computing is, by definition, a non-tunable technique to enlarge the feature space, we apply machine learning training methods for optical quantum circuit design to shape an optimal feature space for the task at hand.

Our contributionscan be summarized as follows:

1. we showcase the potential of integrated nonlinear photonics to perform the quantum machine learning tasks of quantum state tomography and quantum state generation
2. we provide evidence that one can efficiently and to great effect optimize the design of the polaritonic PIC for tomographical tasks
3. we show the efficacy of our polaritonic device for the task of photonic state generation. Specifically, we focus on the technologically relevant case of generating highly accurate trains of single photons, at maximal emission rate.

## 2 Polaritonic Photonic Integrated Circuit Optimization

On-chip quantum dynamics.The full quantum dynamics, describing photons traversing the chip of interconnected nonlinear waveguides illustrated in Fig. 1, is governed by the interplay of energy-conserving Hamiltonian dynamics and dissipation in the form of, primarily, polariton losses. Under the _Born-Markov_ approximation, this is fully captured by the Lindblad master equation for the photonic density matrix - see, e.g., Ref. . Using the paraxial approximation, mapping the spatial axis of polariton propagation onto time \(t\) (see Ref.  and Appendix B), we find,

\[_{t}=-iH(t),+_{i}a_{i} a_{ i}^{}-a_{i}^{}a_{i}+ a_{i}^{}a_{i} \;, \]

where we set Planck's constant \(\) and the polariton group velocity \(v_{g}\) to one - see also Appendix A. The first term of equation (1) describes the coherent dynamics, defined by the Hamiltonian,

\[H(t)=-_{i=1}^{L}a_{i}^{}a_{i}-_{i,j=1}^{L}J_{ij}(t )a_{i}^{}a_{j}+J_{ij}^{*}(t)a_{i}a_{j}^{}+ _{i=1}^{L}a_{i}^{}a_{i}^{}a_{i}a_{i}\;, \]

and the second term the photonic losses. Here, \(a_{i}\) and \(a_{i}^{}\) are the photon creation and annihilation operators, respectively, which create or remove a photonic quantum from a quantum state \(|,\) and \(L\) is the number of waveguides. Let us clarify the parameters that were used in Eqs. (1) and (2). Some of them are semiconductor material properties and are, therefore, not easily accessible for tuning. These include the detuning \(\) of the incoming light with respect to the exact polariton resonance - in what follows, we assume exact resonance, so \(=0\); the polariton loss rate \(\); and the strength of the nonlinear photon interaction \(U\) that is mediated by excitons, which are effective bosonic quasi-particles arising from semiconductor excitations.

Of fundamental importance is the dimensionless ratio \(U/\), quantifying the effective nonlinearity experienced by the photon field. While in traditional microcavity platforms a modest optical nonlinearity has been reported , it has been shown that much larger effects can be engineered in integrated waveguide designs .

Besides the fixed properties of the material stack \(,\)\(U,\) and \(\), the set of parameters \(J_{ij}(t)\) in (2) remains directly accessible for the purpose of optimizing the circuit design. These parameters describe the graph matrix of waveguide couplings, as fabricated using directional couplers (DCs) or multi-mode interferometers (MMIs). We choose to keep the matrices \(J_{ij}\) real, configured in a brick-like pattern of couplings, see Fig. 1.

In this work, it is precisely the flexibility in the design of the PIC, parametrized by \(J_{ij}(t)\) in (2), that we exploit to optimize the performance of the chip on two exemplary tasks: (i) the quantum tomography of incoming Gaussian squeezed states of light and (ii) the emission of a single-photon train at maximal emission rate.

Quantum simulation.In principle, full exact quantum simulation of the dynamics governed by Eqs. (1) and (2) can be achieved using the toolbox of linear algebra, by representing quantum states \(|\) as vectors and the operators as matrices. Noteworthy, even though the method is, in principle, exact, the vector space dimension grows exponentially as \(D=N^{L}\), for \(L\) waveguides carrying photon states up to occupation number \(N\). This exponential growth is well-known to constitute the fundamental hardness of classically simulating quantum mechanics. Also worth noting is that for photonic systems, the occupation number can be any positive integer. That's why we rely on computationally more efficient techniques with manageable memory overhead, to wit, a Gaussian variational approximation and the method of Monte Carlo unravelings of the master equation . For details on these simulation techniques we refer the reader to the supplementary material, see Appendices B and C.

Quantum state tomography and generation.For quantum state tomography, the photonic integrated circuit establishes a quantum extreme learning machine . Recall that a classical extreme learning machine pre-processes data via a memoryless (i.e., non-recurrent) non-linear map, while the final output is obtained via a trainable linear layer. In its quantum version, the preprocessing of the input data - in our case a quantum state of light - is governed by a quantum-mechanical time-evolution, followed by the quantum measurement of a collection of observable quantities. In our realization, the quantum dynamics is governed by the above-described effects, while we measure the expected photon count at the end of each waveguide.

For quantum state generation, the PIC receives standard laser beams as its input, which are subsequently intertwined into an entangled multi-mode quantum output state, thanks to the interplay of waveguide interference and the photonic nonlinearity. This quantum state is next sent through a traditional (hence, fully linear) mesh of tunable phase-shifters and DCs which performs an entangling mixture governed by an \(L L\) unitary matrix \(V\) and whose output is the desired quantum state.

Quantum circuit optimization.For tomographical tasks, going beyond the extreme learning machine paradigm, we optimize the circuit via its coupling coefficients \(J_{ij}(t)\), which are easily adjustable during the design phase of the chip. As these coefficients govern the quantum dynamics as in (2), they appear as parameters in the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) describing the time evolution of the quantum state. Choosing a gradient descent approach to perform the optimization, we can rely on the adjoint state (or sensitivity) method to find the updates to the ODE parameters. Within the machine learning community, this approach was reintroduced in , and we leverage the associated PyTorch package. Note that the linear layer is always fitted perfectly optimally given the measurements of the occupation numbers (output intensities).

Fig. 2 shows the setup of state generation focused on the task of single-photon generation. We optimize the parameters of the unitary mixing, which we parameterize as \(V():=\{i()\}\). Here, \(\) is an \(L L\) Hermitian matrix, representing the inter-waveguide couplings that we want to optimize to obtain stable high-probability single-photon outcomes - this is perfectly similar to the optimization of the coefficients \(J_{ij}(t)\) for tomography. For this usecase, we choose to keep the nonlinear PIC random and fixed. The rationale is that we ultimately aim for a device that is universal in its quantum state generation capabilities. There is, however, no obstruction to designing a device tailored to generating a specific state by leveraging the techniques of the previous paragraph.

Results

In this section, we present our results, based on numerical simulations, on optimizing the tasks of quantum tomography and state generation. See Appendix E for the simulation details.

### Gaussian quantum state characterization

Gaussian quantum states are multi-mode optical states characterized by the property that number statistics - as expressed by expectation values of strings of creation and annihilation operators - are governed by Gaussian statistics. Amongst this class of states, we focus on single- and two-mode thermal squeezed states, often abbreviated as SMTSS and TMTSS respectively. As squeezed versions of thermal states, they are specified by three real parameters: the thermal average number of photons \(\) in each mode and the complex squeezing parameter \(=re^{i}\). These parameters fully determine the covariance matrix of the above-mentioned Gaussian statistics. We do not displace the state, i.e., we keep the distribution's first moments zero. In formulae, the tomographical information of an SMTSS can be summarized by the following expectation values :

\[ a=0\;, n= a^{}a=(+)\;(2r)-\;, c= aa=-(+)\;(2r)e^{i}\;. \]

For two-mode thermal squeezed states similar expressions determine the equal diagonal elements of \(_{ij}= a_{i}^{}a_{j}\), while the off-diagonal entries are zero, and the equal off-diagonal elements of \(_{ij}= a_{i}a_{j},\) whose diagonal is zero. Naturally, the indices \(i,j\) run over the values \(1\) and \(2.\) We implement the quantum state characterization of thermal squeezed states as the task of determining \(n\) and the real and imaginary parts of \(c\).

Concretely, we inject the single/two-mode thermal squeezed state into one/two input waveguides of the chip of Fig. 1. We choose the chip to have five waveguides, and send fixed coherent laser light, described quantum mechanically by coherent states, into the remaining four/three waveguides. We consider five layers of interference regions in a brick-pattern. We created a training and test dataset, each consisting of 250 random samples. We measure the total mean squared error (MSE) loss after the linear layer. To efficiently optimize the MSE during training, we implement a two-stage optimization. First, we optimize the linear layer given the features provided by the quantum circuit. As this is standard linear regression, it is an easily solved convex optimization problem that, in fact, has an analytical solution. Next, we freeze the weights of the linear layer and optimize the coupling parameters of the quantum circuit, simulated using the Gaussian variational approximation, by taking a gradient descent step. In practice, we use SciPy's L-BFGS-B algorithm to perform the gradient descent.

In Fig. 3, we summarize our results. Panel (a) contains a boxplot showing statistical information on the improvement in the test MSE that can be achieved by optimizing a randomly initialized quantum circuit; we do so as a function of the nonlinear interaction strength. We start by noting that a random circuit is the waveguide equivalent of the currently state-of-the-art quantum reservoirs of [20; 21; 22; 23]. In particular we observe a more than ten thousand-fold improvement in median MSE for the currently experimentally feasible interaction strength of \(U/=0.1\). The necessity of the photonic nonlinearity is also made manifest by the very poor results in the bin \(_{10}U/=-\), i.e., \(U=0\). In panel (b), we showcase an example of a circuit for SMTSS characterization at \(U/=0.1\). Finally, in panel (c), we show several circuit optimization curves, initialized with random circuits, as measured by the test MSE on the two-mode characterization task for \(U/=0.1\). We easily achieve an order of magnitude improvement. As we didn't change the overall architecture of the PIC, it is natural that the MSE of the two-mode characterization cannot fully match the single-mode MSE. Indeed, two-mode characterization requires the system to disentangle the statistical cross-correlation between two strongly entangled modes, instead of merely identifying single-mode, uncorrelated, statistics. Nevertheless, we obtain perfectly satisfactory values for the MSE.

### Single-photon generation

Our setup for quantum state generation is illustrated in Fig. 2. Coherent states (laser fields) are injected into the waveguides and traverse the first nonlinear quantum PIC, thereby generating a multi-mode entangled output state \(_{}\). Two different figures of merit (FOM) were investigated to find the optimal configuration of the second, linear, PIC for the task of generating a single-photon output in one output arm, using \(_{}\) as input. Additional details on the simulation and optimization procedure are provided in the Supplementary Material, see Appendix D.

Density-density correlations.The correlation function \(g^{(2)}()\) defines the density-density correlations between a pair of quantum modes \(i\) and \(j\). It is defined as,

\[g^{(2)}_{ij}()=^{}(0)a_{j}^{}()a_{j}( )a_{i}(0)}{n_{i}(0)n_{j}()}. \]

We focus on single-photon generation in one output arm \(l\) (i.e., \(i=j=l\)), at zero time delay (\(=0\)). It can be shown that the quantity \(g^{(2)}_{ll}(0)\) is non-negative. Moreover, it is only zero for single-photon states. In fact, minimizing \(g^{(2)}_{ll}(0;)\), where \(_{i}\) are the PIC configuration variables, amounts to maximizing the single-photon generation efficiency .

Density matrix.We also formulate a FOM in terms of the entries of the reduced density matrix \(_{l}\) of output arm \(l\),

\[_{l}=-_{l,11}-w_{0}_{l,00}+_{l, ij}|_{l,ij}|-_{l,11}-_{l,00}. \]

Now, the goal is to maximize the matrix entry \(_{l,11}\), the single-photon probability, or otherwise filling the vacuum mode \(_{l,00}\) (\(0 w_{0} 1\)). All matrix elements other than \(_{l,00}\) and \(_{l,11}\) are penalized in the last term. In (5), we _explicitly_ aim at maximizing the single-photon probability, which was absent in \(g^{(2)}(0)\). Indeed, in (4), very accurate single-photons can be generated, at the cost of obtaining a very low intensity \(n_{l}\).

Nevertheless, measuring \(g^{(2)}_{ll}()\) is a standard task, accomplished in a Hanbury Brown - Twiss interferometric setup (e.g., Refs. ), opening the possibility of real-time PIC optimization based on experimental outcomes. In stark contrast, experimentally obtaining matrix entries of \(_{l}\) for (5) is much more complicated .

Fig. 4 contains an overview of our single-photon generation results. On the left-hand side, in panel (a), a scan of the 2D parameter space \((U,)\) is shown for moderate interaction strengths \(U/\) and

input laser amplitudes \(\). One notices that the optimal \(g^{(2)}(0;V_{})\)-values are obtained for large \(U\) and small \(\). In panel (b), we illustrate the convergence of PyTorch's L-BFGS optimizer. Noteworthy, as shown in panel (c), while small input amplitudes \(\) and stronger interaction \(U\) give good results for \(g^{(2)}(0;V_{})\), this comes at the expense of low single-photon output intensities and thus low probabilities - only a few percent chance of single-photon emission, see yellow dots.

On the right-hand side of Fig. 4, we show the results for using the objective \((V)\) of Expr. 5. These results were obtained for the same nonlinear PIC configuration, but allowing for larger interaction coefficients \(U\). The input intensity is set to \(=1\). The curve in panel (d) shows some wiggles, but we observe that generally better values of the FOM are obtained at higher \(U/\). In panel (e), the obtained optimal density matrix for \(U=35\) is shown and it is clear that, to a good approximation, only the matrix entries \(_{11}\) and \(_{00}\) are occupied. Finally, in panel (f), we compare the probability of producing vacuum and the probability of single-photon generation. We find a single-photon probability of about \(p_{1}=0.4\) for large values of \(U/\). Clearly, higher photon numbers (inducing spurious signals ) are strongly suppressed, since \(p_{0}+p_{1} 1\) for all \(U\)-values (black dotted line).

## 4 Conclusions and Outlook

We have proposed a novel polaritonic PIC to perform universal quantum state characterization and generation. Moreover, we introduced and successfully brought to bear a methodology to optimize the circuit so as to maximize the efficiency of the respective tasks. We provided evidence, based on numerical simulations, of the efficacy of the optimized chips in the tasks of characterizing single- and two-mode squeezed thermal states and the highly accurate generation of single photons.

We are currently actively corresponding with experimental research groups about realizing our proposed PICs, using cryogenic GaAs-based polariton quantum wells. Once implemented, the PIC will be tested and benchmarked against our numerical simulations. Furthermore, for both state tomography and generation, we aim at scaling up our simulations to larger system sizes, using matrix-product based methods , to the end of characterizing and generating states of higher complexity - e.g., for performing full density-matrix tomography or generating Bell-pair states. These results will be benchmarked and compared against the original (conceptual) results of Refs. [20; 24]. Finally,
