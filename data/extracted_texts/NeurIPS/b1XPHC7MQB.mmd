###### Abstract

Diffusion distillation represents a highly promising direction for achieving faithful text-to-image generation in a few sampling steps. However, despite recent successes, existing distilled models still do not provide the full spectrum of diffusion abilities, such as real image inversion, which enables many precise image manipulation methods. This work aims to enrich distilled text-to-image diffusion models with the ability to effectively encode real images into their latent space. To this end, we introduce _invertible Consistency Distillation_ (iCD), a generalized consistency distillation framework that facilitates both high-quality image synthesis and accurate image encoding in only \(3{-}4\) inference steps. Though the inversion problem for text-to-image diffusion models gets exacerbated by high classifier-free guidance scales, we notice that _dynamic guidance_ significantly reduces reconstruction errors without noticeable degradation in generation performance. As a result, we demonstrate that iCD equipped with dynamic guidance may serve as a highly effective tool for zero-shot text-guided image editing, competing with more expensive state-of-the-art alternatives.

Introduction

Recently, text-to-image diffusion models [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6] have become a dominant paradigm in image generation based on user-provided textual prompts. The exceptional quality of these models makes them a valuable tool for graphics editors, especially for various image manipulation tasks [7; 8; 9]. In practice, however, the applicability of diffusion models is often hindered by their slow inference, which stems from a sequential sampling procedure, gradually recovering images from pure noise.

To speed-up the inference, many recent works aim to reduce the number of diffusion steps via diffusion distillation [10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16; 17] that has provided significant progress in high-quality generation in \(1-4\) steps and has already been successfully scaled to the state-of-the-art text-to-image diffusion models [18; 19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24]. Though the existing distillation approaches still often trade either mode coverage or image quality for few-step inference, the proposed models can already be feasible for practical applications, such as text-driven image editing [25; 26; 27].

The most effective diffusion-based editing methods typically require encoding real images into the latent space of a diffusion model. For "undistilled" models, this encoding is possible by virtue of the connection of diffusion modeling  with denoising score matching  through SDE and probability flow ODE (PF ODE) . The ODE perspective of diffusion models reveals their _reversibility_, i.e., the ability to encode a real image into the model latent space and closely reconstruct it with minimal changes. This ability is successfully exploited in various applications, such as text-driven image editing [31; 32; 33], domain translation [34; 9], style transfer .

Nevertheless, it remains unclear if distilled models can be enriched with such reversibility since existing diffusion distillation methods primarily focus on achieving efficient generation. This work positively answers this question by proposing _invertible Consistency Distillation_ (iCD), a generalized consistency modeling framework [10; 12; 13] enabling both high-quality image generation and accurate inversion in a few sampling steps.

In practice, text-to-image models leverage classifier-free guidance (CFG) , which is crucial for high-fidelity text-to-image generation [1; 3] and text-guided editing [32; 33]. However, the guided diffusion processes yield significant challenges for inversion-based editing methods . Previous approaches [32; 37; 38; 39; 40; 41; 42; 27; 25; 26; 43; 44] have extensively addressed these challenges but often necessitate high computational budget to achieve both strong image manipulations and faithful content preservation. While some of these techniques are applicable to the distilled models [25; 26; 27], they still dilute the primary advantage of distilled diffusion models: efficient inference.

One of the main ingredients of the iCD framework is how it operates with guided diffusion processes. Recently, dynamic guidance has been proposed to improve distribution diversity without noticeable loss in image quality [45; 46]. The key idea is to deactivate CFG for high diffusion noise levels to stimulate exploration at earlier sampling steps. In this work, we notice that dynamic CFG can facilitate image inversion while preserving the editability of the text-to-image diffusion models. Notably, dynamic CFG yields no computational overhead, entirely leveraging the efficiency gains from diffusion distillation. In our experiments, we demonstrate that invertible distilled models equipped with dynamic guidance are a highly effective inversion-based image editing tool.

To sum up, our contributions can be formulated as follows:

* We propose a generalized consistency distillation framework, invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD), enabling both high-fidelity text-to-image generation and accurate image encoding in around \(3-4\) sampling steps.
* We investigate dynamic classifier-free guidance in the context of image inversion and text-guided editing. We demonstrate that it preserves editability of the text-to-image diffusion models while significantly increasing the inversion quality for free.
* We apply iCD to large-scale text-to-image models such Stable Diffusion 1.5  and XL  and extensively evaluate them for image editing problems. According to automated and human studies, we confirm that iCD unlocks faithful text-guided image editing for \(6-8\) steps and is comparable to state-of-the-art text-driven image manipulation methods while being multiple times faster.

## 2 Background

Diffusion probabilistic modelsDPMs [29; 28; 47] are a class of generative models producing samples from a simple, typically standard normal, distribution by solving the underlying Probability Flow ODE [30; 48], involving iterative _score function_ estimation. DPMs are trained to approximate the score function and employ dedicated diffusion ODE solvers [49; 50; 48] for sampling. DDIM  is a simple yet effective solver, widely used in text-to-image models and operating in around \(50\) steps. A single DDIM step from \(_{t}\) to \(_{s}\) can be formulated as follows:

\[_{s}^{w}=(_{t},t,s,,w)=}{ _{t}}}_{t}+_{}^{w}(_{t},t,) (}-}{_{t}}}}),\] (1)

where \(_{s}\), \(_{t}\) are defined according to the diffusion schedule , and \(_{}^{w}(_{t},t,)=_{}(_{t},t,)+w(_{}(_{t},t, )-_{}(_{t},t,))\) is a linear combination of conditional and unconditional noise predictions called as Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) , used to improve the image quality and context alignment in conditional generation. In the following, we omit the condition \(\) for simplicity.

Due to reversibility, the PF ODE can be solved in both directions: encoding data into the noise space and decoding it back without additional optimization procedures. We refer to this process as _inversion_ where encoding and decoding correspond to _forward_ and _reverse_ processes, respectively.

Consistency DistillationCD [10; 12; 13] is the recent state-of-the-art diffusion distillation approach for few-step image generation, which learns to integrate the PF ODE induced with a pretrained diffusion model. In more detail, the model \(_{}\) is trained to satisfy the self-consistency property:

\[_{}()=[d(_{}( _{t_{n-1}}^{w},t_{n-1}),_{}(_{t_{n}},t_{n})) ]_{},\] (2)

where \(t_{n}\{t_{0},...,t_{N}\}\) is a discrete time step, \(d(,)\) denotes a distance function and \(_{t_{n-1}}^{w}\) is obtained with a single step of the DDIM solver from \(t_{n}\) to \(t_{n-1}\) using the teacher diffusion model. The optimum of (2) is defined by the boundary condition, \(_{}(_{t_{0}},t_{0})=_{t_{0}}\). Therefore, consistency models (CMs) learn the transition from any trajectory point to the starting one: \(_{}(_{t_{n}},t_{n})=_{t_{0}},\,t_{n} \{t_{0},...,t_{N}\}\). Consequently, CMs imply a single step generation. However, approximating the entire trajectory using only one step remains highly challenging, leading to unsatisfactory results in practice. To address this,  proposes stochastic _multistep consistency sampling_ that iteratively predicts \(_{t_{0}}\) using \(_{}\) and goes back to the intermediate points using the forward diffusion process.

The competitive performance of consistency models has stimulated their rapid adoption for text-to-image generation [52; 18; 53]. Nevertheless, we believe that CMs have not yet fully realized their potential in downstream applications, where DPMs excel. One of the reasons is that, unlike DPMs, CMs do not support the inversion process. This work aims to unlock this ability for CMs.

Dynamic guidanceState-of-the-art text-to-image models employ large CFG scales to achieve high image quality and textual alignment. However, it often leads to the reduced diversity of generated images. To address this, _dynamic classifier-free guidance_[45; 46; 54] has recently been proposed to improve distribution diversity without noticeable loss in generative performance. CADS  gradually increases the guidance scale from zero to the initial high value over the sampling process, Figure 1(a). Alternatively,  proposes deactivating the guidance for low and high noise levels and using it only on the middle time step interval, Figure 1(b). Both strategies suggest that the unguided process at high noise levels is responsible for better distribution diversity without compromising sampling quality. In addition, the authors  demonstrate that guidance at low noise levels has a minor effect on the performance and can be omitted to avoid extra model evaluations for guidance calculation. Both dynamic techniques are controlled by two hyperparameters: \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\), which are responsible for the value of dynamic CFG \(w(t)\). In our work, we focus on the CADS formulation.

Figure 2: Dynamic CFG strategies.

Method

This section introduces the invertible Consistency Distillation (iCD) framework, which comprises forward and reverse consistency models. First, we formulate the forward CD procedure that encodes images into latent noise. Then, we describe multi-boundary generalization of iCD to enable deterministic multistep inversion. Finally, we investigate the _dynamic guidance_ technique from the inversion perspective.

### Forward Consistency Distillation

Forward Consistency Distillation (fCD) works in the opposite way to CD. That is, it aims to map any point on the PF ODE trajectory to the latent noise (the last trajectory point).

The transition from CD to the forward counterpart is quite straightforward: the only thing that should be modified is the boundary condition. Precisely, the forward consistency model is constrained to be an identity function for the last trajectory point: \(}(_{t_{N}},t_{N})=_{t_{N}}\). Thus, fCD inherits the same consistency distillation loss (2) without incurring extra training costs. This way, the distilled model can transform any trajectory point to the last one: \(}(_{t_{n}},t_{n})=_{t_{N}},\;t_{n}\). To perform inversion, first, fCD encodes an image into noise and then CD decodes it back. The comparison between CD and fCD is shown in Figure 2(a).

### Multi-boundary Consistency Distillation

In practice, the encoding with fCD faces two challenges. Firstly, like in CD, a single-step prediction with fCD can be highly inaccurate. However, this cannot be easily addressed since the multistep consistency sampling  is not applicable to fCD. Concretely, intermediate points cannot be obtained from the latent noise using the forward diffusion process. Secondly, even if fCD is accurate, the multistep sampling is not suitable for decoding, as its stochastic nature prevents the reconstruction of real images. So, to improve the prediction accuracy of fCD and reduce the reconstruction error of CD, it is necessary to formulate a deterministic multistep procedure for both models.

Recent approaches [53; 13] generalize the CD framework to a multistep regime and allow approximating arbitrary trajectory intervals in the reverse direction. However, these methods focus solely on the generation quality, without supporting the inversion. Thus, inspired by these works, we propose a multi-boundary CD, that unlocks deterministic multistep inversion with the distilled models and carries similar training costs as the classical CD methods.

Specifically, we divide the solution interval, \(\{t_{0},...,t_{N}\}\), into \(m\) segments and perform the distillation on each of these segments separately. This way, we obtain a set of single-step consistency models operating on different intervals and boundary points. This formulation is valid for both CD and fCD and hence can enable deterministic multistep inversion. We provide an illustration of \(2\)-boundary CD and fCD in Figure 2(b). We denote the multi-boundary reverse and forward models as CD\({}^{m}\) and fCD\({}^{m}\).

Formally, we consider CD\({}^{m}\) and fCD\({}^{m}\) using the following parametrization, inspired by [53; 13].

\[_{s_{t}^{m}}=^{m}}(_{t},t,s_{t}^{m},w)=( _{t},t,s_{t}^{m},w),\] (3)

where \(s_{t}^{m}\) is the boundary time step depending on the number of boundaries, \(m\), and the current time step \(t\). For instance, let \(m=1\), then \(s_{t}^{1}=t_{0}\) for CD\({}^{1}\) and \(s_{t}^{1}=t_{N}\) for fCD\({}^{1}\). Note that we learn a single model, the multistep sampling is achieved by varying \(s_{t}^{m}\) during inference. The training objective remains the same as (2), avoiding additional training costs compared to CD. The only limitation is that the number of segments and the corresponding boundary time steps must be set before the training.

Figure 3: The proposed invertible Consistency Distillation framework consists of two models: the forward \(m\)-boundary model, fCD\({}^{m}\), and the reverse model, CD\({}^{m}\). (a) For \(m=1\), the reverse model corresponds to CD. More boundary points unlock the deterministic multistep inversion, e.g., (b) shows the case for \(m=2\).

### Training fCD\({}^{m}\) and CD\({}^{m}\)

We train fCD\({}^{m}\) and CD\({}^{m}\) separately, initializing both with the same teacher model. We use the same loss with a difference only in boundary time steps. However, a notable difference is the CFG scale, \(w\). For CD\({}^{m}\), we preliminarily embed the model on guidance, following , to use various \(w\) during sampling and avoid extra model evaluations. For fCD\({}^{m}\), we consider an unguided model with a constant \(w=1\). The reason is that the guided encoding (\(w>1\)) leads to out-of-distribution latent noise , and as a result, to poor image reconstruction. We confirm this intuition in Section 3.4. Finally, we find that \(m{=}3{-}4\) provides competitive generation and inversion quality for large-scale text-to-image models .

**Preservation losses** The procedure described above already provides decent inversion quality but still does not match the teacher inversion performance. To reduce the gap between them, we propose the forward and reverse preservation losses aimed at making CD\({}^{m}\) and fCD\({}^{m}\) more consistent with each other and improve the inversion accuracy. These losses can additionally be turned on during training. Below, we denote the parameters of CD\({}^{m}\), fCD\({}^{m}\) as \(^{+},^{-}\), respectively.

The forward preservation loss modifies only fCD\({}^{m}\) and is described as follows:

\[_{}(^{-},^{+})=[d (_{^{-}}^{m}(_{^{+}}^{m}( {x}_{s_{t}^{m}})),_{s_{t}^{m}})]_ {^{-}},\] (4)

For simplicity, we omit some notation. In a nutshell, we sample a noisy image \(_{s_{t}^{m}}\) for a boundary time step \(s_{t}^{m}\), then make a prediction using CD\({}^{m}\) and force fCD\({}^{m}\) to predict the same \(_{s_{t}^{m}}\). This approach encourages CD\({}^{m}\) and fCD\({}^{m}\) to be consistent with each other.

The reverse preservation loss provides the same intuition but with a difference in the optimized model (CD\({}^{m}\) instead of fCD\({}^{m}\)) and prediction sequence. That is, we first make a prediction using fCD\({}^{m}\) and then use CD\({}^{m}\). We denote it as \(_{}(^{-},^{+})\). In our experiments, we calculate the preservation losses only for the unguided reverse process (\(w=1\)).

**Putting it all together** We present our final pipeline for the case where fCD\({}^{m}\) and CD\({}^{m}\) are trained jointly starting from the pretrained diffusion model. However, it is possible to learn them by one or take an already pretrained consistency model and learn the rest one. The final objective consists of two consistency losses with the proposed multi-boundary modification and two preservation losses:

\[_{}(^{+},^{-})=_{}(^{+})+_{}(^{-})+_{} _{}(^{-},^{+})+_{} _{}(^{+},^{-})\] (5)

In this way, the proposed approach can compete with the state-of-the-art inversion methods using heavyweight diffusion models. We present technical details about the training in Appendix A.

### Dynamic Classifier-Free Guidance Facilitates Inversion

As previously discussed, dynamic guidance  provides promising results for both faithful and diverse text-to-image generation. In this work, we reveal that dynamic CFG is also an effective technique for improving inversion accuracy as shown in Figure 3(b). Below, we delve into the questions when and why dynamic guidance might facilitate image inversion while preserving the generative performance. To answer these questions, we conduct experiments using Stable Diffusion 1.5 with DDIM solver for \(50\) steps and maximum CFG scale set to \(8.0\).

**Dynamic guidance for decoding** We start with the dynamic CFG analysis at the decoding stage using the unguided encoding process following the prior work . First, we wonder at which time steps the guidance has the most significant impact on reconstruction quality. To this end, we evaluate MSE between real and reconstructed images for different CFG turn-on thresholds \(\). If \(t>\), we set \(w=1.0\), otherwise, the CFG scale is set to its initial value \(8.0\). In Figure 3(a), we observe an exponential decrease in reconstruction error, implying that the absence of CFG at higher noise levels is essential for achieving more accurate inversion. Figure 3(b) confirms this intuition qualitatively. These results are consistent with , which also suggest turning off the guidance at high noise levels but motivating this from the perspective of diversity improvement.

Then, we investigate the influence of various \(_{1},_{2}\) from the CADS dynamic (Figure 1(a)) on the inversion and generation performance. We aim to identify an operating point providing both stronggeneration performance and faithful image inversion. Thus, we evaluate generation performance using the ImageReward  (IR) on top of randomly generated samples for \(1000\) COCO2014 prompts . The inversion accuracy is estimated in terms of MSE between original and reconstructed samples. Figure 4(a) presents the results for varying \(_{1}\) and \(_{2}\). It can be seen that several points for \(_{1} 0.7\) offer slightly lower text-to-image performance but exhibit significantly better reconstruction quality compared to the constant CFG scale, \(8.0\). Moreover, we notice that the settings where \(_{1}=_{2}\) perform similarly to those where \(_{1}<_{2}\). Consequently, in all our experiments, we consider a single \(\) representing the case where \(_{1}=_{2}\) and use \(=0.7\) and \(=0.8\). This means that CD\({}^{m}\) follows unguided sampling for \(t>\) and sets the initial CFG scale for \(t\).

Note that the setting with \(_{1}{=}_{2}\) corresponds to a step CFG function \(w(t)\), which yields a distinct advantage for distilled models. The linearly changing CFG scales are not applicable to the processes with large discretization steps, typical for distilled diffusion models. Therefore, such a CFG schedule needs to be distilled into the model during training, making it less flexible for different generation and editing settings. In contrast, the step CFG function enables dynamic CFG for already pretrained distilled models, operating with different constant CFG scales.

    & Enc, No CFG & Enc, d.CFG, \(0.6\) & Enc, d.CFG, \(0.8\) & Enc, CFG \\  Dec. No CFG & \(11.0\) & \(36.6\) & \(63.4\) & \(100.5\) \\ Dec. d.CFG \(0.6\) & \(11.4\) & \(23.5\) & \(67.8\) & \(102.6\) \\ Dec. d.CFG \(0.8\) & \(15.0\) & \(14.6\) & \(52.2\) & \(108.5\) \\ Dec.

Figure 5: (a) Trade-off between generation performance (IR) and reconstruction quality (MSE) provided by different \(_{1},_{2}\). (b) Generation examples for dynamic and constant CFG scales. The points around \(_{1}=_{2}=0.8\) provide preferable trade-off between generation and inversion performance.

Dynamic guidance for encoding

Next, we investigate the guidance role in tackling the encoding problem. In Table 1, we compare noise latents encoded using various guidance strategies. The quality of the noise latents is estimated by evaluating the generation performance starting from these latents with a fixed CFG scale of \(8.0\). As the performance measure, we calculate FID for \(5000\) image-text pairs from COCO .

We observe that the latents obtained with a consistently high CFG scale exhibit the worst generative performance, indicating their out-of-domain nature. While dynamic guidance produces significantly more plausible latents, it still falls short of the unguided encoding in most cases. To further validate these results, we estimate the negative log-likelihood (NLL) of the encoded latents under different CFG settings in Table 1 (Bottom). NLL is calculated with respect to the standard normal distribution. While NLL decreases for dynamic CFG with lower \(\), the encoding without guidance (\(w{=}1\)) provides the highest likelihood value. Therefore, in all our experiments, we maintain \(w{=}1\) for the encoding and train the forward distilled models (fCD) on the unguided teacher process.

## 4 Experiments

In the following experiments, we apply our approach to text-to-image diffusion models of different scales: SD1.5  and SDXL , and denote them iCD-SD1.5 and iCD-XL, respectively. We provide the training details in Appendix A.

Initially, we illustrate the inversion capability of the proposed framework. Then, we consider the text-guided image editing problem and demonstrate that our approach outperforms or is comparable to significantly more expensive baselines.

Before diving into the main experiments, we present a few generated samples using iCD-XL for 4 steps in Figure 6. Additional quantitative and qualitative results are provided in Appendix B. The results confirm that the distilled model demonstrates strong text-to-image generation performance.

### Inversion quality of iCD

Here, we analyze the reconstruction capabilities of iCD-SD1.5 under various configurations. Specifically, we explore the contribution of the different pipeline components, such as the number of steps, preservation losses, and dynamic CFG, to inversion performance. Our forward model is run without

Figure 6: Few examples of text-to-image generation using the iCD-XL model for 4 steps.

CFG (\(w=1\)), while for the reverse model, we consider two settings: unguided (\(w=1\)) and guided (\(w=8\)), both of which are important in practice.

**Configuration** To evaluate the inversion quality, we consider \(5\)K images and the corresponding prompts from the MS-COCO dataset . We measure the reconstruction quality using LPIPS , PSNR and cosine distance in the DinoV2  feature space. As for the reference, the teacher inversion with a disabled CFG scale is considered. For the dynamic guidance, we use \(=0.7\). The coefficients for the preservation losses are equal to \(_{}=1.5\) and \(_{}=1.5\).

**Results** The results are presented in Table 2. First, configurations (**A**-**C**) evaluate the number of the forward and inverse models inference steps. We observe that the reconstruction quality improves as the number of steps increases. In our main experiments, we consider \(3\) and \(4\) steps.

Then, (**E**-**G**) examine the preservation losses. In (**E**), we learn the forward model in the encoder  regime using the forward preservation loss only. This experiment reveals that the consistency loss contributes significantly to inversion performance. (**F**, **G**) show that both losses improve the inversion, with the latter approaching the quality of the teacher model.

Finally, we explore the dynamic CFG and preservation losses under the guided decoding setting (**I**-**K**) and compare them to the setting (**H**), which does not employ any boosting techniques. From the configurations (**I**, **J**, **K**), we can see that all techniques provide significant contribution to the reconstruction quality. In Figure 7, we visualize their influence on inversion. It can be seen that the dynamic CFG (**I**) is rather responsible for global object preservation, while the preservation losses (**J**,**K**) rather improve fine-grained details. We note that the final configuration (**K**) provides comparable inversion quality to the unguided process while preserving the editing capabilities due to the activated guidance. More visual examples of inversion and quantitative results are in Appendix C.

### Text-guided image editing

In this section, we apply the proposed iCD to the text-guided image editing problem. For the SD1.5 model, we use the Prompt-to-Prompt (P2P) method . We vary two hyperparameters: the cross-attention and self-attention steps balancing between editing strength and preservation of the reference image. We also apply our approach to MasaCTRL  in Appendix D. For the SDXL model, we follow the ReNoise  evaluation setting and just change the source prompt during decoding according to .

**Metrics** We measure editing performance using both automatic metrics and human-study. The former uses two metrics: 1) to estimate the preservation of the reference image, we calculate the cosine distance between images in the DinoV2 feature space; 2) as an editing quality measure, we use the CLIP score between the edited image and the target prompt. For human evaluation, we employ professional assessors who successfully completed assessment tasks. We show them the source and target prompts, reference image and two images produced with the methods under the comparison

and ask the question: _which of the edited images do you prefer more taking into account the editing strength and reference preservation?_

BenchmarksIn our experiments, we consider two benchmarks: PieBench  and a manually created COCO evaluation set based on text-paired images from the MS-COCO dataset . PieBench  consists of various types of editing, for example, replacement, addition, or deletion. We take \(420\) examples of realistic images, including all types of editing. COCO focuses solely on the replacement task as one of the most popular among practitioners. This benchmark contains \(140\) image-text pairs.

#### 4.2.1 Text-guided image editing with iCD-SD1.5

ConfigurationTo provide the editing with the SD1.5 model, we consider iCD using \(4\) forward and \(4\) reverse steps trained with both preservation losses (\(_{}=1.5\), \(_{}=1.5\)). In Appendix D, we also present the results for iCD using \(3\) steps, which is not much worse than the \(4\) step model. We set the hyperparameters of the dynamic CFG to \(=0.8\) and maximum CFG scale to \(19.0\).

#### 4.2.2 Text-guided image editing with iCD-XL

ConfigurationWe consider the configuration using \(4\) steps, \(=0.7\) and CFG scale equals \(8.0\).

BaselinesWe compare our approach to the recently proposed ReNoise , accurately following its guidelines. This method works with both distilled models (LCM-SDXL , SDXL-Turbo ) and original diffusion model, SDXL . However, even for the distilled models, a significant number of steps is required to achieve decent performance.

ResultsThe quantitative and qualitative comparisons are presented in Table 3 and Figure 10, respectively. According to the human evaluation, iCD-XL outperforms all ReNoise configurations. Based on the automatic evaluation, our approach provides better reference preservation (DinoV2 and CLIP score, I) while maintaining strong editing capabilities, as indicated by the CLIP score (T). We provide more visual examples in Appendix D.

## 5 Conclusion

The paper proposes a generalized consistency distillation framework that enables both accurate image inversion and solid generation performance using a few inference steps. Accompanied by the recently proposed dynamic guidance, the distilled models demonstrate highly efficient and accurate image manipulations, making a significant step towards real-time text-driven image editing.
