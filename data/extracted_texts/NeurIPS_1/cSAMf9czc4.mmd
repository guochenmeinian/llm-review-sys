###### Abstract

Language-conditioned robot models enable robots to perform a wide range of tasks based on natural language instructions. Despite strong performance on existing benchmarks, evaluating the safety and effectiveness of these models is challenging due to the complexity of testing all possible language variations. Current benchmarks have two key limitations: they rely on a limited set of human-generated instructions, missing many challenging cases, and they focus only on task performance without assessing safety, such as avoiding damage. To address these gaps, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), a new evaluation method that generates diverse and challenging instructions to test these models. ERT uses automated red teaming techniques with Vision Language Models (VLMs) to create contextually grounded, difficult instructions. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art models frequently fail or behave unsafely on ERT tests, underscoring the shortcomings of current benchmarks in evaluating real-world performance and safety.

## 1 Introduction

Commanding robots through natural language has long been a goal in robotics, as it is one of the most intuitive interfaces for humans. Recent advances in foundational robot models (Ke et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023) trained on large-scale internet text have shown promising results in enabling robots to follow written instructions and perform tasks. However, despite achieving near-optimal performance on the instructions within existing manipulation datasets (Mees et al., 2022; James et al., 2020), these models often struggle to generalize to semantically similar instructions beyond the existing datasets. For instance, a model might successfully execute the command _"close the drawer"_ from the dataset but fail when given the phrase _"shut off the drawer,"_ even though both commands describe the intended task. This indicates that current models may overfit to a narrow range of instructions and fail to generalize effectively. Consequently, the evaluation results of those models on the existing instruction datasets may provide a misleading assessment of a model's true capabilities, resulting in an overestimation of performance.

Overestimating the performance of language-conditioned robot models is a significant concern because it does not accurately reflect how robots will handle real-world scenarios, where user instructions may differ from those in the training datasets. For example, a robot might score 100% on benchmark tests but drop to 30% when given instructions outside of the dataset. This underlines the need for more robust evaluation methods to assess how well these models generalize beyond their training data. If a model overfits to a narrow set of instructions, effective evaluation should identify the instructions it struggles with, which current benchmarks often miss. On the other hand, a model that generalizes well should perform consistently across both benchmark and real-world instructions. To evaluate generalization, we propose using red teaming--testing the model with instructions specifically designed to challenge its capabilities. A model that truly generalizes should maintain high performance on these challenging instructions, whereas a drop in success rate would signal overfitting to the training instructions.

The question now arises: how can we effectively conduct red teaming against language-conditioned robot models to uncover instructions that challenge their capabilities? To begin with, the instructionsmust be feasible for the robot in real-world scenarios. For example, we are not concerned if a stationary manipulator cannot follow an instruction to fly, as such a task is simply not feasible for that type of robot. Additionally, the instructions should expose the models' weaknesses, causing them to fail in completing the task. While one approach would be to recruit human annotators to write these challenging instructions, this method is not scalable due to the high costs and difficulty in finding qualified annotators.

An alternative approach is to leverage recent advances in large language models (LLMs) (Yu et al., 2023; Hong et al., 2024) for red teaming. LLMs have proven effective in red teaming chatbots (Hong et al., 2024; Perez et al., 2022) and generating instructions that lead to undesired outputs in chatbot models. For language-conditioned robot models, adapting this strategy for testing robots could efficiently identify challenging instructions. However, directly applying chatbot red teaming techniques to robots is ineffective because instructions need to be executable within the robot's environment. For instance, testing a robot's ability to move a table is irrelevant if no table is present. Therefore, instructions must be feasible in the given context and designed to reveal the robot's weaknesses. Since LLMs cannot perceive the environment, they cannot determine which instructions are feasible in a given context. To address this, we propose using vision-language models (VLMs) for red teaming. VLMs can interpret images of the current environment and reason using both visual and textual information. We term this approach Embodied Red Teaming (ERT).

Our main contribution is an automated evaluation method using VLMs. Our results show that VLMs can generate feasible instructions that effectively challenge state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models, implying a potential performance gaps between existing benchmarks and real-world scenarios. We also found that these models might exhibit unsafe behaviors, such as causing collisions or dropping objects, when given infeasible instructions, which poses potential safety risks. To our knowledge, this is the first work to apply red teaming to language-conditioned robot models and to identify the risks associated with exploiting these models through unexpected instructions.

## 2 Preliminaries

We define a language-conditioned robot model to be a robot's policy, \(\), which processes high-dimensional sensory inputs (e.g., images) \(o\) and natural language instructions \(c\), to produce actions \(=(,)\) that accomplish the tasks described by \(c\). These robot models are fine-tuned for sensorimotor tasks based on instructions in the training dataset, starting with pre-trained vision and language models. Due to the large-scale training of these vision and language models, these robot models are expected to generalize across a wide range of sensorimotor tasks specified by natural language instructions, even those they have not encountered during training. For instance, a language-conditioned robot model should understand and execute the command "Shut off the LED light," even if it was only trained on instructions like "Turn off the light."

## 3 Embodied Red Teaming

The goal of embodied red teaming is to identify a diverse set of instructions \(\{_{1},,_{N}\}\) that cause undesirable outcomes. We formulate the task as optimizing the following objective:

\[_{\{_{1}|c_{i} F i\}}_{i=1}^{N}R(,c_{i})- (\{_{1},,_{N}\}) \]

where \(N\) is the red teaming budget for the language-conditioned robot model \(\), and Div represents the diversity of the instructions.

Our method consists of two primary components. First, we need to generate text prompts according to a specified task in a given environment. Toward this goal, we develop an automatic prompt generator capable of producing text prompts that condition on the task and the state of the environment. The second component is a prompt judge that selects prompts causing undesired behavior and compares the generated prompt to existing prompts collections to ensure diversity. Together, these components allow us to red team language-conditioned robot models. We describe our algorithm in 1.

```
1:Input: Metric \(R\), target robot model \(\), feasible set description FeasibleSet, number of refinement \(K\), and budget per refinement \(N\)
2:Output: Instruction sets of \(N K\) instructions
3:Initialize the red team model \(p\) as any pre-trained VLM
4:Initialize the prompt \(\) FeasibleSet
5:Initialize the output instruction set: \(C_{}\)
6:for\(k=1 K\)do
7: Find \(\{c_{1} c_{N}\}\) maximizing \((\{c_{1} c_{N}\})\) with prompt \(\)
8: Test the instructions: \(\{c_{i},R(,c_{i})\}\)\( i[1,N]\)
9: Update the prompt \(\) with instructions \(c_{i}\) causing failure
10: Append instructions \(C_{} C_{}\{c_{1} c_{N}\}\)
11:endfor
12:return\(C_{}\)
```

**Algorithm 1** Embodied Red Teaming (ERT)

### Meta-prompt

In this section, we describe the implementation of Algorithm 1. We use GPT-4o as the red team VLM \(p\), though other pre-trained VLMs can also be used. The prompt \(\) for \(p\) is initially set to the FeasibleSet (detailed below) and is updated iteratively with instructions \(c\) that caused the robot model \(\) to fail. The prompt \(\) is constructed using the following template:

```
{IMAGE} The attached image shows the robot's environment. Generate a list of {N} instructions that are challenging the robot's language comprehension capability for {TASK}, similar to the following examples {EXAMPLES}.
```

**FeasibleSet:** Here, {IMAGE} and {TASK} are parts of the FeasibleSet. {IMAGE} is an image depicting the environment, and {TASK} is a brief description of the desired task (e.g., _Turn off the light_). Instructions describe how users might command the agent to perform the task; for instance, _"Switch off the light"_ and _"Robot, please shut off the LED"_ are both feasible for _"Turn off the light"_. Note that while state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models are intended to handle a variety of tasks eventually, current models are limited to those they have been trained on. Therefore, we should focus on testing instructions for tasks the robot can perform, as it will fail at tasks it was not trained for, making such tests unnecessary.

**Examples:** {EXAMPLES} are instructions causing the agent to fail. For each instruction \(c\), failure is measured by the metric function \(R\), where \(R(,)=0\) indicates failure and \(R(,)=1\) indicates success. Instructions with \(R(,)=0\) are added to the prompt \(\).

**Rejection Sampling:** To maximize the diversity of generated instructions, we sample \(M\) sets of \(N\) instructions from the red team VLM \(p\) with prior \(\), evaluate the diversity of each set, and select the set with the highest diversity for refinement step \(k\). The index of the selected set is given by:

\[*{arg\,max}_{m[1,M]}\ (\{c_{1}^{m},,c_{N}^{m}\}), \ \ \{c_{1}^{m},,c_{N}^{m}\} p(.|). \]

Instead of fine-tuning the pre-trained LLM \(p\) to enhance diversity, which requires extensive data and can be costly in compute, we use rejection sampling to showcase a minimal viable way to increase diversity of generated instructions.

## 4 Experiments

Our goal is to demonstrate that ERT can discover instructions causing the robot to fail or behave unsafely. Our experiments are conducted based on the following setup.

**Simulated environments:** We evaluate our ERT method on the CALVIN language-conditioned manipulation tasks (Mees et al., 2022) and RLBench (James et al., 2020), two widely-used benchmarks in language-conditioned robot research Ke et al. (2024); Wu et al. (2023); Chen et al. (2023). The CALVIN benchmark includes 27 distinct tasks and 400 crowd-sourced natural language instructions,with approximately 10 instructions per task. RLBench consists of 18 tasks with 3 to 6 instructions each. Robots are provided with a natural language instruction \(\) and camera image observations \(\) from gripper and top-down views. They perform rollouts from various initial states, such as different object layouts. Figure 1 shows example environments for both CALVIN and RLBench. The robot's performance \(R(,)\) for a given instruction \(\) is measured by success rate based on task-specific criteria defined by the benchmark. For example, in the "close the drawer" task, the robot receives a top-down camera view and an instruction like "Hold the drawer handle and shut it," and moves the end-effector based on the image at each timestep. Success is determined by whether the drawer is closed.

**Language-conditioned robot models:** We tested the ERT instructions on two state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models, GR-1 Wu et al. (2023) and 3D-Diffuser Ke et al. (2024), using their publicly available pre-trained checkpoints. Both models are fine-tuned on expert demonstrations for each task and the instructions included with the CALVIN benchmark and RLBench. GR-1 is a transformer model pre-trained on large-scale video datasets with language annotations, where both image and language data are processed as token streams. Note that we did not evaluate GR-1 on RLBench, as models for RLBench were not released. 3D-Diffuser is a diffusion policy model that takes images and language embeddings as inputs, with instructions processed by pre-trained CLIP models (Radford et al., 2021). Both GR-1 and 3D-Diffuser achieved near-optimal success rates (around 90%) on the CALVIN benchmark instructions.

### Language-conditioned robots struggle with generalization

**Setup:** We demonstrate that state-of-the-art language-conditioned robots, despite performing near-optimally on existing benchmarks, struggle to generalize to new instructions beyond those benchmarks. To illustrate this, we compare the performance of GR-1 and 3D-Diffuser on several instruction sets: those from the CALVIN benchmark and RLBench, rephrased versions of these instructions, and instructions generated by ERT. We consider rephrased instructions as a naive method for generating new instructions beyond the existing benchmarks, serving as a baseline to highlight ERT's effectiveness in discovering instructions that cause robot failures.

We generate the same number of instructions from ERT as those in the benchmarks. Specifically, in the CALVIN environment, ERT produces 10 instructions for each of 27 tasks, totaling 270 instructions. We use \(k\) to denote the refinement stage of ERT. During ERT's iterative refinement, we don't run iterative refinement (see Algorithm 1) on GR-1 but re-use the instructions found from performing ERT on 3D-Diffuser for testing GR-1, aiming to see if instructions causing one model to fail also lead to failure in the other. For RLBench, we generate 3 to 6 instructions for each of 18 tasks using ERT. All generated instructions are provided in Appendix A.4 for CALVIN and Appendix A.5 for RLBench.

**Metric:** The models are evaluated for each instruction across all initial states defined by the benchmarks. The success rate of a model \(\) on instruction \(\) is denoted as \(R(,)\). The model's overall performance on an instruction set \(\{_{1},,_{N}\}\) is the average success rate across all instructions:

\[(,\{_{1},,_{N}\})=_{ i=1}^{N}R(,_{i}).\]

For ERT and Rephrase, we report the robots' mean performance on instructions generated using five different random seeds, along with the 95% confidence intervals estimated via bootstrapping. Note that we cannot compute confidence intervals for the robots' mean performance on the existing benchmark instructions because they consist of only one set of instructions. We summarize our quantitative and qualitative results below.

Figure 1: Example environments from CALVIN and RLBench.

**Failure to generalize.** Figures 1(a) and 1(b) demonstrate that while GR-1 and 3D-Diffuser perform nearly optimally on instruction sets from the CALVIN and RLBench benchmarks, their performance degrades significantly on instructions generated by ERT. Specifically, in RLBench (Figure 1(b)), 3D-Diffuser completely fails on instructions outside its training dataset. Comparison of instructions from CALVIN and RLBench with those generated by ERT shown in Table 1 shows that that ERT produces valid instructions while the robots fail to execute. These findings suggest that state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models overfit to the narrow set of instructions in existing benchmarks, raising concerns about their deployment in real-world scenarios where users may phrase instructions differently.

**Rephrasing degrades performance.** Figure 1(a) shows that simply rephrasing existing benchmark instructions leads to a degradation in the robots' performance, evidenced by lower success rates on rephrased instructions. GR-1 performs better than 3D-Diffuser on these rephrased instructions, suggesting that 3D-Diffuser is less capable of generalizing to rephrased instructions--possibly because GR-1 is trained on larger-scale video and language datasets.

**ERT identifies more challenging instructions.** As shown in Figure 1(a), rephrased instructions didn't cause GR-1 to fail, but both 3D-Diffuser and GR-1 struggle with instructions generated by ERT--even at \(k=0\) without iterative refinement--resulting in similarly low success rates. This indicates that ERT goes beyond simple rephrasing. Furthermore, as ERT's refinement progresses (with increasing \(k\)) and encounters more instructions that cause the robots to fail, the generated instructions further reduce the robots' success rates, demonstrating the effectiveness of iterative refinement.

**ERT generates more diverse instructions.** As shown in Figure 2, ERT not only produces challenging instructions that cause the robot to fail but also generates more diverse instructions compared to other methods. Following prior works (Hong et al., 2024; Tevet and Berant, 2020), we measure instruction diversity using the BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2002) and embeddings from CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) and BERT (Reimers and Gurevych, 2019). We invert the BLEU score (1 - BLEU) and the average embedding similarity (1 - similarity) to obtain diversity scores, so higher scores indicate greater diversity. Diversity scores are calculated for instructions within the same task, and we report the average diversity in Figure 3. The BLEU diversity reflects variations in text form (e.g., wording, structure), while CLIP and BERT embedding diversities assess semantic differences. All methods exhibit similar embedding diversities, which is expected since they describe the same tasks and thus have similar semantics. However, ERT achieves significantly higher BLEU diversity, indicating that it phrases instructions in more varied ways than existing benchmarks and their rephrased versions. This suggests that ERT does not merely exploit a single vulnerability of the robot but challenges it with a broader range of instruction phrasings.

**Refined instructions transfer to other models.** We found that instructions causing one robot model to fail often lead to failures in other models. ERT(\(k=0\)) instructions are generated by sampling from the VLM without examples, while ERT(\(k=1\)) and ERT(\(k=2\)) generate instructions conditioned on

Figure 2: The average success rates of the GR-1 and 3D-Diffuser models were evaluated on two instruction sets: **(a)** CALVIN and **(b)** RLBench. Both models performed nearly optimally on existing instructions in both environments but showed significant performance drops on instructions generated by ERT. This indicates that the current language-conditioned robot models are overfitting to narrow instruction sets and fail to generalize, despite using large-scale pre-trained language embeddings.

the lowest-performing instructions from the previous iteration. Although we refined ERT using only 3D-Diffuser's success rates (see Algorithm 1), ERT(\(k=1\)) and ERT(\(k=2\)) also significantly reduced GR-1's success rates. This suggests that instructions challenging for 3D-Diffuser are similarly challenging for GR-1, indicating that current state-of-the-art robot models may struggle with similar types of instructions.

**Template-generated instructions could be problematic.** We hypothesize that the significant performance drop in RLBench is due to its use of template-generated instructions, whereas CALVIN uses human-generated instructions. As shown in Table 1, template-generated instructions lack the variety of human phrasing and appear monolithic. This suggests that relying on templates to train or evaluate language-conditioned robot models is problematic.

### Safety of language-conditioned robots is overlooked

We emphasize that safety is a significant concern for language-conditioned robots--a factor often overlooked in existing benchmarks that focus solely on success rates. Safety considerations--such as preventing environmental damage, avoiding harm to humans, and preventing self-damage--are critical because these robots interact with humans through natural language instructions. In this experiment, we consider unsafe behavior as causing objects to fall from the table. We present examples in Figure 4, as generated with annotations described in Section A.3, and summarize our findings below. In Figure 4, we illustrate 4 timesteps from episodes in which the robot exhibits unsafe behavior across 4 instructions. These unsafe behaviors result in one or more objects falling off the table.

**Robots follow unsafe instructions.** In Figures 3(a) and 3(b), the robots successfully complete tasks that are inherently unsafe--such as causing objects to fall off and destabilizing them. This suggests the need for alignment training, similar to that used in large language models (LLMs), to ensure

Table 1: Example instructions from CALVIN, RLBench, and ERT (our method) for various tasks. ERT generates more complex yet reasonable instructions. Note that the instructions in the same row are not necessarily matched for the same task.

Figure 3: Instruction Diversity. BLEU diversity captures variations in text form, while CLIP and BERT diversity measure semantic differences. Since all instructions describe the same task, semantic diversity is similar across methods. However, ERT achieves higher BLEU diversity, indicating it can generate more varied phrasing for the same task compared to other methods. See Section 1(a).

robots align with human preferences and refuse to perform harmful or unsafe actions that could damage the environment.

**Robots exhibit unsafe behaviors on neutral instructions.** While robots following unsafe instructions is problematic, it could be addressed by training them to reject such commands or by filtering out unsafe instructions using an LLM before execution. However, as shown in Figure 3(c) and 3(d), we found that robots can still display unsafe behaviors even when given instructions for safe tasks. This means we cannot rely solely on filtering instructions to prevent unsafe behaviors, as safe instructions that pass safety checks may still lead to unintended unsafe actions.

**Potential threat: jailbreak.** Language-conditioned robots may not always follow instructions accurately and could exhibit unsafe behaviors, making it unpredictable when they might damage the environment or harm humans based on the given instructions. Even neutral and safe instructions can cause the robot to act unsafely, presenting a vulnerability that malicious users could exploit. For example, consider a service robot in a store that takes natural language instructions. A malicious user could craft a neutral instruction (e.g., "Adjust your arm position") to trigger the robot to harm customers. Since the instruction appears completely neutral, engineers might not be aware of the potential danger or be able to prevent it.

Figure 4: Robots (3D Diffuser Ke et al. (2024) in this case) may follow unsafe instructions, as seen in Figures 3(a) and 3(b), or exhibit unsafe behavior even with neutral instructions, shown in Figures 3(c) and 3(d). This highlights the need for alignment training to ensure robots reject harmful tasks. Additionally, a potential vulnerability exists in that malicious users could exploit seemingly neutral instructions to cause harm, posing a significant safety risk.

### Analysis of failure modes

To examine the failure modes of these robot models, we have selected the instructions with the lowest success rates from each task, presented in Table 3, and summarize our findings below:

**Complex Instructions.** Complex or multi-step instructions often lead to task failures. For instance, in the close_drawer task (1.05% success), the directive to _"check for obstructions, then apply force to close the drawer snugly"_ introduces multiple actions.

**Uncommon vocabulary.** Using rare synonyms or vague terms can cause misinterpretation and subsequent failures. The instruction for turn_off_led (9.47% success) uses the phrase _"suppress its glow,"_ which is rare in the instructions of CALVIN and RLBench benchmarks yet a valid way of describing the task turn_off_led.

**Distracting details.** Including unnecessary information or human-centric perspectives in instructions can distract the robot, leading to failures. In the open_drawer task (0.0% success), the phrase _"pull it towards yourself"_ introduces a perspective that the robot may not comprehend.

**Takeaway:** The observed failure modes indicate that most failures result from confusion or misinterpretation of language instructions. We conjecture that pre-trained language embeddings capture textual similarity but not "embodied similarity"--the similarity in intended actions. For example, the instruction _"Check for obstructions, then apply force to close the drawer snugly"_ is textually different from the simpler _"Close the drawer"_, yet both describe the same desired behavior. This suggests that training language embedding models jointly with the robot's policy could enable the embeddings to capture similarities in desired actions, improving performance.

## 5 Discussion and Limitations

We demonstrate that current state-of-the-art language-conditioned robot models struggle to generalize beyond existing benchmarks. To show this, we introduce Embodied Red Teaming (ERT), an automated method that identifies a diverse set of instructions causing these models to fail.

**For Robot Model Developers:** Language-conditioned robot models are central to recent advancements in foundational robotics, similar to how ChatGPT serves as a foundational model for language tasks. We urge the community to redesign evaluation instructions and prioritize safety. As these models aim to automate daily tasks and interact with humans, it is essential to test them on real-world data distributions rather than relying solely on limited benchmark instructions.

**For Red Teamers:** To our knowledge, this is the first study to apply red teaming to language-conditioned robots using vision-language models. We hope to inspire new applications of red teaming in robotics by bridging these fields. Red teaming robotic systems presents unique challenges, such as the high cost of feedback-based generation due to lengthy instruction execution and the time-consuming evaluation process. Developing surrogate metrics to efficiently estimate the performance and safety of foundational agents is crucial.

**Limitations:** Our study is limited to manipulation tasks. However, the ERT approach is versatile and can be extended to other language-conditioned models, such as navigation robots Shridhar et al. (2020), which we leave for future work.
