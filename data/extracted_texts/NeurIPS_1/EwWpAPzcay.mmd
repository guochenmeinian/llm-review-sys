###### Abstract

3D reconstruction from multi-view images is one of the fundamental challenges in computer vision and graphics. Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality 3D reconstruction. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representation and tile-based splatting techniques, bypassing the expensive neural field querying. Despite its potential, 3DGS encounters challenges such as needle-like artifacts, suboptimal geometries, and inaccurate normals caused by the Gaussians converging into anisotropic shapes with one dominant variance. We propose using the effective rank analysis to examine the shape statistics of 3D Gaussian primitives, and identify the Gaussians indeed converge into needle-like shapes with the effective rank 1. To address this, we introduce the effective rank as a regularization, which constrains the structure of the Gaussians. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like artifacts. The approach can be integrated as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality without compromising visual fidelity.

## 1 Introduction

Creating 3D models from multiple images is a central challenge in computer vision and graphics. Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF)  have revolutionized this area by demonstrating remarkable capabilities in novel view synthesis through implicit neural fields and differentiable rendering techniques. Despite their impressive 3D reconstruction quality, the training and rendering processes of NeRF-based methods are computationally intensive, posing significant challenges for real-time applications. To improve training and rendering efficiency, various acceleration techniques, such as baking with shell  and grid representations , have been introduced. While these solutions enhance efficiency to some extent, there are still limitations for real-time interactive scenarios.

Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a promising technique capable of real-time rendering with high-quality results. This method utilizes 3D Gaussian representations and tile-based splatting techniques instead of expensive neural field querying, making it feasible to apply the technique in practical applications. This opens up new possibilities in areas that require faster rendering, such as virtual and augmented reality, gaming, and real-time avatars.

However, despite its potential, 3DGS encounters several challenges in terms of geometry reconstruction, including noisy rendering results with needle-like artifacts, especially in novel and extreme views far from the training images. These issues stem from the primitive-based nature of 3DGS, where individual primitives lack geometric constraints.

For accurate geometry reconstruction, it is well known that the density field should be concentrated near the surface . To this end, previous efforts, such as SuGaR , have focused on regularizing the 3D Gaussians to be flatter, _i.e._, regularizing the primitives into anisotropic Gaussians with one of its variance very small. Similarly, 2DGS  utilizes 2D Gaussians instead of 3D Gaussians to force this effect.

While the flatness of Gaussians is necessary for proper alignment with the surface, we argue that flatness alone is insufficient for accurately representing surface geometry. Gaussians should also avoid being needle-like or highly anisotropic, where one variance dominates the others. Needle-like Gaussians hinder accurate reconstruction as they cover only a negligible portion of the surface and produce spiky artifacts. Instead, disk-like Gaussians are preferable as they cover meaningful areas and contribute effectively to surface reconstruction.

However, existing methods fail to adequately differentiate between disk-like and needle-like Gaussians, as both can exhibit one scale that is near or exactly zero. Empirically, we find that most Gaussians converge into anisotropic forms, becoming needle-like with small scales along two axes due to the absence of appropriate regularization mechanisms.

To directly examine the shape statistics (whether their geometries are disk-like or needle-like) of 3D Gaussian primitives and understand their structural changes during training, we first propose performing the effective rank analysis on the covariance matrices of Gaussians. The effective rank , which is a real-valued and differentiable extension of the integer rank, can be used to monitor the training dynamics and structural transformations of Gaussian primitives. Indeed, our analysis reveals that the effective ranks of Gaussians approach an effective rank of 1 (_erank_-1), resulting in needle-like shapes in 3DGS and other methods, such as SuGaR  and 2DGS .

Additionally, we propose using the effective rank as a regularization term to constrain the structure of the Gaussians. The differentiable nature of effective rank, with its concave logarithmic term providing stable gradients, makes it directly applicable to continuous optimization problems. Our new regularization method enhances normal and geometry reconstruction while reducing needle-like

artifacts, particularly in novel view scenarios. Furthermore, our effective rank regularization can be applied as an add-on module to other 3DGS variants, improving their quality.

The main contributions of our work are as follows:

* We are firstly analyzing the dynamics of Gaussian primitive structures using the effective rank in the optimizing process, discovering that Gaussians converge into anisotropic forms with one dominant variance.
* We propose an effective rank regularization method that alleviates needle-like artifacts in 3DGS rendering and improves geometric reconstruction.
* Our approach is an add-on module that can be integrated with other 3DGS variants, and demonstrate that our method enhances 3D geometry reconstruction without compromising visual quality.

## 3 Preliminaries

### 3D Gaussian splatting

3DGS  represents a scene with a set of learnable 3D Gaussian primitives \(\{_{k} k=1,,K\}\), where each 3D Gaussian \(_{k}\) consists of mean \(_{k}^{3 1}\), covariance \(_{k}^{3 3}\), point opacity \(_{k}\) and view-dependent color \(c_{k}\) in spherical harmonics. Covariance matrix \(_{k}=_{k}_{k}_{k}^{}_{k} ^{}\) is positive semi-definite, where \(_{k}=(_{k})\) is a scaling matrix, \(_{k}=(s_{k1};s_{k2};s_{k3})^{3 1}\) is a scale parameter, and \(_{k}^{3 3}\) is a rotation matrix parameterized by a quaternion. A 3D Gaussian primitive can be represented in 3D space as:

\[_{k}()=e^{-(-_{k})^{T} _{k}^{-1}(-_{k})}. \]

The primitives are then rasterized via differentiable volume splatting. Specifically, a 3D Gaussian is projected to 2D screen space as \(_{k}^{{}^{}}=_{k}^{ }^{}\), where \(\) is a world-to-camera transform and \(\) is the Jacobian of the affine approximation of the projection matrix . The covariance and mean

of the projected Gaussian \(_{k}^{2D}()\) are then obtained by removing the third column and row of \(_{k}^{}\) and simply projecting \(_{k}\) to screen space, respectively. Finally, the Gaussians are alpha-blended in the order of depth as:

\[()=_{k=1}^{K}c_{k}_{k}_{j=1}^{k-1}(1- _{j}_{j}^{2D}()), \]

where \(\) is a screen space coordinate. The rendered images are supervised with photometric loss \(L\) for 3D primitive optimization similar to NeRF .

As Gaussians are initialized by sparse SfM points, Adaptive Density Control (ADC) is designed for densification during optimization. Specifically, ADC subsamples and splits Gaussians that satisfy the condition:

\[\|}\|_{2}=\|_{i }_{i}} _{i}}{}\|_{2}>, \]

where \(\) and \(_{i}\) denote a set of pixel indices and the \(i\)-th pixel, respectively, and \(\) is a predefined threshold. The intuition behind Eq. 3 is that regions not yet well reconstructed exhibit large view-space positional gradients. This occurs because the optimization process attempts to move the Gaussians to correct these areas, so densifying such Gaussians can effectively increase expressibility.

### Effective rank

Consider a real-valued non-all-zero \(M N\) matrix \(\). The singular value decomposition (SVD) of \(\) can be expressed as \(=\), where \(\) and \(\) are unitary matrices of sizes \(M M\) and \(N N\) respectively, and \(\) is a diagonal matrix of size \(M N\) containing the real positive singular values in descending order:

\[_{1}_{2}_{L} 0, \]

where \(L=\{M,N\}\). The _singular value distribution_ is then defined as

\[q_{i}=}{\|\|_{1}},\;i=1,2,,L, \]

where \(=(_{1},_{2},,_{L})^{T}\), and \(\|\|_{1}\) denotes \(_{1}\)-norm.

**Definition 1** (Effective rank).: The effective rank  of the matrix \(\) is concisely defined as \(()=\{H(q_{1},q_{2},,q_{L})\},\) where \(H(q_{1},q_{2},,q_{L})\) is the Shannon entropy given by

\[H(q_{1},q_{2},,q_{L})=-_{i=1}^{L}q_{i} q_{i}. \]

## 4 Method

In Section 4.1, we introduce the effective rank analysis to inspect the geometries of Gaussians of 3DGS and its variants, shedding light on their underlying structures. Based on the findings from our effective rank analysis, we propose a novel effective rank regularization method in Section 4.2.

### Effective rank analysis of 3D Gaussians

We propose to analyze the effective rank to investigate the structural dynamics of individual 3D Gaussians by calculating the effective rank of the covariance matrix of the Gaussians. The covariance matrix of the 3D Guassians is defined as \(_{k}=_{k}_{k}_{k}^{T} _{k}^{T}\), and the diagonal matrix after SVD is \(=_{k}_{k}^{T}\), with real positive singular values in a descending order as follows:

\[s_{1}^{2} s_{2}^{2} s_{3}^{2}>0, \]

where we omit subscript \(k\) of \(_{k}\) for brevity.

Accordingly, we can derive the effective rank of a 3D Gaussian \(_{k}\) with the covariance matrix \(_{k}\). The entropy term is \(H(_{k}):=H(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3}):=-_{i=1}^{3}q_{i} q_{i},\) with

\[=(q_{1},q_{2},q_{3})=(^{2}}{S},^{2}}{S}, ^{2}}{S}), S=_{i=1}^{3}s_{i}^{2}, \]

and the effective rank of a 3D Gaussian \(_{k}\) with the covariance matrix \(_{k}\) is defined as follows:

\[(_{k}):=\{H(_{k})\}. \]

The effective rank, being a differentiable extension of an integer rank, is a suitable tool for geometric analysis of 3D Gaussians since it jointly considers all of the scale parameters and can identify the relative scales of the three axes. The advantage of effective rank becomes more apparent when compared to recent works that only analyze individual or pair-wise variances of the 3D Gaussians . Such approaches do not fully represent the geometry of Gaussians, potentially leading to planar and needle-like Gaussians being categorized together. For better understanding, we visualize the effective ranks of a sphere and 2D disks in Fig. 3.

With the distinct advantage of our approach, we can differentiate between needle-like Gaussians, which have effective ranks close to 1, and planar disk-like Gaussians. To reconstruct a scene with an accurate surface, we need Gaussians that represent a plane that aligns and concentrates well with the surface . Ideally, 3D Gaussians with \((_{k}) 2\) are preferred, but Gaussians with an effective rank smaller than 2 are also required for representing thin and elongated objects and patterns. However, the needle-like Gaussians with \((_{k}) 1\) are undesirable because they account for a negligible region of the surface and produce degenerate results in novel views.

The first row of Fig. 2 (green graph) shows the effective rank histogram for 3DGS during training. As the model converges, the number of 3D Gaussians with \((_{k}) 1\) increases, indicating overfitting without improvements in PSNR and Chamfer distance metrics (metrics are provided in the Appendix A.5, Table 5). This indicates that the majority of "flat" Gaussians (singular values close to \(0\)) are actually needle-like (\((_{k}) 1\)), rather than disk-like (\((_{k}) 2\)). It is also interesting to note that 3DGS naturally forms a small mode at \((_{k})=2\), indicating an observed preference that can be further strengthened with our regularization.

Despite having different geometric constraints on the Gaussians, SuGaR  (the second row in Fig. 2) and 2DGS  (the third row in Fig. 2) also exhibit a similar tendency to have a large amount of needle-like Gaussians with a single dominant variance along an axis. Notice that all Gaussians in 2DGS start with an effective rank of exactly \(2\), but the majority still fail to remain disk-shaped and instead become needle-like 2D Gaussians.

### Optimization

The real-valued and differentiable nature of the effective rank allows us to utilize it as a regularization objective to impose structural constraints on 3D Gaussians. Specifically, our goal is to keep the effective rank of 3D Gaussians below 2, thereby promoting planar shapes, while penalizing Gaussians with an effective rank close to 1 to minimize needle-like artifacts. Although disk-like Gaussians with \((_{k}) 2\) are preferred, shapes with \((_{k})<2\) are also essential for representing complex geometries. We propose an effective rank regularization term that increases exponentially as the effective rank nears 1, strongly penalizing such Gaussians:

\[_{}=_{k}_{}(-((_{k})-1+),0)+s_{3}, \]

where \(=1 10^{-5}\) ensures numerical stability, and \(s_{3}\) is the smallest scale parameter of \(_{k}\). The regularization effectively constrains the effective rank of Gaussian primitives when added to the baselines, as shown in the purple graphs of Fig. 2. Also, the regularization is scheduled to be applied from 7000-iteration, adhering to the coarse-to-fine training paradigm, which enables stable training upon early iterations with \((_{k})>2\) Gaussians.

ADC algorithmWe adopt the revised version of the densification algorithm presented in [4; 36], which densifies Gaussians based on the summation of norms instead of the norm of the summation in

distance and mean PSNR. The "+e" symbol indicates the addition of the effective rank regularization (with fixed densification) to the baseline methods.

The results show that methods enhanced with our add-on term outperform the baselines. Notably, applying our regularization to 3DGS (3DGS+e) results in a significant improvement in geometry reconstruction, demonstrating the effectiveness of the regularization. This supports our hypothesis that reducing needle-like Gaussians and achieving flatness as in Fig. 2 improves performance. Additionally, the figure shows that SuGaR contains both needle-like and non-planar Gaussians with effective ranks greater than 2. By attaining flatness and removing spikes through effective rank regularization, we achieve a substantial performance gain for SuGaR (SuGaR+e).

GOF and 2DGS already incorporate well-designed regularization terms, such as depth distortion loss , to align Gaussians with surfaces and enhance geometry reconstruction. Furthermore, 2DGS explicitly uses 2D Gaussians as their primitive, inherently achieving planarity. Nonetheless, our method prevents Gaussians from converging into needles in both approaches (and enforces flatness in GOF), resulting in performance gains.

Fig. 4 shows mesh reconstruction results, where baseline methods often exhibit empty holes in the reconstructed meshes. Our regularization term enforces disk-like Gaussians, reducing such holes and proving advantageous for surface reconstruction.

Fig. 5 and the first row of Fig. 1 display normal reconstruction results. In Fig. 5, the resulting image from GOF shows spiky artifacts and a hollow surface on the pear. Similarly to the mesh results, needle-like Gaussians often fail to cover the entire area, leaving empty holes or transparent regions, resulting in hollow or incomplete reconstructions. The effective rank regularization mitigates these noisy artifacts, leading to a more accurate reconstruction of the underlying geometry.

Novel view synthesisSince 3D reconstruction from 2D images is an ill-posed problem, Gaussians tend to overfit to the training views, converging into needle-like shapes and causing spiky artifacts in test views, as shown in Fig. 1 (b), (c), and Fig.6. For better understanding, we visualize Gaussians with \((_{k})<1.02\) (scale ratio of approximately 20:1 or larger) in red. Our method mitigates overfitting and the resulting artifacts by enforcing structural priors on the Gaussians.

Figure 4: Visualization of the reconstructed mesh using TSDF. Baseline methods often exhibit empty holes, while our regularization term enforces disk-like Gaussians, reducing such artifacts and improving surface reconstruction.

Figure 5: Normal reconstruction results on the DTU dataset. Needle-like Gaussians often leave empty holes or transparent regions, resulting in hollow or incomplete reconstructions, as seen on the pear surface. The effective rank regularization significantly mitigates these artifacts, leading to more accurate geometry reconstruction.

Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 7, our method adaptively preserves some elongated Gaussians when necessary, allowing the representation of slender structures. The results indicate that while 3DGS heavily relies on needle-like Gaussians to represent the scene, our method limits their use to only when required, leading to improved novel view synthesis performance.

We also provide quantitative results in Table 1, where we report the average PSNR for the DTU dataset. Results for Mip-NeRF360 are reported in Table 3 in the Appendix A.5. While many geometry regularization techniques degrade visual quality, our method does not exhibit this trade-off and actually shows slight improvements by properly constraining the shape of the Gaussians.

EfficiencyAs shown in Fig. 7 and Table 4, the efficacy of disk-like Gaussians in 3D reconstruction, compared to needle-like Gaussians, leads to a better memory footprint. The average storage usage for the DTU and Mip-NeRF360 datasets is reported in Table 4 (Appendix A.5).

### Ablations

Our method comprises two key components: (a) the fixed densification (ADC) algorithm and (b) the effective rank regularization. We performed an ablation study on these components to observe their performance gains compared to the naive 3DGS method. Table 2 shows the Chamfer distance and PSNR measured on the DTU dataset. The results indicate that both components contribute to performance gains in geometry reconstruction and novel view synthesis tasks. Additionally, incorporating techniques such as depth distortion loss [13; 36] can further enhance the best-performing model (row +a+b+c). These techniques are discussed in the Appendix A.2.

## 6 Conclusion

LimitationsOur regularization term constrains individual Gaussians but does not account for the local and global structure of the scene. Thus, it may be beneficial to pair our method with structure-aware regularizations, such as the depth distortion loss , which considers the Gaussians
