###### Abstract

Self-evaluation using large language models (LLMs) has proven valuable not only in benchmarking but also methods like reward modeling, constitutional AI, and self-refinement. But new biases are introduced due to the same LLM acting as both the evaluator and the evaluatee. One such bias is self-preference, where an LLM evaluator scores its own outputs higher than others' while human annotators consider them of equal quality. But do LLMs actually recognize their own outputs when they give those texts higher scores, or is it just a coincidence? In this paper, we investigate if self-recognition capability contributes to self-preference. We discover that, out of the box, LLMs such as GPT-4 and Llama 2 have non-trivial accuracy at distinguishing themselves from other LLMs and humans. By fine-tuning LLMs, we discover a linear correlation between self-recognition capability and the strength of self-preference bias; using controlled experiments, we show that the causal explanation resists straightforward confounders. We discuss how self-recognition can interfere with unbiased evaluations and AI safety more generally.

## 1 Introduction

Self-evaluation is becoming a prominent part of the large language model (LLM) lifecycle. In methods like reward modeling (Leike et al., 2018; Stiennon et al., 2020), model-based benchmarks (Shashidhar et al., 2023; Zeng et al., 2023; Yuan et al., 2023; Fu et al., 2023; Li et al., 2024), self-refinement (Saunders et al., 2022; Madaan et al., 2023; Lee et al., 2023; Shridhar et al., 2023), and constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022), LLMs are increasingly used to provide assessment, supervision, and oversight for themselves and other LLMs. LLM evaluators are shown to be highly accurate at approximating human annotators on various tasks, and are significantly more scalable (Hackl et al., 2023).

In self-evaluation, as the name suggests, the same underlying LLM acts as both the evaluator and the evaluatee. As a result, the neutrality of the evaluator is in question, and the evaluation can suffer from biases where the LLM evaluators diverge from humans in systematic ways (Zheng et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024). One such bias is self-preference, where an LLM rates its own outputs higher than texts written by other LLMs or humans, while human annotators judge them as equal quality. Self-preference has been observed in GPT-4-based dialogue benchmarks (Bitton et al., 2023; Koo et al., 2023), as well as for text summarization (Liu et al., 2023).

Towards understanding and mitigating self-preference, we study self-recognition--an LLM's capability of recognizing its own outputs. We ask: Is self-preference truly _self_-preference, in the sense that the LLM prefers a text _because_ it was generated by itself?

We measure their correlation while using prompting and fine-tuning to alter the LLM's self-recognition capability. In order to provide signals for the causal link between self-recognition and self-preference, we also fine-tune the LLM on a comprehensive set of potential confounding properties.

Our main findings are as follows:

1. **Frontier LLMs exhibit self-preference in self-evaluation.** On two summarization tasks, LLMs (GPT-3.5 Turbo, GPT-4, and Llama 2) disproportionately favor summaries written by themselves over those by other LLMs and from humans.
2. **LLMs have non-trivial self-recognition capability out of the box**. All three LLMs we evaluate achieve over \(50\%\) accuracy at distinguishing their own outputs from other sources using simple prompts without fine-tuning. GPT-4 is \(73.5\%\) accurate at distinguishing its outputs from those of two other LLMs and humans.
3. **Fine-tuning leads to near-perfect self-recognition.** GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 both achieve over \(90\%\) accuracy at self-recognition after fine-tuning on 500 examples.
4. **Self-preference strength is linearly correlated with self-recognition.** We fine-tune LLMs to increase or decrease self-recognition, and find a linear trend between them (Figure 1).

## 2 Definition and measurement of self-preference and self-recognition

**Self-preference** is when an LLM favors its own outputs over texts by human or other LLMs.

**Self-recognition** is an LLM's ability to distinguish its outputs from texts by humans or other LLMs.

For both definitions, we follow the prosaic rather than the intentional interpretation. We use the term "self" in an empirical sense, without claiming that the LLMs have any notion or representation of itself. The prosaic interpretation allows these two concepts to exist independent of one another: An LLM can _prefer_ texts it generated without _recognizing_ that those texts were in fact generated by itself.

In our experiments, one LLM can play up to three different roles: generator, evaluator, and authorship identifier, depending on the instructions that they are given. Statements like "an LLM evaluator is used to evaluate texts generated by _itself_" emphasize the fact that the generator and the evaluator use the same underlying model, although it receives different prompts and can behave differently.

### Datasets and models

We focus on text summarization, a task where self-evaluation is used extensively in both model-based benchmarks and reward modeling (Stiennon et al., 2020; Wu et al., 2021). We base our experiments on 2,000 randomly sampled news articles from two datasets: XSUM (Narayan et al., 2018) and

Figure 1: The strength of self-preference bias is linearly correlated with the LLM’s self-recognition capability. Each point represents a model evaluated on the two properties on the CNN/Dailymail (left) and XSUM (right) datasets. We fine-tune GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 for self-recognition or control tasks using both in- and out-of-domain data. The scores represented by both axes can be interpreted as measures of the LLM’s confidence on these properties.

CNN/DailyMail (Nallapati et al., 2016) Each example includes the original news article and a human-written summary.

To produce and evaluate LLM-generated summaries, we use instruction-tuned LLMs: Llama-2-7b-chat (Touvron et al., 2023), GPT-3.5 (Brown et al., 2020), and GPT-4 (OpenAI, 2023). Our fine-tuning experiments include Llama 2 (our own implementation) and GPT-3.5 (via API). We sample summaries from each of the LLMs at temperature zero using simple prompts, and standardize the punctuation and initial capitalization to match the formatting of the human summaries. The following evaluations of out-of-the-box LLMs are all based on these sampled summaries. 1

### Measurements

For both properties, we measure LLMs by prompting them using one of the following two formats:

**Pairwise measurement**. The LLM is presented two pieces of text, one generated by itself, and another by a second LLM or a human. We ask the LLM to choose which text has higher quality for self-preference, and which one was generated by itself for self-recognition. The identity of the alternative source is not revealed to the evaluator. We compute a prediction confidence by normalizing the output probabilities of the tokens associated with the two options.

To account for the LLMs' ordering bias (Pezeshkpour and Hruschka, 2023), we prompt the LLMs twice for each example by swapping the options, computing the average of the two confidence scores.

**Individual measurement**. The LLM is presented a single summary either generated by itself, another LLM, or a human. For self-recognition, we prompt the LLM evaluator to answer a yes/no question of whether a given summary is its own generation, with the confidence score computed in the same way as pairwise measurement. For self-preference, we prompt the LLM evaluator to rate a given summary with a Likert-scale rating of one to five for a given summary, computing the final rating as the average of the five possible scores weighted by the output probability of each number token.

To make scores comparable across individual and pairwise measurements, we further normalize the individually measured confidence and Likert-scale scores. Suppose that in a pairwise measurement, GPT-4 is evaluated for self-recognition between its own summary and one by Llama 2. In individual measurement, we gather these two scores separately and divide GPT-4's score for its own summary by the sum of the scores to compute GPT-4's confidence on this pair of examples. We similarly re-normalize the Likert-scale scores for self-preference.

We refer to the results of these measurements as self-recognition and self-preference scores (noting whether they are from the pairwise or individual setting); taking the average of these scores over a whole dataset provides the overall self-recognition and self-preference scores of an evaluator model.

### Out-of-the-box self-recognition

Figure 2 (left) visualizes the self-recognition capability of each LLM evaluator in the pairwise setting. The results appear consistent across the two datasets, so we aggregate them for clarity. Our main observations are the following:

1. GPT-4 is significantly more capable at self-recognition than the two weaker models.
2. All three LLM evaluators most easily distinguish their summaries from human-written summaries. Human is the only alternative that Llama 2 can effective distinguish itself from.
3. Weaker LLMs struggle to distinguish themselves from stronger LLMs: Llama 2 is completely incapable of distinguishing itself from GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, and GPT-3.5 struggles to distinguish itself from GPT-4.
4. The GPT-4 evaluator does not distinguish Llama 2 summaries from its own summaries more easily than GPT-3.5 summaries. This goes against our intuition that self-recognition scores should increase as the dissimilarity between evaluator and evaluatee increases.

Figure 2 (right) visualizes self-recognition scores measured in the individual setting. As expected, self-recognition capability drops across the board in this setting where the LLM loses the benefit of

having two pieces of texts to compare and contrast. GPT-4 is the only model capable of distinguishing authors with non-trivial accuracy. Interestingly, looking at the un-normalized confidence scores (Figure 3), we see that GPT-4 is strongly biased against predicting any text as being generated by itself, regardless of the actual author; GPT-3.5 and Llama 2 show the opposite bias.

Figure 4: Self-preference before fine-tuning, evaluated using pairwise (left) and individual (right) measurements; scores are aggregated over two datasets.

Figure 3: Confidence in self-recognition by the evaluator (row) on texts from various sources (column) measured in the **individual** setting; scores are aggregated over two datasets. GPT-4 stands out as the only discerning model under this setting, but it is also extremely unwilling to predict any text as having been generated by itself, including those actually generated by itself.

### Out-of-the-box self-preference

All models show the greatest self-preference against the human summary. In the individual setting, we observe that Llama doesn't give very different scores to the different sources, while GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 show signs of self-preference. With the exception of GPT-3.5 on the XSUM dataset, evaluators show a tendency to give the human summary lower scores compared to model-generated summaries and a tendency to give their generations higher scores compared to the scores given by other evaluators (Figure 4).

### Human evaluation of preference

We conduct human evaluation of pairwise judgment on generated summaries to check if the self-preference shown by LLMs is justified by quality differences, particularly between LLM-generated summaries. We sample 50 summaries from each dataset for each of the three LLMs, and collect three human judgments for each pair, resulting in 900 pairwise comparisons. We recruit 20 annotators from Upwork who are English speakers located in the United States with bachelor's degrees in humanities disciplines. The win rate of each pair of LLMs, calculated over 300 human annotators, is as follows:

1. GPT-4 vs. GPT-3.5: \(57\%\)
2. GPT-4 vs. Llama 2: \(63\%\)
3. GPT-3.5 vs. Llama 2: \(58\%\)

The results suggest that human annotators rank the three LLMs as GPT-4 > GPT-3.5 > Llama 2, consistent with their performance on various benchmarks. But the disparity between LLMs as rated by humans is significantly lower than the level of self-preference exhibited by the LLMs, in particular GPT-4. This suggests that out of the box, the LLMs' self-preference is disproportionate to the actual quality differences.

### Alternative adjustment for ordering bias

All three evaluators models display ordering bias. GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and Llama reverse their pairwise preferences when the ordering of options is reversed at rates of 25%, 58%, and 89% respectively, averaged across tasks and datasets (Figure 5). We account for this bias by averaging the logit-based confidence scores across the two orderings.

An alternative interpretation of the data is, for each evaluator, to discard all the results as "ambiguous" where its preference displayed ordering-based reversal, reporting an evaluator's self-recognition ability and self-preference tendency as its frequency of recognizing or preferring its own summary in "unambiguous" cases (Figure 5). This method exposes differences in evaluator results between the two datasets, but supports the presence of out-of-the-box self-recognition and self-preference.

## 3 Measuring correlation between self-preference and self-recognition

Having validated the existence of self-preference and self-recognition, we now turn to study their correlation. The main research question is to understand whether they have a causal relationship. Our hypothesis is that self-recognition causes self-preference--that LLMs prefer their own outputs _because_ they recognize them. Our investigation is motivated by the safety implications, which we discuss in detail in Section 5.

We fine-tune LLMs to alter their self-recognition ability, and measure how their self-preference changes accordingly. The correlation alone doesn't prove the causal hypothesis, whose validation

Figure 5: Evaluator responses when treated as a binary response without considering confidence scores. Results are marked “ambiguous” if the response reverses when the options are swapped.

requires mechanistic tools that do not exist for LLMs yet (discussion in Section 5). But we provide more evidence for the hypothesis by (1) invalidating the inverse claim that self-preference causes self-recognition (Section 3.3) and (2) controlling for confounders by fine-tuning on unrelated tasks (Section 3.4).

### Fine-tuning for self-recognition

We use supervised fine-tuning on **pairwise examples** to alter the LLMs' self-recognition capability. The training examples are generated in the same way as the evaluation examples we use in the pairwise measurement. Each example consists of two summaries of a given article, one by the LLM evaluator and the other by another LLM or human source. The evaluators are trained to predict the final token, representing the correct choice among two options, using supervised learning with cross-entropy loss. To train an LLM evaluator, we use 500 training articles and collect examples from all alternative sources (two other LLMs and human). The remaining 500 articles and associated summaries are used for evaluation. We train on the two datasets separately but evaluate both in- and out-of-domain. GPT-3.5 was fine-tuned via API, and Llama 2 using our own implementation. The Llama models are quantized to 8 bits and fine-tuned for one epoch using Adam optimization and a learning rate of \(5.0 10^{-5}\).

### Fine-tuning results

Fine-tuning on the self-recognition task causes models to become more confident in their pairwise judgments (Figure 6). When plotting self-recognition score against self-preference, the data clump more tightly around \(0.5\) and the high- and low-score corners.

In the pairwise setting, fine-tuning for self-recognition results in a strong linear correlation between a model's self-recognition ability and its self-preference (Figure 7). We find that fine-tuning for self-recognition ability on one dataset transfers to the other.

In additional to analyzing the relationship between self-recognition ability and overall dataset self-preference, we measure the correlation between these two properties on the example level (Table 1). For GPT-3.5 on the XSUM dataset, the evaluator prior to fine-tuning has a correlation of \(0.41\) (Kendall's \(\)) between correctly recognizing its summary from a pair and preferring its summary from that same pair. Every fine-tuning configuration we employ results in a model with a positive correlation on this metric and this correlation does not change meaningfully as self-recognition ability increases.

### Invalidating the inverse causal relationship

We ensure that the causal direction is not the reverse--that the LLM does not recognize its own outputs because the quality is objectively higher, which would not reflect favoritism or raise safety concerns--by showing that LLM evaluators do not systematically favor summaries generated by fine-tuned models to those generated by the original model. Some fine-tuning runs resulted in degraded generation quality. The remainder show an average preference for the fine-tuned model's

Figure 6: GPT-3.5 pairwise results on XSUM after 0, 10, and 500 fine-tuning examples show a pattern of increasing absolute confidence scores.

generations of \(0.46\), reflecting a slight preference against the new generations. Only 22% of the evaluator-domain pairs show a preference greater than \(0.51\) for the fine-tuned model's generations.

### Controlling for confounders

To confirm that the fine-tuning procedure did not introduce any confounding effect on the variables under study, we additionally fine-tune GPT-3.5 and Llama on three tasks unrelated to self-recognition: length, vowel count, and Flesh-Kincaid readability score (Flesch, 1948). We also fine-tune both models to always output the answer "1" and to answer randomly. Together with the three fine-tuned models trained on the self-recognition task, this gives eight fine-tuned models for each of the two datasets. We find that these models can be placed in the same linear trend that we see in the models fine-tuned on the self-recognition task (Figure 1).

### Labeling the summary sources

An additional experiment using only prompting to show evidence of a causal link between self-recognition and self-preference is to add either correct or reversed labels indicating the source of each summary in the pairwise self-preference question (Table 6). The GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 evaluator models show a reversal in self-preference when the labels are reversed in the XSUM dataset; that is, they show a preference for the summary labeled as being their own generation. In the CNN dataset or the Llama evaluator, no clear difference is shown from label reversal.

### Self-preference and bias in self-evaluation

The tendency of LLMs to prefer their own generations was first recognized in the context of LLM-based benchmarks (Bitton et al., 2023; Zheng et al., 2024; Bai et al., 2024). Like us, Liu et al. (2023) study self-preference bias on text summarization, between BERT, T5, and GPT-3.5. The larger capability gap between these models makes it difficult to control for summarization quality.

Koo et al. (2023) include self-preference in a suite of tests for LLM cognitive biases in a pairwise question-answering setting. They find GPT-4 to demonstrate lower self-preference than GPT-3.5 out-of-the-box, contrary to our findings, which suggests that wider evaluation is needed to draw generalizable conclusions. Neither of these previous works attempted to provide an explanation for self-preference nor to alter self-preference strength.

Hoelscher-Obermaier et al. (2023) evaluate GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Claude-2 for self-recognition ability on pairs of ten-sentence fables based on BIG-bench (Srivastava et al., 2023). On this task, contrary to our findings, GPT-3.5 is more accurate than GPT-4, which is less than 50% accurate, again showing the need for wide experimentation on varied datasets.

### LLM detection

Detection of LLM-generated text is important for AI safety and combating misinformation (Jawahar et al., 2020; Crothers et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023; Kumarage et al., 2024). Despite having similar goals, self-recognition focuses on the introspective ability of language models, rather a third party's discernment between varied sources of text. The self-recognition task can be seen as a highly restricted version of detection where the method is limited to prompting an LLM. In particular, the detector LLM is not given explicit access to information such as perplexity, which is crucial to many detection methods (Mitchell et al., 2023; Hans et al., 2024).

## 5 Limitations, discussion, and conclusion

### Safety concerns related to self-recognizing LLMs

Self-recognition is a general ability that can potentially affect many multi-LLM interactions. In this paper, we focus on self-preference as the downstream property and provide initial evidence towards causation, but we see evidence of generalization to additional downstream properties. In particular, by evaluating LLMs on datasets with distinct construction processes, we observe that self-recognition fine-tuning generalizes across the two datasets and that our hypothesis holds out-of-distribution. Motivated by these results, we discuss safety risks caused by self-recognition and its causal effect on various biases.

**Biased self-evaluation** In model-based benchmarks, a model's rating can be inflated simply because it is similar to the evaluator model. The bias is also a risk for methods designed for safety and alignment, such as reward modeling (Leike et al., 2018; Stiennon et al., 2020) and constitutional AI (Bai et al., 2022), for similar reasons: the reward model gives higher scores to models similar to

Figure 8: Self-preference scores in the pairwise setting with the two summaries labeled with their sources either correctly or with the labels swapped.

itself, leading to weaker oversight and supervision. The bias can be amplified if the model is updated with feedback or training signal generated by itself Pan et al. (2024); Xu et al. (2024).

Our work provides a basis for countermeasures against self-preference. If future evaluation confirms self-preference to be as pervasive as other biases such as ordering bias, countermeasures such as authorship obfuscation should be incorporated into standard prompting practice.

**White-box adversarial attacks for free and unbounded reward hacking** In an adversarial setting (see Raina et al. (2024) for example), an LLM defender is no longer protected by black-box access if the adversary LLM recognizes their similarities. In the worst case scenario where the adversary uses the same LLM as the defender, the adversary can gain unbounded access to the defender. A similar concern applies to the non-adversarial setting, where similar LLMs are use as both optimizer and reward model, as well: the strength of potential reward hacking is unbounded even if the two LLMs only communicate textually. For example, the optimizer can ignore the feedback provided by the reward model, and instead directly optimize for the shared, unaligned representation of the human-specified objectives.

### Limitations and future work

**Controlling for ground-truth generation quality**. Self-preference is justified if the LLM's generation actually is higher in quality. From a safety perspective, our interest is when an LLM prefers its own outputs that are of equal or worse quality than the alternative. This requires controlling for generation quality using ground-truth annotation when measuring self-preference. Our existing results provide indirect evidence for disproportionate self-preference: the sum of mutual self-preference scores for a pair of LLMs exceeds \(1\), so for at least a portion of the dataset they each prefer themselves.

**Example-level causal hypothesis**. Our central hypothesis can be interpreted on either the example or capability level. We focus on the capability level: high self-recognition capability causes LLMs to show stronger self-preference. The example level counterpart would be: an LLM shows preference towards a piece of text because it recognizes the text as its own generation, an hypothesis of interest to interpretability. Although we observe on the correlation of the two properties on the confidence of individual predictions, our control experiments cannot further the causal argument on the example level. One approach to gather evidence for the example-level causal hypothesis is to perturb or paraphrase LLM-generated text to inhibit self-recognition and measure self-preference.

**Limited number of experiment conditions**. We focus on text summarization as a realistic problem with existing high quality data that have seen successful application of self-evaluation. Our cross-dataset evaluation provides initial evidence that self-recognition is a general capability that can be amplified easily by fine-tuning on a small number of examples from one dataset. Our future work will validate the hypothesis on more text summarization datasets, more tasks, as well as more frontier LLMs. We will also experiment with fine-tuning for self-recognition on the general domain rather than on a specific task.

**Variance reduction**. Our preliminary experiments indicate that the strength of both properties are insensitive to prompts, so all conditions use the same straightforward prompt design. To reduce variance, we will expand our experiments with more prompt designs in future work, including instructions to condition LLMs for better calibration (and reduce rejection responses). Along the lines of fine-tuning on the general domain, we will also mix self-recognition with standard instruction following datasets to improve coverage on the spectrum of self-recognition signal strength.

### Conclusion

We provide initial evidence towards the hypothesis that LLMs prefer their own generations because they recognize themselves. In addition to evaluating LLMs out-of-the-box, we show that fine-tuning on a small number of examples elicit strong, generalizable self-recognition capability on summarization datasets. By varying fine-tuning task, we observe a linear correlation between self-recognition and self-preference, and validate that the correlation cannot be explained away by potential confounders. Our results establish self-recognition as a crucial factor in unbiased self-evaluation as well as an important safety-related property. The experiment design also provides a blueprint to explore the effects of self-recognition on other downstream properties.
