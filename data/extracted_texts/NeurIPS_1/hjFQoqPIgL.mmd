###### Abstract

The efficient exploration of chemical space to design molecules with intended properties enables the accelerated discovery of drugs, materials, and catalysts, and is one of the most important outstanding challenges in chemistry. Encouraged by the recent surge in computer power and artificial intelligence development, many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem. However, despite the emergence of many new approaches in recent years, comparatively little progress has been made in developing realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of molecular design for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a set of practical benchmark tasks relying on physical simulation of molecular systems mimicking real-life molecular design problems for materials, drugs, and chemical reactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility and ease of use of our new benchmark set by demonstrating how to compare the performance of several well-established families of algorithms. Surprisingly, we find that model performance can strongly depend on the benchmark domain. We believe that our benchmark suite will help move the field towards more realistic molecular design benchmarks, and move the development of inverse molecular design algorithms closer to designing molecules that solve existing problems in both academia and industry alike.

## 1 Introduction

Inverse molecular design, which involves crafting molecules with specific optimal properties , poses a critical optimization challenge prevalent across various scientific fields. It holds particular significance in chemistry for designing drugs, catalysts, and materials. Each of these scenarios requires a complex balance between multiple desired properties for a realistic inverse design. Yet, the majority of comparisons between molecular design algorithms are primarily carried out on oversimplified tasks, thereby providing limited insights into their potential performance when confronting intricate design challenges commonplace in chemistry . While simplistic and cost-effective benchmarks serve as vital tools during the initial stages of algorithm development, facilitating rapid testing and informed design choices, the lack of more realistic benchmarks obstructs their adoption by domain experts in chemistry or materials science. Our work aims to bridge this gap.

In this study, we propose a modular suite of design objectives directly inspired by problems regarding new materials, drugs, and chemical reactions. These problems rely on well-established simulation methods in computational chemistry, such as force fields, semi-empirical quantum chemistry, and density functional approximations. We test multiple popular molecular design algorithms on these objectives, offering an exemplary performance comparison. The design approaches selected represent some of the most important algorithm classes in the field. We also examine the impact of representations on the performance of some algorithms. Finally, we provide detailed instructions forinstallation and setup for both the benchmarks and the molecular design algorithms, enabling the cheminformatics and machine learning communities to integrate them into their work and inspire the development of future methods. The core idea is to provide a unified benchmarking framework with a diverse selection of problem domains to assess the generalizability of inverse design algorithms. Notably, the scope of included benchmark domains is to be expanded upon in future work. Altogether, we believe this is a stepping stone towards the widespread adoption of molecular generative models for challenging design problems that permeate the chemical sciences.

## 2 Background

Generative models play a pivotal role in inverse molecular design, yet the progress of benchmark tasks for their performance assessment has been relatively slow . The penalized log P metric, frequently employed in current benchmarks, is characterized by its dependence on molecule size and chain composition, thus limiting its effectiveness . Numerous models have reached a saturation point on the task of generating molecules with maximum QED values . The GuacaMol benchmark suite, with its array of goal-oriented objectives , often similarly results in near-perfect scores, thus obscuring useful comparisons . This concern was traced back to unlimited property evaluations within the suite, with imposed limits revealing significant performance disparities and underscoring the importance of evaluation procedures explicitly accounting for evaluations . The MOSES benchmark suite evaluates the ability of models to propose diverse compounds that mimic the distribution of training datasets . However, the emergence of SELFIES and rudimentary algorithms have rendered these tasks trivial .

The recent trend of using molecular docking as a benchmark for generative models includes tasks like designing molecules complying with Lipinski's Rule of Five . However, this often favors highly reactive and unstable molecules . Additionally, molecular docking scores have recently become a popular metric . However, they were only recently incorporated into systematic benchmark platforms. In particular, the Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) does provide a comprehensive benchmark platform, but crafting sensible, synthesizeable, stable structures with low binding affinity estimates remains a formidable challenge . The DOCKSTRING package supplies extensive datasets and benchmarks for a variety of machine learning strategies in drug design . It constitutes an advance over previous methodologies by offering computational workflows and realistic molecular design benchmarks. However, the breadth of molecular design task extends beyond drug discovery. Accordingly, TARTARUS aspires to cover a more comprehensive set of molecular design problems, to include important structural domains previously neglected.

Model performance is assessed based on the alignment of the acquired properties with predefined objectives.

Molecular design algorithms have the potential to accelerate the discovery of materials for the benefit of humankind. However, they can just as well be used to design hazardous materials intentionally. While this pertains primarily to the molecular design algorithms themselves, benchmarking can also provide a contribution in that regard by identifying robust and generally applicable tools. However, first, we would like to emphasize that none of the molecular design benchmarks developed have a direct link to the development of potentially hazardous materials. Additionally, the molecular design algorithms employed in this work propose merely structures but do not provide any instructions for their synthesis making their malicious use unlikely.

This study introduces four molecular design benchmarks, each with a curated dataset of reference molecules with predicted properties, as depicted in Figure 1. The potential availability of reference data from laboratory experiments for at least subsets of our curated datasets was not considered. The goal is to present authentic benchmarks that aid in discovering structures optimized for specific target properties across diverse applications. To evaluate models with TARTARUS, we recommend training the generative model on the provided dataset, using 80% for training and 20% for hyperparameter optimization. The model should then propose structures for evaluation by the corresponding benchmark task. Structure optimization is initiated using the best reference molecule from the respective dataset. A constrained approach is followed, limiting the population size, iterations, and total proposed compounds to 5,000, with a capped runtime of 24 hours. Each optimization run is repeated five times for increased robustness and reproducibility. This resource-constrained comparison approach, we argue, is crucial for impartial method comparison and should be a community standard. The parameters and settings used for each model are detailed in the Supporting Information.

## 3 Results

In this section, we describe the molecular design benchmarks we developed, along with their reference datasets. We also present the results for all the generative models considered, namely: REINVENT , SMILES-VAE , SELFIES-VAE, MoFlow , SMILES-LSTM-HC [33; 3], SELFIES-LSTM-HC, GB-GA , and JANUS . We would like to emphasize that this is far from a comprehensive list of all molecular design algorithms, but rather a small selection of various algorithmic approaches spanning the field. Moreover, the results provided heavily depend on both the model hyperparameters and the benchmark settings, such as available computing resources and number of property evaluations. For a comprehensive outline and discussion of the property simulation workflows developed in this work, we refer the reader to the Additional Results of the Supporting Information.

### Design of Organic Photovoltaics

Our first benchmark objective set comprises two individual tasks inspired by organic photovoltaic (OPV) design . The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) garners broad interest due to their potential to replace and expand upon the applications of predominant inorganic devices [36; 37; 38; 39]. Key properties of photoactive materials for OSCs are their HOMO and LUMO energies (i.e., \(E_{HOMO}\) and \(E_{LUMO}\), respectively). Importantly, these properties of interest can be directly estimated using a standard ground state electronic structure simulation. Thus, we defined two benchmark objectives that are directly inspired by previous high-throughput virtual screening efforts in the literature aimed

Figure 2: Overview of the property simulation workflow for the design of organic photovoltaics benchmarks. The code accepts a SMILES string, generates initial Cartesian coordinates with Open Babel, and performs conformer search and geometry optimization with crest and xtb. Finally, a single point calculation at the GFN2-xTB level of theory provides the HOMO and LUMO energies, the HOMO-LUMO gap and the molecular dipole moment. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) is computed from the simulated properties based on the Scharber model.

at finding new photoactive materials for OPVs. The first task is based on the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) [37; 40] and corresponds to the design of a small organic donor molecule to be used with -phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) as acceptor in a bulk heterojunction device [41; 42; 37; 40]. The second task is based on follow-up work of the CEP and corresponds to the design of a small organic acceptor molecule to be used in bulk heterojunction devices with poly[N-90-hepatocany]-2,7-carbazole-alt-5,5-(40,70-di-2-thienyl-20,10,30-benzothiadiazole]) (PCDTBT) as a donor . In both cases, the objective function is a combination of (1) the estimated power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the corresponding device, which is based on the Scharber model for single junction OSCs [41; 42] and derived from the results of an electronic structure calculation of the proposed molecule, and (2) the synthethic accessibility of the corresponding structure as quantified by the SAscore .

We also provide a reference dataset for training generative models. It is a subset of the Harvard Clean Energy Project Database (CEPDB) , originally encompassing 2.3 million organic compounds. Our subset, CEPSUB, consists of approximately 25,000 molecules. We implemented a robust property simulation workflow for these benchmark tasks. This workflow accepts the SMILES string of proposed molecules as input [45; 46], generates an initial guess of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates, performs conformer sampling using the iMTD-GC workflow [47; 48] as implemented in crest at the GFN-FF level of theory [50; 51; 52], and performs geometry optimization of the lowest energy conformer obtained at the GFN2-XTB level of theory [53; 54]. The predicted properties are taken from a final single point energy calculation of the converged geometry. An overview of the simulation workflow and the corresponding benchmark objectives is provided in Figure 2.

The results of the two benchmarks are summarized in Table 1. We observe that GB-GA shows best performance on the first benchmark task (7.78), while SMILES-LSTM-HC shows best performance on the second (31.79). While most models are capable to propose molecules with marginally improved PCEs, they are not able to both improve PCEs and diminish SAscores. When looking at the best molecules that the molecular design algorithms generated (cf. Supporting Information), it is interesting to see that the various models seem to produce structures with essentially equivalent core motifs. Additionally, it is apparent that, due to the inclusion of the SAscore in the design objectives, the proposed structures are more likely to be stable and synthesizable.

### Design of Organic Emitters

The next set of benchmarks is inspired by the design of emissive materials for organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs), which received significant attention in recent years [55; 56; 57; 58; 59] after the discovery of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) . Their main applications are digital screens

an ionotropic glutamate receptor associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and epilepsy , 6Y2F, the main protease of SARS-CoV-2 responsible for translation of the viral RNA of the SARS-CoV-2 virus , and 4LDE, the \(\)2-adrenoceptor GPCR receptor spanning the cell membrane and binding adrenaline, a hormone which mediates muscle relaxation and bronchodilation . In all cases, crystal structures of the proteins bound to a ligand are available in the protein data bank (PDB)  and the objective is to minimize the docking score of a proposed molecule to one of these protein targets.

For training, we started from the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP) Open Compound Collection [79; 80], a set of about 250,000 molecules tested for treatment against cancer and the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) , and selected all structures passing the structure constraints leading to around 150,000 structures referred to as DATASET. Molecules included in this collection can be ordered for free, except for shipping costs, from the DTP . The simulation workflow for these benchmark tasks is initiated with the SMILES string of the proposed molecule and creates an initial guess of the corresponding Cartesian coordinates with openbabel. Subsequently, we use QuickVina2  to introduce the newly proposed compound in the protein binding pocket, and perform a docking pose search. Following recent literature recommendations [84; 85], the top compounds from each run were re-scored for improved accuracy using smina (see Figure 4).

The results are compiled in Table 3, which includes the averages of the top docking scores achieved by each model. We also present the highest docking scores from the reference dataset for each of the tasks (DATASET in Table 3), along with the docking scores of the original ligands bound to the three target proteins in their respective crystal structures ("Native Ligand" in Table 3). Moreover, Table 3 indicates the percentage of sampled molecules that pass standard structure filters employed in drug discovery (see SR in Table 3). Notably, the native ligand for 6Y2F fails to pass these constraints, illustrating that these constraints only evaluate the likelihood of a structure being both stable and synthesizable. Across all protein targets,SMILES-VAE struggles to suggest structures with better

The process accepts a SMILES string for protein targets 1SYH, 6Y2F, and 4LDE, generates Cartesian coordinates using Open Babel, and samples docking poses via smina. The lowest docking score is returned as the target property.

third and the fourth task combine two properties into one objective function. The third corresponds to finding substrates that lead to both a fast and a thermodynamically favorable reaction. The fourth is about finding substrates that cause both a slow and a thermodynamically favorable reaction.

Like for the other benchmarks, we provide a reference dataset that can be used for training the generative models. As this benchmark requires molecules that contain the _syn_-sesquinorbornene motif, we needed to create the new SNB-60K dataset with approximately 60,000 molecules. The simulation workflow starts with a check of the required structural constraints (_vide supra_) in the proposed substrate SMILES string. If any constraint is violated, the workflow will be aborted and an extremely bad objective value of -10,000 returned. If all constraints are satisfied, initial guess Cartesian coordinates will be generated. Subsequently, a combination of conformer searches and constrained optimizations generates the reactant and product structures required to set up the SEAM force field and perform TS optimization. Finally, conformer search of the TS is carried out, followed by subsequent SEAM force field optimization, and the reaction and activation energies are derived from the lowest energy structures of reactant, TS and product. The workflow is shown in Figure 5.

The performance of the generative models considered on the molecular reactivity benchmarks is provided in Table 4. As similarly seen on the protein ligand design benchmarks, we observed that both the VAE models failed to surpass the best values in the dataset (e.g., SMILES-VAE: 76.81 versus 64.94 in the dataset for \( E^{}\), -10.96 versus -34.49 in the dataset for \( E_{r}\), 71.01 versus 56.48 in the dataset for \( E^{}+ E_{r}\), and -90.94 versus -95.25 in the dataset for \(- E^{}+ E_{r}\)). Compared to the VAEs, both the LSTM-HC models, MoFlow, and REINVENT perform better but they are not able to improve upon the best molecules from the dataset for all four benchmark objectives. In particular, SELFIES-LSTM-HC only reaches -21.02 versus -34.49 in the dataset for \( E_{r}\) and 68.06 versus 56.48 in the dataset for \( E^{}+ E_{r}\). Only JANUS and GB-GA consistently propose structures that outperform the best reference compounds. The best structures proposed in these benchmark tasks (cf. Supporting Information) generally show that the majority of structures is reasonable in terms of stability. In addition, the inclusion of SAScore constraints in the two combined objectives seems to particularly result in smaller molecules as molecular size tends to correlate with the SAScore.

### Model Timing Comparison

Finally, one overlooked consideration for choosing generative models is the computation time needed for pre-conditioning the model based on a reference dataset and for proposing new candidates. The main reason we conducted this benchmark is our belief that shorter pre-conditioning and structure generation translates to increased usage of molecular design algorithms. While it is a minor overhead in the case of time-limiting property evaluation, it can constitute a significant entrance barrier for testing a model in benchmark tasks with comparably fast evaluations before using it on the actual problem of interest. We used three different metrics for comparison based on the reference dataset of the design of protein ligands. First, we evaluated the time the models need for pre-conditioning (or training) when provided with the corresponding reference dataset. For that, the models have access to 24 CPU cores and 1 GPU. Second, as access to GPUs can sometimes be limited, we wanted to evaluate the impact of GPU usage on the model pre-conditioning time. However, for some of the models tested, training times were too prohibitive for benchmarking when no GPU was provided. Thus, to measure the impact of using a GPU for training, instead of the full time, we evaluated single epoch times both with and without access to a GPU. Third, we determined the time required by the algorithms to propose 10,000 unique structures. All timing results are illustrated in Figure 6.

Overall, we find that both VAEs needed by far the longest training time, both taking considerably longer than 9 hours, with the SELFIES-VAE requiring somewhat more time than the SMILES-VAE. In contrast, both LSTM-HC models only need approximately 2 hours with no statistically significant difference between using SMILES and SELFIES. Compared to the other deep generative models, both MoFlow and REINVENT show by far the fastest training times finishing already after less than 1 hour in our benchmark. When looking at the single epoch times with and without GPU usage, we find that the relative order with respect to timing is comparable regardless of whether a GPU is utilized. It is particularly notable that both the VAEs have single epoch times of approximately 8 hours which leads to an estimated training time without a GPU of about 25 days, which we decided to be too prohibitive to perform full training. All other deep generative models have single epoch times significantly faster than 1 hour leading to estimated training times below 1 day. The fastest models in that respect are again MoFlow and REINVENT with single epoch times of only several minutes. Notably, MoFlow has a faster epoch time than REINVENT with GPU usage, but a slower one without. Nevertheless, the total pre-conditioning times of both GAs, which are provided in the diagram depicting single epoch times (cf. Figure 6C), is still shorter which only surmounts to several seconds without the use of a GPU.

## 4 Conclusion and Outlook

We developed TARTARUS, a modular set of realistic molecular design objectives representative of common problems in the domains of organic materials, drugs, and chemical reactions to be used as general goal-directed benchmarks for generative models. Most tasks are directly inspired by design objectives pursued in the literature. Hence, high-performing molecules have potential value in real applications. We observed that none of the representative generative models selected consistently outperformed the others across all the design tasks. This is due to a seemingly strong dependence of the performance of some models on the specific benchmark domain and suggests the importance of conducting diverse molecular design benchmarks that reflect actual problems pursued in chemistry to evaluate the generalizability of inverse molecular design algorithms across domains. Furthermore, it shows that current molecular design algorithms have significant room for improvement in terms of generality, particularly deep generative models. Thus, more sophisticated approaches do not guarantee stronger inverse design performance, especially when not tested on the problem domain of interest.

We note that relatively simple approaches like genetic algorithms that do not need large reference datasets show more consistently good performance across benchmarks, whereas the VAE approaches, that strongly rely on the available training data, show limited performance across multiple benchmarks. However, more comprehensive investigations are required to confirm this hypothesis and identify the origins of the limited performance of some of the approaches tested. Moreover, we believe that demonstrating strong performance of computer algorithms applied to realistic design objectives will inspire researchers across fields to adopt these techniques in their workflows eventually leading to mainstream use. Accordingly, we believe that TARTARUS will act as a stepping stone for advancing deep generative models and for inspiring the development of realistic molecular design benchmarks. Notably, we would like to emphasize that TARTARUS does not replace the development of more specialized molecular design benchmarks that are tailored to specific domains of interest and necessarily follow a different design workflow, particularly in drug design . We believe that such specialized benchmarks are complementary to TARTARUS and are equally important to assess the practicality and performance of molecular generative models.

Nevertheless, this first work on TARTARUS still leaves room for further developments. As is common in real-world molecular design, objectives need to be revised when undesired structures are promoted and new property requirements can emerge. In particular, the relative importance of multiple target properties sometimes needs to be adjusted and the consideration of additional properties becomes necessary. Furthermore, the benchmark domains currently covered are far from comprehensive,

Figure 6: Results of model timing comparisons. Models are trained on a subset of the DTP Open Compound Collection. The benchmark metrics consist of model training time (or pre-condition time) with the use of a GPU (A), single epoch times during training both with (D) and without a GPU (C), and the time required to sample 10,000 structures (B). Results are provided as mean (main bar) and standard deviation (error bars) of the metrics obtained in five independent runs.

providing opportunities for the development of additional design tasks in the near future. Deep generative models capable to design 3D molecular structures directly are currently not well supported, as proposed conformers would be ignored. Extending TARTARUS in that regard requires including geometries in our reference datasets. Both for the protein ligand and the chemical reaction substrate design benchmarks, specialized geometries are needed. Hence, it would not be enough to train 3D generative models suggesting ground-state gas-phase geometries. The chemical reaction substrate design benchmarks require multiple geometries as both two ground state geometries and one transition state geometry are simulated. Consequently, most current 3D generative models cannot fulfill this requirement out of the box and could thus not replace established global geometry optimization strategies. Finally, the results of 3D generative models require dedicated performance comparisons as molecular properties are intrinsically tied to their 3D structures. For a meaningful comparison to the other molecular design algorithms considered, it is necessary to separate 3D structure generation from molecular connectivity generation. This requires introducing separate conformer generation benchmarks for each of the benchmark tasks. Accordingly, these extensions of TARTARUS will be the subject of future work. Finally, we aim to launch open molecular design challenges on a regular basis making use of the benchmark codes included in TARTARUS. This will allow us to provide regular measurements of the state of the art in molecular generative models and promote further advances in the field.
