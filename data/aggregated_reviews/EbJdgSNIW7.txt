### Key Points
This paper presents MEEdge, a system that transforms single-exit neural networks into dynamic multi-exit models for resource-constrained edge devices. The authors propose techniques such as dynamic branch construction, neuron-level weight sharing, and few-shot knowledge distillation to achieve memory-elastic inference. The paper addresses the challenges of efficiently utilizing limited computing power on edge devices and introduces novel approaches like branch cultivation and HPF for branch placement.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper comprehensively tackles enabling neural network inference on non-deterministic edge resources through server-side and device-side techniques.
2. Extensive experiments demonstrate the ability to adapt dynamically to resource changes.
3. The proposed techniques, including neuron-level weight sharing and HPF-based search, have broader applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to traditional architectures like ResNet and VGG; scalability to larger models, such as Transformer-based architectures, needs exploration.
2. There is a lack of discussion regarding potential adaptive threats to the multi-exit architecture, particularly concerning vulnerabilities to adversarial attacks.
3. More technical details about the branch zoo and Branch Survival processes are needed, including clarity on the use of NAS.
4. The implications of server-device collaboration on security and privacy are not addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the branch zoo concept and provide more technical details regarding its implementation and the use of NAS. Additionally, the authors should discuss the potential adaptive threats to the proposed architecture and consider including comparisons with other model transformations, such as quantization, to highlight the advantages of multi-exit models. Finally, we suggest analyzing end-to-end performance in more complex edge computing scenarios and addressing the security and privacy implications of server-device collaboration.
