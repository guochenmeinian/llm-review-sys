### Key Points
This paper presents the authors' analysis of large language models (LLMs) for hate speech detection, specifically focusing on GPT 3.5 and text-davinci across three datasets. The authors explore the challenges these models face in default configurations and propose tailored prompt strategies to enhance performance. They also conduct a detailed error analysis, identifying vulnerabilities in the models' performance. The study offers insights into the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting hate speech and highlights the importance of context cues such as explanations and target communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant and timely issue in the detection of hate speech using LLMs.
- It provides a comprehensive analysis of two prominent LLMs, detailing their performance and limitations.
- The identification of vulnerabilities and the introduction of prompt strategies contribute valuable insights for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of hate speech is unclear, leading to ambiguity in result interpretation.
- The methodology lacks detail regarding data preprocessing techniques and hyper-parameter optimization.
- The study is limited to only two LLMs from the same family, which may restrict the generalizability of the findings.
- Significant reformatting is needed for clarity and presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the definition of hate speech to avoid ambiguity in interpreting results. Additionally, the authors should provide detailed descriptions of data preprocessing techniques and hyper-parameters used in their experiments to enhance reproducibility. Expanding the scope to include other LLMs and baseline models would strengthen the study's conclusions. We also suggest significant reformatting of the manuscript to improve clarity, particularly in the introduction and methodology sections. Finally, the authors should consider presenting results in a more comprehensible manner, possibly by combining tables for better readability.
