### Key Points
This paper presents an application of the Integrated Gradients technique to analyze the importance of neurons in the MonoBERT model for information retrieval (IR). The authors investigate the role of specific neurons in classifying relevance and non-relevance, with experiments conducted on eight publicly available datasets. The findings indicate that distinct sets of neurons are engaged in predicting relevance, and the model's handling of out-of-domain data differs from in-domain data. The evaluation is thorough, revealing a core set of neurons consistently responsible for identifying relevance across datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is sound, leveraging a well-established technique to probe the MonoBERT model.  
- The paper is generally well presented and easy to follow, with sufficient introduction to the Integrated Gradients method.  
- The results provide valuable insights into the distribution of important neurons across layers and modules.  

Weaknesses:  
- The study is limited to a single architecture (MonoBERT), raising concerns about the generalizability of findings to other models.  
- The low number of negatives used (20 BM25 negatives per query) is identified as a limitation, and the impact of different types of negatives on neuron importance is not explored.  
- Presentation issues, such as the absence of Figure 4 and unclear notations in figures and tables, detract from clarity.  
- The comparison of parameter weights across datasets is deemed unconvincing, and the paper lacks sufficient theoretical grounding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting similar studies on other architectures, such as MonoT5, to validate their hypotheses. Additionally, the authors should explore the behavior of the method with varying types of negatives to assess the consistency of "important neurons." Expanding the evaluation to include the full set of queries and deeper re-ranking thresholds would strengthen their claims. We also suggest enhancing the clarity of figures and tables by using more readable notations and defining terms precisely. Finally, the authors should cite relevant prior research on term match attribution in IR to provide a more comprehensive context for their work.
