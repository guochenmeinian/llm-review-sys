### Key Points
This paper presents MADLAD-400, a multilingual dataset comprising 419 languages collected from CommonCrawl, which underwent extensive filtering and auditing processes. The authors detail the dataset construction pipeline, addressing various challenges and solutions, and release two data partitions: a noisy partition and a clean partition. The paper also introduces a large parallel dataset covering 156 languages and trains multiple machine translation models and an 8B decoder-only language model, demonstrating competitive performance on various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset significantly increases the number of languages available for multilingual models, doubling the scope compared to existing datasets.
- Detailed descriptions of the dataset construction and filtering processes enhance reproducibility and utility for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of the language model is limited to machine translation, with no demonstration of the advantages of using clean data over noisy data.
- The assessment of language quality is based on a small sample of 20 documents per language, which raises concerns about the accuracy of the language identification system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of the language model by including additional benchmarks beyond machine translation, such as XTREME. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer demonstration of the benefits of using clean data compared to noisy data. The authors should also address the limitations of the language quality assessment, particularly the reliance on a small sample size, and clarify the potential issues with the LangID system in handling low-resource languages. Finally, we advise changing the terminology from "monolingual" to "multilingual" to avoid confusion regarding the dataset's nature.
