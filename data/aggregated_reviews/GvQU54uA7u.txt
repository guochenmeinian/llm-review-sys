Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on multi-armed bandits with vectorized rewards, focusing on identifying Pareto Optimal arms under a fixed confidence framework. The authors propose a more general preference definition using a preference cone and aim to find the entire set of Pareto optimal arms. A lower bound is established, revealing the problem's complexity, and a track-and-stop style algorithm is introduced, with its efficiency supported by an upper bound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is novel and relevant, as it pertains to common scenarios involving multiple objectives, with no prior efforts in the exact setup.
- The paper's structure is clear, and the techniques employed are reasonable, extending from single-objective best arm identification.
- The results appear sound despite some notation confusion.

Weaknesses:
- The paper requires careful proofreading to clarify notations and definitions, such as in Definition 3 and the maximizations in Equation 1.
- While the techniques are sound, they closely follow the original track-and-stop framework, with insufficient emphasis on the novel contributions.
- The presentation suffers from broken references and unclear definitions, which hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and definitions throughout the paper, particularly in Definition 3 and the maximizations in Equation 1. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed description of the technical novelties in the proof techniques and include illustrative examples to enhance reader comprehension. A thorough proofreading is necessary to address broken references and minor writing issues. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the purpose of convexification, discussing both its computational and statistical implications more explicitly.
