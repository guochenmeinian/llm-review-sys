### Key Points
This paper presents a novel application of Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) to molecular tasks, demonstrating their capability to generate complex signals from images to 3D structures. The authors illustrate that NCA can effectively represent various molecular structures, including electron density and ligands in binding pockets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The application and adaptation of Cellular Automata are well-executed.  
- The demonstration of NCA's ability to generate complex signals is compelling and innovative.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a robust argument for the unique advantages of using NCA compared to other methods, such as diffusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the unique advantages of using Neural Cellular Automata over other approaches, such as diffusion, to strengthen their argument for this methodology.
