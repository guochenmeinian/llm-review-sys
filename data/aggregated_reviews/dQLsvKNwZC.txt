Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the safe reinforcement learning (RL) problem with a generalized stepwise safety chance constraint, crucial for safety-critical systems. The authors propose a meta-algorithm, MASE, which combines unconstrained RL with an uncertainty quantifier to ensure safety with high probability. They explore two variants of MASE, one for linear models and another for Gaussian processes (GP), demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in experiments on grid-world and safety gym environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a general GSE problem that is significant for real-world applications like autonomous vehicles.  
- The proposed method appears sound, with experimental results indicating fewer safety violations compared to CMDP-based approaches.  
- The theoretical results, particularly Thms 5.6 and 5.7, confirm that GLM-MASE guarantees safety with high probability.

Weaknesses:  
- The authors should discuss the relevance of a specific ICML paper on hard safety chance constraints, as it relates closely to the GSE problem.  
- Limitations of the work, particularly regarding scalability and the assumptions of the emergency stop action, are insufficiently addressed.  
- The numerical results are limited to one environment, and the complexity of computing a safe action set in MASE is not adequately explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by discussing the ICML paper on hard safety chance constraints and addressing the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding scalability. Additionally, clarify the assumptions required for computing the safe action set in MASE. We suggest enhancing the experimental evaluation by including boxplots to illustrate the distribution of results and providing more epochs in the experiments to better assess convergence rates. Finally, a discussion on the relationship between their method and existing safety layer techniques would strengthen the paper's contribution.
