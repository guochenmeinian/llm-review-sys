Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the incentives in recommendation systems, focusing on how to design the platform's reward mechanism to optimize creators' competition for social welfare. The authors propose a backward rewarding mechanism (BRM) to address the limitations of merit-based monotone mechanisms, which tend to favor majority users and neglect niche groups. The effectiveness of the BRM is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, revealing its potential to enhance social welfare in creator competition games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a relevant issue in recommendation systems, connecting well with existing literature and extending it through new theoretical insights and empirical validation.
- The introduction of BRM mechanisms is conceptually interesting, offering a solution to the monotonicity problem while maintaining merit-based properties.
- The clarity of the paper is commendable, with abstract concepts made understandable through examples and detailed explanations.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section is underdeveloped, with few recent references, making it challenging to establish the novelty of the proposed method.
- The paper lacks a clear statement of its limitations and does not adequately justify the applied value of the proposed model.
- The empirical evaluation is criticized for lacking proper benchmarks and clarity regarding experimental details, such as the data used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by incorporating more recent references to strengthen the novelty of their approach. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clearly state the limitations of their research and provide a justification for the applied value of their model. To enhance the empirical evaluation, we encourage the authors to include proper benchmarks and clarify the experimental details, particularly regarding the data used in their simulations. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion on the implications of the BRM mechanism compared to monotonic mechanisms would benefit the reader's understanding.
