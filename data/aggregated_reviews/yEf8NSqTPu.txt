Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
We recognize that the paper introduces the largest publicly available dataset of isolated American Sign Language (ASL) signs, comprising over 200K high-resolution videos aimed at assisting hearing parents of deaf infants in learning ASL through the PopSign app. The dataset's construction and the app's gamified design are notable contributions to the field. However, we also note concerns regarding the dataset's representation of sign language, particularly for those unfamiliar with ASL or Deaf culture. We plan to explicitly address the dataset's limitations and biases, including its focus on one-handed signs, the existence of multiple signed languages, regional variations, and the isolation of certain linguistic features. Furthermore, we recognize the need for more diverse representation in terms of skin tones and gender, as well as the selection bias inherent in the participant pool.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the significant number of videos, the comprehensive review process ensuring high quality, and the acknowledgment of the dataset's limitations, which enhances transparency regarding biases. We appreciate the submission of a revision that incorporates feedback and the addition of a 10th page to address reviewer comments. The app's user-friendly interface and real-time hand recognition features enhance learning. However, weaknesses arise from problematic data labeling, unclear data collection procedures, and the limited vocabulary size of 250 signs, which restricts the dataset's utility for broader sign language research. The inconsistent labeling undermines the dataset's effectiveness for isolated sign recognition, and the lack of lemmatization poses a significant challenge. Additionally, the dataset's narrow focus and potential misrepresentation of sign language, along with the limited diversity among participants, could skew results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest clarifying the data collection process and addressing the lemmatization issue to improve labeling consistency. We recommend making the limitations and biases of the dataset more explicit, particularly regarding the one-handed nature of the signs and the representation of various signed languages. Incorporating both-handed signs would enhance the dataset's expressiveness. We also encourage discussing the selection process for signs in greater detail, including the involvement of multiple signers. Adding a dictionary feature to the app for reviewing learned signs would be beneficial. Furthermore, we urge efforts to broaden participant diversity beyond those with specific socioeconomic advantages and to address the technical aspects such as compression and varied use cases more thoroughly. Lastly, we recommend including additional metrics, such as the F1 score, in the results and refining the ethical framing around language deprivation while providing more guidance on ethical considerations for users of the dataset.
