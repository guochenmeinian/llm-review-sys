Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Controllable Condition Fusion (CCF) framework that utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model for dynamic and adaptive condition selection in image fusion tasks. The authors construct a conditional bank with basic, enhanced, and task-specific conditions, enabling the calibration of fused images according to the diffusion step. The method is validated through extensive experiments across various fusion tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the CCF framework is innovative, allowing for controllable image fusion without specific training.
- The integration of DDPM enhances the generation and denoising capabilities, producing high-quality fused images.
- Extensive experiments validate the superior performance of the CCF framework over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of 'condition' is unclear, as it relies on evaluation metrics rather than common guidance conditions.
- Important comparisons to demonstrate the reconstruction capability of DDPM are missing.
- The lack of clear definitions for the three types of conditions in the Conditional Bank limits understanding.
- There are multiple writing and formatting issues, including symbol inconsistencies and unclear explanations of figures and equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of 'condition' in the Introduction. Additionally, it is crucial to systematically demonstrate how the fusion process utilizes the reconstruction capability of DDPM. We suggest providing clear definitions for the basic, enhanced, and task-specific conditions in the Conditional Bank. Furthermore, addressing the writing and formatting issues, such as symbol inconsistencies and unclear figure explanations, will enhance the manuscript's readability. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the advantages of using DDPM for controlled image fusion and to clarify the iterative refinement of sampling in relation to the proposed CCF framework.
