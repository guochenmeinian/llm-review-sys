Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework, HisTPT, aimed at mitigating the knowledge forgetting problem in test-time prompt tuning by utilizing three types of knowledge banks: local, hard-sample, and global. The method incorporates an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism to optimize prompts based on memorized knowledge, demonstrating superior performance across various visual recognition tasks, including image classification, semantic segmentation, and object detection, particularly in continuously changing test domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of knowledge banks and an adaptive knowledge retrieval mechanism effectively addresses knowledge forgetting during test-time prompt tuning.
2. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks and visual recognition tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough explanation of how the three memory banks effectively mitigate knowledge forgetting, relying primarily on empirical results without sufficient analysis.
2. The main experiments do not align with the motivation of addressing continuously changing test domains, focusing instead on single datasets without evaluating continuous test-time adaptation.
3. The use of entropy as a confidence metric is questionable, and the paper does not discuss alternative metrics or the computational and storage overhead compared to TPT.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of how the memory banks address the knowledge forgetting issue, providing a clearer analysis of their effectiveness. Additionally, the authors should expand their experiments to include evaluations of continuous test-time adaptation and discuss the limitations of using entropy as a confidence metric. It would also be beneficial to report the running time of the proposed method and compare it with existing methods in the related work section.
