Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel strategy for constructing iterative learning algorithms by optimizing a sequence of surrogate training objectives derived from PAC-Bayes generalization bounds. The authors propose replacing the empirical risk in the standard PAC-Bayes bound with a surrogate loss, which is a projection onto a low-dimensional function space. They provide theoretical guarantees that minimizing their bound also minimizes the original PAC-Bayes bound and demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in both meta-learning and practical biochemical modeling contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents substantial contributions, particularly in addressing the computational burden associated with PAC-Bayes bounds in biochemical applications.
- The theoretical foundation for the surrogate loss construction is solid, and the efficiency gains compared to simple gradient descent are impressive.
- The originality of the approach is high, combining existing techniques in a novel manner.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of detailed discussion on computational bottlenecks and the definition of "computational burden," making it unclear how much the proposed method resolves these issues compared to traditional methods.
- The presentation of proofs is somewhat informal, which may hinder understanding of the theoretical techniques.
- The empirical evaluation is insufficient, as it relies solely on objective values without validating theoretical claims or comparing computational efficiency with existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational bottlenecks by providing a precise definition of "computational burden" and including a theoretical evaluation of the complexity of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the proofs by offering more detailed explanations of the techniques used. The authors should also expand the empirical evaluation to include comparisons of the proposed method with existing methods in terms of various time metrics, such as wall-clock time, and validate the theoretical claims regarding the minimization of the original PAC-Bayes bound. Finally, incorporating concrete examples of applications in physics, biology, or medical problems would help clarify the scope of the contribution.
