Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel optimization-based method for sparse-view 3D reconstruction from unposed images, utilizing an off-the-shelf pose estimator for initialization. The authors propose a framework that employs rendering loss and generative priors, specifically a multi-view SDS loss using Zero123, to optimize both pose and 3D reconstruction. The method shows promising results on evaluation data, with an ablation study validating the effectiveness of each proposed technique.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The reconstruction quality and pose estimation accuracy are commendable.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow.
- The concept of rejecting images with significant pose errors is innovative.
- The technical foundation of the paper is robust.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of a comprehensive baseline comparison is notable; the only baseline is LEAP, a feedforward method, while the proposed method is optimization-based. Adding comparisons with SPARF and UpFusion is recommended.
- The inference speed remains unclear; an analysis of the joint optimization's time efficiency is needed.
- The related work section lacks depth, particularly regarding iFusion and FORGE, and should include a more detailed discussion of prior sparse-view reconstruction methods.
- The ablation study relies on Ray Diffusion pose initialization; exploring Dust3r initialization is essential for a complete analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the baseline comparisons by including SPARF and UpFusion under similar pose initialization conditions. Additionally, please provide a detailed analysis of inference speed, particularly how it scales with the number of outliers. The related work section should be expanded to include a thorough discussion of iFusion and FORGE, as well as a more comprehensive comparison with prior works. Lastly, we suggest conducting the ablation study with Dust3r initialization to assess its impact on the results.
