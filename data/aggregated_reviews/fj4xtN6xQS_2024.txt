### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into improving group fairness, specifically demographic parity, in large language models (LLMs) for tabular prediction tasks. The authors propose four methods: fair prompt optimization, soft prompt tuning, strategic few-shot example selection, and self-refining predictions through chain-of-thought reasoning. The methods are empirically evaluated across four tabular datasets using both open-source and proprietary LLMs, demonstrating effectiveness in enhancing demographic parity while maintaining overall performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive Methodology: The authors systematically explore four distinct approaches, providing a thorough examination of in-context learning methods for improving fairness.
- Effective Experimental Validation: Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and LLM architectures offer robust evidence for the proposed methods' effectiveness.
- Practical Guidance: The paper provides actionable insights for practitioners, enhancing its practical value for both researchers and industry professionals.

Weaknesses:
- Limited Performance and Fairness Metrics: The focus on demographic parity may not encompass the full spectrum of fairness concerns; other metrics such as precision and recall should also be considered.
- Limited Discussion on Dataset: The paper does not adequately address scalability to larger datasets or more complex tasks, nor does it explore more diverse real-world datasets with balanced distributions.
- Potential for Overfitting: The small validation set (50 samples) used for prompt selection raises concerns about the generalizability of the optimized prompts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the variety and scope of testing datasets to include more diverse real-world datasets, rather than relying solely on income, credit, and insurance coverage. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating a broader range of performance and fairness metrics beyond demographic parity to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Finally, we suggest increasing the size of the validation set to enhance the generalizability of the optimized prompts.
