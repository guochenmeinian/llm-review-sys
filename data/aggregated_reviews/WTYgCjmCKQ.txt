### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to modeling multiple types of user feedback in recommender systems through the introduction of xMTF, which utilizes a learnable monotonic fusion cell (MFC) instead of pre-defined formulas. The authors propose a two-stage training strategy to effectively learn model parameters. Empirical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of xMTF in both offline and online experiments, showing improvements over baseline methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in recommendation systems and presents a clear structure, making it accessible even to those unfamiliar with reinforcement learning.
- The formula-free MTF module is innovative, leveraging the Sprecher Representation Theorem to enhance performance.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of xMTF, supported by ablation studies and visualizations.

Weaknesses:
- The time complexity and inference latency of the proposed method compared to baselines remain unclear.
- The selection criteria for users in visualizations lack diversity, which could enhance the study's persuasiveness.
- The impact of the hyperparameter $\lambda$ on results raises questions about how to efficiently determine its value for new datasets.
- The differences in xMTF's performance across various targets need further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a detailed time complexity analysis and time cost results for the MFC and the two-stage training strategy. Additionally, including more recent baseline methods would strengthen the experimental validation. The authors should clarify the user selection criteria in visualizations and offer guidance on determining the hyperparameter $\lambda$ for different scenarios. Finally, a deeper discussion on the varying impacts of xMTF on different targets would enhance the paper's depth.
