Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on normal mean estimation in a collaborative setting involving multiple agents who aim to estimate an unknown mean while minimizing data acquisition costs. The authors identify that a naive data aggregation mechanism can lead to freeriding and propose a novel mechanism where a central entity collects data and shares noisy information about other players' samples, with noise magnitude based on sample deviations. The authors demonstrate that their mechanism satisfies desirable properties such as incentive compatibility (IC), individual rationality (IR), and efficiency in the single-dimensional Gaussian case, and retains approximate versions of these properties more generally. Additionally, the paper explores mechanisms for incentivizing effort among agents, focusing on how strategic considerations evolve when agents can freely use the data they receive. The authors propose a main mechanism in Algorithm 1 and two simpler mechanisms in Sections 4.1 and 4.2, with the latter achieving a $(1+\epsilon)$ factor improvement over a previous approximation in a restricted strategy space. However, in the richer strategy space, agents are incentivized to modify their data rather than simply accept the provided estimates, complicating the determination of Nash equilibria.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a relevant perspective on data-sharing incentives in federated learning.
- The proposed mechanism is flexible as it does not rely on side payments.
- The authors consider a broad class of player strategies and prove strong theorems.
- The paper addresses a novel aspect of strategic behavior by allowing agents to utilize their own data, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between different mechanisms and their respective performance metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The placement of "recommended strategies" within the formalism is confusing, as there is no clear distinction in the analysis between recommended and non-recommended strategies.
- The recommended strategies are shown to be Nash equilibria but not dominant strategies; a discussion on other equilibria would enhance the paper.
- Several relevant citations are missing, particularly regarding the similarity of the proposed mechanism to peer prediction.
- The motivation for exploring the complex corruption strategy space is not sufficiently articulated.
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the Nash equilibria of the mechanisms, particularly in the richer strategy space, which may undermine the robustness of the findings.
- Minor issues include redundancy in language and grammatical errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "recommended strategies" section to differentiate it from non-recommended strategies. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on other equilibria to explore their relationship with the recommended strategies. The authors should also enhance the related work section by incorporating relevant citations, particularly those related to peer prediction. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the motivation for studying the complex strategy space, emphasizing its relevance to collaborative data sharing scenarios. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed comparison with the mechanism from Cai et al. to highlight the differences in optimal strategies and performance metrics. Finally, providing more insight into the Nash equilibria for the mechanisms discussed is crucial for understanding their effectiveness in the proposed settings, and addressing minor language issues, such as redundancy in sentences and grammatical errors, would improve the overall presentation.
