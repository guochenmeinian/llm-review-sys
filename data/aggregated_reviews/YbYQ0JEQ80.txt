### Key Points
This paper presents BiMatting, the first binarized video matting network aimed at reducing computational consumption while maintaining practical accuracy. The authors analyze the bottlenecks in direct binarization of video matting models and propose an efficient binarization method. BiMatting constructs a binary backbone that achieves comparable acceleration to binarized MobileNetV3, enhancing the practicality of binarization in video matting. The method utilizes sparse masks to reduce computational load without significant performance degradation, demonstrating superior accuracy compared to existing binarized models and even full-precision models like BGMv2.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors introduce the first binary neural network for video matting, significantly reducing computation while retaining accuracy, which is crucial for resource-constrained devices.
- The design of the binary backbone with SBB is a major contribution, achieving reasonable accuracy and efficiency.
- The experimental results show that BiMatting outperforms existing methods, with substantial improvements in detail and storage savings.

Weaknesses:
- The authors should provide more detailed information on the SBB backbone, including FLOPs and parameter counts for both full-precision and binarized models.
- The SAB implementation leads to unexpected crashes in the direct binarized model, necessitating an explanation.
- The performance of ReCU and BNN in Table 2 is inconsistent with their reported performance in original papers, warranting further discussion.
- The complexity of the training pipeline, with multiple stages and settings, raises concerns about robustness and reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the SBB backbone by including detailed ablation studies on efficiency metrics. Additionally, the authors should address the unexpected performance issues related to SAB and clarify the discrepancies in Table 2. It would be beneficial to discuss the practical deployment of BiMatting on edge devices, including hardware inference performance. Lastly, we suggest simplifying the training pipeline and providing comprehensive experiments to validate the robustness of the proposed method under various training settings.
