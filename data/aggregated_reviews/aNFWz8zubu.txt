### Key Points
This paper presents EtiCor, a novel English corpus of etiquettes covering five major world regions: India, Latin America, Japan-Korea-Taiwan, Middle-East-Africa, North America, and Europe. The corpus, constructed through scraping various sources, includes manually labeled norms indicating regional appropriateness. The authors introduce the Etiquette Sensitivity task, which assesses whether a given statement about etiquette is suitable for a specific region. Three Large Language Models (LLMs) were evaluated on this task, revealing no significant differences among them, while fine-tuned BERT classifiers showed slight improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a novel corpus with 35,000 meticulously curated labels focusing on etiquettes from diverse global regions.
2. The proposal of the 'Etiquette Sensitivity' task to evaluate the appropriateness of social norms in geographical contexts.
3. The analysis of biases in LLMs regarding social etiquettes, contributing to responsible AI development.
4. The dataset's potential for enhancing cross-cultural understanding and promoting a more equitable society.
5. Notable findings regarding GPT3.5's responses to Middle East and Africa social norms, suggesting avenues for further qualitative analysis.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of clarity regarding the specific research gap addressed by the new etiquette corpus amidst existing resources.
2. Insufficient detail in the methodology for data creation and querying models about social etiquette.
3. Inconsistencies in reported results, particularly regarding Falcon40B and discrepancies between BERT validation and test accuracies.
4. Absence of a ten-fold cross-validation approach for the fine-tuned BERT system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly articulating the research gap their corpus addresses. Additionally, please provide more detailed descriptions of the data creation methodology, including criteria for labeling and website selection. We suggest clarifying the querying process for the models regarding social etiquette. To enhance the robustness of the BERT results, we recommend employing a ten-fold cross-validation approach. Furthermore, please ensure that all results are consistently presented and clarify any discrepancies noted in the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the identified typos and incorporate additional references as discussed.
