Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FreqMark, a novel method for watermarking images that embeds a binary message in the latent frequency space derived from Variational Autoencoder (VAE) encoding. The authors demonstrate that FreqMark achieves a robust quality-robustness tradeoff through numerical experiments on datasets including 500 images from ImageNet and DiffusionDB. The method shows superior performance compared to existing techniques such as DwtDctSvd, Stable Signature, and SSL, particularly against regeneration attacks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of the FreqMark algorithm and its superior performance compared to baseline methods.
- The method demonstrates high bit accuracy (over 90% for a 48-bit encoding) and robustness against various attacks, including VAE and diffusion models.
- The paper is well-organized, and the appendices provide significant additional information.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of theoretical justification for the benefits of embedding watermark bits in the FFT of latent space, particularly regarding the nature of spatial relationships captured.
- The paper does not adequately address how watermark bits are embedded in the complex values produced by the FFT.
- The methodology lacks novelty, as it follows an established framework with incremental innovations and does not sufficiently differentiate itself from previous approaches like StegaStamp and Tree-Ring watermarking.
- The sample size of 500 images is considered too small for robust testing, and the paper does not explore the effects of longer regeneration steps adequately.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of their work by providing a convincing justification for the advantages of using FFT in latent space. Additionally, a detailed discussion on how watermark bits are embedded in the complex values of the FFT outputs is necessary. The authors should consider revising the title to better reflect the major contribution of the paper regarding robustness against regeneration attacks. Furthermore, we suggest including comparisons with critical competitor baselines such as StegaStamp and Tree-Ring watermarking to substantiate claims of novelty. Finally, expanding the sample size and exploring the effects of longer regeneration steps would enhance the robustness of the findings.
