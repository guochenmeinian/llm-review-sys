Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel densification strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) utilizing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling scheme. The authors address the limitations of heuristic densification in standard 3DGS by introducing a distribution-aware resampling pipeline, resulting in improved rendering quality while maintaining fast inference times. The method is shown to outperform existing NeRF-based methods and standard 3DGS across various datasets, demonstrating robustness to initialization and effective performance with limited Gaussian budgets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and provides a fresh perspective on 3D Gaussian sampling, supported by extensive and detailed experiments.
- It effectively tackles the limitations of standard 3DGS, achieving high rendering quality and robustness to initialization.
- The proposed method shows competitive results across various datasets and is easy to implement, with a clear evaluation of performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The additional computational costs associated with MCMC increase training time compared to standard 3DGS, with the proposed method taking significantly longer.
- The technical contribution is limited to the resampling strategy, which may be seen as inefficient despite the detailed analysis.
- There is a lack of evaluation on the Scannet++ dataset, and the relevance of the MCMC framework is questioned, particularly regarding its necessity in the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the computational time comparison between their method and standard 3DGS for each scene, as well as provide more details on how adding noise to parameters can lead to harmful results. Additionally, we suggest including evaluations on the Scannet++ dataset to assess performance on challenging indoor scenes. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the design of the noise term and its impact on performance, as well as clarify the assumptions and approximations related to the derivation in equation 9.
