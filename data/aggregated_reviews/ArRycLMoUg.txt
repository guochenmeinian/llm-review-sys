Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Lyapunov control method for discrete-time systems, introducing a mixed-integer linear programming approach for verifying stability conditions, a technique for computing sub-level sets to define the region of attraction, and a heuristic gradient-based method for generating counterexamples to accelerate the learning of Lyapunov functions. The authors claim significant improvements over existing methods, particularly in running time and the size of the region of attraction. Additionally, the paper emphasizes a computational approach to stability checking, leveraging specific structures in Lyapunov conditions to achieve superior performance compared to existing methods. The authors argue that their empirical contributions are significant within the AI community, despite differing perspectives on the importance of mathematical foundations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed counterexample generation method effectively leverages adversarial training concepts from computer vision, enhancing the discovery of counterexamples.  
- The method demonstrates substantial performance improvements over neural Lyapunov control baselines, achieving better results in both running time and region of attraction size across multiple benchmarks.  
- The authors provide a novel computational method that exploits problem structure for improved stability checking in discrete-time systems.  
- Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, which is aligned with recent advancements in the field.  
- The structured presentation and novel techniques for discrete-time systems are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- The heuristic counterexample generation method lacks guarantees for finding all counterexamples, relying on state space sampling, which does not align with strict verification objectives.  
- The authors do not clarify the challenges of training in discrete-time systems compared to continuous-time systems, despite their theoretical similarities.  
- The necessity of verification in learning for control is questioned, as real-world dynamics often exceed the complexities addressed in the paper, suggesting that empirical performance may be more relevant than rigorous verification.  
- The mathematical foundation of the proposed stability results is questioned, with concerns that the revised Lemma 3.1 does not guarantee asymptotic stability, only boundedness.  
- The terminology used in defining stability may not align with standard definitions in control theory, leading to potential misunderstandings about the work's contributions.  
- There are concerns regarding the mathematical correctness of Lemma 3.1, which is deemed incorrect by some reviewers, potentially undermining the soundness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the heuristic counterexample generation method to ensure more comprehensive coverage of the state space, enhancing the verification process.  
- The authors should provide a clearer discussion on the challenges specific to discrete-time systems and how their approach differs from existing continuous-time methodologies.  
- We suggest that the authors consider the implications of their verification methods in real-world applications, possibly emphasizing empirical performance over strict verification.  
- It is crucial to address the concerns regarding Lemma 3.1 by revising its mathematical formulation and providing a more robust proof to ensure the soundness of the proposed approach.  
- We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical rigor of their stability claims, particularly in Lemma 3.1, to ensure that asymptotic stability is adequately addressed.  
- The authors should clarify their definitions of stability to align with established terminology in control literature.  
- A thorough discussion on parameter choices, including \(\epsilon\), should also be included to strengthen the foundation of their numerical results.  
- Finally, we encourage the authors to consider a substantial rewrite to address the foundational issues raised, rather than a minor revision.
