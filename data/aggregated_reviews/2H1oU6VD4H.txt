### Key Points
This paper presents Molecule-Edit Templates for Retrosynthesis (METRO), a model for reaction prediction that utilizes efficient minimal templates. The authors demonstrate that METRO achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on four out of five standard benchmarks while employing fewer templates than previous methods. The method decomposes reaction prediction into a series of small graph edits, with a neural network "policy" learned to apply these edits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- METRO showcases high accuracy on multiple benchmarks with fewer templates.  
- The core idea of using graph edits for retrosynthesis prediction is clear and well-presented.  
- The empirical results appear promising.

Weaknesses:  
- The distinction between METRO and similar semi-template methods, particularly MEGAN, is not clearly articulated.  
- Potential evaluation errors, such as atom mapping labels and stereochemistry considerations, may affect the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide more analysis on the benchmarks where METRO did not excel to better understand its advantages and use cases. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the differences between METRO and MEGAN, ideally including comparative experiments to elucidate performance variations.
