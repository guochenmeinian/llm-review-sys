Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an instance-adaptive prompting (IAP) algorithm aimed at enhancing zero-shot Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models (LLMs). The authors analyze the interactions among the question, prompt, and rationale using neuron saliency scores to identify effective reasoning patterns. They demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IAP through extensive experiments on LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and Qwen models across various reasoning tasks, revealing that traditional task-level prompts are inadequate for all instances. The authors' responses to reviewer concerns have effectively addressed the issues raised, leading to an overall positive reception of the work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the research is intuitive, with clear illustrations of the benefits of instance-wise prompting over task-level prompts.
- The innovative use of neuron saliency scores to analyze information flow provides valuable insights into reasoning mechanisms.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods across multiple models and tasks.
- The paper is recognized as a solid contribution to the field, with reviewers noting that their concerns were satisfactorily addressed.

Weaknesses:
- The explanation of the proposed methods lacks clarity, with missing details on thresholds for Sequential Substitution (IAP-ss) and the number of top scores preserved in Majority Vote (IAP-mv).
- The experimental setup is criticized for being unfair, particularly in comparing IAP-mv with baselines that perform single inferences, potentially skewing results.
- Some experimental conclusions lack sufficient analysis, particularly regarding the consistency and complementary results, leading to potentially misleading interpretations.
- Some reviewers initially expressed concerns that required clarification, but these have since been resolved through the authors' responses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proposed methods by providing specific details on the thresholds used in IAP-ss and the criteria for selecting top scores in IAP-mv. Additionally, we suggest revising the experimental setup to ensure fair comparisons between IAP-mv and baseline methods, possibly by including ensemble inference as a baseline. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more thorough analysis of the experimental results, particularly in the sections discussing consistency and complementary findings, to strengthen the conclusions drawn from the data. Lastly, we recommend that the authors enhance clarity in the presentation of their findings to further improve understanding among readers.
