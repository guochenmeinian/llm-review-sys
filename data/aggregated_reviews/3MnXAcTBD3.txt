### Key Points
This paper presents the B-ary Tree Push-Pull (BTPP) algorithm for distributed learning over heterogeneous data, utilizing two spanning directed trees: Pull Tree \(G_R\) and Push Tree \(G_C\). The BTPP algorithm achieves only \(\Theta(1)\) communication overhead per iteration and \(O(n)\) transient time complexity, demonstrating superior performance compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for BTPP's sublinear convergence rate and support their claims with experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- BTPP effectively combines two directed trees for efficient distributed learning.
- The communication time complexity is lower than other methods due to the maximum degree of \(O(n)\).
- The paper offers rigorous theoretical analysis and guarantees for the BTPP algorithm.

Weaknesses:
- The derivation of BTPP from the Push-Pull gradient method raises questions about the differences between the two algorithms, particularly since the mathematical formulation and pseudocode resemble those in prior work.
- The assertion that the Pull graph \(G_R\) is the inverse of the Push graph \(G_C\) lacks clarity regarding the necessity for identical structures.
- The paper primarily presents iteration-wise test performance, neglecting time-wise performance comparisons, which are crucial for evaluating communication cost advantages.
- The introduction lacks cohesion, and the significance of transient time could be better articulated.
- The analysis is limited to smooth nonconvex functions, with no discussion on strongly convex functions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences between BTPP and the Push-Pull gradient method, particularly in the mathematical formulation. Additionally, the authors should clarify the necessity of the Pull and Push graphs having the same structure. To enhance the evaluation of BTPP's advantages, we suggest including time-wise performance metrics alongside iteration-wise results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more cohesive introduction that emphasizes the importance of transient time and to discuss the implications of their assumptions regarding the gradient estimator's bias and variance. Lastly, expanding the analysis to include strongly convex functions would strengthen the paper's contributions.
