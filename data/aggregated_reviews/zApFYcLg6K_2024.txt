Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating U statistics under central differential privacy, addressing a gap in the literature. U statistics are minimum variance unbiased estimators for parameters of the form $\mathbb{E} h (X_1, ..., X_k)$, where $h$ is a kernel and $X_i$ are i.i.d. samples. The authors derive lower bounds for private algorithms in both non-degenerate and degenerate kernel cases, demonstrating that existing private mean estimation methods yield suboptimal errors. They propose an algorithm (Algorithm 1) based on local HÃ¡jek projections that achieves nearly optimal private error, supported by rigorous theoretical results and extensive applications across various statistical tests.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clear, well-structured, and provides rigorous derivations and proofs.
- It addresses a notable gap in differential privacy research concerning U statistics.
- The proposed method shows wide applicability and is supported by a comprehensive theoretical foundation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is technical and notation-heavy, which may hinder readability.
- It lacks asymptotic normality results for the private U-statistics, which are crucial for practical applications.
- There are no experimental results to validate the proposed algorithms, and the discussion on variance estimation for private confidence intervals is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation and definitions, particularly in the algorithmic sections. Additionally, we suggest including asymptotic normality results for the private U-statistics to enhance practical applicability. The authors should also consider adding experimental results to demonstrate the practical performance of the proposed methods. Finally, a dedicated paragraph addressing the limitations of the proposed methods would improve the paper's accessibility for readers skimming through the content.
