### Key Points
This paper presents a geometric score-based generative method for rigidly docking individual protein chains into complex structures, emphasizing computational efficiency for scaling to larger complexes. The authors' experiments indicate that a coarse-grained adaptation of DiffDock for rigid protein-protein docking achieves reasonable performance and high completion rates. However, geometric diffusion methods may experience high variance in their reverse diffusion process due to score degeneracy, although current solutions do not significantly mitigate this issue. The findings are intriguing and suggest avenues for future exploration in geometric diffusion models within protein-protein interactions, but additional comparisons with similar docking methods are necessary.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors' experiments are well-executed, with careful attention to the construction of the docking dataset to prevent cross-validation homology leakage.
- The proposed sequence-based coarse-graining is a novel approach that may be applicable in other molecular contexts, validating its effectiveness for rigid-body protein tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The work shows considerable overlap with DiffDock-PP, necessitating a direct comparison to clarify the strengths and weaknesses of both methods. Benchmarking is required to test the hypothesis that DiffDock-PP may not scale as effectively to large complexes.
- The authors should consider creating a validation dataset with limited "structure-based" similarity to the training dataset to assess potential overfitting to specific protein structural families, using tools like FoldSeek for structure-based filtering.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in their notation, particularly regarding the representation of each chain's structure and the indices used in their equations. Additionally, the authors should clarify the initial positions of each chain and their impact on final performance, as well as how the method addresses overlaps between chains. Finally, we suggest conducting direct comparisons with DiffDock-PP and creating a validation dataset to explore overfitting concerns.
