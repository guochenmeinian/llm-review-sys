Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GaussianMarker, a novel method for embedding invisible watermarks into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) models to protect copyright. The authors propose using uncertainty estimation to add imperceptible perturbations to 3D Gaussian parameters with high uncertainty, minimizing distortions. They differentiate their work from existing methods, particularly CopyRNeRF, by highlighting their method's ability to extract messages from both 2D images and 3D Gaussians, as well as its significantly reduced training time. The method demonstrates robustness against various 3D and 2D distortions, with experimental results indicating effectiveness in message decoding accuracy and visual quality preservation. The authors also address challenges related to hiding information, particularly images, and propose adjustments to improve the encoding and decoding processes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Timely contribution addressing copyright protection for 3D Gaussian Splatting models, an increasingly important 3D asset format.
- Clever use of uncertainty estimation to guide watermark embedding while preserving visual quality.
- Demonstrates robustness to various 3D and 2D distortions/attacks.
- The authors provide a clear distinction between their method and existing approaches, emphasizing unique features such as uncertainty-based embedding and dual extraction capabilities.
- The training efficiency of their method is notably superior, allowing for rapid watermarking of 3DGS models.
- The authors demonstrate a willingness to engage with reviewer feedback and incorporate suggestions for improvement.

Weaknesses:
- The decoder is scene-specific, making the watermarking process impractical for real-world use, as it requires separate encoders and decoders for each scene.
- Experiments focus primarily on simple scenes; more complex, dynamic scenes could pose challenges.
- Robustness against sophisticated attacks (e.g., adversarial perturbations) is not explored.
- Some reviewers perceive the work as relatively incremental, lacking clear novelty compared to existing methods.
- Concerns remain regarding the capacity for hiding complex information, such as images, within the 3DGS framework.
- Discussion of potential negative impacts of the technology could be expanded.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the decoder to allow for a single watermark encoder and decoder applicable across various scenes, similar to traditional image watermarking. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on more complex and dynamic scenes to assess the method's robustness. The authors should also explore the robustness of the watermark against advanced attacks and expand the discussion on potential negative impacts or misuse scenarios associated with the technology. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of their contributions by providing more detailed comparisons with existing methods, particularly regarding novelty. Addressing the concerns about the information hiding capacity through an ablation study could strengthen their argument. Finally, clarifying the specific parameters used in the uncertainty calculations and providing further explanation of the densify function would enhance the paper's clarity.
