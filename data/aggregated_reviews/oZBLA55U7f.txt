Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents APT-Pipe, an automatic and extensible prompt-tuning pipeline aimed at enhancing ChatGPT's performance in social computing data annotation tasks. APT-Pipe demonstrates an average improvement of 7.01% in F1-score across nine out of twelve datasets tested, showcasing its effectiveness in refining LLMs for classification tasks. The tool generates consistent annotations and reduces classification time by over 25%, making it suitable for large-scale projects. Additionally, APT-Pipe incorporates two advanced prompt-tuning techniques, Chain of Thought (CoT) and Tree of Thought (ToT), further enhancing its adaptability and performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in automating prompt-tuning for data annotation tasks.
- APT-Pipe is well-structured and thoroughly evaluated across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness and flexibility.
- The integration of contemporary tuning techniques enhances the tool's capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- APT-Pipe's testing is limited to ChatGPT, raising questions about its generalizability to other models.
- The requirement for prompt engineers to annotate a small subset of data may not be feasible in all scenarios.
- The paper lacks qualitative analysis of generated prompts and annotations, and the rationale behind certain design choices is insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of APT-Pipe by testing it with additional LLMs beyond ChatGPT. It would be beneficial to provide qualitative examples of generated prompts and annotations to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the rationale behind their design choices, including the selection of NLP metrics and dataset choices. Expanding the testing scope to include a wider variety of datasets and tasks would also strengthen the paper's contributions.
