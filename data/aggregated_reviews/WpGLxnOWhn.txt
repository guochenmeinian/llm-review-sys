Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the reasons behind the poor performance of jointly trained deep ensembles compared to separately trained members. The authors provide a theoretical framework for understanding this phenomenon, termed "learner collusion," where base learners artificially inflate their diversity without improving generalization. They introduce a diversity expression (DIV) for probability averaging, generalize it to any twice differentiable loss function, and propose an augmented objective $\mathcal{L}^\beta$ to interpolate between joint and independent training. Empirical measures are devised to test their hypothesis, focusing on generalization gaps and learner codependence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, enhancing the reading experience.
- The novel explanation of learner collusion provides a fresh perspective on the challenges of joint training.
- The theoretical findings are supported by empirical evidence from real-world data.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on varying $\beta$ lacks clarity; a more thorough exploration of collusion effects at intermediate values is needed.
- The paper does not propose practical solutions to prevent learner collusion during joint training, limiting its practical contribution.
- Formatting issues, such as the absence of titles in references and small figure text, detract from readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the variation of $\beta$, particularly regarding the intuition behind the collusion effect and its implications for joint training. Additionally, the authors should consider proposing practical methods to mitigate learner collusion during joint training. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the paper's formatting by ensuring all references include titles and adjusting figure layouts for better clarity.
