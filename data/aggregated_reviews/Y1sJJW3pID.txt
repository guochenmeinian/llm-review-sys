Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for maximizing continuous DR-submodular functions across 16 different settings, employing a Frank-Wolfe algorithm that achieves the first oracle complexity guarantees in nine cases, reduces computational complexity in two cases, and matches existing guarantees in five cases. The authors also extend their results to online stochastic settings with bandit feedback, providing the first regret bounds for this context. Furthermore, the paper introduces a Frank-Wolfe type algorithm for analyzing monotone functions over general convex sets, allowing oracle queries solely within the feasible set. A new construction procedure for a shrunk constraint set is proposed, enabling the use of lower-dimensional feasible sets with a value oracle. The authors assert that their work clarifies gaps in approximation guarantees for monotone DR-submodular maximization, reformulating previously considered problems into a more coherent mathematical framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a unified approach to constrained DR-submodular maximization, applicable across various settings.
- It introduces the first regret analysis for online stochastic DR-submodular maximization with bandit feedback.
- The construction of a shrunk constraint set is a notable technical contribution that allows for lower-dimensional feasible sets when using a value oracle.
- The authors shed light on previously unexplained gaps in approximation guarantees, enhancing the understanding of monotone DR-submodular maximization.
- The paper is well-organized and clearly presents its main concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of empirical evaluation is a significant concern, particularly given the focus on avoiding computationally expensive projections.
- The novelty of the paper is perceived as lacking, with a notable absence of empirical evaluation.
- The motivation for the specific setting of value oracle queries is insufficiently addressed, lacking examples of practical applications.
- Many techniques used, such as the smoothing trick and two-point estimator, are not novel and should be better contextualized within the paper's contributions.
- The reviewers express a need for further discussion to finalize their assessments, indicating uncertainty about the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation of their framework and algorithm to substantiate their theoretical claims. Additionally, it is crucial to include a dedicated section discussing the importance of the setting where the oracle provides only function values, along with relevant applications. Enhancing the discussion of the paper's novelty in relation to existing literature could address the reviewers' concerns regarding its originality. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the challenges faced when proving their results and how they overcame these challenges, particularly in the context of the more general results. Lastly, enhancing the presentation of proofs in the appendix would improve readability and comprehension.
