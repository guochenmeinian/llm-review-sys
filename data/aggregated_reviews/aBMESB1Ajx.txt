Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an existence proof for Strong Lottery Tickets (SLTs) by improving upon the existing method that utilized the Subset Sum approximation. The authors propose the Random Fixed Subset Sum (RFSS) approximation, which employs subsets of fixed sizes to approximate parameters in target networks. They demonstrate the existence of SLTs and provide a lower bound on the overparameterization required for achieving sparsity after pruning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors introduce the RFSS approximation, allowing for a fixed-size subset to approximate parameters, which is a notable advancement.
2. The work is the first to provide a size guarantee for pruned subnetworks with high probability, contributing to the understanding of SLTs.

Weaknesses:
1. The overall contribution appears limited, primarily connecting existing results without substantial new insights.
2. The paper lacks numerical constructions of real-world neural networks using the proposed framework, raising questions about the practical implications of the theoretical results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the novelty of their proof, particularly in relation to existing work by Burkholz et al. on sparsity estimates. Additionally, the authors should include numerical examples to validate their theoretical framework and demonstrate whether the networks found are sparser than those identified in previous studies. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the discussion on the implications of their results, particularly in Sections 4 and 5, to better connect their findings to practical applications.
