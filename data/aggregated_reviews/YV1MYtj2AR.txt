Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance view generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) by integrating a spatial transformer network (STN) into model-based policy adaptation. The authors propose a method that utilizes a dynamic transition model during testing to fine-tune the mapping of observed states, enabling effective adaptation to unseen views. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements across multiple benchmarks, although the novelty of the method is questioned.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is simple yet achieves stable performance gains across various benchmarks.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear explanations and effective ablation studies highlighting the contributions of each component.
- The approach's test-time adaptation capability is a notable advantage, allowing for application in real-world scenarios without requiring a reward signal.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, primarily combining existing methods without substantial novelty.
- The evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, focusing instead on ablation studies.
- There are issues with clarity in the writing, particularly regarding the model-based RL problem and the definition of view generalization.
- The choice of baseline comparisons and the effectiveness of the proposed method against model-free algorithms remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of sections 2 and 3 to better define the model-based RL problem and the concept of view generalization. Additionally, providing performance data related to the original view would help quantify the significance of the generalization gap. We suggest incorporating comparisons with SOTA methods, such as TD-MPC and recent data augmentation techniques like DrQ-v2 and SEVA, to strengthen the evaluation. Furthermore, a deeper analysis of the architecture and the choice of test-time loss is necessary, including qualitative assessments of representations before and after adaptation. Finally, conducting real-world robot experiments would substantiate claims regarding the method's applicability in practical scenarios.
