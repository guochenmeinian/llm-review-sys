### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of CLIP foundation models using standard inversion techniques, marking the first interrogation of CLIP through these methods and revealing significant biases. The authors propose that their methodology for generating inversions is comparable to existing vision encoder inversion techniques. The results provide intriguing insights into the model's behavior and biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers insightful observations regarding CLIP's ability to blend concepts and the emergence of NSFW images from benign prompts, highlighting critical issues for practitioners.  
- It addresses gender biases in inverted images, contributing to discussions on fairness and ethical AI deployment.  
- The study enhances model interpretability by providing a practical method for understanding how CLIP models represent and manipulate concepts.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation is sloppy, with unpolished text, missing citations, and formatting issues that hinder readability.  
- The experimental design is overly qualitative and lacks systematic study, raising concerns about generalizability.  
- The reliance on arbitrary selections of prompts and the use of biased classifiers in experiments diminishes confidence in the findings.  
- There is insufficient discussion of the methodology's novelty, as the inversion approach itself is not new.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's presentation by refining the text, addressing formatting issues, and ensuring all citations are complete. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the experimental design by implementing a more systematic approach to prompt selection and including ablation studies on different models and optimization setups. It would also be beneficial to clarify the novelty of the inversion methodology and its contributions to existing literature. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more comprehensive discussion on the implications of their findings, including ethical considerations and broader impacts.
