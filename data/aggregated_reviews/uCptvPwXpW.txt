Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We recognize that the authors identify a domain gap in textual annotations across the BABEL, KIT, and HumanML3D datasets and propose using textual augmentations with LLMs (Llama-2 and GPT3.5) to bridge this gap. Their approach aims to enhance motion retrieval tasks, retrain the TMR model, and demonstrate improved results through comprehensive experiments.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include a thorough analysis of the text-motion datasets, the potential utility of cross-dataset data augmentation for the 3D human motion synthesis community, and the introduction of a unified representation of 3D motion sequences. The experimental analysis is extensive, showing positive improvements in the TMR model. However, the technical novelty is marginal, with improvements primarily stemming from minor adjustments to the contrastive loss function and augmentation labels. Additionally, the evaluation does not consistently guarantee better performance across all datasets, and there is a lack of discussion regarding dataset bias beyond the introduction.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest addressing the domain gap in the motion modality, as there is an overlap between the datasets that could be beneficial for understanding multi-dataset experiments. Furthermore, we recommend publishing the textual augmentations for the datasets, as this would be valuable for other text-to-motion tasks. Overall, we believe the paper highlights a significant issue in text-motion research and can be beneficial for the community, warranting acceptance.
