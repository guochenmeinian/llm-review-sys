Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents techniques for automatically generating explicitations in translation to address cultural gaps between source and target languages. The authors introduce the WIKIEXPL dataset, which consists of entities described differently across languages, and evaluate the effectiveness of these explicitations in enhancing multilingual question answering systems. The study highlights the importance of explicitation in translation, which is often overlooked in current machine translation models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of the WIKIEXPL dataset, which is human-annotated and serves as a valuable resource for training and evaluating explicitation techniques.
- The paper effectively addresses the cultural nuances in translation, demonstrating practical relevance through evaluations in multilingual question answering.
- The work introduces an interesting task that could improve translation quality, with substantial contributions including a new dataset and evaluation methods.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is relatively small, with low instances of explicitation, which may weaken the inferences drawn from experimental performance.
- Several assumptions regarding explicitations are built into the work, potentially narrowing their definition and applicability.
- The motivations behind specific dataset choices and hyperparameters are inadequately documented, leading to questions about their validity and impact on results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation and explanation of their dataset choices and hyperparameters, particularly regarding the thresholds and exclusions mentioned in the paper. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments to validate the algorithm's performance across different language pairs. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the process of creating the WIKIEXPL dataset, including the criteria for selecting entities and examples requiring explicitation. Finally, addressing the limitations of current NLP approaches to explicitation could strengthen the paper's impact.
