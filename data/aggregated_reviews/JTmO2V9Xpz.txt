Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MegaByte, a decoder-style model comprising three components: patching of bytes, processing of patches with an autoregressive model, and converting patches back to bytes using another autoregressive model. The authors claim that MegaByte enables sub-quadratic attention, enhances expressiveness for the same computational cost, accelerates decoding, and eliminates the need for tokenization. The model reportedly outperforms Transformer and Perceiver AR in byte-level language, image, and audio modeling, suggesting potential for future language models to bypass tokenization entirely.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The proposed architecture is novel and demonstrates a solid understanding of related work.
- **Quality**: The experiments effectively showcase the model's capabilities.
- **Clarity**: The paper is generally well-written and comprehensible.
- **Significance**: It provides compelling evidence that tokenization may be unnecessary in language modeling, exploring a well-motivated architecture.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the application of the three "Extensions" in Section 2.3, necessitating a table in the appendix to clarify their usage in results.
- Low-level details remain ambiguous, such as the use of position embeddings in the local model and specifics about the audio modeling dataset.
- Reproducibility of results is a concern, and there is insufficient discussion of limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including a table in the appendix that specifies when each "Extension" was utilized in the results. Additionally, providing code associated with the paper would enhance reproducibility. The authors should also clarify low-level details, such as the use of position embeddings and the specific audio dataset employed. Lastly, a more thorough analysis of the model's limitations and a comparison against state-of-the-art tokenizer-based models would strengthen the paper.
