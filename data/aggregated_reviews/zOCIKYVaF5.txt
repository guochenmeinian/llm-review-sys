Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the phenomenon of Residual Alignment (RA) in ResNets, where the top left and right singular vectors of residual Jacobians align across different residual blocks. The authors provide extensive experimental verification and theoretical frameworks, demonstrating that RA emerges in ResNets but not in non-residual networks. This work offers novel insights into the mechanisms behind the success of ResNets, contributing to deep learning theory, architecture design, and model compression.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The identification of RA is novel and significant, with implications for deep learning theory and architecture.
- The experimental protocols are innovative and convincingly demonstrate the presence of RA in residual networks.
- The theoretical analysis is robust, with sound proofs and a well-defined mathematical model.
- The paper is well-structured and clear, with high-quality figures supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with critical definitions and information missing from the main text.
- The paper primarily focuses on binary classification, limiting its applicability and exploration of RA in other contexts.
- Some minor errors and typos are present, which could detract from the overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by ensuring that all critical definitions, such as that of residual alignment Jacobians ($J_i$'s), are included in the main text. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the restriction of findings to classification tasks and exploring the implications of RA beyond this context. It would also be beneficial to enhance the organization of the paper, particularly by relocating the related work section to an earlier position. Finally, addressing minor errors and typos, such as those noted in the review, will further improve clarity and presentation.
