### Key Points
This paper presents an image generation framework utilizing denoising diffusion models through optical computing. The method employs passive diffractive optical layers trained to manipulate light propagation, achieving effective denoising and rapid image processing with significantly reduced power consumption. The authors demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on datasets such as MNIST, Quick Draw, and Fashion MNIST. Additionally, the paper proposes an opto-electronic realization of a toy diffusion model, integrating a DMD for optical projection, SLMs for phase modulation, and a CMOS photosensor for signal recording, alongside an online learning scheme to optimize physical parameters. Furthermore, the authors provide a proof-of-principle demonstration of diffusion models utilizing optics through algorithmic innovations with accessible hardware, arguing that SLM-based systems have potential for widespread industrial deployment. They present scalability results indicating that their optical system, ODU, performs favorably against digital neural networks as datasets increase in complexity and note that enhancing the trainable parameter count in the optical system improves generation quality comparably to digital implementations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear, addressing the environmental impact of traditional computing methods, with the framework being 400 times more energy-efficient than conventional GPU approaches.  
- The innovative demonstration of an opto-electronic implementation and the effective online learning scheme are notable contributions.  
- The study demonstrates innovative use of optics in diffusion models with accessible hardware.  
- Scalability results show ODU's competitive performance against digital neural networks.  
- The authors are proactive in addressing the need for multi-channel capabilities and exploring additional dimensionality through optical properties.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the scalability of the proposed models in real-world scenarios and does not provide rigorous comparisons with existing GPU-based denoising frameworks.  
- The novelty is limited, as no new hardware system is proposed, and the methods largely rely on standard algorithms.  
- The implementation is restricted to linear operations, which may limit its effectiveness compared to conventional neural networks that leverage non-linearities.  
- The experimental evaluation lacks insightful baselines, and only toy examples are presented, with no high-resolution benchmarks.  
- The challenges of implementing SLM-based systems in compact devices like smartphones are not fully addressed, and the paper lacks detailed exploration of potential limitations in the proposed model for more complex tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability and maintenance of their systems, particularly addressing the temperature sensitivity of components like liquid crystal displays. Additionally, a broader comparison with existing approaches regarding image quality, convergence time, and processing speed is necessary. The authors should clarify the calibration process of the digital twin and elaborate on the implications of the 20% misalignment mentioned. Including qualitative evaluations of the denoising task and comparisons with simulated digital twins would enhance the paper's impact. We also suggest improving the discussion on the challenges of miniaturizing SLM-based systems for compact devices, particularly smartphones, and providing a more thorough analysis of any potential limitations of the proposed model when tackling complex tasks. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the purely linear implementation and exploring the integration of non-linear elements in future work would strengthen the contribution.
