### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to image augmentation in machine learning by utilizing radiologists' gaze data to enhance the selection of positive pairs in contrastive learning. The authors propose three new image augmentation methods that modify traditional techniques based on gaze-informed attentional maps. They demonstrate that classification models trained with these gaze-aware methods outperform those using standard augmentation techniques across various data percentages. The work emphasizes the significance of gaze-informed models in improving the interpretability and performance of machine learning in medical imaging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well written and logically structured, making it easy to follow.
- The use of eye gaze data for filtering positive pairs is innovative and shows promising results in classification performance.
- The experimental design, including the recording of 354 gaze tracks, is commendable, and the figures and tables are well presented.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of the method is questionable, particularly in more complex imaging scenarios beyond knee X-rays.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the number of radiologists involved and the distribution of gaze tracks among them, which is crucial for assessing potential biases.
- The technique necessitates an additional U-Net model for gaze data, raising concerns about the practicality of widespread application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by providing detailed information on the number of radiologists involved and the distribution of gaze tracks across images. Additionally, exploring the potential for augmenting the region of interest, while maintaining the integrity of critical information, could further enhance the results. We also suggest investigating the generalizability of the gaze-informed approach across different imaging contexts, such as abdominal images, to assess its broader applicability.
