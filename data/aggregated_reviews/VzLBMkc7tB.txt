Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for Robust Markov Decision Processes (RMDPs) and proposes the Doubly Pessimistic Model-based Policy Optimization (P^2MPO) algorithm, which utilizes a double pessimism principle for policy optimization. The authors demonstrate that the suboptimality gap of P^2MPO is bounded by model estimation error and the robust partial coverage coefficient, achieving a convergence rate of $n^{-1/2}$ with respect to the number of trajectories in the offline dataset. The study emphasizes the efficiency of P^2MPO in distributionally robust offline reinforcement learning, particularly in the context of function approximation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a generic framework encompassing various models, including $\mathcal{S}\times\mathcal{A}$-rectangular tabular, kernel, neural, and factored RMDPs.
- It requires only a partial coverage assumption for the dataset, which is a significant improvement over previous works that necessitate full coverage.
- The theoretical contributions, including the double pessimism principle and sub-optimality theorem, are novel and well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The computational efficiency of the proposed algorithm is questionable, particularly regarding the implementation of model estimation steps that satisfy Conditions 3.1 and 3.2.
- The proof of the robust Bellman equation for d-rectangular sets is not formally established, and the current appendix merely rewrites existing proofs.
- The motivation for the two-phase uncertainty sets is unclear, and the paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of their necessity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model estimation steps to ensure they can be efficiently implemented under the specified conditions. Additionally, we suggest providing a formal proof for the robust Bellman equation for d-rectangular sets, rather than relying on existing literature. To enhance the motivation for the two-phase uncertainty sets, the authors should include examples or theoretical justifications demonstrating their practical applicability and advantages over a single-phase approach. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to streamline the presentation by focusing on fewer examples in the main text and moving supplementary material to the appendix.
