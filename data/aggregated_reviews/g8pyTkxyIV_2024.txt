Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Fully Explicit Dynamic Gaussian Splatting (FEDGS) method aimed at modeling dynamic scenes using a purely explicit approach. The authors propose a separation of static and dynamic Gaussians during training, employing interpolation techniques for position, rotation, and opacity. The method is evaluated on the Neural 3D Video (N3V) and Technicolor datasets, demonstrating competitive performance while significantly reducing training time and memory costs. Additionally, the authors report that their method achieves higher PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores compared to existing models like STG and 4DGS, while maintaining consistent performance across various scenes. They acknowledge the need for compression techniques to reduce storage size in future work and address concerns regarding baseline comparisons, noting difficulties in reproducing results for certain models due to missing scene backgrounds and discrepancies in reported performance metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The approach of explicitly modeling scenes at keyframes is innovative and may effectively address long-range dependencies.
2. The use of Gaussian Splatting combined with well-supported interpolation techniques, particularly two-Gaussian opacity modeling, is commendable.
3. The separation of static and dynamic Gaussians is a novel contribution that appears to enhance the methodology's effectiveness.
4. The method effectively distinguishes between static and dynamic points, allowing for accurate rendering even with occlusions.
5. The experimental results indicate that FEDGS outperforms several existing models in terms of PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS metrics across different scenes.
6. The approach to keyframe interval selection based on rendering quality is innovative and shows promise in optimizing storage and rendering performance.
7. The paper is well-structured and includes extensive ablation experiments validating the proposed designs.

Weaknesses:
1. The extracted points from the dynamic points extraction technique appear to correlate with color changes, raising concerns about the robustness of the contribution; additional experiments with significant object movements are needed.
2. The model struggles with sudden appearances of objects that lack neighboring Gaussians, which limits its adaptability in certain scenarios.
3. The method's performance in scenarios involving new objects is unclear, as results do not address this aspect.
4. Important baselines are missing from the comparisons, and the metrics reported are limited, with only PSNR included in Table 1.
5. The empirical selection of dynamic point ratios and keyframe intervals may restrict the generalizability of the proposed method.
6. The balance between rendering speed and storage cost remains a concern, particularly in complex scenes.
7. There are discrepancies in the reported performance of comparison methods, leading to confusion about the validity of claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's descriptions, particularly regarding the relationship between temporal opacity modeling and Gaussian densification, as well as the rationale behind keyframe selection. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with relevant baselines and providing detailed breakdowns of results per scene. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments that involve new object appearances and assess the method's performance under varying keyframe intervals. Furthermore, we recommend addressing the balance between rendering speed and storage cost in the revised version to strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, clarifying the discrepancies in performance metrics and addressing the challenges faced in reproducing results for certain models will enhance the credibility of the findings.
