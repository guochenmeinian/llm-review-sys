Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for object part segmentation of point clouds that is equivariant to SE(3) transformations. The authors propose a neural network that takes point clouds and segmentation as input, utilizing Banach fixed-point iterations for inference. The method is evaluated on articulated object part segmentation using the Shape2Motion dataset and multi-object scans from DynLab, demonstrating strong performance against baselines. The authors emphasize the necessity of segmentation for achieving per-part equivariance, which they address in a rigorous manner.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear structure and instructive illustrations that enhance comprehension.
- The theoretical framework of Banach iterations provides a novel perspective on iterative networks, supported by convergence guarantees under Lipschitz constraints.
- Experimental validation shows strong generalization capabilities across different scene configurations.

Weaknesses:
- A discussion on the (time-)complexity of the proposed method is lacking, particularly regarding the efficiency of iterative inference and comparisons with baseline model complexities.
- Details on hyperparameter choices, including the optimal number of iterations and the rationale for the chosen radius of the ball query and local neighborhood size, are insufficiently addressed.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to small-scale datasets, raising questions about scalability and performance on more complex scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the (time-)complexity of the proposed method, including a comparison of model complexities with baselines. Additionally, the authors should provide more details on hyperparameter choices, particularly the optimal number of iterations \( \textbf{k} \) and the motivations for the selected radius \( r \) and neighborhood size \( k \). It would also be beneficial to evaluate the method on larger datasets and discuss its performance in more complex scenarios. Finally, addressing the potential negative connotations of the title and clarifying the use of Lipschitz constraints in practice would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
