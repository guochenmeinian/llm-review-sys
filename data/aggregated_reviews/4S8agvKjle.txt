Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AgentBoard, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based agents on their multi-turn functional call abilities across nine environments within four diverse task categories. The evaluation metrics include success rate and a novel progress rate metric, which tracks intermediate performance. The benchmark aims to enhance the interpretability of LLM capabilities and is valuable for assessing AI agents' tool-use and long-term planning abilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The codebase is easy to use and well-maintained.
2. The benchmark includes a visualization tool for advanced analysis, such as progress gain relative to trajectory length.
3. The tasks are diverse and well-integrated into a unified framework, covering various scenarios including embodied AI and e-commerce.

Weaknesses:
1. The number of test cases is limited in some environments, leading to potentially misleading evaluation results.
2. The action space is restricted in most environments, limiting the benchmark's ability to test models in complex action scenarios.
3. The design of subgoals lacks clear guidelines, complicating the inclusion of new test cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors increase the number of test cases in scenarios like JC, TO, and TQ to enhance the benchmark's reliability.
2. We suggest that the authors provide clearer rules and intuitions behind subgoal design, detailing how tasks are sequenced and how subgoals are created.
3. We encourage the authors to explore the possibility of using LLMs to generate subgoals to alleviate the burden of manual annotation.
4. We recommend that the authors clarify the evaluation metrics for each environment to improve understanding of the evaluation process.
