### Key Points
This paper presents a hybrid continuous/discrete diffusion model for text generation, integrating Gaussian noise from continuous models like DiffuSeq and discrete word masking noise from models such as D3PM. The hybrid approach aims to leverage the speed of DPM-solver++ while aligning training and testing conditions by eliminating the need for "clamping" intermediate states. Results on QQP indicate approximately 2x speedups over discrete models while maintaining similar performance levels. The authors introduce a learned soft absorbing state to enhance convergence and adapt DPM-solver++ for efficient sampling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The hybrid diffusion model is well-motivated and explores the advantages of both continuous and discrete approaches.
- Experiments support claims regarding training speed and performance, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The abstract misrepresents comparisons to DiffuSeq, lacking clarity on the hybrid nature of the model.
- Insufficient detail on the experiments, including model parameters and dataset diversity, hampers the ability to assess fairness in comparisons.
- The paper's presentation is rushed, with inadequate explanations of key concepts and notation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by accurately discussing the hybrid nature of their model. Additionally, please clarify why DiffuSeq cannot utilize DPM-solver++ and provide more comprehensive details on the experimental setup, including model parameters and a broader range of evaluation datasets. We also suggest enhancing the presentation by introducing all acronyms and notation clearly, and providing a theoretical justification for the introduction of the soft absorbing state. Finally, consider including comparisons with standard seq2seq Transformer models to better contextualize the contributions of the proposed methods.
