Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the lower bounds of adaptive low-rank matrix sensing, demonstrating that when noise significantly exceeds the signal, any adaptive algorithm requiring fewer than $o(\log(n)/\log\log n)$ rounds must utilize at least $\Omega(n^2)$ linear measurements in total. The authors provide a measurement-vs-rounds trade-off for recovering low-rank matrices, establishing that any adaptive algorithm using $n^{2-\beta}$ linear measurements in each round must run for $o(\log n/ \log \log n)$ rounds to achieve a good reconstruction with high probability. The techniques also extend to other numerical linear algebra problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical results are robust and sound, filling a gap in sparse recovery literature.
- The presentation is clear, making complex ideas accessible.
- The problem addressed is fundamental, with contributions that are new and broadly applicable.

Weaknesses:
- The significance of the results is unclear due to insufficient comparison with prior works.
- The study's focus on a specific noise level raises questions about its general relevance.
- The assumption of $o(\log n/log \log n)$ rounds instead of just $o(\log n)$ rounds may limit the applicability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison between their results and prior works to clarify the significance of their contributions. Additionally, elaborating on the motivations behind the choice of noise and signal levels would strengthen the paper's relevance. It would also be beneficial to address whether the lower bound requires that all iterations take $k$ queries uniformly and to clarify the implications of the assumption regarding the orthonormal basis on the homogeneous noise level. Lastly, we suggest enhancing the presentation in Section 1 and 1.3 by outlining the 2-3 most significant contributions for better modularity.
