Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified post-processing framework for multi-objective learn-to-defer (L2D) problems, addressing constraints such as minimizing deferral loss. The authors propose a novel approach that generalizes the Neyman-Pearson lemma to derive Bayes optimal solutions and develop an algorithm for estimation. The framework allows simultaneous handling of multiple constraints, although the experimental validation primarily focuses on single-constraint scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel general framework for constrained L2D, enhancing the understanding of multi-objective problems.
2. The proposed post-processing algorithm has provable performance guarantees and can be extended to other constrained objectives beyond L2D.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear illustrations aiding comprehension.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental section lacks depth, primarily addressing single-constraint scenarios and not adequately reflecting the framework's capability to handle multiple constraints.
2. Inconsistent notations and typographical errors hinder clarity, making the paper difficult to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparative experiments that address various constraints, particularly those previously solved in the literature, such as expert intervention budget and long-tail classification. Additionally, we suggest a thorough proofreading of the manuscript to resolve notational inconsistencies and typographical errors, ensuring clarity and readability.
