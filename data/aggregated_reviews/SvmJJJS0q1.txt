Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods for identifying and quantifying both observed and unobserved confounding in causal inference, leveraging data from multiple contexts. The authors propose measures to detect and assess the relative strengths of confounding effects without relying on parametric assumptions. They introduce theoretical properties of these measures and provide an algorithm for their estimation, although empirical validation is limited and primarily conducted on synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive study of confounding, addressing detection and measurement from multiple perspectives, which appears to be novel.
- It is well-written and structured, making the concepts accessible.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains several typographical errors and unclear definitions, such as the misuse of the term "p-value" and the late introduction of key concepts like mechanism shifts.
- There is a lack of experimental evaluations, raising concerns about the practical relevance and computational feasibility of the proposed measures.
- Some relevant related works are missing, particularly those addressing hidden confounding in observational data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and correct typographical errors throughout the manuscript. Specifically, they should address the misuse of "p-value" and clarify the meaning of Assumption 3.2. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the empirical validation by including real-world examples and experiments involving observed confounding. It would also be beneficial to discuss the significance of the properties of their measures, particularly positivity, and how they relate to existing literature on confounding. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate relevant related works to strengthen the context of their contributions.
