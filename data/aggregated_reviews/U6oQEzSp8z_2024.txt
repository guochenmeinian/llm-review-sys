Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for zero-shot audio captioning using a well-trained visual LLM (Llava-v1.5). The authors propose a two-stage training framework with five sub-steps, utilizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and optimal transport (OT) as loss functions to align audio and visual representation spaces. The approach aims to leverage existing visual captioning systems to enhance audio captioning capabilities. Additionally, the authors are seeking feedback on their responses to previous reviewer concerns, emphasizing the urgency of receiving feedback due to an impending deadline.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The exploration of MMD and OT as novel loss functions for aligning different modalities is a significant contribution.
2. The paper addresses a timely issue in audio-visual LLM applications.
3. The authors demonstrate a proactive approach by reaching out for feedback, indicating their commitment to addressing reviewer concerns.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for zero-shot audio captioning is unclear, lacking concrete examples of practical scenarios where it is beneficial.
2. The method lacks theoretical grounding, particularly in analyzing the relationship between selected frames and audio content.
3. The experimental setup raises concerns, particularly regarding the definition of "zero-shot" and the fairness of comparisons with existing methods like ImageBind.
4. The reported performance metrics are low compared to state-of-the-art systems, and the results across datasets are inconsistent.
5. The message seeking feedback lacks specific details about the content of the work or the nature of the concerns previously raised, which may hinder the reviewers' ability to provide informed feedback.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for zero-shot audio captioning by providing specific scenarios where this approach is advantageous. Additionally, we suggest including a theoretical analysis to justify the effectiveness of MMD and OT in outperforming contrastive learning methods. The authors should clarify the experimental setup regarding "zero-shot" definitions and ensure fair comparisons with other methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the low performance metrics in relation to state-of-the-art systems and provide insights into the discrepancies observed across different datasets. Lastly, we recommend that the authors provide a brief summary of the key concerns they are addressing and clarify the specific aspects of their work that require feedback to facilitate a more focused and constructive response from the reviewers.
