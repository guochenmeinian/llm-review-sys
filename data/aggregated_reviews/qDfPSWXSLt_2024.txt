Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach that integrates anisotropic spherical Gaussian (ASG) appearance fields into 3D Gaussian splatting to enhance the modeling of view-dependent appearances, particularly for specular reflections. The authors propose separating diffuse and specular components in color representation and employing a feature decoupling MLP to generate colors from ASG features. The method demonstrates improved reconstruction quality and rendering performance across various datasets, surpassing existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of ASG appearance fields significantly enhances the representation of high-frequency information in 3D Gaussian splatting.
2. The coarse-to-fine training scheme effectively reduces floaters, supported by comprehensive ablation studies.
3. The method shows notable performance improvements in rendering quality and the ability to model specular highlights.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed comparison of training times with other methods, which is essential for a fair evaluation.
2. The related works section does not adequately highlight differences from similar studies, such as GaussianShader, and could benefit from a clearer comparison with prior works.
3. The mathematical notations are inconsistent, leading to potential confusion regarding operations like inner products and element-wise multiplications.
4. The claims regarding novelty and contributions may be overstated, as earlier works have also addressed specular highlights in Gaussian splatting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related works section by explicitly comparing their method with prior studies, such as SpecNeRF and GaussianShader, to clarify the advantages of their approach. Additionally, including the training time of their model in comparisons with other methods would provide a more equitable assessment. The authors should also refine the mathematical notations to ensure clarity and consistency, particularly distinguishing between different operations. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors tone down claims of novelty regarding specular highlights modeling, as previous works have explored similar concepts. Finally, enhancing the clarity of Section 3 by clearly delineating components of the base method from those of variants would strengthen the paper's presentation.
