### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative application of Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) for symbolic music representation, aiming to enhance both generation and classification tasks. The authors propose using BPE as a second tokenization step, demonstrating improved model performance and faster inference. They compare BPE with other tokenization methods and discuss its limitations, while also providing a website with code and audio samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The methodology is solid, and the paper is well-written, showcasing impressive results in generation tasks.  
- The proposed method reduces the average token count by 50%, which can lower computational costs and improve modeling accessibility.  
- The research idea is innovative and impactful, contributing valuable insights to the field of symbolic music.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the paper is limited as it makes minimal modifications to the BPE algorithm for music scenarios.  
- Some claims, particularly regarding classification performance, lack clarity and require further explanation.  
- The writing is sometimes unclear, which may affect the perceived trustworthiness of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of claims regarding classification performance and reformulate ambiguous statements, such as "We advise anyone using Transformer models with symbolic music to use BPE." Additionally, we suggest providing explicit reasons for the performance differences between BPE and the Octuple model in classification tasks. It would also be beneficial to evaluate models across different random seeds to assess result variability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to benchmark end-to-end speed improvements more rigorously and clarify the base vocabulary in Algorithm 1. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical issues and enhancing the overall writing clarity will strengthen the paper.
