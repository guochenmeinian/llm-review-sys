### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, the Cross-Space Adaptive Filter (CSF), designed to address the over-smoothing problem in graph convolutional networks (GCNs). The authors propose an interpretable high-pass filter based on node attribute correlations and combine it with a low-pass filter from graph topology to capture adaptive-frequency information. Theoretical foundations are provided through semi-supervised kernel ridge regression, and extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of CSF, particularly on disassortative graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow.
2. It explores a significant challenge in GCNs and proposes an effective solution.
3. The theoretical interpretation of the high-pass filter is convincing, and experimental results show promising improvements over baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for using a high-pass filter from the attribute space and a low-pass filter from the topology space is not adequately explained.
2. The paper lacks comparisons with important baselines such as AM-GCN and GNN-BC, which also address the over-smoothing issue.
3. Minor mistakes exist in equations, and the theoretical derivation process in Section 4.1 is missing.
4. The method's high time complexity of \(O(n^3)\) raises concerns for medium and large graphs.
5. The experimental setup may be biased, as the proposed method does not consistently outperform others with increasing layer depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the design choices for the high-pass and low-pass filters to clarify their motivations. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with relevant baselines such as AM-GCN and GNN-BC to strengthen their claims. Providing a detailed theoretical derivation process for the equations in Section 4.1, particularly from Eq 1 to Eq 2, would enhance clarity. Furthermore, addressing the high time complexity and potential biases in the experimental setup would be beneficial. Lastly, conducting an ablation study comparing the performance with a GCN that includes a skip connection would provide valuable insights.
