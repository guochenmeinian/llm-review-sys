Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of semi-structured networks for functional data, integrating an interpretable linear model with a nonlinear functional neural network. The authors validate the model's performance on biomechanics datasets, demonstrating its scalability and interpretability through an orthogonalization technique. The paper discusses the model's ability to explain linear interactions but lacks evidence for its interpretability in experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making the ideas accessible despite the abstract nature of the experiments.  
- Extensive experiments validate the method's applicability and generalizability, showcasing its performance against traditional models.  
- The approach retains linear model interpretability through projection, which is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim of interpretability is not substantiated by experimental results.  
- The performance improvements over existing methods are modest, with overlapping error distributions.  
- The paper lacks clarity in certain areas, such as the choice of basis functions and the computational cost of fitting parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of the interpretability of the proposed method in their experiments. Additionally, clarify the differences between time series modeling and functional networks under discretization. It would be beneficial to include error bars in Figure 5 and to provide a more intuitive explanation of the orthogonalization approach. We also suggest that the authors specify the basis functions for the encoder and decoder and justify their choices. Lastly, consider adding a practical example of functional data analysis early in the introduction to enhance reader comprehension.
