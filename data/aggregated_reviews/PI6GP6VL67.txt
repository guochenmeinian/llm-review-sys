### Key Points
This paper presents a quadratic programming approach with linear inequality constraints to efficiently compute the responses of electronic circuits with adaptive resistor elements, which are relevant for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing. The inclusion of diodes as inequality constraints enables the computation of nonlinear functions. The authors demonstrate the utility of quadratic programming in simulating these networks, implementing coding tools for a topology similar to deep neural networks, and achieving significant speedups over traditional circuit simulations like Spice. The paper articulates the advantages of this method and shows clear computational benefits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper significantly enhances the computational ability to simulate resistor-based learning circuits.  
- Ideas are clearly articulated and justified, demonstrating the natural fit of quadratic programming for this problem.  
- Simulated results indicate substantial computational advantages over previous methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The energy function described is actually a power dissipation function, which may mislead readers regarding energy input requirements.  
- Some aspects of the algorithm, such as node selection for convergence acceleration, lack clarity.  
- Questions remain about the necessity of input amplification and the expected differences in results between backpropagation and equilibrium propagation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify that Eq. 2 represents a power dissipation function rather than an energy function, emphasizing the constant energy input required for operation. Additionally, consider designing a "smart" method for selecting internal node potentials to enhance convergence. It would be beneficial to address whether input amplification is necessary in DRNs, particularly with small resistance values. Furthermore, please clarify the expected differences in results between backpropagation and equilibrium propagation, and ensure that wall clock time units are indicated in the table. Finally, providing ranges for conductance and voltage would aid in assessing the feasibility of the proposed architectures, and discussing the feasibility of using smooth nonlinear functions in the context of piecewise linear approximations would strengthen the paper.
