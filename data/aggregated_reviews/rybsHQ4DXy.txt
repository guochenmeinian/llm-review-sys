Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for learning environment-aware video representations from egocentric videos, utilizing a transformer-based approach to encode local environment states defined by objects and their distances relative to the camera-wearer. The authors claim their method outperforms state-of-the-art representations in predicting visited rooms and retrieving significant moments in response to natural language queries. The framework is trained on synthetic data but effectively handles real-world videos, achieving state-of-the-art results in the Ego4D NLQ challenge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work significantly advances the modeling of physical surroundings from a single egocentric perspective, with potential applications in AR, VR, and robot navigation.
- The approach is novel, as it learns representations for the camera-wearerâ€™s surroundings rather than just localizing the camera.
- The authors provide a solid theoretical background and rigorous experimentation across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of their method.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and includes comprehensive ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The method does not account for motion blur caused by sudden camera movements, limiting its applicability in real environments.
- The reliance on a semantic segmentation model may restrict the approach to only those objects classified by the model.
- The performance gain appears marginal on the Ego4D dataset, and the method struggles in scenes with clean backgrounds.
- Limitations of the approach are not explicitly stated in the paper, including its performance in dynamic scenes or outdoor environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how their models will handle motion blur and sudden camera movements. Specifically, they should clarify whether a motion model is implicitly learned or if it assumes fixed camera speed. Additionally, we suggest conducting evaluations to benchmark the real-time inference performance of their method for AR applications. The authors should also consider allowing other models access to the same amount of information as EgoEnv features in a more straightforward manner, such as providing uniformly sampled frames from the entire video. Finally, we encourage the authors to explicitly state the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the accuracy of the pose embedding learning network and its implications for the overall model performance.
