### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, Graph Attention Contrastive Learning (GACL), which integrates a full-attention transformer into graph contrastive learning to mitigate noise issues. The authors propose a 'noise matrix' to enhance the encoder's latent space and introduce the concept of 'effective mutual information' to support their methodology. The paper includes theoretical results and extensive experiments demonstrating the model's performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of full-attention transformers with graph neural networks represents a significant advancement in the field.
2. The establishment of effective mutual information provides theoretical depth to the work.
3. Extensive experiments validate the model's performance, showing its robustness and versatility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper suffers from unclear notations and explanations, particularly regarding the construction of the 'noise matrix' and 'effective event set'.
2. The theoretical sections are complex and may be difficult for readers without a deep background in the field.
3. The performance gains are modest, with some results not demonstrating consistent superiority over existing methods.
4. The paper lacks sufficient clarity and detail in the methodology, particularly concerning the computational demands and potential for overfitting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and provide explicit definitions for terms such as 'noise matrix' and 'effective event set', including pseudocode for construction. Additionally, we suggest simplifying the theoretical explanations to enhance accessibility. The authors should also conduct further experiments across a broader range of datasets to validate the effectiveness of different noise matrices and address potential overfitting concerns. Lastly, providing a detailed comparison with existing methods in terms of computational efficiency and performance would strengthen the paper.
