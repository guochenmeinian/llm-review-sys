Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel verification algorithm for decision tree policies in continuous-time systems, enabling the verification of reach-avoid properties. The approach utilizes Taylor models for sound and compact representation of reachable sets, efficiently propagating state approximations through decision nodes. The effectiveness is demonstrated through safety verification of decision trees imitating neural-network policies in low-dimensional nonlinear control systems, providing robust guarantees for system behaviors. The algorithm's theoretical analysis offers insights into its main components and scalability to unbounded time horizons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm is a significant advancement as the first formal verification method for reach-avoid properties in decision-tree controlled systems (DTCS) with continuous-time dynamics.
- It effectively mitigates the wrapping effect by utilizing axis-aligned predicates and interval-based approximations, enhancing precision in abstract states.
- The capability to generalize to unbounded time horizons through reachable states fixpoint calculations is noteworthy.
- The empirical evaluation demonstrates scalability compared to other techniques, and the writing quality is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the verification procedure for dynamical systems, which could be better treated as background information.
- The evaluation does not adequately showcase the limitations of the algorithm in practical scenarios, particularly regarding scalability with deep decision trees.
- Benchmarks used are simplistic; including scenarios where linear controllers fail would highlight the necessity of decision tree controllers.
- The novelty of the approach is not sufficiently articulated, and the generalization to unbounded time requires more precise explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by dedicating a section to the verification procedure for dynamical systems, allowing a stronger focus on decision tree policy analysis. Additionally, we suggest exploring the scalability of the reachability analysis with deep decision trees and conducting an ablation study on decision trees of various shapes. To strengthen the evaluation, including a benchmark scenario where a linear controller fails, such as the cartpole swinging up, would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on the novelty of their approach and the implications of using common axis-aligned predicates in real-world DTCS.
