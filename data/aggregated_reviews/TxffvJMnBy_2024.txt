Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of online convex optimization (OCO) with adversarial and time-varying constraints, aiming to bound both the regret and cumulative constraint violation (CCV). The authors propose a new algorithm achieving $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret and $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$ CCV for convex functions, along with a lower bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$ for both metrics. Additionally, they introduce an algorithm for strongly convex functions with $O(\log T)$ regret and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ CCV, and extend their findings to the online constraint satisfaction problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The proposed algorithm improves upon previous studies by achieving $O(\sqrt{T}\log T)$ bounds for convex functions, where prior work only reached $O(T^{3/4})$ CCV.
2) The established lower bound of $O(\sqrt{T})$ for regret and CCV confirms the optimality of the proposed algorithm for convex functions.
3) The algorithm for strongly convex functions simplifies the process by requiring only one projection per round, unlike previous methods that needed Conv-OPT per round.

Weaknesses:
1) The lower bound for convex functions is limited to cases where $d=T$ or $d>T$, raising concerns about its applicability for large $T \gg d$.
2) No lower bound is provided for strongly convex functions, leaving the potential for improvement of the $O(\log T)$ regret and $O(\sqrt{T\log T})$ CCV unclear.
3) The derivation of $O(\log T)$ regret and CCV under the *non-negative* regret assumption appears trivial, lacking analytical challenge.
4) The extension to the online constraint satisfaction problem relies on problem-dependent variables, which may lead to linear CCV bounds in $T$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of the lower bound for convex functions to accommodate cases where $T \gg d$. Additionally, we suggest providing a lower bound for strongly convex functions to clarify the potential for further improvements in regret and CCV. The authors should also elaborate on the analytical challenges faced in deriving the results for strongly convex functions to enhance the perceived novelty of their contributions. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the discussion on the CCV bounds established in Theorems 4 and 5, and to ensure that the experimental results include comparisons with existing baseline algorithms to validate the theoretical advantages of their proposed method.
