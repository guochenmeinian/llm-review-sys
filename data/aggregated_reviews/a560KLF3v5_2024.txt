Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel encrypted backdoor construction technique that integrates backdoors directly into transformer architectures. The authors develop two main designs: an NP-complete backdoor and an encrypted backdoor, both aimed at evading detection and triggering without specific knowledge. The work addresses current limitations in backdoor methodologies and provides empirical evidence of robustness against state-of-the-art elicitation methods. Additionally, the authors propose a hardness scale for backdoor elicitation techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of the proposed methods is high, with no comparable techniques identified by reviewers.
- The authors effectively discuss the state-of-the-art backdoors and articulate the limitations of their approach, including the NP-completeness of their work.
- Quantitative evaluations demonstrate the robustness of the methods against elicitation and provide clear visualizations of the backdoor insertion and encryption processes.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of experimental comparison with other backdoor attacks, which diminishes the soundness of the claims.
- The paper does not include error bars in experimental results, and minor writing flaws exist, such as coherence issues and unclear terminology.
- The threat model is considered unrealistic, as it assumes full control over the training process, which may not be applicable to most commercial models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparative analyses with existing backdoor methods to strengthen the claims of robustness. Additionally, incorporating error bars in the results would enhance the clarity of the findings. We suggest revising the writing for coherence, particularly in sections where terminology is inconsistent or unclear. Furthermore, addressing the generalizability of the findings to other model architectures and the potential for overfitting due to specific trigger patterns would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the practical applications of their encrypted backdoor attacks and the implications for model behavior and safety.
