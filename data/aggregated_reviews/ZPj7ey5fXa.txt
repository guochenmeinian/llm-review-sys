Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for addressing aliasing artifacts in grid-based Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) by utilizing a pyramid of grids at varying resolutions. The authors propose a strategy that involves training separate NeRFs at different resolutions and selecting the appropriate one based on the distance of the sample from the camera. The method, evaluated on various datasets, demonstrates significant improvements in rendering quality and speed compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The simplicity of the proposed method allows for easy implementation with minimal additional computational cost (one extra MLP evaluation per sample).
- The paper is well-presented, with clear motivation and effective ablation studies supporting the main ideas.
- Extensive experiments across multiple datasets showcase the method's advantages in rendering quality and training speed.

Weaknesses:
- Some details are ambiguous or missing, such as the number of levels, feature sizes per level, and MLP dimensions.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on the INGP representation, raising questions about the generality of the method across other representations like TensorRF.
- The technical contribution is perceived as limited since the method builds on existing concepts without introducing significant new challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing specific details regarding the number of levels, feature sizes, and MLP dimensions in the main text rather than relegating them to supplementary materials. Additionally, we suggest that the authors evaluate the proposed method on at least one more representation to substantiate its general applicability. Clarifying the storage requirements and the relationship between the proposed method and Gaussian concepts would also enhance understanding. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the optimization process and providing zoom-in results in the appendix would strengthen the paper.
