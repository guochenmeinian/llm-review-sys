Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FedGame, a game-theory based dynamic defense mechanism against backdoor attacks in Federated Learning (FL). FedGame adapts to attackers using a minimax game model, theoretically proving that a model trained with FedGame is close to one trained without attacks, indicating robustness against malicious disruptions. Extensive empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that FedGame effectively reduces attack success rates on MNIST and CIFAR10 compared to six existing defenses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The incorporation of game theory into federated learning is innovative and addresses a significant problem.
2. The theoretical analysis of the attack and defense as a two-player game is well-articulated.
3. The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and presents extensive experiments showing FedGame's effectiveness against strategic attackers.

Weaknesses:
1. The construction of an auxiliary global model to reverse engineer the trigger raises questions about the assumptions made regarding its comparison to the global model, and the implications if these assumptions do not hold.
2. The determination of the 'genuine score', $p_{i}^{t}$, lacks robust definitions and theoretical estimations, leading to concerns about potential inaccuracies affecting the defense framework.
3. The evaluation methodology could be improved by studying the genuine score in the evaluation section and comparing with state-of-the-art baselines like FLIP for a more comprehensive performance analysis.
4. The dynamic attack definition is unclear, and the proposed method may have limitations in addressing various factors affecting attack performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the assumptions regarding the auxiliary global model and provide an analysis within the minimax game framework. Additionally, we suggest providing robust definitions and theoretical estimations for the genuine score $p_{i}^{t}$ to enhance the defense framework's reliability. The evaluation methodology should be expanded to include a detailed study of the genuine score and comparisons with state-of-the-art baselines like FLIP. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of dynamic attacks and consider a broader range of factors that may influence attack performance.
