### Key Points
This paper presents MK-TOD, a framework designed to address the retrieval-generation misalignment in end-to-end task-oriented dialogue systems. The authors propose incorporating 'meta-knowledge' labels, which include retrieval order, confidence, and entity co-occurrence, to enhance the information flow from the retriever to the generator. The framework demonstrates improved performance across various datasets, although the correlation between retrieval and generation performance remains weak in certain settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper identifies a significant misalignment problem in retrieval-generation processes, which is of practical relevance.
- The proposed meta-knowledge approach effectively integrates the retriever and generator, showing consistent performance improvements across different models and datasets.
- The methodology is straightforward and well-supported by thorough analysis and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation metrics, particularly BLEU and Entity F1, may not fully capture the performance improvements, suggesting the need for additional metrics.
- The mapping of continuous retrieval order and confidence scores to discrete labels appears arbitrary and may overlook comparative relationships among retrieved entities.
- The experiments lack human evaluation, and there are missing results for certain configurations, raising concerns about the completeness of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including human assessments of the generated outputs to complement automatic metrics. Additionally, exploring the use of raw retrieval order and confidence scores instead of discrete labels could provide deeper insights into the effectiveness of the proposed method. The authors should also address the missing results in Table 1 for T5-Large and clarify the performance discrepancies observed in the experiments. Finally, we suggest validating the hyperparameters used in the framework to strengthen the claims regarding the method's effectiveness.
