Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Medformer, a transformer variant designed for medical time series classification, leveraging three key features: cross-channel patching for token embedding, multi-length patching for processing features at different scales, and multi-granularity self-attention for integrating information across granularities. The authors validate their model against ten baselines across five datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness, particularly in high-frequency waveform classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: Medformer uniquely combines cross-channel patching with varying patch lengths and a multi-granularity self-attention mechanism.
- Quality: Extensive testing on five datasets with ten competing baselines enhances reproducibility, supported by publicly available code and datasets, along with ablation studies.
- Clarity: The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations of equations and figures.
- Significance: The model's potential to improve diagnostic performance is crucial in healthcare, facilitating clinician adoption.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of explainability studies undermines usability and transparency in processing medical time series.
- The novelty is limited, as multi-granularity and multi-channel features have been previously explored in time series classification.
- The comparison of models is primarily limited to transformer-based architectures, with a need for inclusion of other architectures like TCN.
- The results of Medformer are not consistently superior across all metrics, and the efficiency of the models has not been benchmarked.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating explainability studies to enhance usability and transparency. Additionally, addressing the societal impact of their model, particularly regarding demographic biases, is crucial. The authors should also clarify the specific challenges of medical time series classification compared to general time series and include comparisons with recent state-of-the-art methods such as Time-LLM and ModernTCN. Finally, benchmarking the efficiency of the models and highlighting tied results in Table 3 would provide a clearer picture of performance.
