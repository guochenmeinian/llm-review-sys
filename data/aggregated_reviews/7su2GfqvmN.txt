### Key Points
This paper presents a novel implicit field representation for multi-person geometry modeling, enabling simultaneous estimation of occupancy, identity, and geometry. To address occlusion issues, a 3D scene representation module is introduced. The authors also develop a synthetic dataset for multi-view multi-human interactions, demonstrating the method's superiority through experimental results. Additionally, the authors reconstruct humans from multi-view images using sequences from the Hi4D dataset, acknowledging that while there are overlaps in subjects between the training and test sets, there is no overlap in the motion sequences of these subjects. They mention that due to time constraints, they could only include new synthetic samples in the provided Figure D, derived from novel configurations of characters and motions. The authors plan to extend their model to include additional benchmarks (Multihuman, CHI3D) in a future version of the manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively estimates contact fields using the variance of the predicted ID field, showcasing impressive quantitative and qualitative performance.
- The proposed dataset is valuable for future tasks involving close interaction reconstruction, and the overall quality of the paper is commendable.
- The authors follow established protocols for human reconstruction, ensuring methodological rigor.
- The inclusion of novel synthetic samples demonstrates innovation in character and motion configurations.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient details regarding the synthetic dataset creation, including data source, synthesis and annotation protocols, and scale.
- Key hyper-parameters, such as the contact deviation threshold \(\tau_c\) in L236, are not specified.
- The underlying idea closely resembles DeepMultiCap, lacking prior human knowledge, which may lead to artifacts in occluded body parts.
- The absence of a comparative analysis with relevant works raises concerns about the method's novelty and effectiveness.
- The overlap in subjects between training and test sets may raise concerns about the generalizability of the results.
- Limited experimentation due to time constraints may affect the comprehensiveness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the synthetic dataset by providing details on its creation, including the software used and statistical information. Additionally, clarify the unspecified hyper-parameters, particularly the contact deviation threshold \(\tau_c\). We suggest including a comparative analysis with existing methods like DeepMultiCap to substantiate the contributions of the proposed approach. Furthermore, we advise conducting an ablation study to support claims regarding the importance of the bifocal approach in the loss function. Addressing the questions related to the generalization ability of the method and the impact of varying input views on reconstruction performance would enhance the paper's clarity and depth. Lastly, we recommend improving the clarity of the distinction between training and test sets to address potential concerns regarding generalizability and providing more extensive experimental results in future versions to strengthen their claims and validate their approach against the mentioned benchmarks (Multihuman, CHI3D).
