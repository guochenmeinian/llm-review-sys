### Key Points
This paper presents the Federated Ensemble-Directed Offline Reinforcement Learning Algorithm (FEDORA), which addresses key challenges in federated offline reinforcement learning, such as ensemble heterogeneity and data heterogeneity. The authors propose a method that estimates client policy performance using local data and produces a weighted combination of policies to optimize the offline RL objective. The paper includes extensive evaluations on Mujoco and real-world datasets, demonstrating improved performance over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the proposed FEDORA algorithm is notable, as it is the first federated offline RL algorithm without assuming linearity.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivations and thorough experimental validation, including tests on a real-world robot.  
- The sharing of code enhances the paper's contribution to the field.  

Weaknesses:  
- Some technical details, such as the role of ensemble learning, require further explanation.  
- The novelty of the approach needs clarification, particularly in distinguishing it from existing studies.  
- The algorithm lacks theoretical guarantees, and the number of communication rounds for convergence is high.  
- Limitations and opportunities for future work should be explicitly discussed, and the algorithm pseudocode should be included in the main material.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of technical details, particularly regarding ensemble learning and its role in the algorithm. Additionally, the authors should clarify the novelty of their method and its differences from existing approaches. To strengthen the paper, we suggest including theoretical analysis and explicitly discussing the limitations of the algorithm. Furthermore, the authors should consider comparing their method with more baselines and ensure that the algorithm pseudocode is included in the main text. Lastly, we advise that figures be placed closer to their references in the text for better clarity.
