### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs), focusing on the impact of varying the number of input-output demonstrations (demos) for test queries. The authors reveal that ICL performance remains strong even with a single randomly chosen demo, challenging the belief that multiple demos are necessary. Key findings include that a single positive demo can outperform multi-demo setups, and the accuracy of multi-demo ICL is affected by the nature of the demos (positive or negative). The study also discusses the trade-offs of using more demonstrations, which can lead to longer prompts and increased costs with marginal improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It provides interesting findings that challenge conventional wisdom regarding the necessity of multiple demos in ICL.
- The analyses have practical implications for ICL design.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation is limited to a single model (code-davinci-002), raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.
- There is a lack of statistical significance testing, which is crucial given the small datasets used.
- The paper does not adequately address biases in the datasets or discuss related work in depth.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by evaluating multiple language models beyond code-davinci-002. Additionally, conducting statistical significance tests on the results would enhance the reliability of their claims. We suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of biases in the datasets and how these may affect their conclusions. Finally, expanding the related work section, particularly in the context of the role of demos in ICL, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
