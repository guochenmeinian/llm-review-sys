Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel time series augmentation method that applies Mixup to the amplitude and phase in the frequency domain, thereby avoiding the destructive extrapolation associated with linear Mixup. The authors provide a theoretical proof demonstrating that this method retains information while generating diverse samples. The empirical evaluation indicates that the proposed method outperforms existing contrastive learning baselines across eight datasets from three tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a theoretically grounded mixup method tailored for time series, addressing an important and under-explored problem in contrastive learning.
2. The theoretical analysis highlights the advantages of the proposed method over linear Mixup, and the extensive empirical evaluation supports its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity regarding the effects of using amplitude or phase alone for Mixup, necessitating consistent ablation experiments.
2. There are insufficient practical examples illustrating how Mixup may corrupt frequency domain information.
3. The title's reference to "Find Order in Chaos" is not adequately explained, nor is the method for "controlling the degree of chaos."
4. The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in the Method and Results sections, and the paper does not include comparisons with relevant time-series contrastive learning methods.
5. Dataset statistics are missing from the Results and Discussion section, and the choice of datasets lacks consistency with existing benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodology by providing detailed explanations of how to "Find Order in Chaos" and the process for "controlling the degree of chaos." Additionally, the authors should conduct ablation experiments to assess the impact of using amplitude or phase alone for Mixup. Including practical examples of how Mixup can corrupt frequency domain information would enhance the paper's depth. We also suggest that the authors improve the organization of the writing, particularly in the Method and Results sections, and ensure that comparisons with relevant time-series contrastive learning methods are included. Finally, adding dataset statistics in a table format would aid in understanding the results.
