### Key Points
This paper titled "Memory-Based Invariance Learning for Out-of-Domain Text Classification" presents a novel memory-based invariant representation learning method that utilizes a memory network to construct domain-invariant representations. The authors evaluate their approach on sentiment analysis and natural language inference tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results on six datasets. The paper also compares the proposed method with traditional learning strategies and analyzes the effects of memory size and optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of a memory-based approach for domain-invariant representation learning is novel and significantly enhances out-of-domain text classification accuracy.  
- The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, supported by comprehensive analyses and ablation studies.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and justification for the methodology.

Weaknesses:  
- The underlying base encoder used in experiments is unspecified, raising concerns about the sensitivity of different base models to out-of-domain methods.  
- The paper lacks sufficient rationale for design choices, such as the use of key-value memory and the adoption of meta-learning.  
- Clarity and organization issues exist, particularly in Section 3, which contains typos and confusing notation.  
- There is a potential missing baseline that should be addressed to strengthen the paper's claims.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, particularly in Section 3, by addressing typos and confusing notation. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer rationale for their design choices, such as the use of key-value memory and the meta-learning approach. It would be beneficial to discuss the challenges posed by the datasets used for out-of-domain classification to better highlight the contributions of the proposed framework. Finally, we suggest including a comparison with the missing baseline identified in the reviews to enhance the robustness of the findings.
