### Key Points
This paper presents a GAN-based approach to align word embedding spaces for the Bilingual Lexical Induction (BLI) task. The authors propose a graphical convolutional network (GCN) to learn the topology of the embedding space in a given language and utilize a GAN to learn cross-space correlations. They demonstrate the performance of their method across a diverse set of datasets, including experiments on 16 language pairs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and presents a reasonable motivation supported by experiments.
2. The method exploits the manifold structure in the embedding space, contributing to the understanding of bilingual induction.
3. Extensive experiments analyze various aspects of the pipeline, showcasing the importance of individual components.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental results are somewhat weak, lacking a study on the quality of the seed lexicon and not including downstream tasks to demonstrate broader applicability.
2. The GCN proposed has no learnable parameters, raising questions about its classification as a GCN and the propagation of structural information.
3. The paper does not adequately ground its improvements, lacking a section on error analysis or comparisons with existing state-of-the-art models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the GCN's role and its learning capabilities, as its current description may mislead readers. Additionally, including experiments on word similarity and sentence translation tasks, as well as incorporating morphologically rich and low-resource languages, would enhance the robustness of the framework. Finally, we suggest adding a section on error analysis or comparisons with existing models to better contextualize the reported improvements.
