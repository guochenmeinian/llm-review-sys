### Key Points
This paper presents a method for constructing time-uniform and value-uniform bounds on the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the averaged historical distribution of a real-valued random process. The authors propose a design principle, AVAST (always valid and sometimes trivial), ensuring that their bounds maintain coverage, albeit with potentially slow convergence. Building on the work of Howard and Ramdas (2022), the authors extend these results to non-stationary processes and facilitate counterfactual estimation. They also address the construction of confidence bands for dependent sequences of random variables, demonstrating the method's applicability in practical scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a novel algorithm for constructing time and value uniform bounds on the CDF in non-stationary contexts, with clear theoretical guarantees and correct proofs.
2. The extension to importance-weighted random variables is significant for online decision-making applications.
3. Simulations illustrate the algorithm's adaptive performance and consistency with theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
1. The instance-adaptivity of Theorem 3.3 is unclear, particularly regarding whether the bound $\xi_t$ is constant across all $t$. Clarification is needed on how the bound remains time-uniform without dependence on previous $\xi_t$ values.
2. The introduction lacks clarity on the problem being addressed, and the explanation of contributions could be better integrated with earlier sections.
3. The writing is often difficult to follow, with insufficient elaboration on key concepts such as confidence sequences and technical difficulties encountered in proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by providing a more detailed explanation of the problem being solved and integrating relevant background information earlier in the manuscript. Additionally, we suggest that the authors elaborate on the confidence sequences and their roles in Algorithms 1 and 2 to enhance understanding. The writing should be revised for greater readability, particularly in sections that are currently notation-heavy. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the specific technical difficulties encountered in their proofs to provide a clearer picture of their contributions.
