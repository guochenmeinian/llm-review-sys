### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm to accelerate Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) by introducing a limited number \( k \) of edges into peer-to-peer (P2P) graphs. The authors establish a connection between the convergence rate and the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix, proving that finding the optimal edge set is NP-complete. They propose an efficient \( O(krn^2) \) algorithm to compute the best edge set, which enhances the convergence rate. Experimental results across various datasets validate the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The theoretical analysis is solid and well-articulated.
2. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
3. The proposed algorithm significantly reduces operation time complexity and demonstrates effectiveness through thorough experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited, as similar works addressing topology in decentralized machine learning exist.
2. Determining the number of edges \( k \) is challenging in practical settings.
3. The evaluation relies heavily on a single dataset (CIFAR-10), which may limit the generalizability of results.
4. The motivation for adding edges in real-world scenarios is not adequately justified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty by addressing existing works more comprehensively. Additionally, consider providing a clearer rationale for the feasibility of adding edges in real-world networks. It would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on a broader range of datasets, particularly those that reflect non-IID distributions. We also suggest including theoretical analysis on the approximation rate of the algorithms SSEO and SSEO+, and clarifying any potentially misleading notations. Finally, providing more straightforward illustrations in case studies would enhance clarity.
