### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the safety issues of generative AI, specifically Text-to-Image models, across various socio-cultural groups, focusing on gender, ethnicity, and age. The authors highlight the problem of aggregated and biased annotated data that can adversely affect model development and evaluation frameworks. The study is supported by a thorough statistical analysis involving 630 raters and 1000 generated images, providing a robust foundation for the findings. The challenge and goal of the project are clearly articulated, with key findings and methodology well-defined.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study's large-scale statistical experiment offers a solid basis for analysis.  
- In-depth discussion of survey results provides nuanced insights into safety perceptions across demographic groups.  
- Clear articulation of the project's challenge and goals, with well-defined methodology.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited background information on the image dataset used in the study.  
- Inadequate explanation of metrics employed in the analysis.  
- Simplistic experimental design that lacks depth in capturing nuanced perceptions.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background information by detailing the image dataset, including the topics or themes represented, the overall quality assessment, and the diversity of content and style. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the survey design by implementing more fine-grained questions to capture subtle differences in perception across demographic groups and explaining the rationale behind the chosen survey questions in relation to specific safety concerns in generative AI. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to reconsider the aggregation of annotations per pair into a single rating, as this may obscure the inherent diversity of perspectives highlighted in the study.
