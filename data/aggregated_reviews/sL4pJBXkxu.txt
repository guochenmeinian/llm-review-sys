Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ELDEN, a framework for intrinsic exploration rewards in reinforcement learning that focuses on local dependencies between entities. ELDEN utilizes partial derivatives of learned dynamics to model these dependencies, with the variance across an ensemble of models serving as an intrinsic reward to encourage exploration of states where relationships are poorly understood. The authors propose a Causal Graphical Model to represent transitions, emphasizing local causal graphs to enhance efficiency and generalization in reinforcement learning tasks. Experiments are conducted across various domains, including robotic tasks, to validate the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ideas presented are novel, particularly the intrinsic reward based on local dependencies, which aids exploration in sparse-reward environments.
- The related work section is well-written, providing clear context for the proposed approach.
- The method is clearly explained and easy to understand, with promising results in the evaluated domains.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is a major weakness, as the tasks utilize high-level primitives, limiting the complexity and applicability of the results.
- ELDEN's performance is not strong enough in certain tasks, with some not achieving the normalized score of 1.0.
- The paper relies heavily on appendices for important details, which could hinder understanding and evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including more complex, low-level control tasks to better demonstrate ELDEN's capabilities. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the significance of ELDEN in comparison to large language models for semantic reasoning, especially in environments with fine-grained control. It would also be beneficial to include more baseline comparisons, such as RND, to strengthen the evaluation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to minimize reliance on appendices for critical information, ensuring that essential details are accessible within the main text.
