### Key Points
This paper presents a vision-language model utilizing sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques to reduce costs in training and deployment. The authors propose a comprehensive scaling strategy for MoE in multimodal models, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments across various vision-language tasks. The findings reveal valuable insights into scaling methodologies and the behavior of VL-MoE models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors achieve state-of-the-art performance on multiple vision-language benchmarks.
- A thorough analysis of scaling strategies is conducted, providing interesting insights.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, with strong experimental results supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the technical contributions is limited, as many designs are based on prior works, leading to concerns about the incremental nature of the research.
- The experiments do not encompass a broader range of VL tasks, such as image captioning, which could better showcase the model's potential.
- Some comparisons with existing models may be inappropriate, and the limitations of the proposed method are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by clearly differentiating their approach from LIMoE and addressing the potential limitations of VL-MoE, particularly regarding memory requirements and training time. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on more VL tasks, including image captioning, and providing a wall-clock time versus validation performance figure in the appendix to clarify the model's efficiency. Lastly, the authors should ensure that the parameter settings are clearly specified to enhance reproducibility.
