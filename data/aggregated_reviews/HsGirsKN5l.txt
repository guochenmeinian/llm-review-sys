### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address the length bias problem in document-level neural machine translation (DNMT), which affects translation quality for sentences significantly shorter or longer than those seen during training. The authors propose three strategies: 1) dynamic length sampling during training, 2) length-aware attention to focus on relevant target words, and 3) sliding window decoding for handling longer test sentences. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in BLEU and chrF scores across three widely-used datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is relevant, and the proposed methods are intuitively motivated and simple to implement.  
- The paper is clearly written, and the experimental results indicate effective mitigation of the length bias problem, achieving state-of-the-art scores.  

Weaknesses:  
- The sliding window decoding strategy appears to underperform, lacking a clear declaration of window size and further exploration of its limitations.  
- There is insufficient statistical analysis of sentence length variation after sampling, and comparisons with other recent methods are lacking.  
- The authors do not provide data on the distribution of series lengths in the dataset, which could affect the proposed method's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the sliding decoding strategy, including a clear declaration of window size and an exploration of its performance issues. Additionally, we suggest providing statistical analysis on the variation of sentence lengths after sampling and including comparisons with other recent methods that address length generalization. It would also be beneficial to include data on the distribution of series lengths in the dataset to support claims about the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
