Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel non-parametric algorithm for stochastic bandits, utilizing a sub-sampling scheme to construct exact confidence intervals for a UCB algorithm called MARS. The authors provide theoretical guarantees of logarithmic regret under continuous and symmetric distribution assumptions, while avoiding direct use of the function $\phi$. The empirical results validate the proposed method. Additionally, the paper introduces a data-dependent upper confidence bound that improves upon classical UCB methods by offering tighter error estimates.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of the algorithm and theoretical results.
- It contributes interesting insights to the literature on non-parametric algorithms and demonstrates empirical validation of the method.
- The approach to compute UCBs without needing scale parameters is practically significant and supported by rigorous theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The literature review on non-parametric algorithms lacks precision, and the contribution of MARS compared to existing approaches is inadequately explained.
- The memory and computation time of MARS are not well discussed, with concerns that they may be worse than existing methods.
- The empirical evaluation is limited, lacking comparisons with more algorithms and real-world examples, which diminishes the paper's impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by clearly distinguishing MARS from other non-parametric algorithms, specifying their assumptions, costs, and performance. Additionally, the authors should explicitly discuss the memory and computation costs associated with MARS, providing comparisons with benchmarks. We suggest enhancing the empirical evaluation by including more algorithms like GIRO and PHE, and exploring real-world examples to better demonstrate the practical improvements offered by the new data-dependent estimator. Furthermore, clarifying the concept of "typical values" and its role in the theoretical framework would strengthen the paper.
