Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel training framework called GeoTMI, which utilizes a denoising process to predict quantum chemical properties from easily obtainable (corrupted) geometries rather than expensive DFT-optimized geometries. The authors propose that the corrupted geometry can be denoised to yield accurate predictions during training, while only the corrupted geometry is used during inference. The experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate that this approach outperforms methods relying solely on correct geometries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of the denoising autoencoder with property prediction using a mutual information paradigm among $\tilde Z, Z, Y$ provides a structured approach to property prediction.
- The method converges to standard objectives in GNN literature, making it easy to integrate into existing frameworks and model agnostic.
- Comprehensive experiments across three datasets show significant improvements over methods that only use correct geometries.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between $X$ and $\tilde X$ is unclear; the assumption that $\tilde X$ is a corrupted version of $X$ raises questions about the nature of this corruption and its impact on information loss.
- The model's structure appears to converge to a denoising autoencoder followed by a property predictor, which may oversimplify the task of predicting $Y$ from $\tilde X$.
- The selection criteria for $\tilde X$ and $Y$ are dataset-specific, raising concerns about generalizability to other tasks.
- Claims regarding rotation and translation equivariance lack sufficient elaboration, particularly how updating the position vector ensures these properties.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between $X$ and $\tilde X$, specifically addressing whether the corruption is an information-destroying process. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the distinctions made in the model's structure and provide a more detailed explanation of how the selection of $\tilde X$ can generalize across different datasets. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the claims regarding equivariance and how the coordinate system is managed during updates. Finally, including direct comparisons with other denoising-based methods would strengthen the experimental validation of GeoTMI's effectiveness.
