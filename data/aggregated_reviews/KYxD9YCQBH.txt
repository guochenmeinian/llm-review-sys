Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ReContrast, an approach for domain-specific anomaly detection and segmentation that aims to address the transfer limitations of existing methods by optimizing the entire network to align with the target domain. The authors introduce a new optimization objective, global cosine distance, to enhance training stability, utilize a stop-gradient operation to prevent pattern collapse, and integrate contrastive learning without negative samples. The effectiveness of ReContrast is demonstrated through experiments on diverse datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors effectively analyze the limitations of the reverse distillation approach, leading to an improved anomaly detection method.
2. The paper is well-written, providing a clear description of the ReContrast framework and its principles.
3. Experimental evaluations across various datasets demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on selectively changing the batch normalization mode based on dataset performance raises concerns about the method's reliability and generalizability. A systematic approach to utilizing BN layers without a separate validation set is recommended to ensure unbiased training.
2. The focus on structural anomalies limits the method's applicability, as it performs poorly on logical anomalies. This limitation should be explicitly stated in the main paper.
3. The paper lacks clarity in distinguishing its contributions from existing methods, particularly regarding the novelty of the stop-gradient operation and the absence of comparisons with baseline methods like UniAD.
4. The organization of the paper is confusing, with subsections lacking coherence and clear connections between existing and proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly differentiating them from existing methods and including comparisons with UniAD in their experimental results. Additionally, a more coherent organization of the paper is necessary to enhance readability. The authors should also provide a systematic approach to batch normalization that does not rely on separate validation sets to avoid biases. Furthermore, it is essential to address the limitations regarding the detection of logical anomalies and clarify the scope of the method's applicability. Finally, we suggest including experimental settings that demonstrate the performance of ReContrast in a multi-class anomaly detection scenario to reflect real-world applications.
