Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model for audio-visual video parsing using weak supervision, leveraging the language modality to enhance performance over previous baselines. The authors propose a dynamic re-weighting method to assign soft labels to video segments, demonstrating significant improvements through extensive comparisons and ablation studies. The results indicate that fine-grained segment-level labels, derived from the CLIP model, outperform coarse video-level labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed system outperforms previous baselines.
- Comprehensive comparisons with multiple baselines.
- Extensive ablation studies highlight the importance of each component.
- Clear presentation with qualitative results.

Weaknesses:
- Several typographical and consistency issues, such as "andvisual" and discrepancies in Figure 1.
- Lack of clarity regarding the training of ResNet and VGGish models.
- Ambiguities in mathematical equations, particularly regarding the shapes and roles of variables in Equation 1.
- Insufficient details on segment feature extraction and overlap region selection.
- The proposed method primarily addresses visual domain label denoising, limiting overall audio-visual parsing accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the mathematical equations, particularly in Equation 1, by explicitly defining the shapes of variables and their roles. Additionally, please clarify how features per segment are obtained from CLIP and provide details on the selection criteria for overlap regions. We also suggest that the authors explore the relationship between audio and visual modalities more thoroughly and consider including recent baselines in their comparisons to strengthen the evaluation. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding audio modality denoising could enhance the paper's contribution.
