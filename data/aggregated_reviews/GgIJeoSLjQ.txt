Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel heatmap representation for 2D human pose estimation, addressing limitations of prior quantized heatmap approaches that assign confidence scores to pixels. The authors propose an implicit neural representation, NerPE, which outputs confidence scores for keypoints based on continuous 2D coordinates. The main contributions include the introduction of NerPE and a progressive coordinate decoding method for recovering 2D coordinates from continuous heatmaps. The authors also effectively utilize implicit neural representations (INR) to achieve strong performance in low-resolution experiments, providing enhancements that include experiments on GFLOPs, inference latency in FPS, and various input and cell resolutions. The experiments demonstrate improvements over state-of-the-art methods across several benchmarks, and the authors express a willingness to consider a higher rating if specific improvements are made.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative, as it is the first to utilize implicit representations for heatmaps.
- The writing quality is high, with a clear identification of prior weaknesses and a well-justified proposed solution.
- The method shows consistent performance improvements over existing techniques, supported by a thorough ablation study.
- The authors address most concerns raised by reviewers, particularly regarding experimental details and performance metrics.
- The straightforward concept of INR is well-executed, especially in low-resolution contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The Related Work section lacks sufficient discussion of existing methods addressing quantization errors, such as soft-argmax and offset regression techniques.
- The utility of a continuous heatmap representation is questionable, given that ground truth is in pixel coordinates.
- Important reproducibility details are missing, including training datasets, epochs, and computational costs.
- The decoding process may introduce significant computational costs, and a detailed efficiency comparison with existing methods is necessary.
- The absence of comparisons with the "offset" method and limited visualizations of non-standard Gaussian heatmaps detracts from the paper's completeness.
- Sparse convolution is not considered, which could enhance the approach, especially in 3D reconstruction and generation contexts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the Related Work section by discussing alternative techniques like soft-argmax and offset regression, which also address quantization errors. Additionally, clarify the practical benefits of a continuous representation given the pixel-based ground truth. To enhance reproducibility, provide detailed information on training datasets, epochs, and computational costs. We also recommend adding comparison and combination experiments with the "offset" method as suggested in other reviews, and including more visualizations of non-standard Gaussian heatmaps, particularly the differences between rendered and baseline heatmaps for medium and hard cases. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify why sparse convolution was not considered, as it has been explored in 3D reconstruction and generation. Finally, include a comprehensive efficiency comparison of the proposed method against existing approaches, detailing GFLOPs, inference time, and GPU memory consumption.
