Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called the Concept-Incremental text-to-image Diffusion Model (CIDM) to tackle the Concept-Incremental Flexible Customization (CIFC) problem in text-to-image generation. The authors identify catastrophic forgetting and concept neglect as key challenges in CIFC and propose innovative solutions, including a concept consolidation loss, elastic weight aggregation, and a context-controllable synthesis strategy. The effectiveness of CIDM is demonstrated through extensive experiments across various customization tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant practical problem in custom text-to-image generation, focusing on the continual learning of new concepts without forgetting old ones.
2. The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of each proposed component, enhancing the technical depth of the work.
3. The model-agnostic nature of the approach, tested on different backbone architectures (SD-1.5 and SDXL), showcases its broad applicability.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of symbol definitions makes them difficult to follow.
2. The introduction of several new hyperparameters raises questions about the model's sensitivity to these parameters.
3. The paper lacks a discussion on the performance of the model across different application domains and with varied types of personalized concepts.
4. The baseline choices for continual learning, such as EWC and LWF, are outdated and should be updated to more recent algorithms.
5. There is insufficient detail on the implementation of critical tasks like custom image editing and style transfer, which affects clarity and replicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of symbol definitions to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the model's sensitivity to the introduced hyperparameters. It would be beneficial to include a comparison of the proposed method with contemporary continual learning algorithms to strengthen the baseline choices. We also suggest incorporating a comprehensive description of custom image editing and style transfer processes, including specific parameters and settings used. Lastly, including a table comparing training, parameter, and memory costs against other methods would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approach.
