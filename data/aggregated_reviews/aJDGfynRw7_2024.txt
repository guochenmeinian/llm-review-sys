### Key Points
This paper presents a novel post-processing approach called IWBVT aimed at enhancing the training of machine learning models using crowdsourced datasets. The method involves instance weighting based on the entropy of the complementary label distribution and employs a bias-variance trade-off to minimize generalization error. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IWBVT significantly improves model quality compared to existing state-of-the-art label integration and noise correction algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper proposes a technically sound post-processing approach that significantly enhances the quality of models trained with crowdsourced datasets, supported by clear and rigorous proofs.
2. The writing is well-organized and logical, making the problem and argumentation process easy to follow, with effective use of figures and tables.
3. The experiments are well-designed, utilizing appropriate datasets and evaluation metrics to validate the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
1. More detailed explanations of experimental results are needed, particularly regarding the differing effectiveness of instance weighting and bias-variance trade-off across datasets.
2. The focus on robustness across various algorithms and datasets limits validation; performance on a wider range of models should be observed.
3. The paper should discuss more limitations of IWBVT, including its robustness in extremely noisy labeling, computational complexity with large datasets, and challenges in real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental results by providing insights into why instance weighting is more effective on the Leaves dataset while the bias-variance trade-off excels on the Income dataset. Additionally, demonstrating IWBVT's performance across a broader array of machine learning models would further validate its effectiveness. We also suggest discussing the limitations of IWBVT in contexts involving extremely noisy labeling or large datasets to enhance its applicability. Finally, clarifying the significance testing methodology and the rationale behind the chosen alpha value would strengthen the experimental section.
