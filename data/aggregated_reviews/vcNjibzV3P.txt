### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the completeness of neural networks for distinguishing non-isomorphic point clouds, specifically through adaptations of the k-WL graph isomorphism test. The authors propose the k-EWL test, demonstrating that it can effectively separate point clouds using message passing networks (GNNs) and provide proofs of completeness for 3D point clouds. Additionally, the paper explores separation and universality in rotation-invariant architectures, arguing that these concepts are crucial for classification tasks involving point clouds. The authors emphasize that separation ensures the ability to distinguish non-equivalent point clouds without necessitating strict Euclidean isomorphism on categorical labels, retaining all information from the raw input for further processing. The work includes theoretical results that suggest the potential applicability of these findings to a broader range of models and addresses the robustness of their model to perturbations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a rigorous mathematical formulation and proof of their claims, establishing a well-defined problem.
2. The organization of the paper is clear, transitioning from problem discussion to theoretical analysis and experimental validation.
3. The theoretical results are generalizable and contribute significantly to the understanding of GNNs applied to point clouds.
4. The paper contributes significantly to the understanding of separation and universality in neural network architectures.
5. It provides a novel approach to achieving full separation and universality using low-order representations.
6. The authors effectively demonstrate the robustness of their model to noise through empirical experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to small-scale synthetic datasets, lacking validation on larger, practical datasets which are more representative of real-world scenarios.
2. The potential benefits of the model's separation capability in practical tasks, such as classification or regression, are not explored.
3. The assumption of complete graphs significantly limits the model's applicability, and the scaling complexity of $O(n^4)$ poses practical challenges.
4. The necessity of enforcing strict Euclidean isomorphism on categorical labels remains inadequately addressed.
5. Concerns about the practical application of the proposed model, particularly regarding robustness versus completeness, are not fully resolved.
6. The complexity of the proposed method may hinder its practical application compared to existing models like TFN.
7. The manuscript's writing requires improvement, particularly in citation formatting and overall clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by testing their model on larger, real-world datasets, particularly in chemistry or molecular contexts, to validate the practical applicability of their theoretical claims. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the implications of graph isomorphism tests on downstream tasks, such as classification and regression, to demonstrate the model's utility. It would also be beneficial to address the limitations imposed by the complete graph assumption and consider relaxing this condition. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve their discussion on the necessity of strict Euclidean isomorphism by addressing its practical implications more thoroughly, clarifying how their model handles numerical errors and noise during data curation. Providing more empirical evidence demonstrating the robustness of their model in real-world scenarios, particularly in comparison to TFN, would enhance the paper. Lastly, a clearer explanation of the computational complexity and its practical ramifications would improve the paper's applicability.
