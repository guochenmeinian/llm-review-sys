### Key Points
This paper presents a novel graph convolution approach for Bilingual Lexicon Induction (BLI), addressing the challenge of aligning semantically related terms across languages. The authors propose a method called GRI (Graph-based Relative Isomorphism), which utilizes attentive graph convolutions to enhance the alignment of bilingual dictionaries. The results indicate that GRI outperforms existing methods, achieving an average precision at rank 1 (P@1) of 63.6%, even in domain mismatch scenarios. The work extends Marchisio et al. (2022) by introducing a new graph isomorphism loss function that improves the mapping of static word embedding spaces to a shared cross-lingual space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The GRI method significantly improves bilingual dictionary creation and machine translation.
- Comprehensive experiments, including multiple trials and ablation studies, demonstrate strong results.
- The emphasis on semantically similar words and the use of graph convolutions is innovative.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology and contributions lack clarity, particularly in comparing GRI against traditional BLI methods.
- The explanation of the method is obscured by unclear math notation and jargon, making it difficult to understand.
- Some results may not be easily reproducible due to underspecified parameters and the availability of training/evaluation data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by simplifying the mathematical notation and providing clear definitions for terms like $L_{ISO}$. Additionally, we suggest explaining the rationale behind using Graph Convolutional Networks over other graph neural network models. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should specify parameter settings and ensure that training/evaluation data are more accessible. Furthermore, addressing the detailed comments made by reviewers regarding the presentation and citation issues will benefit future readers.
