### Key Points
This paper presents a KL-then-steer (KTS) method that aims to retain model performance while enhancing safety. The authors propose that this method offers a superior tradeoff compared to previous approaches. Additionally, the paper discusses the significance of controlling unintended behaviors of language models post-deployment, emphasizing the importance of this intervention in real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The KTS technique is well-structured and supported by a robust experimental framework that focuses on quantifiable evidence.  
2. The clarity of the paper is enhanced by appropriate visual aids, making complex concepts more accessible.  
3. The originality of the approach, particularly the combination of steering vectors with KL-divergence minimization, is noteworthy and innovative.  
4. The method is practical and can be adapted to real-world use cases with minimal overhead.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The mathematical implications of the KTS technique may be challenging for readers lacking subject matter expertise.  
2. The integration of prompt classification could introduce additional computational complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the mathematical concepts related to the KL-then-steer technique to accommodate a broader audience. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the potential computational complexity introduced by prompt classification, possibly by providing clearer explanations or alternative methods to mitigate this issue. Furthermore, extending the approach to encompass more model capability and safety measurements would enhance its applicability.
