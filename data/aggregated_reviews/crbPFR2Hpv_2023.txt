### Key Points
This paper presents the AVOIDDS dataset, a public and labeled dataset for aircraft vision-based intruder detection and avoidance. It consists of 72,000 images generated using the X-Plane 11 flight simulator, featuring intruder aircraft in various positions, lighting, weather conditions, and geographic locations. The dataset is well-documented and includes an interface for evaluating pre-trained models, with a benchmark based on YOLOv8. The authors propose a closed-loop simulator for assessing trained detection models in collision avoidance scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset includes a significant variety of distribution shifts due to environmental changes, enhancing its applicability in aviation research.
- The automatic generation of bounding box labels from the simulator eliminates the need for manual labeling.
- The evaluation of pre-trained models encompasses both classical metrics and higher-level tasks, crucial for safety-critical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The quality of images generated by the simulator compared to real-world images is not adequately addressed.
- The use of a simple pairwise encounter model limits the realism of the simulations, and the authors do not sufficiently discuss potential improvements.
- The related work section lacks depth, missing references to relevant methods in tiny object detection and UAV-to-UAV tracking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors provide more information regarding the quality of images generated by the X-Plane 11 flight simulator, particularly in comparison to real images captured by aircraft. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations of the simple pairwise encounter model and explore how it can be enhanced with more complex models in future work. Expanding the related work section to include relevant literature on tiny object detection and UAV-to-UAV methods would strengthen the manuscript. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider developing a video dataset, as it would be more practical for real-time applications in the field.
