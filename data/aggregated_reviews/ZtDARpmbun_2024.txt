Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address catastrophic forgetting in non-exemplar class-incremental learning (NECIL) through Prospective Representation Learning (PRL). The authors propose a strategy that involves squeezing the embedding distribution of current classes to reserve space for future classes, thereby minimizing interference when introducing new classes. The method employs Preemptive Embedding Squeezing (PES) and a Prototype-Guided Representation Update (PGRU) to maintain distinct features for new classes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed PRL scheme effectively addresses the balance between old and new classes in NECIL tasks.
2. The method is easy to understand and follow, with clear illustrations and extensive experimental validation.
3. The PES constrains the current class space logically to prepare for future classes.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the method is questionable, as previous works have explored similar concepts, and the paper lacks a thorough comparison with these methods.
2. There is insufficient evaluation on larger datasets like Imagenet1000, and the paper does not discuss the standard deviation of results across different runs.
3. The analysis of hyperparameters in the proposed method is limited, and there are grammatical errors present in the text.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the advantages of PRL over other forward-compatible methods and include a comparison with existing literature. Additionally, we suggest providing evaluation results on larger datasets to strengthen the findings. It would be beneficial to include a section addressing the standard deviation of results and to conduct a sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameters in equation 14. Lastly, we advise correcting grammatical errors and clarifying the meaning of terms such as IIC in equation 9.
