Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Stormer, a deep learning weather prediction model based on a vision transformer architecture. Stormer incorporates a "weather-specific embedding" to process variables individually and employs a randomized dynamics forecast technique to generate multiple weather scenarios for varying lead times. The model achieves competitive performance at short-to-medium time scales and superior results at longer time scales while being faster to train and infer due to its lower spatial resolution compared to existing models. Additionally, the paper compares ensemble and non-ensemble forecasting methods, focusing on Stormer's performance against models like GraphCast and Pangu-Weather. The authors propose that Stormer, despite being an ensemble technique, functions as a deterministic model, emphasizing the importance of careful comparisons between ensemble and non-ensemble results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper demonstrates that high-performance weather prediction models can operate effectively at lower resolutions, conserving computational resources while maintaining performance.  
- The use of adaptive layer normalization for variable lead times is an innovative contribution.  
- The methodology is clearly articulated, making it accessible to readers.  
- The authors provide valuable insights and a comprehensive rebuttal addressing most concerns.  
- The non-ensemble Stormer results are noteworthy, performing comparably to GraphCast and surpassing Pangu-Weather.  
- The inclusion of additional plots and discussions in the rebuttal PDF enhances the paper's clarity.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the paper is limited, with many components resembling existing models like ClimaX and PanguWeather.  
- The evaluation methodology is criticized for being unfair, as it compares an ensemble technique against deterministic models without proper probabilistic metrics.  
- There is a lack of rigor in comparing ensemble and non-ensemble results, particularly in the treatment of point predictions versus ensemble-mean predictions.  
- The overly smooth predictions in Figures 12-16 raise concerns about the physical realism of ensemble-mean predictions.  
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of related works and fails to adequately address the limitations of its approach, particularly regarding spatial resolution and the ability to resolve localized weather features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the paper by clearly distinguishing their contributions from existing models like ClimaX and PanguWeather. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with other related works such as ClimODE and Neural GCM to contextualize Stormer's performance. The evaluation should incorporate probabilistic metrics like CRPS to assess ensemble quality accurately. We also recommend improving the clarity of the paper by clearly distinguishing between ensemble and non-ensemble results throughout, providing separate comparisons: ensemble Stormer with other ensemble methods (e.g., IFS ENS) and non-ensemble Stormer with non-ensemble baselines. While it is acceptable to show these results together in a plot, exercise caution in making direct comparisons between ensemble predictions and point predictions. To highlight differences between models on short-range forecasts (~1-3 days ahead), consider showing relative plots (e.g., relative to HRES for non-ensemble models, and ENS for ensembles). Finally, clarify the reasons for ClimaX's underperformance in weather forecasting, particularly in relation to its training data and methodology, and provide a more transparent discussion of the limitations, particularly regarding spatial resolution and its implications for localized weather features.
