### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for entity linking using polar box embeddings and relation encoding, enhancing entity matching through a dense retrieval framework. The authors propose a method that clusters entities based on shared relations, optimizing their representation in spherical polar coordinates. The approach demonstrates average performance improvements across various datasets, contributing to the understanding of entity disambiguation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new type of embeddingsâ€”box embeddings in polar coordinates.
- It effectively addresses a critical problem with a well-structured analysis and clear examples.
- The methodology is well-articulated, and the experimental setup is robust, including multiple models and an ablation study.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the approach may hinder reproducibility, as it relies on extensive entity information from sources like Wikipedia and Wikidata, which may not be accessible in practical scenarios.
- There is insufficient discussion on how relations are modeled and extracted from Wikipedia, which could limit understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their results by publishing the source code alongside the paper, as confirmed during the author response period. Additionally, providing more details on relation modeling and the relation encoder would enhance clarity. Lastly, conducting a quantitative analysis of relation boxes with incorrect entities could yield insights into model confusion and further strengthen the paper.
