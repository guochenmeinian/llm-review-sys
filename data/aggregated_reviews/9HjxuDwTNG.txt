Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multi-task learning method for a unified conversational recommendation system, proposing a joint learning approach for recommendation and dialogue tasks. The authors introduce two versions of contextualized knowledge distillation to integrate knowledge from task-specific teachers, addressing the previously unexplored discrepancy between recommendation and dialogue tasks in conversational agents. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements in recommendation performance and dialogue fluency compared to existing methodologies, supported by a detailed ablation study.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured, providing clear insights and detailed explanations that enhance clarity and reproducibility.
- The proposed teacher-student model structure outperforms existing methods in recommendation performance and response fluency.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, with qualitative results being intuitive.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of empirical validation regarding real-time application efficiency, which is crucial for dialogue-based recommender systems.
- Insufficient comparison with similar works, particularly "RecInDial," which presents a related baseline and demonstrates better performance.
- The rationale behind the integration of knowledge distillation and gated mechanisms is inadequately explained, and the performance improvements are not significant.
- The evaluation results are inconsistent, and the human evaluation lacks credibility due to an inadequately described valuation scheme.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their model's real-time application efficiency by conducting benchmarking against existing solutions. Additionally, it is crucial to provide a thorough comparison with "RecInDial" and other relevant works to clarify the distinct contributions of their approach. We suggest enhancing the explanation of the rationale behind the gated mechanisms and knowledge distillation. Furthermore, the authors should address the inconsistencies in evaluation results and strengthen the credibility of the human evaluation by providing a clearer description of the valuation scheme. Lastly, we encourage the authors to extend their evaluation to more complex datasets beyond the ReDial dataset to demonstrate the generalization ability of their approach across different domains, such as E-commerce.
