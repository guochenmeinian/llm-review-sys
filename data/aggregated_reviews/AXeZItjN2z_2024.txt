### Key Points
We note that the paper demonstrates significant improvements in performance and efficiency by combining MedSAM and CNN-based transformer RepViT. The distillation of a RepViT image encoder from a pretrained TinyViT image encoder, followed by fine-tuning, resulted in a reduction of processing time from approximately 300 seconds to 170 seconds on a complex 3D case (CT_0566). The achieved DSC of 0.8688 and NSD of 0.8746 surpasses the baseline and other models. However, we require a detailed explanation of why distillation led to such substantial improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of hybrid ViT effectively optimizes both accuracy and speed.
- The authors conducted a thorough ablation study, demonstrating the importance of the two-stage training process (distillation followed by fine-tuning).

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks the application of additional tools for deployment performance enhancement, such as torch script, torch.jit, or onnx.
- There are minor writing issues, such as the phrase "mandatory table" in Table 1, which should be removed.
- The absence of code for reproducibility is a significant drawback.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest that the authors provide a detailed explanation of the improvements achieved through distillation. Additionally, we recommend incorporating tools like torch script, torch.jit, or onnx to further enhance efficiency. The manuscript should replace "Abbreviated paper title" with the actual title and include code for reproducibility.
