Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on bias detection in the Bayesian persuasion model, focusing on the resistance of the receiver to update their prior beliefs. The authors propose a signaling scheme to determine whether the bias level of an agent is above or below a threshold $\tau$. The algorithm design is based on the revelation principle, converting the problem into a linear program under specific constraints. The paper aims to minimize the number of signaling rounds required to detect the bias level.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and generally easy to follow, with clear explanations of the problem formulation and scheme design intuitions.  
- The study addresses a novel problem relevant to the Bayesian persuasion community, and the proofs appear theoretically sound.  
- The geometric characterization of the problem is interesting, particularly regarding the conditions under which the bias level can be detected.  

Weaknesses:  
- The definition of the baseline is inadequately contextualized within PAC learning, raising questions about the choice of baseline and its implications for sample complexity.  
- The motivation for the study lacks depth, particularly in real-world applications, and the assumption that the principal knows the agent's prior undermines the practical relevance of the findings.  
- The main theorems are not clearly articulated, making it difficult to grasp the contributions of the results.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the baseline definition and its relationship to PAC learning, specifically addressing why it is defined as such rather than considering the minimum expected samples needed for bias detection. Additionally, we suggest expanding the motivation section to include a more detailed discussion of real-world applications and implications. Clarifying the main theorems and their contributions would enhance the paper's readability. Finally, exploring the possibility of extending the model to multi-type receivers and discussing the sample complexity in terms of $\epsilon$ and $\delta$ could strengthen the submission.
