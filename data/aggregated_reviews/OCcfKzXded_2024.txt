Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel unsupervised outdoor point cloud registration method called INTEGER, which integrates high-level contextual and low-level geometric information to generate reliable pseudo-labels. The authors propose a Feature-Geometry Coherence Mining module, Anchor-Based Contrastive Learning, and a Mixed-Density Student model, achieving improved accuracy and generalizability in complex outdoor environments compared to traditional methods. The method demonstrates competitive performance on standard datasets like KITTI and nuScenes. Additionally, the paper examines the PREDATOR framework, focusing on the two components of the loss function: the anchor-based auxiliary loss \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}} \) and the registration loss \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} \). The authors clarify that \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}} \) enhances feature similarity to positive anchors while reducing it for negative anchors, distinguishing it from Circle Loss. They emphasize that \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} \) serves as the primary supervision signal for the student model and detail the training process involving both encoders and decoders.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: INTEGER innovatively combines high-level contextual and low-level geometric information, addressing challenges in outdoor environments where previous methods relying solely on geometric data often fail.
- Quality: The paper exhibits high-quality research with robust evaluations on benchmarks like KITTI and nuScenes, showcasing the mixed-density student model's ability to learn density-invariant features.
- Clarity: The manuscript is well-organized and clearly written, effectively communicating methodologies and results with helpful figures and tables.
- Significance: The work has transformative potential in autonomous driving and robotics, enhancing unsupervised point cloud registration and reducing reliance on labeled data.
- Distinction of Loss Functions: The authors provide a clear distinction between the roles of \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}} \) and \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{reg}} \), enhancing understanding of their methodology.
- Performance: The performance results indicate that their approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of their proposed losses.

Weaknesses:
- Dependency on Initial Conditions: INTEGER's performance is heavily reliant on the quality of the initial teacher model, which could propagate errors. The paper should explore alternative strategies for robust initializations and analyze their impact on performance.
- Comparison with State-of-the-Art Methods: The comparison with existing methods is limited. Including a broader range of recent unsupervised learning approaches could validate INTEGER's strengths and uniqueness.
- Confusion in Implementation Details: There is some confusion regarding the implementation details, particularly concerning the network used in the ablation study and the hyperparameters of the losses.
- Ambiguity of Loss Relationships: The relationship between \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{aux}} \) and Circle Loss remains ambiguous for some reviewers.
- Discussion on Failure Cases and Limitations: A more thorough discussion of scenarios where INTEGER may underperform, such as with sparse point clouds or noise, is needed to set realistic expectations.
- Generalizability Across Different Datasets: While tested on KITTI and nuScenes, additional experiments on diverse datasets would demonstrate the method's adaptability and robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the robustness of the initial teacher model, including strategies for initialization and its effects on performance. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with a wider range of state-of-the-art unsupervised methods to better highlight INTEGER's advantages. A more detailed exploration of failure cases and limitations, particularly in challenging environments, would enhance the manuscript. We also recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly stating the network used in the ablation study and confirming whether the hyperparameters, such as \( \gamma \), are consistent with those in PREDATOR. Finally, conducting experiments on datasets with varying characteristics would provide a comprehensive evaluation of INTEGER's effectiveness across different real-world conditions, and we suggest that the authors release the code upon acceptance to facilitate a better understanding of their method.
