### Key Points
This paper formulates h-adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) as a decentralized partially-observable Markov decision process (Dec-POMDP) and proposes the Adaptive Swarm Markov Decision Process (ASMDP) with parameter-sharing among agents and individual rewards. The refinement policies are parameterized by message-passing graph neural networks (MPN) and trained using Q-learning (DQN) and proximal policy optimization (PPO). The authors investigate AMR using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, focusing on unstructured conforming meshes and predominantly stationary problems. Evaluation on various 2D elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) demonstrates that the proposed approach is competitive with traditional error-based AMR heuristics and outperforms modified existing learning-based methods. The authors conducted additional experiments showing that their method generalizes to larger meshes and provides accurate refinements significantly faster than uniform solutions, addressing the complexity of finding multiple precise refinement actions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The use of independent multi-agent reinforcement learning with individual rewards addresses the posthumous credit assignment problem in AMR, avoiding the complexities of a single team reward.
- Quality: The paper provides sufficient motivation, rigorous formulation, and empirical evaluation, covering most aspects of a high-quality applied paper.
- Clarity: The problem description, proposed method, notation, and experimental setup are clearly articulated.
- Significance: The results contribute to improving AMR for the finite element method, crucial for solving PDEs in engineering and applied sciences.
- Substantial experimental results demonstrate generalization to larger meshes and improved refinement strategies, distinguishing their work from simpler approaches in existing literature.
- The implementation of learned baselines is thorough, with adaptations made for comparability.

Weaknesses:
- The characterization of the experimental scale is imprecise; the paper suggests it addresses real-world problems, but experiments are limited to simple elliptic PDEs on meshes with thousands of elements, similar to prior work.
- The approach could extend to include coarsening actions, which is not demonstrated, raising questions about its applicability in more complex scenarios, particularly for time-dependent PDEs.
- The experimental evaluation lacks generalization to larger meshes and longer time steps, which is essential for real-world applications.
- Some terminology and comparisons with existing methods are misleading, particularly regarding the implementation of learning-based baselines.
- The initial presentation of the abstract may overstate the complexity of the experiments relative to previous work.
- The labeling of baselines in figures requires clarification to accurately reflect the methodologies used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the characterization of the experimental scale to align the abstract with the actual complexity of the experiments conducted. We suggest demonstrating that trained policies generalize to larger meshes and longer time steps than those seen in training, as this is crucial for practical applications. We recommend including empirical evidence that the approach extends to coarsening actions, as this is necessary for handling more complex PDEs. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed discussion on mesh coarsening and its implications for time-dependent problems. We advise clarifying the terminology used in the paper, particularly regarding the "PPO version of VDGN," and ensuring that the learning-based baselines accurately reflect the methods in the referenced works. We also recommend revising the notation introduced in Section 3 for clarity, as some definitions are ambiguous and may hinder understanding. Finally, we encourage the authors to revise the labels in Figures 4 and 5 to clearly distinguish between the different baseline methods and their architectures, and to integrate the new generalization results into the main paper to enhance its practical relevance.
