Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a unified approach to universal approximation theorems for neural networks using group representation theory, extending to vector-valued joint-group-equivariant feature maps. The authors propose a systematic method applicable to both shallow and deep networks with nonlinear activation functions. Leveraging Schur's lemma, they demonstrate that these networks can universally approximate functions within a specific class. A significant contribution is the closed-form ridgelet transform, which provides a constructive proof and explicit parameter distribution for these networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unified constructive universal approximation theorem for both shallow and deep networks, representing an innovative application of group representation theory.
- The theoretical foundation is robust, utilizing group representation theory and Schur's lemma, with a thorough development of the ridgelet transform.
- The writing is well-structured and clear, facilitating reader comprehension of complex arguments and implications.
- The work establishes a significant connection between deep learning theory and modern algebra, encouraging further research in machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical validation; practical applicability of the ridgelet transform and the unified framework on real-world datasets is not demonstrated, which could enhance the paper's relevance.
- Several assumptions, such as the local compactness of the group \( G \) and the boundedness of the composite operator \( \text{NN} \circ R \), are made without sufficient discussion of their implications or limitations.
- Some technical details may be challenging for non-experts, suggesting a need for more intuitive explanations, diagrams, or examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of their theoretical results by including experiments or simulations on real-world datasets to demonstrate the practical relevance of the ridgelet transform. Additionally, a more detailed discussion on the implications and limitations of the assumptions made in the paper would be beneficial. Clarifying the robustness of the findings in scenarios where these assumptions might not hold would strengthen the work. Finally, providing additional intuitive explanations or examples for advanced concepts in group representation theory could enhance clarity for a broader audience.
