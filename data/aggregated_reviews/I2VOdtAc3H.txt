Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Global Flood Forecasting (GFF) dataset, which is designed for rapid flood extent mapping and forecasting. It integrates Sentinel-1 observations with other modalities such as weather, topography, and hydrography, and includes two benchmark tasks: one for global flood mapping and another focused on coastal flood events. The dataset is notable for its global representativeness and the separation of coastal and near-coastal flood events.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of multi-temporal and multi-modal data enhances the dataset's robustness.
- The dataset is geographically balanced, avoiding bias in performance metrics.
- The authors provide a well-structured document with detailed instructions for dataset construction and a comprehensive empirical study.
- The benchmarks are thoughtfully designed, including a clear distinction between expert annotations and pseudolabels.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on pseudolabels raises concerns about the dataset's accuracy, potentially limiting model performance.
- The experiments primarily utilize the F1 metric, which may restrict the evaluation scope; additional metrics could strengthen the results.
- The lack of formal expertise in interpreting SAR data for flooding is a significant limitation, as visual reviews by untrained individuals may undermine dataset confidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset by specifying how the event duration was sourced and whether any steps were taken to address class imbalance. Additionally, it would be beneficial to indicate which regions of interest (ROIs) contain expert annotations versus pseudolabels in the figures. We also suggest that the authors review and correct all pseudolabeled masks to ensure high quality, and provide a more granular comparison of the GFF dataset with existing datasets. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the interpretation of SAR data by trained experts would significantly enhance the dataset's credibility.
