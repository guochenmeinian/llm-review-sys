Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FITS, a lightweight model for time series analysis that operates in the frequency domain by manipulating time series through interpolation. The authors argue that their approach achieves competitive performance across various datasets, outperforming existing methods in many scenarios while maintaining a compact size of approximately 10k parameters. FITS demonstrates effectiveness in forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, achieving the best results in 13 out of 28 settings and second best in 11 out of 28. The authors emphasize the importance of efficiency, particularly for edge devices, and acknowledge the need for multiple runs to ensure statistical significance in comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of frequency domain manipulation for time series analysis is novel and technically sound.
2. The model's compact size is a significant advantage, being 50 times smaller than DLinear.
3. FITS demonstrates strong performance, achieving competitive results in forecasting tasks.
4. The method is efficient, requiring significantly less compute and memory than existing solutions, making it suitable for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The practical value of the approach is unclear, as existing models like DLinear may already be sufficiently small for edge devices.
2. The experiments on anomaly detection lack rigor, primarily comparing against neural network baselines without including traditional methods.
3. The comparison of methods lacks comprehensive statistical significance due to the use of a single random seed for some baselines.
4. The motivation for the method's approach to interpolation and its impact on forecasting is not fully convincing to all reviewers.
5. The paper does not adequately address the handling of multivariate time series or provide sufficient details on input/output dimensions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the visibility of figures by adjusting colors and increasing font sizes. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the framework can handle multivariate time series and how to select cutoff frequencies in such cases. It is essential to report training efficiency and conduct more comprehensive experiments, including comparisons with non-transformer models and traditional anomaly detection methods. We also suggest improving the statistical rigor of comparisons by conducting multiple runs for each method to ensure reproducibility and significance. Furthermore, providing more analysis and discussions with synthetic data to illustrate how the method behaves under various conditions would enhance reader understanding. Finally, we suggest including a dedicated section on multivariate handling and empirical evidence regarding channel correlations in the revised manuscript.
