### Key Points
This paper presents an economic model that utilizes tokens to enhance the utility derived from shared commons, aiming to align individual consumption with overall optimal levels. The authors propose a tokenization system that incentivizes self-regulation among users of public goods, exemplified through public park usage. The model suggests that tokens can mirror the social planner's marginal cost and leverage blockchain technology for decentralized management and real-time data integrity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The relevance of addressing the tragedy of the commons is significant, and the proposed framework offers a promising alternative incentive mechanism.
2. The authors provide a detailed theoretical model with clear illustrations and explanations of concepts.

Weaknesses:
1. The example of public park usage is impractical, as measuring consumption and benefits in this context is challenging and raises privacy concerns.
2. The paper lacks clarity and structure, with elements like Figure 1 not adequately explained, which diminishes the overall understanding of the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical example by selecting a scenario more aligned with Web3, such as blockchain infrastructure or DAO common funds. This would allow for comparisons with established approaches like Quadratic Funding/Voting. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the tokenomics section by detailing the mechanics of token distribution, supply, demand, transferability, and design features that incentivize desired behaviors. Lastly, revising the manuscript to better align the formal analysis with the illustrative use case would strengthen the contribution.
