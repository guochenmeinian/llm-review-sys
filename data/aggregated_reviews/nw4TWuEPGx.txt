Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for discovering plasticity rules in spiking neural networks aimed at achieving sequence generation, particularly inspired by the HVC region of zebra finches. The authors propose that local plasticity rules can lead to self-organizing connectivity motifs, enhancing stability and robustness in the presence of noise and synaptic turnover. The study employs meta-learning to optimize these rules, analyzing their effectiveness across various conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly presenting the key questions and motivations behind the research.
- The investigation into self-organizing networks with meta-learned plasticity rules is novel and biologically plausible.
- The use of meta-learning to estimate plasticity rules is innovative, providing interpretable outcomes from complex machine learning techniques.
- The exploration of various synaptic rules (E-E, E-I, I-E) adds depth to the analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear technical novelties, as meta-learning of plasticity rules has been previously explored in various contexts.
- The novelty of the findings is not well highlighted in relation to existing studies, particularly regarding the application of evolutionary algorithms and the generalization of the Oja rule.
- The manuscript occasionally feels rushed, particularly in sections discussing figures and the interaction of estimated rules with supervised learning.
- The clarity of figures and the presentation of results could be improved, as some figures are busy and difficult to interpret.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of existing methods related to meta-learning of plasticity rules to clarify their contributions. Additionally, it would be beneficial to explicitly explore the interaction between the estimated plasticity rule and subsequent supervised learning, as hinted in the introduction. We suggest enhancing the clarity of figures and ensuring consistent formatting throughout the manuscript. Finally, we recommend expanding the background section to assist readers unfamiliar with neuronal sequence modeling and zebra finch HVC.
