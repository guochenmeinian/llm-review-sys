Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Equivariant Probabilistic Neural Simulation (EPNS), a framework for incorporating symmetries into autoregressive probabilistic modeling of multidimensional dynamics. The authors demonstrate that EPNS outperforms existing neural network-based methods in simulation quality, data efficiency, rollout stability, and uncertainty quantification across two applications: a stochastic n-body system and stochastic cellular dynamics. The framework leverages domain equivariances and introduces a novel message passing graph neural architecture that maintains equivariance to permutations of cell indices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides a valuable contribution by developing a method for learning stochastic equivariant distributions over trajectories, enhancing neural simulation capabilities.  
2. Comprehensive experiments showcase multiple benefits of the framework, including improved data efficiency and uncertainty quantification.  
3. The presentation is excellent, with a detailed appendix and reproducible results that facilitate understanding.

Weaknesses:  
1. An important reference [A] is not cited, which undermines claims regarding the novelty of the authors' approach to incorporating symmetries.  
2. Several crucial contributions are insufficiently justified, including the need for comparisons against equivariant deterministic methods and typical probabilistic models.  
3. The experimental scenarios are limited to simple systems, raising questions about generalizability to more complex, realistic applications.  
4. The choice of graph architecture lacks clarity, particularly regarding its generalizability to larger systems.  
5. The authors do not adequately explore the model's ability to preserve physical quantities or provide insights into the learned dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including reference [A] to clarify the novelty of their work. Additionally, the authors should conduct experiments comparing their method against equivariant deterministic models and typical probabilistic models like ODEVAE to substantiate their claims. It would be beneficial to explore more complex systems beyond the current toy examples to demonstrate the generalizability of the approach. We suggest providing further insights into the stability of the model and its ability to capture physical dynamics, including detailed error metrics and the rationale behind the choice of architecture. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the scalability of the model to larger systems and the implications of data efficiency would strengthen the paper.
