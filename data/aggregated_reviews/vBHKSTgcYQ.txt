Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a solution to the best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) problem for linear bandits by introducing an Exploration-by-Optimization (EXO) approach. The authors demonstrate that this method achieves $O(d\sqrt{T \log T})$ regret in adversarial environments and $O(d^2 \log T/\Delta_{\min})$ regret in stochastic settings. The paper establishes a connection between EXO and the SCRiBLe algorithm, allowing for a broader interpretation of existing algorithms. Furthermore, the authors suggest that the EXO framework could extend to other sequential decision-making problems, such as partial monitoring and episodic MDPs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively addresses the significant challenge of constructing BOBW linear bandit algorithms for both stochastic and adversarial environments.  
- It demonstrates the effectiveness of the EXO approach in achieving nearly optimal regret bounds and establishes connections with existing algorithms, enhancing interpretability.  
- The potential for extending the EXO framework to other decision-making contexts is highlighted, indicating broader implications for future research.  

Weaknesses:  
- The assumption that loss vectors adhere to a specific model may not reflect real-world complexities, where environments can be hybrid rather than strictly stochastic or adversarial.  
- The lack of empirical evaluation raises concerns about the practical effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.  
- The improvement by a log(T) term may not be significant in all contexts, and the paper does not provide sufficient insights into the complexity and implementation challenges of the proposed algorithms.  
- Limitations and assumptions regarding the algorithms are not explicitly discussed, which could benefit from clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation of the proposed algorithms to validate their practical effectiveness in real-world scenarios. Additionally, addressing the assumptions made about the underlying environment and discussing potential limitations would enhance the clarity of the work. We suggest providing detailed insights into the implementation challenges associated with the EXO algorithms and exploring the computational feasibility of the proposed methods. Finally, further discussions on the advantages of the EXO algorithm compared to standard FTRL-type algorithms would strengthen the theoretical contributions of the paper.
