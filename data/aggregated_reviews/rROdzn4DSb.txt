### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the ability of Transformer models to learn and generalize the rules of Elementary Cellular Automata (ECA). By training on sequences generated from random initial conditions, the authors assess whether Transformers can abstract underlying Boolean functions. While the models demonstrate high accuracy in next-state predictions, they struggle significantly with multi-step planning tasks. The authors propose enhancements to model architecture, such as increasing depth and incorporating dynamic elements, to improve performance on complex reasoning tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative use of ECAs as a testbed effectively evaluates the generalization capabilities of Transformers, providing a novel approach to assessing abstract reasoning in deep learning models.
2. The comprehensive examination of model performance across various tasks, including next-state prediction and multi-step planning, offers valuable insights into the strengths and limitations of the models.

Weaknesses:
1. The controlled environment of ECAs may not adequately reflect the complexities of real-world scenarios, potentially limiting the broader applicability of the findings.
2. Increasing model depth could lead to resource-intensive architectures, raising concerns about computational and energy costs for practical applications.
3. The focus on ECAs and Boolean functions may result in overfitting, diminishing the models' effectiveness on diverse real-world problems.
4. The novelty of the study is limited, as learning Turing Machines has been explored in prior research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including additional training details and hyperparameters to enhance reproducibility. It would also be beneficial to provide a supporting test-bed or toy example to strengthen the claims and broaden their applicability. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the influence of lattice and radius sizes on results, and investigating any theoretical guarantees related to the number of layers in Transformers concerning planning ability. Additionally, considering more complex learning tasks beyond ECAs could provide insights into the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explicitly compare their methods with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) approaches and explore techniques such as data mixing and recurrent architectures to potentially enhance planning capabilities.
