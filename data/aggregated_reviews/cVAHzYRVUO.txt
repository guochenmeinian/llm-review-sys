### Key Points
This paper presents a method for inductive inference on knowledge graphs, focusing on unseen entities and relations, an under-explored area. The authors propose using ontological and type information for inductive link and type prediction, which is intriguing. The approach incorporates ontology semantics into learning node embeddings and utilizes three loss components, including a type-constrained regular loss. While the results outperform existing algorithms, the paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work and the experimental settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach based on ontology and type information is interesting and shows positive results over benchmark datasets.
- The incorporation of type-constrained regular loss enhances model robustness.
- The authors conduct a comprehensive experimental analysis and improve datasets through rigorous processing.

Weaknesses:
- Missing related work raises doubts about the effectiveness of the approach in comparison to existing methods.
- The problem formulation may misunderstand the nature of unseen entities, as common entities often reoccur in training and testing.
- The datasets are inadequately explained and appear cherry-picked, raising concerns about their realism and representativeness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work to clarify the novelty of their approach. Additionally, the authors should address the marginal differences observed in the ablation study regarding ontological information and explain its impact on inductive relational inference. It would also be beneficial to provide more details on the datasets, including how splits were generated and the nature of relations and instances. Finally, we suggest reporting absolute or relative recall gains at a certain precision instead of solely relying on ranking metrics to enhance the evaluation of their method's effectiveness.
