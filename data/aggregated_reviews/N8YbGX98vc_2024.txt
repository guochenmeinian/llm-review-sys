### Key Points
This paper presents Training-Free Guidance (TFG), a novel framework aimed at enhancing sample generation with desired properties using diffusion models without requiring additional training. TFG addresses limitations of existing training-free methods by providing a unified algorithmic framework that simplifies comparisons and applications across various tasks. The authors conduct a theoretical and empirical analysis of hyper-parameter design, developing an effective selection strategy applicable to multiple tasks. Comprehensive benchmarks demonstrate TFG's superior performance, achieving an average improvement of 7.4% over existing methods. Additionally, the authors propose a method for fine-tuning a network trained on clean images for noisy image applications, achieving satisfactory performance within one A100 hour. They emphasize that their approach differs significantly from existing methods, particularly in the structure of the guidance function and its implications for training efficiency. The main contribution of their unification algorithm lies in recognizing the importance of unifying various methods within the same hyper-parameter space. The authors also express willingness to provide a detailed theoretical discussion on the connections between the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and time travel.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The establishment of a unified benchmark for training-free guidance is a commendable contribution that could significantly advance research in this area.  
- The extensive experiments reflect high diligence and thoroughness, validating the proposed framework's applicability across diverse tasks.  
- The reproducible benchmark established in the paper is expected to influence future research in training-free guidance.  
- The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the theoretical foundations and implications of their work.  

Weaknesses:  
- The title may overreach by implying a broader coverage of training-free guidance than is presented, as it does not fully address the spectrum of existing works.  
- The rationale for focusing on training-free approaches is less articulated, and the theoretical foundations require further elaboration to substantiate claims made.  
- The defined hyperparameter space may not encompass all relevant parameters from existing literature, potentially limiting the framework's applicability.  
- Some claims regarding the framework's comprehensiveness and performance comparisons are overly broad and lack sufficient theoretical backing.  
- The proof of Theorem 3.2 is perceived as straightforward, raising questions about its significance.  
- There is a lack of formal guarantees regarding the practical implications of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process in time travel methodology.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the title to more accurately reflect the scope of the paper and clarify the relationship of their work to existing studies in training-free guidance. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the articulation of the motivations for focusing on training-free methods and providing a more thorough theoretical grounding for the claims made, particularly regarding the unified framework. The authors should also expand the discussion on hyperparameter settings to include critical parameters from existing literature and ensure that the hyperparameter search settings for comparative analyses are transparently disclosed. We encourage a more detailed explanation of Algorithm 1 and its components to aid understanding. Furthermore, we recommend improving the discussion on the practical implications of the connections between the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process and time travel, providing clearer insights that could enhance the methodology. Lastly, we strongly suggest including motion diffusion guidance from the LGD paper and phase retrieval from the DPS paper as additional benchmarks in the final manuscript to ensure comprehensive comparisons.
