### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to mitigate hallucinations in large vision-language models (LVLMs) without requiring retraining or API usage. The authors propose the MARINE method, which enhances visual encoding during inference by leveraging external object detection models. The methodology demonstrates improved average accuracy, F1 score, and yes ratio compared to existing methods, as well as reduced hallucinations at both the instance and sentence levels. The ablation study indicates that guidance strength significantly impacts model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides strong empirical evidence for the effectiveness of the MARINE method in mitigating object hallucinations.
- It includes comprehensive comparisons with multiple previously proposed hallucination correction methods and decoding strategies.
- Introduces a simple, lightweight approach that enhances LVLMs during inference.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty of the MARINE framework may be questioned, as it primarily adds original prompts to the decoding process.
- The paper lacks a discussion on the broader implications of hallucination mitigation for safe image generation.
- There is some overlap in the error bars for results in Table 3, suggesting potential statistical insignificance.
- The experiments do not adequately address the robustness of the method concerning different object detection models.
- The focus is primarily on object hallucinations, neglecting other types such as attribute, relationship, and scene hallucinations.
- A deeper discussion on potential failure cases and limitations of the MARINE framework is absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of hallucination mitigation for safe image generation. Additionally, including traditional task performance metrics for tasks like image captioning would demonstrate that the new method does not negatively impact overall performance. The authors should also address why using an object detection model is superior to traditional vision encoders and provide a more thorough examination of the robustness of their method across different object detection models. Finally, a more comprehensive discussion on potential failure cases and limitations of the MARINE framework is necessary.
