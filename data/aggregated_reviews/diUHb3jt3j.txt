Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of Hate Instigating Speech (HIS), focusing on textual posts that provoke hate speech on platforms like YouTube. The authors propose a multilingual dataset in English and Korean aimed at addressing the root causes of hate speech rather than just individual instances. The study emphasizes the need for a deeper understanding of hate speech instigation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new dataset relevant to the study of hate speech instigation.
- It addresses an overlooked aspect of hate speech by focusing on its propagation rather than mere detection.

Weaknesses:
- The criteria for defining Hate Instigating Speech are unclear, making the categorization of posts unconvincing.
- The paper lacks comprehensive literature review and comparison with existing datasets.
- Important details regarding the dataset's annotation process, guidelines, and demographic information about annotators are insufficiently addressed.
- The models employed are not state-of-the-art, yet the authors claim their inadequacy in detecting hate speech instigation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the criteria for Hate Instigating Speech and provide a detailed explanation of the annotation guidelines and processes. It is essential to include a thorough comparison with existing literature and datasets, particularly those mentioned in the reviews. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether the dataset focuses solely on political content and specify any text preprocessing applied. We also suggest that the authors substantiate claims regarding the dataset's characteristics with significance testing and reconsider the terminology used to describe the dataset, favoring "hate prone/hate provoking" over "hate instigation."
