Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical understanding of equivariant self-supervised learning (E-SSL) methods and their effectiveness, proposing an information-theoretic analysis that elucidates the synergy between class information and equivariant transformations, which enhances downstream performance. The authors identify three principles for E-SSL design: lossy transformations, class relevance, and shortcut pruning. The importance of model equivariance is discussed, demonstrating its advantages in E-SSL. The study also aims to bridge the gap between theory and practice in E-SSL, providing insights into the "explaining-away" principle and its implications for mutual information between pre-task and downstream task labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article is well-structured, with clear arguments and a solid theoretical foundation supported by experimental evidence.
2. The authors analyze the impact of equivariance on self-supervised learning from an information theory perspective and propose three design principles for E-SSL.
3. The theoretical validity is supported by proofs and small experiments, enhancing understanding of augmentation functions.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to a few datasets, which may not convincingly demonstrate the proposed theories.
2. There are several typos in the paper, including “xIn” in line 352.
3. The practical insights are primarily qualitative, lacking quantitative assessments of class relevance, which would strengthen the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by conducting tests on a broader range of datasets to enhance the robustness of their claims. Additionally, addressing the identified typos and ensuring consistent notation throughout the paper would improve clarity. We suggest providing a design enhancement example and conducting experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness, as the current explanations primarily reference previous E-SSL works. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the distinction between augmentation-aware methods and truly equivariant methods more thoroughly to clarify their implications for empirical results.
