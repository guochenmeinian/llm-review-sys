Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to learning interactions of unseen modality combinations, addressing the challenge of modality incompleteness during training. The authors propose a feature projection layer to align different modalities into a shared dimensionality and a dual-branch prediction layer that generates both real and pseudo-labels. The method is evaluated across three diverse datasets, demonstrating significant improvements over existing modality-complete and modality-incomplete methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a new setting for learning from unseen modality combinations and proposes a method to address this challenge.
- The experiments are comprehensive, involving diverse datasets and thorough ablation studies that justify design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the presentation requires improvement, particularly in the methods section, where variable names and notation are inconsistent and confusing.
- Some claims regarding the robustness of the method lack empirical justification, particularly concerning the handling of corrupted modalities and the benefits of using additional modalities at inference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by ensuring consistent variable naming and clearer notation, particularly regarding the alignment process and pseudo-label generation. Additionally, we suggest providing a quantitative justification for the benefits of using a superset of modalities at inference time and elaborating on the architecture's handling of modality order. A more detailed exploration of the pseudo-labeling process, including qualitative examples, would enhance the robustness of the claims made. Finally, addressing the ambiguities in the experimental setup and ensuring accurate table numbering will improve the overall presentation.
