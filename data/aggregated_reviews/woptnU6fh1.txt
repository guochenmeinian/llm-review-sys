Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents BayesDAG, a hybrid SG-MCMC sampling and variational inference method for posterior distribution sampling of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) in Bayesian structure learning. The authors modify the approach from "Yu et al., Dags with no curl, 2021" by replacing a continuous skew-symmetric matrix with a binary matrix to enhance optimization and sampling. The method aims to overcome limitations of previous approaches by allowing for a more flexible representation of DAGs and demonstrating competitive performance on various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, clearly articulating the motivation and methodology.
- It intelligently utilizes recent research and presents concrete innovations in Bayesian structure learning.
- The proposed method effectively addresses limitations of prior work, particularly in posterior inference.

Weaknesses:
- The justification for replacing the continuous matrix W with a binary matrix lacks clarity and requires better explanation, particularly regarding its impact on gradient-based optimization and sampling.
- A comparative analysis with a continuous W approach, similar to NoCurl, is absent.
- The paper does not provide a link to the authors' code, which is essential for reproducibility and practical application of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for replacing the continuous matrix W with a binary matrix, addressing questions about its benefits for gradient-based methods. Additionally, the authors should include a comparison of their algorithm with an alternative that uses a continuous W. We encourage the authors to provide a link to their code to facilitate reproducibility and usability of their method. Finally, clarifying the implications of the causal sufficiency assumption and enhancing the presentation of their inference method would improve the overall clarity of the paper.
