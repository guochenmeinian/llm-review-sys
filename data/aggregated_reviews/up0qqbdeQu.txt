Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post hoc method to tune the ResNet-based CLIP method for multi-label recognition tasks. The authors propose a class concept representation, which averages class description sentence embeddings from sources like MSCOCO, as an alternative to the default prompt format. Additionally, they introduce a sequential attention mechanism to align visual features with this class concept representation. The method aims to enhance zero-shot and prompt-tuning performance without requiring additional training or labeled samples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method significantly enhances zero-shot and prompt-tuning performance without additional training, demonstrating computational efficiency.
2. Experimental results across multiple benchmark datasets (MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE) indicate substantial performance gains, showcasing the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear differentiation from TaI-DPT, leaving the comparative advantages ambiguous.
2. The Class Concept Representation's reliance on the MS-COCO dataset raises concerns about the fairness of comparisons with the baseline CLIP method.
3. The implementation is limited to the ResNet-based CLIP model, with no exploration of transformer-based models, which restricts the generalizability of the findings.
4. The terminology "training-free" in the title conflicts with the description of "test-time adaptation" in the content, potentially leading to confusion.
5. The method's dependence on the selection of source text descriptions could benefit from a comparative analysis of different datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages of their method over TaI-DPT. Additionally, addressing the fairness of comparisons in Table 5 is crucial, as is exploring the implications of using transformer-based models. We suggest clarifying the terminology used in the paper to avoid confusion regarding "training-free" versus "test-time adaptation." Furthermore, a comparative analysis of different text description sources would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide clearer explanations of the softmax application in Figure 3 and the rationale behind the performance improvements observed with class concept representation.
