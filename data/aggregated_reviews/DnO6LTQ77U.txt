Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical investigation into the approximation and generalization errors for models exhibiting approximate equivariance. It introduces the concept of "error to equivariance," defining the $\epsilon$-stabilizer, which maintains approximate equivariance under certain transformations. The authors analyze generalization error through PAC-bounds and Rademacher complexity, exploring the approximation error as well. The performance error is defined as the sum of generalization and approximation errors, allowing for a quantitative analysis of the trade-off between these two terms. The paper rigorously derives generalization error bounds that consider the cardinality of transformation sets and group dimensionality, contributing valuable theoretical tools to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in equivariant learning literature, focusing on approximate equivariance relevant to real-world applications.
2. It provides general bounds that enhance the theoretical foundations of the field.

Weaknesses:
1. Section 4 is challenging to read for those unfamiliar with PAC-bounds and Rademacher complexity; additional explanations or intuitive examples are needed for accessibility.
2. The lack of empirical validation or experiments leaves a gap; practical examples aligning with theoretical bounds could enhance applicability.
3. The interpretation of the "generalization-approximation trade-off" is unclear, and the implications of the proposed theory for model selection under approximate equivariance are not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of Section 4 by including additional explanations or intuitive examples to aid readers unfamiliar with PAC-bounds and Rademacher complexity. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating empirical validation or experiments that align with the theoretical bounds to provide practical guidance on the application of the findings. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the high-level message regarding the "generalization-approximation trade-off" and to discuss the broader implications of their theory, particularly in the context of model selection under approximate equivariance. Lastly, we advise summarizing and discussing the assumptions made throughout the theoretical analysis in the limitations section to provide a clearer understanding of the paper's constraints.
