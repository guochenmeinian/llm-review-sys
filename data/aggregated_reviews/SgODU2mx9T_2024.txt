Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Terra, a low-rank adapter designed for effective cross-domain modeling through a continuous parameter manifold. The authors propose a time-varying approach that facilitates knowledge sharing across domains by training a single low-rank adapter. The theoretical expressiveness of the model is analyzed, and extensive experiments on various UDA and UG benchmarks demonstrate its effectiveness. The framework's robustness is validated through ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed Terra is a simple yet effective PEFT method for fine-tuning diffusion models, generating diverse images in customized domain flows.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, facilitating effective knowledge sharing while maintaining parameter efficiency.
- Terra's construction of a continuous parameter manifold using a time variable is theoretically analyzed, with empirical verification of smooth interpolation.
- The method serves as a plugin for existing UDA and DG methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks.
- Codes are provided for reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The qualitative evaluation could be improved; more qualitative samples are needed to comprehensively assess Terra's interpretability.
- The comparative analysis should include recent CNN-based and ViT-based UDA methods, such as CoVi and PMTrans.
- The rationale for randomly sampling the value of "t" in DG experiments is unclear, and the distribution of the target domain needs better explanation.
- The term "time" may cause confusion with the widely used time step in diffusion models; a different term is recommended.
- More insights on choosing the function form for Terra and an ablation study on different functions are needed.
- The novelty of the method is limited as it essentially adopts the LoRA approach, and direct comparative experiments are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the qualitative evaluation by providing more samples to assess Terra's interpretability comprehensively. Additionally, the authors should extend the comparative analysis to include recent CNN-based and ViT-based UDA methods, such as CoVi and PMTrans. Clarifying the rationale behind the random sampling of "t" and providing a better explanation of the target domain distribution is essential. To avoid confusion, we suggest using a different term instead of "time" for the proposed variable. Furthermore, the authors should provide more insights on how to choose the function form for Terra and include an ablation study on different functions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the novelty of the method by incorporating direct comparative experiments with other similar morphing works.
