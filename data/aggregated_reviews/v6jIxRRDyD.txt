### Key Points
This paper presents a study on identifying Pareto optimal arms in a multi-objective bandit setting, extending the single-objective best arm identification problem. The authors propose the Adaptive Pareto Exploration (APE) algorithm and establish theoretical guarantees regarding its performance. The paper also discusses sample complexity and provides empirical validation through experiments, particularly in the context of Covid-19 vaccination strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the underexplored area of Pareto optimality in bandit literature, introducing a novel problem setup and clearly defining goals for various scenarios.  
- It provides a comprehensive discussion on sample complexity upper bounds and connects to existing literature, demonstrating a solid understanding of the research landscape.  
- The empirical evidence, including experiments on real-world datasets, enhances the credibility and practical relevance of the proposed approaches.  

Weaknesses:  
- The extension of the single-objective problem to a multi-objective setting appears trivial, limiting the perceived novelty of the work.  
- The paper lacks references to real-world applications that could benefit from the proposed framework, such as A/B testing in clinical trials.  
- There is insufficient discussion on lower bounds and computational complexity of the APE algorithm, which are crucial for understanding the problem's complexities and practical efficiency.  
- The mathematical notation is overly complicated, and the experimental results seem somewhat hand-wavy, lacking comparisons with naively modified baselines.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical notation to enhance accessibility. Additionally, providing a more detailed motivation for the $\epsilon$-PSI-$k$ formulation and discussing its necessity compared to existing frameworks would strengthen the contribution. We also suggest including a thorough analysis of lower bounds and computational complexity to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed methods. Furthermore, discussing potential real-world applications beyond clinical trials and comparing the proposed method with simpler baselines would enhance the paper's impact and practical relevance.
