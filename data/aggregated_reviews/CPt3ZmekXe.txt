### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for extracting betweenness centrality in temporal graphs, introducing three main contributions: the Exact Temporal Betweenness Centrality (ETBC), an optimized version called Optimized Temporal Betweenness Centrality (OTBC), and an approximate method known as Approximate Temporal Betweenness Centrality (ATBC). The authors derive a new recursive temporal dependency formulation, which enhances the efficiency of the algorithms. The paper includes theoretical guarantees and empirical results, demonstrating the methods' effectiveness on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new recursive temporal dependency formulation is a significant contribution.
- Both exact and approximate algorithms are shown to be efficient.
- Extensive experiments are conducted, with a fair comparison of methods implemented in C++.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to read and contains several mistakes.
- There are concerns regarding the validity of the results.
- The authors do not adequately address related works on fastest paths and existing definitions of betweenness centrality in temporal graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by adopting a more discursive style to help readers understand the concepts better. Additionally, addressing the related works on fastest paths is crucial. The authors should clarify the notation in definitions, particularly in line 344 and definition 6, and ensure that the proof of lemma 2 is comprehensible. Improving the quality of Figure 1 and adding parallel edges would enhance the illustrative examples. Furthermore, we suggest providing counterexamples for the statement regarding optimal temporal paths and considering the use of spacing instead of commas in tables to avoid confusion. Lastly, addressing the error reported for "OTBC" in Table 4 is necessary for accuracy.
