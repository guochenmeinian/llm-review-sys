Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The authors present AllSim, a simulation tool for online organ allocation, highlighting its versatility for various resource allocation policies. The framework allows for data-driven simulations and supports modular environment configurations for stress testing and sensitivity analysis, addressing challenges in resource allocation evaluation, particularly in non-steady-state environments. They propose a simplified API design to enhance usability and encourage wider adoption, acknowledging the potential of online learning within AllSim and extending the API to include a `Policy.feedback` function. The authors emphasize the importance of open-sourcing their complete codebase and providing comprehensive examples and documentation to facilitate adoption.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear visualizations.
2. AllSim provides a standardized evaluation framework for resource allocation policies, promoting research in this impactful domain.
3. The parameterized modeling of user and resource arrival processes is reasonable and adaptable to various scenarios.
4. The authors have effectively addressed key concerns regarding API design and online learning capabilities, demonstrating a commitment to improving user experience.
5. Their proactive approach to open-sourcing and documentation is commendable.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The authors overstate their contributions, which should focus on the organ allocation simulator.
2. The paper lacks a thorough literature review and fails to address common online allocation scenarios beyond organ allocation.
3. The appendix appears reused without modification, and the clarity of the API design is inconsistent.
4. The code repository is limited, including only the K-means clustering algorithm without baseline methods from operations research or reinforcement learning.
5. Some reviewers noted that not all suggested modifications were implemented, particularly regarding typographical errors and clarity in the paper, leading to reservations about the completeness of the revisions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. The authors should revise their contribution claims to accurately reflect the focus on the organ allocation simulator.
2. A comprehensive literature review is recommended, along with the inclusion of additional online allocation scenarios in the code repository to support their contributions.
3. The authors need to clarify the API design, possibly by adding visual diagrams and high-level wrappers for improved usability.
4. Incorporating relevance-based inference alongside counterfactual inference could enhance the framework's explanatory power.
5. The authors should consider creating a GitHub page for better community engagement and documentation, including more experimental analyses and access to code.
6. The authors should improve the clarity and detail of the paper by addressing all identified typos and errors to enhance overall readability.
7. The authors are encouraged to provide a clear comparison between the original and modified versions of the paper to facilitate reviewer feedback.
8. The authors should consider implementing a `load_dataset` feature in their API to streamline access to datasets, particularly those that are publicly available only upon request.
