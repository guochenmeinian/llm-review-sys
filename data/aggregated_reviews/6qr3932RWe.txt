Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a 3D Gaussian mapping framework that converts multitraverse videos into a 3D environment while segmenting 2D ephemeral objects. The authors propose a self-supervised approach that utilizes multitraverse data for unsupervised scene decomposition, demonstrating promising results in object segmentation, 3D reconstruction, and neural rendering. The method leverages repeated traversals to capture static background structures and dynamic foreground masks, contributing to applications in autonomous driving and 3D map construction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The self-supervised approach does not rely on object annotations, enhancing scalability.
- The innovative combination of multitraversal data and Gaussian Splatting effectively decomposes urban scenes into static and dynamic elements.

Weaknesses:
- The sequential nature of segmentation and GS mapping may propagate errors; multiple rounds of segmentation and mapping could improve robustness.
- The novelty is limited, as similar concepts have been explored in prior work like EmerNeRF.
- Comparisons with unsupervised segmentation methods lack benchmarks against object discovery methods, and comparisons with STEGO and CAUSE are deemed unfair due to their lack of multitraverse data.
- The evaluation of 3D reconstruction is insufficient, lacking comparisons with state-of-the-art multiview stereo approaches and relying on weaker metrics like Chamfer Distance.
- The complexity of the end-to-end process is not clearly explained, hindering replication efforts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the robustness of the method by incorporating multiple rounds of segmentation and GS mapping. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with object discovery methods and state-of-the-art urban scene reconstruction techniques to strengthen the evaluation. Clarifying the end-to-end process and providing more details on hyperparameter selection and training procedures would enhance the paper's clarity and replicability. Finally, addressing the assumptions regarding environmental stability and exploring the effects of illumination changes would improve the generalizability of the approach.
