### Key Points
This paper presents a generic evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) to assess human personalities using Myers–Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) tests. The authors propose a methodology that incorporates unbiased prompts, flexible queries, and three evaluation metrics—consistency, robustness, and fairness—to evaluate LLM performance. The findings indicate that ChatGPT and GPT-4 demonstrate fairer and more consistent assessments compared to InstructGPT. However, the paper acknowledges limitations in assessing specific individuals due to insufficient personal background knowledge.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel framework for personality assessment using LLMs, which could have significant implications in AI applications.
- The evaluation metrics are well-designed, addressing important aspects of bias, fairness, and robustness.
- The framework's clarity aids in understanding and disseminating the proposed method and findings.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's title may mislead readers, as it does not directly address individual personality assessments, focusing instead on group assessments.
- There is a lack of thorough exploration regarding the potential solutions for improving individual assessments, such as providing richer background information.
- The reliance on MBTI, which is not considered scientifically sound by some psychology researchers, raises concerns about the validity of the study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's title to better reflect its focus on group assessments rather than individual evaluations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct more experiments with other LLMs to demonstrate the generalization of their framework. It would be beneficial to explain why substituting instructions in section 3.3 avoids generating neutral opinions. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of using MBTI in their study and explore the implications of their findings in the context of psychological assessments. Lastly, we recommend adding the MBTI questions and sample answers in the Appendix for better transparency.
