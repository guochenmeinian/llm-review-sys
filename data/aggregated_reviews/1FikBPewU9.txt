Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a depth-range-free Multi-View Stereo (MVS) method that iteratively updates depth using a GRU-based approach, enhancing depth initialization and multi-frame information fusion through a Multi-view Disparity Attention module. The authors propose a novel framework that integrates 3D pose embedding and uncertainty estimation, demonstrating robust depth estimation across various datasets without relying on depth range priors. Furthermore, the authors address the issue of artifacts in point clouds resulting from depth fusion processes, explaining that these artifacts arise from 2D depth errors and inconsistencies across multi-view frames. They compare their approach with MVSFORMER++ and CER-MVS, highlighting the implications of using depth ground truth priors and the challenges of scaling methods across different datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method shows improved robustness to varying depth ranges compared to existing RNN-based methods, achieving promising results on multiple benchmarks.
- The motivation for the model design is clear, and the experimental results reflect the effectiveness of the model in depth estimation without depth priors.
- The authors provide a thorough explanation of the artifact generation process in depth fusion.
- The comparison with CER-MVS is comprehensive, detailing its methodology and performance metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology lacks clarity, with several unexplained symbols and terms in equations, leading to potential confusion for broader audiences. Specific issues include the lack of explanation for $\vec{f}$ in equations 3 and 4, and the initialization of $H_{di}$ in equation 8.
- Writing quality is poor, with inconsistent symbol usage and typographical errors, such as incorrect references and misindexed tables.
- The paper lacks sufficient ablation studies, particularly regarding the impact of uncertainty and disparity feature hidden states, and does not adequately compare with other relevant works like CER-MVS.
- Some concerns remain unresolved, leading to a borderline acceptance rating.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section by providing detailed explanations for all symbols and terms used in equations. Additionally, the authors should refine the writing quality throughout the paper, ensuring consistent symbol usage and correcting typographical errors. We suggest including more comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the effects of different components, such as the uncertainty and disparity feature hidden states, and to enhance the comparison with other relevant methods like CER-MVS. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address any remaining concerns raised by reviewers to elevate the paper's quality and potentially achieve a stronger acceptance rating. Finally, we recommend discussing the implications of their findings on generalization capabilities and performance gaps compared to state-of-the-art methods.
