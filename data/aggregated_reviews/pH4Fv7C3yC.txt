Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal identification in scenarios where the causal graph is probabilistically uncertain. The authors propose two main problems: identifying the most probable subgraph that allows for a desired causal query to be identifiable, and finding the subgraph with the highest aggregate probability over its edge-induced subgraphs that also makes the query identifiable. Both problems are shown to reduce to the NP-hard edge ID problem. The authors provide several exact and heuristic algorithms, evaluating their performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a complex causal inference problem, making a significant contribution to the field.
- A rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrates the NP-hardness of the edge ID problem, enhancing the paper's credibility.
- The proposed algorithms, particularly the heuristic ones, show remarkable performance across various metrics, indicating practical applicability.
- The empirical evaluation on real-world datasets provides valuable insights into the algorithms' performance.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of mutual independence among edges may not hold universally, potentially limiting the applicability of the results.
- The external validity of the derived subgraph is not guaranteed, which could affect its relevance in practical scenarios.
- The EDGEID algorithm exhibits large runtime variance and often times out on real-world structures, raising concerns about its consistency and utility.
- The runtimes for the MCIP variants exceed those of the HEID variants, which may hinder computational efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the assumption of mutual independence of edges, including potential strategies for validating the derived subgraphs in real-world scenarios. Additionally, we suggest providing more details on the specific scenarios where the heuristic algorithms are most effective and exploring cases where the independence assumption does not hold. Clarifying the implementation feasibility of the polynomial reduction in Proposition 4.2 and addressing the lack of worst-case complexity characterizations for the heuristic algorithms would also strengthen the paper. Lastly, enhancing the motivation for dropping edges from the full graph to achieve identifiability could provide a clearer justification for the proposed approach.
