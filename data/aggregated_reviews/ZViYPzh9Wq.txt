Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method, SRStitcher, that integrates the fusion and rectangling stages of the image stitching pipeline into a unified inpainting model using a pre-trained large-scale diffusion model. The approach aims to address error propagation issues in traditional pipelines by employing a progressive reverse process guided by weighted masks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the model's interpretability and generalization capabilities, showing improved performance in image quality and content consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for integrating multiple stages of image stitching into a single model is clear and promising.
2. The experimental results are extensive, providing both quantitative and qualitative evidence of SRStitcher's superiority over existing methods.
3. The use of a pre-trained model eliminates the need for additional training, simplifying the pipeline.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed contributions appear weak, as the integration of existing technologies does not introduce fundamentally new methodologies.
2. The multi-step design of the unified model raises questions about its practicality and effectiveness in addressing the reconstruction problem.
3. The method's reliance on a generation view may lead to artifacts, and the balance between generation and reconstruction remains unclear.
4. The inpainting results are not perfect, and the motivation behind the special fusion step is not adequately explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the fusion and rectangling components are integrated into a unified model, emphasizing the technical novelty of their approach. Additionally, we suggest providing more discussions on the balance between generation and reconstruction, particularly in relation to the potential introduction of artifacts. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed method against a single reverse process guided by a fixed mask to strengthen the argument for the progressive mask dilation approach. Finally, addressing the imperfections in inpainting results and clarifying the motivation for the fusion step would enhance the overall presentation of the work.
