### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of low-dimensional RNN architectures to understand human decision-making behaviors, emphasizing their practical effectiveness compared to traditional cognitive models. The authors propose a unifying framework for analyzing recurrent models and apply low-dimensional RNNs to interpret decisions and learning rates in a multi-arm bandit task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors standardize terminology and provide a broad comparison of low-dimensional RNN architectures, contributing significantly to the field.  
- The paper goes beyond mere model comparison by deducing insights that conventional cognitive models may overlook, particularly in identifying diverse decision-making strategies.  
- The unifying characterization of RNN architectures is helpful for readers unfamiliar with the topic.  
- The logit vs. delta-logit comparison offers an interpretable and mathematically grounded approach to understanding model learning rates and biases.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental setup raises concerns about its applicability to human decision analysis, as it assumes a singular large RNN can encapsulate all individual decision dynamics, which appears unrealistic.  
- The effectiveness of the teacher-student modeling regime is questionable, as it may not improve performance beyond what bootstrapping could achieve, limiting the interpretability of student models.  
- The simplicity of the bandit setting restricts the insights that can be gained about human decision-making, suggesting that more complex environments would yield richer interpretations.  
- The logit analysis's utility is limited to univariate settings, and extending it to multi-action scenarios with hidden states would enhance its impact.  
- The comparison of RNN architectures does not adequately relate to decision-making dynamics, as only the best-performing architecture is evaluated, neglecting a broader assessment across various tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design to better reflect the complexities of human decision processes, possibly by incorporating more diverse and realistic decision-making environments. Additionally, the authors should clarify the role of the teacher-student model and explore whether its performance enhancements are genuinely distinct from bootstrapping methods. Extending the logit analysis to multi-action settings would significantly increase its applicability. Finally, a more comprehensive evaluation of RNN architectures across various tasks would provide deeper insights into their alignment with human decision-making dynamics.
