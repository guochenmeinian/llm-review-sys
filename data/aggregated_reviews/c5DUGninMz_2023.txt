Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset called Reasoning Intention-Oriented Objects (RIO), which includes over 130,000 intention-object pairs aimed at enhancing intention-oriented object detection and segmentation. The dataset features intention descriptions in natural sentences and is evaluated using state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods in open environments. The authors propose a nuanced exploration of intention-oriented object detection, distinguishing between task-driven and intention-oriented approaches, and emphasize the importance of integrating detection and reasoning to enhance task effectiveness. They address performance drops in uncommon object categories, attributing these to imbalanced data rather than scarcity. The authors provide a detailed account of the data collection process, leveraging ChatGPT for annotation, and establish several baselines for experimental evaluation. They also correct missing references and commit to updating their open-source resources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated and clearly articulates the need for intention-oriented object detection/segmentation.
- It offers a comprehensive dataset with a large number of affordances and natural language annotations.
- The authors effectively clarify the distinction between task-driven and intention-oriented object detection.
- They provide a thoughtful analysis of performance issues related to uncommon object categories.
- Corrections to missing references and commitments to open-source updates demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback.
- The authors provide a thorough description of the data collection process and implement multiple baselines for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The distinction between intention-oriented object detection and task-driven object detection is not sufficiently clear in all contexts.
- There is a noticeable performance drop for uncommon sets, and the authors do not adequately address potential reasons for this.
- The analysis of Figure 5 raises questions about the relevance of verb-noun relationships, as some verbs appear unrelated to the nouns.
- Task ambiguity persists, particularly in scenarios where multiple objects could fulfill the same intention, leading to potential mislabeling.
- Tense errors remain in the paper, affecting clarity and professionalism.
- The paper lacks references for certain statements, such as “As indicated in Table ??”.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between intention-oriented object detection and task-driven object detection, particularly addressing the classification of task-driven object detection as a closed set. Additionally, the authors should provide insights into the performance drop observed for uncommon sets and discuss potential strategies to mitigate this issue. We suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the analysis surrounding Figure 5 by explicitly addressing the relevance of verb-noun relationships and their implications for intention detection. Furthermore, we urge the authors to refine their approach to task ambiguity by considering all relevant objects in a scene, rather than limiting themselves to COCO categories, to enhance the accuracy of their object selection process. It would also be beneficial to include a reference for the missing statement at the end of page 8. Lastly, we recommend that the authors thoroughly review the manuscript for tense consistency to ensure a polished presentation and provide more detailed information regarding the human annotation process, including the number of annotators involved and their remuneration, to ensure reproducibility and transparency.
