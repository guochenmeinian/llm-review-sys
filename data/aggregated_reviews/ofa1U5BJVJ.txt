Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a computationally efficient algorithm for multinomial logistic bandits (MLogB), specifically the OFU-MLogB algorithm, which improves both regret bounds and computational costs. The authors utilize online mirror descent and a novel optimistic reward construction, achieving a constant computational cost of $O(1)$ per round and optimal regret bounds of $O(K\sqrt{T})$, independent of the parameter $\kappa$. The paper also discusses the trade-off between statistical efficiency and computational efficiency, with plans to expand this discussion in Section 3. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in computational efficiency, although the reduction in regret appears less pronounced. The authors propose reorganizing the experimental section to compare fixed arm sets using different random seeds over a longer time horizon.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The contributions are clearly articulated and significant, particularly the reduction of computational cost to $O(1)$ per round and improved regret bounds of $O(K\sqrt{T})$.  
- The paper is well-researched and structured, with a clear motivation for the OFU-MLogB algorithm and sound theoretical analyses.  
- The paper addresses important aspects of statistical and computational efficiency, indicating a thoughtful approach to the topic.  
- Empirical results support the claims of improved computational efficiency and performance compared to existing algorithms.  
- The planned reorganization of the experimental section is likely to enhance clarity and rigor.

Weaknesses:  
- The discussion on potential trade-offs between computational efficiency and estimator accuracy is lacking.  
- The current version lacks a detailed discussion on the trade-off between statistical and computational efficiency, which is crucial for understanding the implications of the findings.  
- The experimental validation of regret reduction is insufficient; more extensive experiments are needed to substantiate the claims.  
- Certain aspects of the writing, such as the clarity of the algorithm's initialization and the statistical significance of experimental results, require further detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on potential trade-offs between computational efficiency and the accuracy of the estimator, particularly addressing the questions raised regarding the relationship between regret and computational cost. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive discussion on the trade-off between statistical efficiency and computational efficiency in Section 3. We also recommend conducting more extensive experiments to validate the improvement in regret reduction and reorganizing the experimental section to clearly present comparisons using fixed arm sets with different random seeds over a longer time horizon. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to clarify the initialization process of the algorithm in Theorem 2 and enhance the clarity of the experimental design and results, ensuring that the statistical significance of the findings is adequately discussed.
