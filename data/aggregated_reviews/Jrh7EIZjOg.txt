### Key Points
This paper presents a novel forgetting strategy for computing uniform interpolants of ontologies, specifically within ELI Description Logic. The method employs normalization and inference rules, demonstrating good empirical performance compared to existing tools like Lethe. The authors provide a thorough evaluation using various ontologies, indicating that their approach significantly outperforms the baseline in cases of acyclic ELI ontologies. The work is well-motivated, relevant to the Semantic and Knowledge track of WWW, and contributes valuable insights into ontology modularization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The proposed approach is efficient in practice despite high theoretical complexity.
2) The empirical evaluation shows significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

Weaknesses:
1) The relevance of the work to the Web is not clearly articulated.
2) Certain aspects of the methodology and choices made in the paper lack clarity, including the exclusion of specific competitors in experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by explicitly stating the relationship between Lethe and Fame, supported by appropriate references. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the significance of results, particularly regarding the applicability of the method beyond ELI ontologies. The authors should also provide examples in Sections 2 and 3 to enhance readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the design of the normalization forms and explain the exclusion of definers in Section 4. Lastly, a valid URL for supplementary materials and proofs should be provided, as the current link leads to a 404 error.
