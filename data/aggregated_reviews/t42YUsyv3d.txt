### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named DRAFT for few-shot topic classification, utilizing a dense retriever model to construct a customized dataset through a multi-query retrieval (MQR) algorithm. The authors claim that DRAFT outperforms large language models (LLMs) in this task. Extensive experiments on both benchmark and manually constructed datasets demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a significant problem in topic classification with limited labeled data.
2. It provides clear and detailed explanations of the model design, experimental setup, and results.
3. The experimental results indicate that DRAFT achieves higher performance than in-context large language models.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is limited, as it resembles existing retrieval-augmented methods without sufficient differentiation.
2. The paper lacks comparisons with other few-shot text classification methods and established techniques in the field.
3. The cohesion and fluency of the writing could be improved, with some confusing terminology present.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's cohesion by enhancing the flow between paragraphs and clarifying confusing terms such as "positive samples" and "negative queries." Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with existing few-shot text classification methods to highlight the unique contributions of DRAFT. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of the necessity of the MQR algorithm over direct dataset construction methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider a broader range of baselines beyond LLMs for comparison and to include a case study or visualization to elucidate the advantages of using a dense retriever model.
