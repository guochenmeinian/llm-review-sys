Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an anomaly repair technique that focuses on transforming anomalous data into benign forms by leveraging four proposed properties. The authors conduct evaluations on the VisA and SWaT datasets, demonstrating the method's effectiveness in repairing anomaly data. The approach aims to address the limitations of traditional anomaly detection by producing normal representations from anomalies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The motivation for repairing anomalies is clearly articulated, enhancing anomaly explanation.  
- The four guiding properties for the repair process are well-conceived.  
- The proposed metrics are reasonable, and the method shows significant improvements over baseline models.  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with robust experimental evaluations supporting its claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on outdated anomaly detection methods, such as Fastflow and GPT2, necessitates further investigation into their influence on the repair process.  
- The scope of datasets is limited; additional datasets like MVTec AD should be included for a more comprehensive evaluation.  
- The relationship between Property 1 and Properties 3 and 4 is unclear, suggesting that only Properties 2, 3, and 4 may be necessary.  
- The quality of figures, particularly Figure 3, requires improvement.  
- The fourth metric \(M_{1-w}\) raises questions about whether it should be the absolute value, as it may encourage lower anomaly scores for normal regions.  
- Section 3.3 lacks clarity and should be expanded to elaborate on the generation process and include proper references.  
- The method's assumption of an available anomaly map may not be practical for real-world applications, where only individual anomaly data points are typically available.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.3 by elaborating on the generation process and adding relevant references. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of datasets, such as MVTec AD, to enhance the evaluation. The authors should also clarify the relationship between Properties 1, 3, and 4, potentially simplifying the framework. Improving the quality of figures, especially Figure 3, is essential. Furthermore, the authors should address the implications of using an anomaly map in real-world scenarios and discuss the limitations of their approach, particularly regarding the potential misuse of the method to evade anomaly detection.
