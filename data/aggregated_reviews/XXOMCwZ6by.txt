Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Optimus-1, a retrieval augmented generation method designed to enhance Minecraft agents' performance in long-horizon tasks. The authors propose a Hybrid Multimodal Memory Module, which includes an Abstracted Multimodal Experience Pool (AMEP) and a Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph (HDKG), to address challenges related to insufficient structured knowledge and multimodal experience. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that this memory module significantly improves the agent's performance in long-horizon planning tasks, achieving an 86.7% success rate in app navigation tasks. The authors claim that their method outperforms existing models, such as AppAgent and GPT-4, and they emphasize the need for clearer organization and simplification of technical terminology in the manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant problem, transforming large language models (LLMs) into autonomous decision-making agents.
- The proposed method achieves notable improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches in Minecraft, particularly in long-horizon tasks.
- The introduction of a multimodal memory mechanism, including a hierarchical knowledge graph and experience pool, is innovative and well-supported by experimental results.
- The experimental results indicate that Optimus-1 significantly outperforms baseline models, enhancing the agent's capabilities through effective combination of structured knowledge and multimodal experiences.
- The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, committing to revisions that improve clarity and organization.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in the method section, which should adopt a top-down organization and simplify terminology.
- Major claims in the introduction lack empirical support, particularly regarding the structured knowledge of existing agents.
- The application of the Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph appears limited to Minecraft, raising questions about its generalizability.
- Performance evaluations are based on custom benchmarks, and results on established benchmarks like Voyager and Jarvis are absent.
- The construction procedure of the AMEP and the acquisition of world knowledge through free exploration are inadequately detailed.
- The technical descriptions in the manuscript are convoluted and require better organization for clarity.
- Some terminologies are complex and may hinder reader comprehension, necessitating simplification.
- There is a lack of detailed explanations regarding the automatic plan acquisition process, which could affect replicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the method section, adopting a top-down approach to present high-level ideas before delving into specifics. Simplifying complex terminology, such as "Hybrid Multimodal Memory Module," would enhance reader comprehension. Additionally, we urge the authors to provide empirical evidence supporting their claims regarding the structured knowledge of existing agents and to clarify the limitations of the Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph's applicability beyond Minecraft. Including evaluations on established benchmarks would strengthen the paper's contributions. We also suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the automatic plan acquisition step, including the required inputs and outputs for each component. Lastly, including comparisons with existing models, such as Voyager-1, and expanding discussions on the implications of the proposed method in future revisions would enhance the paper's rigor and relevance.
