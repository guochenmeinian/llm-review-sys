Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two novel Fractional Graph Laplacian (FGL)-based neural Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs): the fractional heat equation and the fractional Schr√∂dinger equation. These solutions enhance the flexibility in the convergence of Dirichlet energy and allow the exponent of the fractional graph Laplacian to be a learnable parameter, enabling adaptive optimization for specific tasks and graphs. The authors extend the concept of Dirichlet energy to directed graphs and provide empirical results on nine benchmarks for node classification, although the benefits of using fractional graph Laplacians appear limited. Additionally, the paper addresses the phenomenon of oversmoothing in graph neural networks (GNNs), defining oversmoothness as the exponential decay of Dirichlet Energy towards the minimum eigenvalue, $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}$. The authors argue that if node features do not converge to $\lambda_{\mathrm{min}}$, oversmoothing is mitigated, claiming their model retains high Dirichlet Energy, making it suitable for heterophilic graphs. However, the theoretical underpinnings and experimental validations of these claims have raised concerns among reviewers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed FGL Neural ODE can be $\lambda-FD$, extending the capabilities of Neural ODE-based GNNs beyond LFD or HFD.
2. The paper effectively generalizes oversmoothing concepts from undirected to directed graphs.
3. The framework (FLODE) is well-structured and easy to follow, demonstrating flexibility for both directed and undirected graphs.
4. The paper addresses a significant limitation in GNNs, specifically the phenomenon of oversmoothing.
5. The authors provide a mathematical framework to analyze oversmoothing using Dirichlet Energy.
6. They demonstrate that their model can mitigate oversmoothing in directed graphs.

Weaknesses:
1. The application of the fractional graph Laplacian operator compromises the graph's sparse property, resulting in a dense graph.
2. Insufficient evidence supports the claim that the fractional graph Laplacian mitigates oversmoothing in GNNs, particularly given that oversmoothness can still occur even with invariant node features.
3. Theorems presented are limited in applicability; significant results only pertain to undirected graphs, and the benefits of FGL for directed graphs remain unclear.
4. The authors introduce definitions, such as the Dirichlet energy for directed graphs, without adequate justification, and the experimental results do not sufficiently validate these definitions.
5. The experimental results are weak, with the proposed method performing comparably to existing methods in only a few cases, and lacking consideration of state-of-the-art results on relevant datasets.
6. The use of complex numbers in the model requires robust justification, as their necessity for addressing oversmoothness is not convincingly demonstrated.
7. The definition of oversmoothness and its relation to Dirichlet Energy has been criticized as potentially misleading.
8. The reliance on small datasets and singular value decomposition limits the generalizability of the findings.
9. The paper lacks comparisons with other oversmoothness ODE models, making it difficult to assess its contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of the Dirichlet energy definition and provide a clearer rationale for the use of complex numbers in the model. Additionally, the authors should strengthen the empirical evidence supporting the claim that the fractional graph Laplacian alleviates oversmoothing, particularly through more comprehensive experiments and comparisons with state-of-the-art methods. It would be beneficial to include ablation studies and results on larger datasets to validate the proposed model's effectiveness. Furthermore, clarifying the applicability of theorems to directed graphs and addressing the limitations of the proposed method in large-scale scenarios would enhance the paper's contributions. We also suggest improving the clarity and robustness of Definition 5.1, ensuring it accurately reflects the relationship between Dirichlet Energy and oversmoothness. Expanding the experimental scope to include larger datasets and comparisons with other oversmoothness mitigation models would be advantageous. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a survey of existing ODE-based models that mitigate oversmoothing in the revised version of the paper.
