Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the challenge of erasing undesirable concepts from stable diffusion models while minimizing the impact on other concepts. The authors propose a novel approach that identifies and preserves adversarial concepts, which are sensitive to changes during the erasure process. They conduct empirical investigations using the Stable Diffusion model, demonstrating the method's potential to erase target concepts effectively while maintaining the integrity of non-target concepts. Additionally, the authors present an adaptive strategy that examines the impact of erasing a target concept on other concepts, providing experimental results that compare different fine-tuning strategies for the ESD method. The findings indicate that fine-tuning non-cross-attention modules yields better erasure performance than cross-attention modules.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and provides clear explanations of the proposed method and its theoretical foundations.
- The focus on adversarial concepts represents a significant contribution to the field, with well-selected experiments showcasing the method's reliability.
- The authors systematically summarize the memory-forgetting tradeoff, enhancing the understanding of the problem.
- The paper introduces a novel approach to concept erasure, emphasizing the preservation of non-sensitive elements.
- Experimental results support the efficacy of the proposed method, particularly in fine-tuning strategies.
- The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, indicating a commitment to improving the paper.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical results do not fully align with the authors' claims regarding minimal impact on other concepts, particularly in the comparison of ESR scores and standard deviations.
- The motivation for preserving all related concepts is unclear, and the paper lacks a boundary discussion between preserved and erased concepts.
- There is insufficient comparison with state-of-the-art methods, such as MACE and SPM, and additional metrics like FID and CLIP Score are needed to evaluate performance comprehensively.
- Limitations of the CLIP score are not adequately discussed.
- Generated samples are not included in the main paper due to page constraints, which may limit the evaluation of results.
- The method's granularity could be enhanced by exploring multiple affected concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the empirical results by providing a more detailed discussion and analysis, especially regarding the discrepancies in ESR scores. Additionally, the authors should clarify the selection process for the set of adversarial concepts and consider including comparisons with the latest methods like MACE. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the rationale for fine-tuning only non-cross-attention modules and to include results that support this decision. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the discussion on the limitations of using the CLIP alignment score in the revised version. Please include the results of erasing the "nudity" concept in the main paper and reference the specific figure. We also recommend enhancing the expressiveness of textual descriptions to better distinguish closely related concepts and exploring multiple affected concepts to provide a more comprehensive perspective on the impact of erasure. Lastly, consider including generated samples or a clear reference to the appendix in the revised version to strengthen the evaluation.
