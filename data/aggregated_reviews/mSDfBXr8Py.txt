Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called Few-Shot Weakly Supervised Learning for Pathology Whole Slide Image classification (FSWC), which aims to classify bags and instances within a WSI using a limited number of labeled bags. The authors propose a Two-level Prompt Learning Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) framework, named TOP, leveraging GPT-4 and prompt learning to enhance classification. The method utilizes CLIP for feature extraction and employs a prompt-guided pooling strategy to aggregate instance features into bag features. Evaluations on three pathology datasets demonstrate notable performance improvements in bag and instance classification. Additionally, the authors provide a comprehensive evaluation of their method for few-shot learning in cancer subtyping, utilizing instance-level and bag-level prompt groups. Numerical comparisons against existing methods, including MI-Zero, show that their approach significantly enhances performance, particularly in few-shot scenarios, achieving superior accuracy in 4-shot and 1-shot settings compared to traditional zero-shot methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of applying large language and cross-modal models to WSI analysis is innovative and addresses a relevant problem in histopathology.
- The prompt-guided pooling approach is intuitive and effectively grounds instance-level weights using natural language embeddings.
- The authors effectively demonstrate the performance improvements of their method through detailed numerical comparisons across various settings, highlighting its practical applicability in clinical environments.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation and clarity of technical details are inadequate, with many aspects poorly explained.
- The experiments lack depth, with insufficient comparisons to state-of-the-art methods and potential biases in performance reporting.
- The novelty of the contributions is limited, as the approach closely follows established techniques without significant differentiation from existing methods.
- The reviewers express concerns regarding the completeness of the work, indicating that further experiments and validations are necessary to fully establish the method's efficacy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology, particularly how the guided pooling operates. Additionally, the authors should conduct more comprehensive comparative experiments, including additional state-of-the-art methods and ablation studies on the use of pathology-specific LLMs. It is crucial to standardize the evaluation methodology to avoid biases in performance reporting, such as using the median instead of the maximum for comparisons. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the robustness of their findings by conducting additional experiments, particularly focusing on the integration of their method with MI-Zero to explore potential synergies. The authors should also provide a more thorough discussion of the limitations of zero-shot transfer in their context, as well as a clearer articulation of the implications of their findings for clinical practice. Lastly, we suggest that the authors proofread the manuscript to enhance the quality of writing and presentation.
