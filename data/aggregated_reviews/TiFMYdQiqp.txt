Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for minimizing off-target optogenetic stimulation using Gaussian Process modeling. The authors propose a Bayesian computational approach that optimizes laser intensity and target locations to selectively stimulate specific neurons while reducing unintended activation of nearby cells. The method employs approximate GP inference and a gradient-based optimization technique to refine stimulation patterns, validated through simulations and real optogenetic experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Careful modeling of experimental features.
- Use of a scalable Gaussian Process approach.
- Clear exposition and originality in addressing off-target stimulation.

Weaknesses:
- Inference algorithms are closely tied to specific modeling choices, limiting broader applicability.
- Limited experimental validation; real data usage is unclear.
- Lack of consideration for how the ORF may change with sustained stimulation and potential trade-offs in optimization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how real data was utilized in the analysis, particularly in Section 4.2. Additionally, the authors should address the justification for linear summation of activation from closely spaced stimulation sites. It would be beneficial to explore the limitations and trade-offs of the method more thoroughly, particularly regarding the sensitivity of the OTS-minimized stimulation protocol to sample motion and changes in neuron sensitivity. Lastly, we suggest providing more detailed time requirements for the current method and exploring the integration of spatial information from calcium imaging into the ORF prior to enhance optimization efficiency.
