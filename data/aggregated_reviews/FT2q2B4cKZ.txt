Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel variant of the sliced Wasserstein (SW) distance, termed Markovian Sliced Wasserstein (MSW), which utilizes a Markov chain for selecting projection directions to address issues of redundancy and loss of metricity found in existing SW variants. The authors propose two Markov chain designs: one that selects orthogonal projection vectors and another that employs projected gradient ascent on the projected Wasserstein distance. Theoretical contributions include proving the metricity of MSW, establishing weak convergence, and deriving sample complexity bounds. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the performance of MSW across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a novel approach to selecting projection directions using Markov chains, contributing a fresh perspective to the field.
- The theoretical analysis is thorough, covering essential aspects such as metricity, sample complexity, and Monte Carlo approximation error.
- Empirical results indicate the effectiveness of MSW compared to other SW variants.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments do not convincingly demonstrate the superiority of MSW, as results in Table 2 show overlapping scores with no significant differences.
- The motivation for the 'burning and thinning' processes is insufficiently explained, lacking references and clear advantages beyond reduced computational complexity.
- The proof of Proposition 2 raises concerns regarding rigor, particularly the treatment of the term $\log(8/\delta)$.
- Some experimental results, such as those in Table 2, do not provide clear insights due to high overlap in scores.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and motivation of the 'burning and thinning' processes by providing relevant references and discussing key advantages in the main body. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the concerns regarding the proof of Proposition 2 by providing more detailed explanations. To enhance the empirical evaluation, we encourage the authors to conduct further experiments that compare MSW with Distributional SW and to clarify the reasons behind the performance of MSW relative to Max-SW. Lastly, we advise increasing the size of figure legends for better readability.
