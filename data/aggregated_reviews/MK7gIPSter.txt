### Key Points
This paper presents LaMPSite, a novel method for predicting protein binding site residues in protein-ligand complexes without relying on 3D protein structural inputs. The authors leverage sequence and structural knowledge from protein language models (PLMs) like ESM2. The experimental results indicate that ESM2's embeddings, combined with GNN and RDKit-based ligand graph embeddings, achieve competitive performance compared to baseline methods requiring 3D structures. Additionally, the authors find that incorporating ground-truth protein distance maps enhances prediction performance only to a limited extent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors' experiments are well-motivated, thorough, and organized, making their reasoning easy to follow. The inclusion of ablation studies is commendable.
- The approach of predicting binding sites without structural inputs is innovative and opens avenues for new methodologies in binding site prediction.

Weaknesses:
- LaMPSite appears to underutilize the initial 3D structures of RDKit conformers for input ligands. The use of a standard GNN for ligand embeddings could be improved by exploring an equivariant GNN architecture to learn both molecular graph embeddings and equivariant features from RDKit 3D conformer inputs.
- The details on clustering and ranking within LaMPSite's computational pipeline are insufficient, making it challenging for readers to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the clustering algorithms in the context of binding site prediction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve LaMPSite by (1) incorporating equivariant methods for learning ligand embeddings, (2) enhancing the clustering and ranking algorithms, and (3) integrating ESMFold-predicted (apo) protein structures into LaMPSite in a meaningful and equivariant manner. Additionally, the authors should discuss and compare their method with existing PLM-based binding site predictors and demonstrate the ability to discriminate binding pockets on the same protein based on the ligand.
