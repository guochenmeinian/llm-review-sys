### Key Points
This paper presents an attention-based method for generating embeddings from both ROI-based functional connectivity and voxel-wise activity in neuroimaging data. It addresses a gap in the literature regarding architectures that integrate voxel- and ROI-level information. The authors provide a well-structured context within the broader literature, demonstrating systematic performance improvements across various datasets and tasks, supported by a useful ablation analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work targets an underexplored area in neuroimaging literature.  
- The presentation of information is clear and contextualized.  
- Results indicate systematic better performance across multiple datasets and tasks.  
- The inclusion of an ablation analysis enhances understanding of component contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
- Key aspects, such as ROI definitions and their impact on results, are unclear.  
- The distinction between voxel connections and correlation matrices is ambiguous.  
- The exclusive use of accuracy as a performance metric may misrepresent results.  
- The manuscript lacks clarity on architectural complexity and hyperparameter search implications.  
- The introduction inadequately contextualizes related works, which should be included in baseline comparisons.  
- There are typographical errors, such as "minuetes" instead of "minutes."  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding how ROIs are defined and their influence on results. Please clarify the connections between voxels and the correlation matrix, as well as the meaning of "patch extraction." We suggest providing justification for using only accuracy as a metric or including additional metrics in the results table. Additionally, please include details on architectural complexity, such as the number of parameters and training times. It would be beneficial to contextualize the related works more thoroughly in the introduction and ensure the appendix is included to provide necessary details on datasets and preprocessing. Lastly, please correct the typographical error noted in line 182.
