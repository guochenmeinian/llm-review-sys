Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for multi-intent detection in dialogue systems, termed Multi-Intent Detection through Supervised Prototypical Contrastive Learning (PCMID). The authors argue that previous methods inadequately address the complexity of intent label embeddings, proposing that PCMID utilizes a single BERT encoder to optimize the semantic representation of utterances and intent labels. The framework reportedly achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple datasets, including MixATIS, MixSNIPS, and FSPS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- PCMID demonstrates superior performance compared to existing approaches.
- The paper is well-structured, easy to read, and provides clear experimental settings and analyses.
- It addresses a relevant and important problem in the dialogue systems community.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution appears incremental and heavily reliant on the initialized base encoder, with BERT's limitations in producing effective sentence embeddings noted.
- There is insufficient comparison with more recent models, and the novelty of the approach is questioned.
- Key details, such as hyper-parameter values and specific formula explanations, are lacking.
- The paper contains redundancies and minor typographical errors, affecting clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by incorporating comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art models. Additionally, please provide more detailed explanations of the formulas used, including $\ell_{BCE}$, and specify hyper-parameter values, such as Ï„. To enhance clarity, consider including a dataflow diagram with examples and addressing the processing of slots in the context of intent detection. Lastly, we suggest revising the paper for typographical consistency and ensuring that figures are clear and legible.
