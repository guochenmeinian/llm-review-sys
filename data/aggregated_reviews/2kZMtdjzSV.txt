Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of multi-task linear bandits, assuming task parameters reside in a low-rank subspace. The authors propose a new algorithm that reduces regret under mild assumptions about task parameters and well-conditioned ellipsoids. The algorithm operates on a bi-level structure, employing meta-exploration and meta-exploitation strategies. Empirical results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness in synthetic adversarial settings. The paper also addresses lifelong learning in linear bandits, providing a two-level algorithm with a regret upper bound without requiring task diversity assumptions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed algorithm achieves low regret without strong assumptions on task parameters, addressing a more challenging sequential setting.  
- The theoretical framework is well-formulated, and the algorithm is clearly described.  
- The paper is well-written, presenting original ideas and a weaker assumption on the action set compared to related works.  

Weaknesses:  
- The algorithm relies on prior knowledge of parameters such as task number, dimension, and rounds, which is not ideal.  
- The novelty of the algorithm is questioned due to similarities with existing works, including PEGE and analyses by Yang et al.  
- Some theoretical statements appear incorrect, and the upper bound lacks tightness.  
- The EWA algorithm is referenced but not adequately detailed in the paper.  
- The presentation of the meta-learning process could be clearer, and additional baselines in experiments would enhance the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the meta-learning presentation by moving definitions to the main text. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of the EWA algorithm within the paper rather than merely referencing it. The authors should also address the assumptions regarding prior knowledge of parameters, particularly the necessity of the $\tau$ parameter, and explore whether these can be relaxed. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a comparison with additional baselines in their experiments and to clarify the impact of the task diversity assumption through simulated environments. Lastly, addressing the gaps in the theoretical upper bounds compared to known lower bounds would strengthen the contribution.
