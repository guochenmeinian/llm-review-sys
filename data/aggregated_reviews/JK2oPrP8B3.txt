### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for dictionary learning by minimizing the determinant of the dictionary matrix, subject to the constraint that each row of the sparse coefficient matrix has unit $\ell_1$ norm. The authors provide global identifiability guarantees for the ground truth dictionary and sparse coefficient matrices under certain conditions. An algorithm based on linearized-ADMM is developed for complete dictionary recovery, accompanied by a probabilistic analysis for the Bernoulli-Gaussian model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The theoretical results are impressive, establishing global identifiability without requiring incoherence conditions.  
- The formulation utilizing the determinant is a unique contribution to the dictionary learning literature.  
- The introduction of an algorithm based on linearized-ADMM demonstrates a practical approach to solving the proposed formulation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The identifiability condition relies on global minimizers of the optimization problem, yet the algorithm does not guarantee convergence to these minimizers, raising concerns about practical applicability.  
- The paper lacks empirical comparisons with existing dictionary learning methods, which would clarify the significance of the proposed approach.  
- The main example, the Bernoulli-Gaussian model, is already covered in previous works, limiting the novelty of the contributions.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical section by including comparisons with previous methods to demonstrate the advantages of their approach. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide more concrete examples beyond the Bernoulli-Gaussian setting that highlight the new framework's capabilities. Clarifying the equivalence between the different optimization problems and discussing the relationship between the 'sufficiently scattered' condition and incoherence conditions would enhance the theoretical clarity. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the algorithm's ability to find global minimizers would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
