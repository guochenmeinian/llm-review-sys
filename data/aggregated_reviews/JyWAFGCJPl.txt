Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel User Sequence Imagination (USIM) framework designed to address the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) recommendation problem, particularly relevant in short video platforms where new content is rapidly generated. The authors propose that existing models, such as generative and dropout approaches, fail to effectively bridge the gap between in-vocabulary (IV) and OOV items due to the absence of user sequences for OOV items. USIM imagines user sequences for OOV items, optimizing their embeddings through a reinforcement learning (RL) approach framed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a recommendation-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization (RecPPO) method. The paper claims successful implementation of USIM on commercial platforms, demonstrating its potential to enhance OOV item recommendations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The USIM framework introduces a new paradigm for solving the OOV problem by imagining user sequences, which is a significant advancement over traditional methods.
2. The formulation of the user sequence imagination process as an MDP, along with the introduction of a State Transition Function, reflects a sophisticated understanding of recommendation system dynamics.
3. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of USIM, showcasing superior performance in cold-start scenarios across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition and implementation details of RecPPO are insufficiently explained, which may hinder reader comprehension.
2. Figure 2 lacks clarity and could be improved to better illustrate the USIM process.
3. There is a need for more detailed discussion regarding the industrial deployment of USIM, including specific results and challenges faced.
4. The experimental scope is limited, with insufficient scale and diversity in datasets, making it difficult to assess USIM's performance comprehensively.
5. The writing quality is inconsistent, with some statements lacking empirical support or clear definitions, which complicates understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 2 to enhance the presentation of the USIM process. Additionally, providing a more detailed explanation of RecPPO in Section 3.3.2 would help readers grasp its significance within the framework. We suggest including insights into the industrial implementation of USIM, such as challenges and specific results from A/B testing, to strengthen the practical relevance of the research. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include larger and more diverse datasets would also provide a clearer picture of USIM's performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the writing for better coherence and clarity, ensuring that all technical terms and claims are well-supported by evidence.
