Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a cross-correlation autoencoder, named GraphCroc, aimed at addressing the limitations of existing graph autoencoders (GAE) that rely on self-correlation for graph structure representation. The authors analyze the shortcomings of current methods in representing complex structures such as islands, symmetrical structures, and directional edges. The proposed model enhances representational capabilities through a mirrored encoding-decoding process and a loss-balancing strategy to mitigate representation bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the cross-correlation autoencoder is clear and reasonable.
2. The writing is clear and easy to follow.
3. The experimental results are comprehensive and demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in structural reconstruction and graph classification tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper presents overall experimental performance without detailing how the cross-correlation autoencoder performs on specific graph structures, despite claiming existing methods fail in this regard.
2. It is unclear whether the graph dataset used is directed or undirected, which is crucial since the cross-correlation autoencoder is effective for directed graphs.
3. The paper lacks discussion on related works addressing graph autoencoder structure recovery, such as position encoding or additional node labels, and how GraphCroc compares in effectiveness and efficiency.
4. There is a concern regarding the potential convergence of the two latent embeddings generated by the proposed method, as it is unclear if techniques exist to ensure their differentiation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset characteristics, specifying whether it is directed or undirected. Additionally, we suggest including more diverse architectures for the encoder and decoder to further validate the cross-correlation mechanism. It would also be beneficial to incorporate a discussion of related works in the final version, particularly those addressing similar challenges in graph autoencoders. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more results in reconstruction visualization, especially for island or directed edge reconstruction, to strengthen their claims.
