### Key Points
This paper presents STKOpt, an automated framework for spatio-temporal traffic prediction that optimizes spatio-temporal knowledge to enhance downstream model performance. STKOpt utilizes a meta-learner and a multi-fidelity optimization strategy to efficiently explore a defined search space of parameters, addressing resource constraints. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets validate the framework's effectiveness and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a pioneering framework for automatically discovering optimal spatio-temporal knowledge, addressing a critical gap in traffic prediction.
2. It employs innovative techniques such as multi-fidelity optimization and meta-learning, which balance efficiency and performance.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across diverse datasets, supporting its practical implications for smart city applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The initialization process with $N_{min} + 2$ random configurations lacks clarity and requires further explanation.
2. The framework shows increased computational costs, particularly for complex downstream models, which may limit its applicability in resource-constrained environments.
3. The paper does not provide sufficient detail on the specific contributions of key components, such as the meta-learning module, nor does it include comparisons with more recent adaptive graph-based methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the initialization process and provide a more intuitive explanation of the spatio-temporal knowledge captured. Additionally, the authors should analyze the contributions of key components in greater depth and include comparisons with more representative baselines from recent years. To enhance understanding, we suggest providing a more detailed framework diagram and discussing the limitations of STKOpt, particularly regarding scalability and computational resource consumption. Lastly, the authors should clarify how the optimized spatio-temporal knowledge is represented and how it aligns during the optimization process.
