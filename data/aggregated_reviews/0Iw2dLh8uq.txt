Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the interdependence between the convergence of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) and the quality of policy initialization. The authors propose a meta-learning method to initialize the OOMD algorithm, demonstrating that initialization-dependent convergence guarantees can lead to faster convergence when the initialization is close. Theoretical results are established for various game types, including two-player zero-sum and Markov potential games, and numerical results support the advantages of meta-learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel algorithm with an initialization-dependent convergence guarantee.
- Extensive theoretical analysis is provided, particularly with Theorem 1 being a notable result.
- The authors effectively analyze two-player zero-sum and Markov potential games.
- The writing is clear, and prior work is well referenced.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical analysis is limited to small-scale games (2x2 matrix games), which may not adequately demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
- The task similarity metric raises concerns about promoting faster convergence in sequential learning, potentially oversimplifying the problem.
- Some theoretical results could benefit from further clarification and justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including larger and more diverse games, such as epsilon/noisy parameterizations of small poker games, to better validate their theoretical results. Additionally, we suggest providing more details in the main text regarding the size of the games used in simulations. Clarifying the choice of the task similarity metric and considering alternatives would also enhance the robustness of the proposed approach. Finally, including a sketch proof in the main text and expanding the limitations/future work section would provide greater depth to the discussion.
