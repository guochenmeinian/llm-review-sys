### Key Points
This paper presents a novel collection of datasets aimed at facilitating machine learning (ML) applications in algebraic combinatorics, introducing the Algebraic Combinatorics Dataset Repository (ACD Repo). The comprehensive suite includes nine datasets addressing both classic and open problems, interlinked with representation theory and algebraic geometry. The datasets encompass tasks such as predicting permutation properties and identifying patterns in combinatorial structures. The authors discuss baseline models, including logistic regression, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), and transformers, showcasing their performance across various tasks. The paper emphasizes the balance between mathematical rigor and accessibility, promoting interdisciplinary collaboration between the ML and mathematics communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive dataset collection covering diverse problems in algebraic combinatorics.
- Clear and concise task descriptions for each dataset, facilitating understanding for researchers.
- Baseline model performance results provided, serving as a reference for future research.
- Discussion of challenges in generating useful mathematics datasets raises awareness and inspires further exploration.

Weaknesses:
- Some datasets are relatively small, potentially limiting their usefulness for training and evaluating ML models.
- The datasets may lack diversity in tasks, not fully representing the range of problems of interest.
- No explicit evaluation metrics are provided for each task, complicating comparisons of different approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset size to enhance the training and evaluation of ML models, particularly for tasks with limited examples, such as the quivers dataset. Additionally, we suggest including explicit evaluation metrics for each task to facilitate better comparisons and assessments of various approaches. It would also be beneficial to explore whether ML could uncover interesting properties related to the open problems, as this could demonstrate the dataset's potential impact. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide examples of how ML has previously aided mathematicians in their research to contextualize the dataset's relevance.
