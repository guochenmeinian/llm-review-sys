Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new off-policy estimators for POMDPs that avoid exponential variance with the horizon by introducing two novel coverage assumptions: outcome coverage and belief coverage. These assumptions capture past and future information, leading to polynomial bounds on estimation guarantees. The authors propose the MIS algorithm to interpret sample complexity under these new conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis, making the proposed paradigm sound.
- The shift from exponential to polynomial guarantees is a significant improvement.
- The novel coverage assumptions effectively address non-trivial problems in the context of POMDPs.

Weaknesses:
- The new algorithm in Section 5.3 lacks thorough experimental validation.
- The paper is primarily targeted at a limited audience of theoreticians, making it less accessible to practitioners.
- There is insufficient discussion on the strictness of assumptions regarding the boundedness of FDVF and the implications of $C_\Xi$ in the sample guarantee.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing more intuitive explanations and motivations for their research questions and approaches. Additionally, we suggest conducting preliminary experiments to validate the empirical performance of the proposed estimators. It would also be beneficial to clarify the necessity of "future-dependence" in addressing partial observation and to discuss the advantages of the emphasized $L_2$ assumptions over looser $L_\infty$ assumptions.
