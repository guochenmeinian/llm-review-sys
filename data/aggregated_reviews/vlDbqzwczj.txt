Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two methods for multi-view clustering: SCMVC (Simple Consistent Multi-View Clustering) and SUMVC (Sufficient Multi-View Clustering). SCMVC employs a consistent variational lower bound to learn consistent information among views, while SUMVC extends the information bottleneck principle to minimize redundancy and enhance representation. The authors provide a theoretical analysis based on the Bayes error rate and evaluate their methods on four real-world multi-view datasets, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in multi-view clustering from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing novel lower bounds to tackle view redundancy and consistency.
- The theoretical analysis using the Bayes Error Rate supports the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
- Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the superior performance of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The objective function in Eq. (4) resembles that of VAE, and further clarification on its differences and the performance of SCMVC compared to VAE-based methods is needed.
- The optimization of the fusion representation $\vec{Z}$ in SCMVC versus its absence in SUMVC may negatively impact SUMVC's performance.
- The methods may not be suitable for datasets with high heterogeneity, and this limitation requires more detailed analysis.
- The introduction contains complex sentences that could be simplified for better clarity.
- A more comprehensive discussion of related multi-view methods is necessary in the related work section.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by simplifying complex sentences. Additionally, providing a detailed analysis of how heterogeneity affects performance would strengthen the paper. The authors should also elaborate on the differences between their objective function and that of VAE, and clarify the reasons behind SCMVC's performance advantages. Including more comparative methods in the experiments and addressing the limitations of the datasets used would enhance the overall contribution. Finally, ensuring that the paper is self-contained without reliance on supplementary material is essential for clarity and completeness.
