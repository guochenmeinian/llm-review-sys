Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of color filtrations on graphs, introducing RePHINE, a novel topological summary that combines node and edge persistence diagrams. The authors establish that RePHINE is more expressive than either type of diagram alone. They conduct experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RePHINE significantly outperforms the existing PH-based model, PersLay, on various benchmarks, including NCI109, PROTEINS, and IMDB-B. The authors also report improved performance when integrating RePHINE with the state-of-the-art GNN, PNA, on the ZINC dataset. Additionally, the paper discusses the limitations of message-passing graph neural networks (MP-GNNs) and the challenges in recognizing attributed graphs using persistent homology. The authors provide fundamental theoretical results that explore the representational limits of PH, contributing to the Graph ML and Topological DL communities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method RePHINE is novel and effectively combines 0- and 1-dimensional information, demonstrating theoretical expressiveness beyond isolated dimensions.
- RePHINE demonstrates superior performance compared to PersLay across multiple datasets.
- The combination of RePHINE with PNA yields improved results, indicating its potential for enhancing existing models.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly communicates its ideas, enhancing reader comprehension.
- The introduction of color-separating sets and necessary conditions for distinguishing graphs based on persistence is a significant theoretical contribution.
- The theoretical insights into the representational limits of PH are valuable for advancing the field.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evaluation lacks comprehensive comparisons with existing methods, particularly with the local Persistent Homology method referenced in [28].
- The supplementary experiments, while addressing initial concerns, do not show significant statistical differences, which may limit the perceived impact of the enhancements.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding its applicability to large-scale graphs and real-world scenarios.
- The exposition can be difficult to follow at times, particularly concerning the interplay between vertex- and edge-based persistent homology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including a more thorough comparison with existing methods, such as the local Persistent Homology method from [28]. Additionally, we suggest improving the statistical analysis of the supplementary experiments to better demonstrate the significance of the enhancements. Discussing the limitations of RePHINE more explicitly, particularly its performance on large-scale graphs and real-world applications, would strengthen the practical relevance of the findings. Clarifying the interplay between vertex- and edge-based persistent homology earlier in the paper would enhance understanding. Furthermore, addressing the specific challenges and limitations of applying RePHINE to real-world datasets could further solidify the contributions of the paper.
