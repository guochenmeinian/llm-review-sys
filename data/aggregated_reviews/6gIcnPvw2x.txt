Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a complete and constructive criterion for sequential covariate adjustment, termed the Sequential Adjustment Criterion (SAC). The authors propose an algorithm to identify a minimal sequential covariate adjustment set, enhancing the efficiency of causal effect estimation. The work highlights the limitations of existing criteria, particularly the multi-outcome Sequential Back-Door (mSBD) criterion, and demonstrates the soundness and completeness of SAC for sequential covariate adjustment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important problem in causal inference and provides a well-motivated investigation into sequential covariate adjustments.
- The introduction of SAC is a significant advancement, extending previous results and offering a sound and complete graphical criterion.
- The theoretical results and algorithm are coherent and sound, with insightful discussions of existing limitations illustrated through examples.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is narrow and difficult to follow, with several definitions and formulas lacking clarity and mathematical precision.
- Key elements, such as the definitions of certain sets (e.g., H_i), are not well-defined, leading to confusion regarding their relationships and implications.
- The paper lacks extensive validation with real-world data and does not provide simulation studies to verify the performance of the proposed algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by refining definitions and ensuring mathematical precision, particularly in Definition 3 and Eq. (2). It would be beneficial to explicitly define the sets H_i in Definition 5 and clarify the relationship between the sequential covariate adjustment formula and the mSBD adjustment formula. Additionally, we suggest including examples to illustrate Definition 4 and discussing the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide experimental results to validate the effectiveness of SAC in real-world scenarios.
