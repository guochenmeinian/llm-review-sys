### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to fine-tune open-source models using instruction data to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in conversational tasks. The authors introduce UltraChat, a large-scale multi-turn conversational dataset comprising 1.5 million turns across diverse topics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by fine-tuning the LLaMA-13B model, referred to as UltraLM, which outperforms existing open-source models. The study emphasizes the significance of dataset diversity and quality in training better models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide empirical evidence supporting the improvements achieved through their approach and report results across multiple models.
- UltraChat is a valuable resource for enhancing chat models, showcasing a systematic method for generating high-quality datasets.
- The semi-automated data collection process is innovative and could inform future efforts in instructional data gathering.

Weaknesses:
- The filtration step for ensuring data quality is unclear, lacking details on whether it is automated or manual.
- Results remain significantly lower than those of ChatGPT and GPT-4, indicating room for improvement.
- The dataset is limited to English dialog data, and potential pitfalls of the dataset and model are not sufficiently discussed.
- The authors do not analyze the overhead costs associated with dataset construction and model fine-tuning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the filtration step by providing detailed information on its execution. Additionally, including a scoped-down human evaluation on a subset of the data would enhance the assessment of data quality. The authors should also consider discussing the limitations of the dataset, including its language constraints, and analyze the costs associated with dataset construction and model fine-tuning to propose cost-reducing alternatives. Finally, conducting ablation experiments could provide insights into the impact of dataset size on performance.
