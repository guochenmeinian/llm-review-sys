Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a probabilistic soft logic approach for fine-grained address entity recognition (FGAER) from multi-turn dialogues, integrating a pre-trained language model (ERNIE-CRF) for BIOE labeling. The authors propose a novel method that combines a standard cross-entropy loss with a probabilistic logic model’s loss, alongside various techniques for augmenting small dialogue datasets using ChatGPT. The approach achieves competitive results, surpassing several baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed logic-guided enhancement for FGAER is novel and general, allowing integration with existing models without architectural changes.
- The paper is well-written, with thorough experiments and a comprehensive discussion of results, including per-entity type analysis.
- Open-source code and datasets enhance reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that address hierarchy is strictly followed in dialogues may not hold true across different languages and contexts, potentially impacting performance.
- The experiments primarily compare the proposed method to a single baseline, limiting the informativeness of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification of the hierarchical relationships among addresses in dialogues, as users may not always adhere to the proposed structure. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experiments to include comparisons of each baseline’s performance with and without the proposed enhancement to better support claims of generalizability. Including ablation studies and qualitative analyses would further strengthen the argument for the logic rules applied. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical issues and ensuring clarity in notation and references would enhance the paper's presentation.
