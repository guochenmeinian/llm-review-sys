### Key Points
This paper investigates the relationship between aesthetic beauty in images and effective communication, proposing that current image captioning models fail to accurately predict human responses. The authors introduce the Impressions dataset, which includes 1,440 image-caption pairs and 4,320 annotations, to explore how visual features evoke emotions and thoughts. They conclude that captioning after image analysis can enhance the description of complex aesthetic elements and that fine-tuning models significantly improves their ability to simulate human impressions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-organized and presents a clear annotation process, enhancing its credibility. The extensive evaluations, including both automatic and human assessments, provide valuable insights into the dataset's effectiveness and the limitations of existing models. The proposed prompts effectively capture key aesthetic elements.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks a thorough statistical analysis compared to other datasets, and a comparison table would clarify the Impressions dataset's standing. Additionally, there are minor concerns regarding the need for more example images in the appendix and a missing citation related to visual symbols/metaphors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a detailed explanation of how the Impressions dataset can be applied in journalism and communication. Additionally, please include a reference for the Impressions dataset and enhance Table 1's legend to explain trends. A discussion on adjective-noun pairs and sentiments in emotions should be added, referencing "Text-Image Sentiment Analysis." Finally, consider adding more example images to the appendix and exploring challenges in generating images that reflect aesthetic aspects.
