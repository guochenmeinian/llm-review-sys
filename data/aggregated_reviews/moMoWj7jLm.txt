Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the FormulaReasoning dataset, comprising 5,420 junior high school-level Chinese physics questions that require knowledge of specific formulae for resolution. The authors evaluate various large language models (LLMs) using different methodologies, including zero-shot, few-shot, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), revealing potential for improvement in model performance on this challenging dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is well-constructed, featuring detailed human annotations and a populated formula database, making it a valuable resource for the research community.
- The paper is clearly written, effectively demonstrating the dataset's key ideas and significance.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is currently limited to Chinese, which may restrict its accessibility and applicability in broader research contexts.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of related work, particularly concerning physics datasets that include similar problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work by including datasets like MATH, which share similarities with FormulaReasoning. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments to test the capabilities of GPT-4o and exploring whether Python can assist models in resolving calculation errors. Furthermore, clarifying how formulas are incorporated into model prompts across different scenarios would enhance the paper's clarity. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expedite the release of the English version of the dataset, ensuring its quality through thorough verification.
