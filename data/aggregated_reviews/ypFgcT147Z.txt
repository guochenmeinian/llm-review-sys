Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for measuring similarity between responses of deep neural networks in vision through the introduction of Semantic Representational Similarity Matrices (RSMs). The authors reformulate traditional RSMs by emphasizing semantic information over spatio-semantic details, claiming that this approach enhances retrieval performance and aligns more closely with human perception. Various experiments demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method compared to baseline approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses an important topic in the field.
- The introduction of semantic RSMs is a significant contribution, potentially leading to more meaningful comparisons between neural network models.
- Empirical results convincingly demonstrate improved retrieval performance, adding practical value to the theoretical framework.

Weaknesses:
- The authors should better discuss the differences in results for CNNs and ViTs, particularly regarding the impact of spatial information on similarity assessments.
- The paper lacks a thorough exploration of the computational complexity and scalability of the proposed method, especially in relation to larger models and datasets.
- There is insufficient quantitative comparative data, and the discussion of experimental results is not comprehensive enough.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between CNNs and ViTs, particularly in how spatial arrangements affect similarity measures. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the scalability of the proposed method to larger datasets and models should be included. We suggest adding quantitative performance comparisons, such as accuracy and time complexity, in tabular form to enhance the evaluation of semantic RSMs against existing methods. Furthermore, the authors should provide more visual examples of their method's application across different networks and tasks to facilitate a more comprehensive qualitative assessment. Lastly, addressing the computational overhead introduced by the permutation matrix and its implications for high-resolution data would strengthen the paper.
