Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "CRAYM: Neural Field Optimization via Camera RAY Matching," a novel uncalibrated NeRF strategy that enhances reconstruction quality and camera pose estimation through keypoints matching across images. The authors propose two main innovations: 1) enriched ray features from surrounding rays sampled around keypoints, and 2) a ray matching index for re-weighting color regression, improving robustness to occlusions. The technique is evaluated against various standard datasets and NeRF-like algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The separation of key rays and auxiliary rays is an interesting and meaningful concept.
- The paper includes numerous conclusive results and a good ablation study demonstrating the benefits of each novelty.
- The approach has been assessed on a large number of datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The robustness against outlier matches is not evaluated; introducing artificial outliers could provide insights into the technique's handling of mismatches.
- The novelty of the approach appears incremental compared to existing methods leveraging epipolar geometry and prior matching, raising questions about its distinct contributions.
- The sampling of auxiliary rays is inadequately described, and the initialization of the pose lacks detail.
- The intrinsic parameters of the camera could be optimized further, and the final loss function's balance may be challenging.
- Comparisons are limited to older baseline methods, and the experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate high-fidelity rendering under noisy camera poses.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of robustness by testing against outlier matches and clarifying how rays are sampled. Additionally, providing more details on pose initialization and the optimization of intrinsic camera parameters would enhance the manuscript. We suggest including comparisons with more recent methods like NoPe-NeRF and BAA-NGP, as well as conducting additional experiments on diverse datasets to strengthen the claims. Lastly, addressing the complexity of the proposed method in terms of memory and runtime would be beneficial.
