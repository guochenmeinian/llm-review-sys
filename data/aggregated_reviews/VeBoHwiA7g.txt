### Key Points
This paper presents SmartSpanNER, a novel approach to enhance the robustness of span-based named entity recognition (NER) by incorporating a Named Entity Head (NEH) prediction task alongside span classification. The authors propose a multi-task learning framework that addresses the shortcomings of standard span-based methods, particularly in low-resource settings. Experiments on four datasets—CoNLL03, Few-NERD (flat), and GENIA, ACE05 (nested)—demonstrate that SmartSpanNER performs robustly even with limited training data and shows improvements in training and inference efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem and proposed solution are clearly articulated, with experimental validation showing SmartSpanNER's robustness in low-resource scenarios.
- The auxiliary task of NEH prediction is well-motivated and contributes positively to performance without adversely affecting the core NER task.
- The negative sampling strategy effectively enhances training efficiency, and the analysis section is thorough, providing insights across various training sizes.

Weaknesses:
- The development set was not utilized for hyperparameter tuning, which raises concerns about the tuning process.
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the effectiveness of the proposed method on nested entities and does not compare against state-of-the-art results, particularly on GENIA and ACE05.
- There is insufficient ablation study to isolate the effects of the auxiliary task and the sampling strategy, and the choice of datasets does not adequately represent true low-resource settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the tuning of hyperparameters by utilizing the development set rather than relying solely on test set analysis. Additionally, conducting a comprehensive comparison against state-of-the-art models, particularly on nested entities, would strengthen the claims. We suggest performing ablation studies to clarify the contributions of the auxiliary task and the negative sampling strategy. Finally, including a qualitative analysis of cases that have improved would enhance the paper's depth and provide clearer insights into the model's performance.
