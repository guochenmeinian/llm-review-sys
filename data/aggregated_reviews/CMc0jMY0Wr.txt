Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on distributed goodness-of-fit testing for discrete distributions under bandwidth and differential privacy constraints, extending results from multivariate Gaussian models using Le Camâ€™s theory. The authors derive matching minimax upper and lower bounds for the goodness-of-fit testing problem when the number of samples held locally is large, characterizing the separation rates in the large-sample regime.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, organized, and mathematically rigorous, effectively leveraging statistical equivalence to address practical challenges in federated learning scenarios. The derivation of minimax bounds is thorough, and the exposition of Le Cam's theory is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
The novelty of the contribution is limited, as the results heavily rely on established techniques and prior works. The distinction between the proposed distributed approach and existing central methods is not clearly articulated, raising questions about its uniqueness. Additionally, the reliance on the assumption \(md\log d/\sqrt{n}=o(1)\) may not reflect practical scenarios, and the absence of empirical validation limits the findings' applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the differences and advantages of the distributed approach over established results in the central setting. It is crucial to address the limitations of the assumption \(md\log d/\sqrt{n}=o(1)\) and provide examples or case studies where these conditions hold. We also suggest including empirical validation or simulations to demonstrate the practical performance of the theoretical results. Furthermore, expanding the discussion around Theorems 1 and 2 in context and improving the overall presentation by addressing minor typos and unclear notations would enhance readability.
