Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WelQrate, a new standard for benchmarking in small molecule drug discovery, addressing the need for improved model evaluation frameworks. The authors propose a meticulously curated dataset collection of nine datasets across five therapeutic target classes, along with a standardized evaluation framework that includes featurization, 3D structure generation, and benchmarking of existing deep learning architectures. The work emphasizes the significance of high-quality labeling and aims to establish a robust foundation for AI-driven drug discovery. Additionally, the paper provides a detailed analysis of predicting molecular activity, particularly addressing the challenges posed by distribution shifts in scaffold structures. The authors propose that observed performance issues may relate to overfitting, as indicated by training and validation loss behaviors, and emphasize the importance of evaluating models under conditions that reflect real-world scenarios through scaffold splits designed to test model robustness against structurally different molecules. They advocate for the use of weighted Mean Squared Error (weighted MSE) as an evaluation metric for regression tasks and suggest that researchers consider adjusting the default inactive value of 1000 ÂµM based on specific needs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of WelQrate as a new gold standard enhances the reliability and reproducibility of AI models in drug discovery.
- The rigorous data curation process ensures high-quality datasets, reflecting real-world scenarios with imbalanced activity labels.
- The clear and well-organized presentation of methodologies and contributions facilitates understanding.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for their methodology, particularly in addressing distribution shifts and overfitting.
- The paper includes a comprehensive analysis of evaluation metrics, proposing innovative approaches tailored to the challenges of molecular activity prediction.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on manual inspection in the data curation process may introduce subjectivity and inconsistency.
- Clarity issues exist, such as the lack of explicit definitions for evaluation metrics and insufficient explanations regarding error bars in figures.
- The paper does not adequately address the implications of using artificial values for inactive compounds in regression tasks.
- The methodology for setting weights in weighted MSE lacks quantitative standards, which may lead to inconsistencies in evaluation.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore alternative evaluation metrics, such as weighted Mean Absolute Error (WMAE), which could also be valid for regression tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly defining each evaluation metric and providing detailed explanations of error bars in the figures. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing strategies for handling class imbalance in model training, such as oversampling or synthetic data generation. Implementing automated or semi-automated tools for data curation could reduce subjectivity and enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, the authors should justify the use of artificial values for inactive compounds and clarify how this affects regression evaluation metrics. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity and rigor of the methodology for setting weights in weighted MSE by providing a quantitative standard. Additionally, we encourage the authors to explore and discuss alternative evaluation metrics, such as weighted Mean Absolute Error (WMAE), to provide a more comprehensive evaluation framework for regression tasks. Finally, we recommend including a dedicated discussion section on the complexities of regression tasks, particularly regarding accurate top-ranked predictions and handling missing values in inactives.
