Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a thorough examination of the potential applications of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare, particularly in resource-limited settings (RLS). It effectively highlights the transformative capabilities of AI while addressing critical ethical considerations. The authors propose actionable recommendations for ethical implementation, emphasizing the need for culturally sensitive frameworks and interdisciplinary collaboration. However, the relevance and selection criteria of the literature reviewed are unclear, and the paper raises numerous questions that suggest a survey-like quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, covering a broad range of applications and ethical evaluations, providing a nuanced perspective on AI in RLS.
- It discusses global health disparities and the importance of culturally sensitive frameworks, aligning with global health priorities.
- The recommendations for ethical implementation are actionable and relevant.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology for literature selection lacks clarity, compromising transparency and reproducibility.
- The paper does not link AI healthcare ethical issues to broader AGI concerns, limiting its comprehensiveness.
- There is a lack of quantitative data to support ethical evaluations, and the market size and maturity of AI in healthcare for RLS remain unclear.
- The absence of real-world case studies makes some arguments feel less grounded, and the reliance on secondary research renders the paper somewhat theoretical.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the literature selection methodology to enhance transparency. Additionally, incorporating quantitative data to support ethical evaluations would strengthen the paper's arguments. The authors should consider linking the ethical issues discussed to broader AGI concerns for a more comprehensive analysis. Including real-world case studies would ground the arguments in practical examples. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the discussion on future research to develop comprehensive ethical guidelines tailored to RLS, addressing algorithmic bias, privacy concerns, and patient autonomy. This could be included in a subsection of the conclusion to enhance the paper's contribution to the discourse on responsible AI deployment in healthcare.
