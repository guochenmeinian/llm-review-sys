Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for creating 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based avatars for interacting hands from single-image inputs. The authors propose a two-stage GS framework that leverages cross-identity priors through learning-based features and preserves per-identity information via optimized identity maps. Additionally, they introduce an interaction-aware attention module and a Gaussian refinement module to enhance hand interaction context for realistic rendering. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing techniques based on generalizable and one-shot NeRFs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with clear technical explanations and figures.
- It offers sufficient technical novelty by disentangling hand representation into learning-based features and optimization-based identity maps, marking it as one of the first works on generating avatars for interacting hands from single-image inputs.
- The experimental validation includes comprehensive ablation studies and comparisons with existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on off-the-shelf MANO regressor and mask detector raises concerns about how the quality of these outputs affects final rendering quality.
- The rendered hand boundaries are less smooth compared to existing methods, suggesting that the proposed GS-based method may learn less smooth geometries.
- The method does not adequately address shadow modeling, which is crucial for realistic interaction between hands.
- The experimental results lack comprehensiveness, particularly in demonstrating in-the-wild testing and failure cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the effects of the MANO regressor and mask detector on rendering quality. Additionally, addressing the non-smooth hand boundaries in rendering results with further analysis would be beneficial. To enhance the practical applicability of the method, we suggest incorporating shadow modeling to account for dynamic interactions between hands. Furthermore, presenting in-the-wild testing results and including failure cases would provide a clearer understanding of the method's limitations and effectiveness. Lastly, clarifying the distinctions between OHTA and the authors' implementations in the revised version would strengthen the paper's contributions.
