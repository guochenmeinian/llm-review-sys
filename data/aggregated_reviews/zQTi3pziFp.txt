Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for predicting sound fields around human bodies by utilizing binaural audio signals and human body motions. The authors propose a model that encodes binaural audio and human poses, then decodes them into audio signals for surrounding microphones, ultimately rendering these signals into sound fields. A novel loss function, termed the shift-\ell_2 loss, is introduced to address time-domain audio signal shifts. Experimental evaluations indicate that the method effectively captures sound fields and demonstrates the importance of full-body poses over head poses for accurate predictions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is novel, particularly in the context of sound field prediction with moving microphones.
2. The method is technically sound, employing time-domain processing through WaveNet-like decoders, which is uncommon in multi-modal deep learning.
3. The shift-\ell_2 loss function is well-conceived, effectively mitigating time shift sensitivity while preserving discriminability.
4. Experimental results validate the method's effectiveness and highlight the advantages of using full-body poses.

Weaknesses:
1. The experimental evaluations lack comparisons with existing sound field prediction methods, which would provide valuable context for the proposed approach.
2. The problem setting is overly restrictive, requiring humans as sound sources and the use of external video cameras, necessitating justifications for these constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with established sound field prediction methods to enhance the contextual understanding of their contributions. Additionally, we suggest providing justifications for the strict constraints of the problem setting, particularly the reliance on humans as sound sources and the use of external cameras, to clarify the applicability of the proposed method in broader contexts.
