### Key Points
This paper presents a new taxonomy for numerical reasoning skills at four levels: representation, number sense, manipulation, and complex reasoning, encompassing over 10 reasoning types. The authors propose an approach to create a probing dataset for each reasoning type using Tabular Natural Language Inference datasets and analyze the performance of several models, including FlanT5, GPT 3.5, NT5, and DeBERTa. The paper systematically assesses models on numerical reasoning abilities and provides a thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art models across various reasoning types.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The topic is significant, addressing a challenging area in language models where numerical reasoning is often inadequate.
- The paper conducts extensive experiments and provides insightful analyses, motivating future research in this domain.
- The proposed taxonomy and probing datasets offer a structured approach to evaluating numerical reasoning skills.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions appear incremental, as previous works have already established similar taxonomies and datasets.
- The motivation for a new taxonomy is insufficiently justified, given existing literature.
- Some sections, particularly the analysis in Section 5.3, lack depth and conclusive insights, primarily reiterating data without substantial interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the new taxonomy by clearly articulating its unique contributions compared to existing works. Additionally, we suggest condensing sections that reiterate previous findings, particularly in the creation of probing data, to enhance clarity and conciseness. Expanding the analysis in Section 5.3 to provide deeper insights rather than merely presenting data would strengthen the paper. Furthermore, consider including a broader range of models, especially table-specific ones like TAPAS and TAPEX, to enhance the robustness of the evaluation. Lastly, addressing the readability of Table 4 by presenting actual accuracies would improve comprehension.
