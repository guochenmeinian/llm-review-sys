Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for decision-aware Bayesian experimental design (BED) that optimizes designs based on the expected utility gain of downstream decision tasks rather than solely on posterior distributions of latent parameters. The authors propose a Transformer Neural Decision Process (TNDP) architecture that integrates experimental design with decision-making, aiming to improve cost- and sample-efficiency in learning. The paper introduces the concept of Decision Utility Gain (DUG) and demonstrates the effectiveness of TNDP through empirical evaluations on various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of DUG shifts the focus of experimental design towards optimizing downstream decision utility, representing a creative departure from traditional BED approaches.
- The TNDP architecture is well-explained and tailored to the BED problem, showing novelty and potential for qualitative and quantitative improvements.
- The empirical evaluation is comprehensive, demonstrating consistent superiority of TNDP over traditional methods across diverse tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of certain concepts, such as the predictive distribution and utility definitions, lacks clarity and rigor, leading to potential confusion.
- The paper does not adequately address model misspecification, a significant issue in BED, nor does it explore the scalability and computational complexity of the TNDP architecture.
- The experimental evaluation primarily focuses on synthetic datasets, with limited exploration of real-world applications, which could enhance the practical utility of the proposed framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation used, particularly regarding the predictive distribution and utility definitions, to avoid confusion. Additionally, a more rigorous analysis of the TNDP architecture's properties, including convergence behavior and sample complexity, should be included. We suggest incorporating real-world case studies in the experimental evaluation to validate the practical utility of the proposed framework. Furthermore, a detailed discussion on the computational complexity and scalability of the TNDP approach, including training time and memory footprint, would be beneficial. Lastly, addressing model misspecification and its implications in the context of the proposed methods would strengthen the paper.
