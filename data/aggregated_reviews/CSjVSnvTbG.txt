Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of optimal transport (OT) distances between finite Markov chains, establishing a novel relationship between OT distances and probabilistic bisimulation metrics. The authors propose a linear program that builds on optimal control concepts from Markov decision processes and introduce an algorithm combining Sinkhorn's method with an entropy-regularized version of the classic Value Iteration algorithm. The work includes convergence guarantees and a computational complexity analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized, with a compelling and novel contribution to the field.  
- Previous works on OT and bisimulation metrics are thoroughly referenced and up-to-date.  
- The identification of bisimulation metrics as a type of optimal transport problem is significant and novel.  
- The theoretical analysis and proposed computational solutions, including Sinkhorn-like iterations, are well-supported by experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical contributions, particularly regarding occupancy couplings, lack clarity, especially the necessity of duplicating variables.  
- The connection between the Markovian optimal transport problem and the finite-dimensional linear program does not clarify the recovery of the optimal bicausal coupling.  
- The guarantees for the Sinkhorn Value Iteration algorithm are confusing, particularly regarding the relationship between the regularization parameter and the precision of the estimates.  
- The assumption of perfect projection steps in theoretical guarantees is impractical and requires further support.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in Section 3 regarding the necessity of duplicating variables in the definition of occupancy couplings. Additionally, please clarify the connection between the Markovian optimal transport problem and the recovery of the optimal bicausal coupling. We suggest that the authors provide a more detailed explanation of the guarantees for the Sinkhorn Value Iteration algorithm, particularly the implications of the regularization parameter on the precision of estimates. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the practicality of the assumption of perfect projection steps and provide theoretical support for their claims. Lastly, please expand on the meaning of entropy in the context of coupling between MDPs and how the metric behaves with noisy data, as OT is sensitive to outliers.
