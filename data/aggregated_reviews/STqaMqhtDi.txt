### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Continual Online Recalibration with Pseudo-labels (CORP) for self-recalibration of intracortical brain-computer interfaces (iBCIs) without user interruption. The authors propose utilizing large language models (LMs) to automatically correct errors in iBCI outputs, using these corrections as "pseudo-labels" to update the iBCI decoder in real time. Evaluated over an 8-month clinical trial with a single participant, the method achieved a stable decoding accuracy of 93.71% in an online handwriting task, demonstrating significant improvements over baseline methods and addressing a critical challenge in iBCI applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Originality: The work introduces an innovative online recalibration method for iBCIs using LLMs, enhancing communication capabilities.
2. Quality and Clarity: The paper is well-structured, with clear experimental validation and smooth flow of ideas.
3. Significance: The CORP method shows higher accuracy and stability in brain-to-text communication than existing methods, validated over an extended period with human participants.

Weaknesses:
1. Limited Validation: The method has only been tested on a single subject, raising concerns about generalizability.
2. Subjective Stopping Criteria: The stopping criteria based on loss thresholds may lack objectivity; alternative quantitative metrics should be explored.
3. Potential Misleading Pseudo-labels: If the iBCI is not used for extended periods, high initial Word Error Rate (WER) and Character Error Rate (CER) may arise, potentially misleading RNN training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by validating the method on a larger sample size. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative quantitative metrics for the stopping criteria to enhance objectivity. It would be beneficial to address the scenario where a participant does not use the iBCI for an extended period, testing the robustness of pseudo-labels generated by LLMs under such conditions. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of using more powerful language models to minimize errors in pseudo-labels, as this could significantly impact the overall performance of the CORP method.
