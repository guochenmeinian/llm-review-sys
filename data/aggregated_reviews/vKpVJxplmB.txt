Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach that connects the transformer architecture to neuroscience by introducing a hippocampus-inspired activation function for the transformer's feedforward modules. The authors demonstrate that this activation function significantly influences the model's ability to store and recall information in a toy navigation task, with neurons exhibiting place cell-like firing patterns. The paper explores the implications of NMDAR dynamics on transformer performance, particularly in memory tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation into the relationship between transformers and biological structures, particularly the hippocampus, is a compelling and relevant research direction.
- The empirical analysis is well-presented, featuring clear and interpretable figures that support the paper's conclusions.
- The exploration of different representations for varying task distributions addresses an under-explored area in hippocampal consolidation.

Weaknesses:
- The argument regarding the necessity of NMDAR-like nonlinearity lacks convincing evidence, as standard activation functions like ReLU perform comparably.
- The interpretation of NMDAR dynamics as a distinct activation function class requires validation through standard machine learning tasks rather than solely bespoke neuroscience tasks.
- The paper does not adequately explain the underlying reasons for the observed effects of the proposed nonlinearity on memory performance.
- Limitations regarding the generalizability of findings to more complex, ecologically valid tasks are not sufficiently discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and depth of the discussion surrounding the NMDAR activation function, particularly addressing its comparative performance against standard activation functions. Additionally, the authors should conduct tests on more standard machine learning tasks to validate the proposed activation function's efficacy. Clarifying the definition of place cell score in the main body and providing a figure summarizing the qualitative agreement with neuroscience findings would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors explore the computational footprint of their proposed activation function in comparison to others to address concerns regarding performance-cost trade-offs.
