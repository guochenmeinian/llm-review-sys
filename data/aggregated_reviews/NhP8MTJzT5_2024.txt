Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SyntheOcc, a framework that utilizes diffusion models with 3D occupancy to synthesize photorealistic images for autonomous driving simulations. The authors propose the use of 3D semantic multi-plane images (MPIs) for enhanced geometric control, addressing limitations in existing 2D models. The method includes re-weighting strategies to tackle class imbalance and demonstrates effectiveness through comprehensive evaluations, including qualitative and quantitative analyses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of 3D semantic MPIs allows for precise modeling of 3D environments, enhancing photorealism and depth accuracy.
- The MPI encoder effectively manages a large number of channels while maintaining spatial consistency with diffusion UNet's latent features.
- Sophisticated re-weighting strategies, including foreground enhancement and class-balanced re-weighting, ensure focus on critical features.
- Extensive evaluations, including qualitative comparisons to real scenes and quantitative metrics like Frechet Inception Distance (FID), provide solid empirical evidence of the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions of the re-weighting strategies appear to be minor improvements over existing methods, limiting the perceived novelty of the paper.
- Object-level editing is underrepresented in the experiments, despite the focus on scene editing capabilities.
- Evaluations on downstream tasks should include comparisons to state-of-the-art baselines for better context.
- The paper lacks evaluations comparing the proposed re-weighting solution with GeoDiffusion.
- Noticeable view inconsistencies exist in generated images, which are not addressed in the paper.
- The reliance on existing data limits scene variety and performance in complex scenarios, such as accurately representing crowds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the re-weighting strategies by clearly distinguishing their contributions from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the representation of object-level editing in experiments to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the method's capabilities. It would be beneficial to include evaluations on the same downstream tasks as the state-of-the-art baselines for better comparisons. We also encourage the authors to address the view inconsistencies observed in the generated images and provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations related to scene variety and complexity. Finally, including a supplementary video could help clarify the method's performance and view consistency across frames and views.
