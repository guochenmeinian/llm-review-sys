### Key Points
This paper presents a study on extracting triples of {emotion cause, emotion utterance, emotion category} from conversations, proposing an end-to-end generation-based model enhanced with commonsense knowledge. The authors claim that their model addresses error propagation issues common in multi-stage approaches by utilizing a unified method. Experimental results indicate that the model achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, particularly the methods section.
- The proposed model is novel and achieves impressive performance, demonstrating its effectiveness.
- Extensive experiments, including re-implementations of baselines, support the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using a generative approach over a discriminative one lacks sufficient discussion and empirical evaluation.
- There is no comparison with ChatGPT, which is relevant given its prevalence in NLP tasks.
- The paper does not provide error analysis or computational efficiency comparisons with baselines.
- The dataset and source code are not available, complicating reproducibility.
- The writing, especially in the introduction, requires improvement for better problem positioning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the advantages of the generation paradigm over encoder-only models. Additionally, including comparisons with ChatGPT's zero-shot performance would strengthen the paper. We suggest providing error analysis and computational cost comparisons with baselines, as these are critical for real-world applications. Furthermore, the authors should ensure that the dataset and source code are made available to enhance reproducibility. Lastly, we advise refining the introduction for a smoother transition from broader context to the specific task.
