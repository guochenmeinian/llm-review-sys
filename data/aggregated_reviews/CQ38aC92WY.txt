Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the problem of differentially private cardinality estimation under continual observation in the turnstile model. The authors propose algorithms that maintain a multi-set S with insertions and deletions, reporting an approximate count of distinct items while adhering to differential privacy constraints. The additive error is characterized by the "flip number" of the stream, with upper and lower bounds established. The paper shows that for maximum flippancy \( w \), the achievable additive error is \( O(\sqrt{w}) \) for approximate differential privacy, while \( \Omega(\sqrt{w}) \) and \( \Omega(w) \) are necessary for approximate and pure differential privacy, respectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a fundamental problem in streaming algorithms, providing significant insights into the relationship between distinct counting and privacy constraints.
- It effectively connects the problem's hardness to the "flip number," offering a nuanced understanding that surpasses traditional worst-case analyses.
- The clear presentation and derivation of both upper and lower bounds contribute to the paper's overall clarity and accessibility.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithms proposed do not consider space complexity, which is critical in streaming contexts, as they require storing the entire dataset.
- The contribution of the paper is somewhat diminished by the lack of memory-efficient algorithms for distinct counting in the turnstile model.
- There exists a gap between the upper and lower bounds for certain regimes of \( w \) and \( T \).

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on potential applications for the proposed algorithm to enhance motivation. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore memory-efficient algorithms for distinct counting in the turnstile model to strengthen their contribution. Addressing the space complexity of the algorithms would significantly enhance their practical relevance in streaming scenarios.
