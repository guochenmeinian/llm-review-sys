### Key Points
This paper presents PROSE, a new dataset for document-level Chinese-English spoken language translation, specifically targeting pro-drop instances. The authors propose a Mention-aware semantic augmentation method to mitigate the challenges posed by dropped pronouns. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches in translation quality and pronoun reinsertion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, making it easy to follow.
- It introduces a comprehensive dataset with detailed pro-drop annotation across four domains: talk, drama, movie, and vlog.
- The Mention-aware semantic augmentation method is trained jointly with the NMT framework, potentially inspiring further research.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method may still be inferior to LLM models, as noted in the limitations.
- The dataset is limited to the Chinese-English language pair, neglecting other pro-drop languages.
- The kappa value of human evaluation is only 0.52, which raises concerns about its reliability.
- The differences between the proposed dataset and related work are inadequately discussed, and the annotation process lacks sufficient detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the proposed dataset differs from related work, particularly addressing the contributions of GuoFeng. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed information on the annotation process, including labeling methods, accuracy of the Chinese labels, and types of labels used. Furthermore, we suggest including performance comparisons with LLMs, such as GPT-3.5/4, to strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method. Lastly, addressing the kappa value in human evaluation would enhance the credibility of the findings.
