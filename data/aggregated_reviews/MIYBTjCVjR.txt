Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel RLHF framework called SeqRank, which aims to enhance feedback efficiency through sequential preference ranking. The authors propose two methods: sequential pairwise comparison and root pairwise comparison. The paper provides a theoretical foundation for these methods, demonstrating their effectiveness in improving feedback efficiency, defined as the ratio of trajectory pairs to feedback. Empirical evaluations show that SeqRank outperforms traditional pairwise comparisons across various simulated and real-world tasks. Additionally, the authors conducted four experiments to validate SeqRank, addressing robustness, alternative sampling methods, training from human feedback, and data dependency. Results indicate that SeqRank, particularly with root pairwise comparison, outperforms the PEBBLE baseline across various robotic tasks, demonstrating faster convergence and improved user satisfaction. Statistical analyses reveal significant differences in user satisfaction scores, although performance improvements in rewards after fine-tuning are modest.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, with a theoretically sound main idea.
- It includes extensive experiments, validating the proposed methods in both simulated and real-world scenarios.
- The mathematical justification for the methods is robust, and the correlation between feedback efficiency and sample efficiency is compelling.
- The additional experiments strengthen the significance of the work and demonstrate compatibility with uncertainty sampling.
- SeqRank shows superior performance over conventional pairwise comparison and the PEBBLE baseline in both locomotion and manipulation tasks.
- Statistical analyses indicate significant improvements in user satisfaction scores for root and sequential pairwise comparisons.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed methods may be perceived as relatively simple, and the contribution of using the transitive property of human preferences is limited.
- There is a lack of exploration of alternative sampling methods beyond pairwise sampling, which could enhance performance.
- The presentation of the methods and theoretical results could be clearer, as some claims, such as the completeness of trajectory comparability, are questionable.
- The improvements in average rewards after fine-tuning are relatively small, raising questions about the practical impact of the proposed methods.
- The statistical significance of the performance improvement for sequential pairwise comparison is less robust compared to root pairwise comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions, particularly regarding $S_M$, and provide illustrations to emphasize the importance of feedback efficiency before discussing the proposed methods. Additionally, addressing the discrepancies in performance between sequential and standard pairwise comparisons in specific tasks would strengthen the paper. The authors should also consider including alternative sampling methods and exploring the implications of labeling comparisons as "equal" to enhance the robustness of their findings. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the statistical analysis by applying the Bonferroni correction for repeated tests, as this would enhance the rigor of their findings. Exploring the implications of their methods in the RLHF application for fine-tuning language models could broaden the impact of their work. Finally, addressing the modest performance improvements in rewards after fine-tuning could provide a more comprehensive understanding of the practical applications of SeqRank. Moving the algorithm description from the appendix to the main text could also improve accessibility for readers.
