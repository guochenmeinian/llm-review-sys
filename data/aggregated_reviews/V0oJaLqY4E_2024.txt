Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) approach, named Diffusion by Maximum Entropy IRL (DxMI), aimed at enhancing the sample quality of diffusion generative models, particularly with limited generation steps. The authors propose a joint training framework for a diffusion model and an energy-based model (EBM), where the EBM serves as a reward signal. Additionally, they introduce the Diffusion by Dynamic Programming (DxDP) algorithm, which efficiently optimizes diffusion model updates by framing the problem as an optimal control task. Empirical results indicate that models fine-tuned with DxMI can generate high-quality samples in as few as 4 to 10 steps and improve EBM training stability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The DxMI methodology introduces a novel application of maximum entropy IRL to diffusion models, potentially enhancing sample quality and inference speed.
2. The manuscript is well-structured and clearly articulates its theoretical foundations and algorithms.
3. Strong empirical results validate the approach across image generation and anomaly detection tasks.

Weaknesses:
1. The comparative analysis with existing diffusion model acceleration methods is limited, necessitating a broader evaluation of speed-quality tradeoffs.
2. The paper lacks theoretical analysis regarding convergence rates for DxDP and approximation guarantees related to the IRL objective.
3. The reliance on pre-trained checkpoints for experiments raises questions about the independence of the proposed methods from traditional training objectives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis by including a more comprehensive evaluation of DxMI against existing methods, particularly in terms of training time and computational costs. Additionally, we suggest incorporating theoretical insights into the convergence properties of DxDP and approximation guarantees related to the IRL objective to strengthen the paper's foundations. A thorough discussion of the methodological distinctions between this approach and prior works is essential for positioning the proposed method effectively. Finally, exploring the scalability of DxMI to more complex datasets and generative tasks would enhance the paper's contributions.
