Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the DOAGNN model to address the Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) using reinforcement learning. The authors propose a decomposition of disjunctive graphs into Machine-to-Operation (M2O) and Operation-to-Operation (O2O) subgraphs, enhancing the representation of relationships and improving scheduling efficiency. A tailored reward function is introduced to mitigate reward sparsity and estimation bias. The performance results indicate that DOAGNN significantly enhances decision-making in cloud manufacturing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The abstract is clear and well-presented.
2. A comprehensive literature review highlights limitations of existing methods and positions the authors' contributions effectively.
3. The mathematical expressions and explanations of the DOAGNN model are well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
1. A summary of major related works, including their limitations and how DOAGNN addresses them, is not provided.
2. The justification for the superiority of the proposed model over other sequencing models is unclear.
3. The dual-model structure may incur significant computational costs, raising scalability concerns.
4. The paper lacks comprehensive ablation studies across multiple datasets to validate design choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for decoupling the disjunctive graph into M2O and O2O graphs, focusing on the rationale behind this approach. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies on various datasets to demonstrate the impact of different design choices. Clarifying the computational costs associated with the dual-model structure and providing a trade-off analysis would enhance the practical applicability of the model. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the background of benchmark datasets to aid readers unfamiliar with the problem.
