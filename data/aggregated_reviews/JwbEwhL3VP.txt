### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared pre-trained language models (PSPLMs) by leveraging a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) inspired technique. The authors propose modifying weights in sub-layers to accelerate inference speed, particularly focusing on BERT and GPT-2. They also introduce a novel pre-training method that alters forward propagation to further improve efficiency. The findings indicate that the proposed strategies yield significant efficiency gains while maintaining performance across various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important issue in NLP regarding the efficiency of Transformers.
- The proposed method shows compelling results, achieving minimal performance loss while improving inference costs significantly.
- The integration of techniques like early exit methods demonstrates practical utility.

Weaknesses:
- Some claims lack sufficient empirical support, particularly regarding the tuning of beta values and their applicability across tasks.
- Clarity issues persist, with ambiguous notations and inconsistencies in terminology that hinder comprehension.
- The absence of a method to determine optimal values for key variables, such as step size and number of iterations, relies heavily on heuristics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing ambiguous notations and ensuring consistent terminology throughout. Specifically, they should clarify the tuning process for beta values and provide insights into their robustness across tasks. Additionally, including comparisons with early exit techniques and addressing the scaling concerns would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest that the authors report results with fixed beta values to substantiate their claims regarding inference speed acceleration.
