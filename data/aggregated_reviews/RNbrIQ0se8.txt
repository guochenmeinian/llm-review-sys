Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptive hypergraph learning module (AHL) for modeling group-wise multi-scale interactions to enhance transformer-based models for time series forecasting. The Multi-Scale Feature Extraction (MFE) Module converts time series data into a hypergraph, followed by intra-scale and inter-scale learning modules. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, Ada-MSHyper, which achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation behind Ada-MSHyper is well-founded and insightful.
2. The design effectively addresses the target challenge of temporal variations entanglement.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate the clear superiority of Ada-MSHyper.
4. The writing is clear and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks insights into performance differences across various datasets, particularly regarding long-range, short-range, and ultra-long-range datasets.
2. The pipeline is somewhat complicated, and the presentation could be improved.
3. Related works do not include Graph-Transformer methods, such as STGNN, which could provide a more comprehensive comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of Ada-MSHyper's performance across different datasets, particularly by exploring the reasons behind its varying effectiveness on long-range versus short-range datasets. Additionally, consider conducting ablation studies to clarify the impact of using both cosine similarity and Euclidean distance in the Hyperedge Constraint. We also suggest enhancing the clarity of the pipeline and ensuring that the paper includes comparisons with relevant Graph-Transformer methods. Finally, including longer prediction lengths in the ablation experiments would provide a more robust evaluation of the model's performance.
