Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel class of SDE-based solvers called Gaussian Mixture Solvers (GMS) to address the efficiency-effectiveness dilemma in diffusion models. The authors highlight that the Gaussian assumption in the reverse transition kernel is often violated, particularly with a limited number of discretization steps. They propose using a mixture of Gaussians to better model the reverse process and estimate the parameters of the mixture using higher-order moments integrated through generalized methods of moments. Empirical results indicate that GMS outperforms existing SDE-based solvers in terms of sample quality for image generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing a significant issue with the Gaussian assumption in diffusion models.
- The theoretical foundation is solid, providing insights into the limitations of current methods and proposing an effective solution.
- Experimental results demonstrate improvements in sample quality, particularly in image generation tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is inadequate for publication, with unclear sentences and a counter-intuitive structure that complicates comprehension.
- Key elements, such as parameters $\theta$ and $\theta^*$, are not well-defined, and the connection between various components of the model is not explicitly stated.
- The paper lacks sampling time data, which is crucial given the focus on improving sampling efficiency.
- The improvement of GMS over SN-DDPM is not as significant as expected, raising questions about its practical advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by addressing the unclear sentences and restructuring the content for better flow. Specifically, ensure that all key parameters are defined and that the connections between them are explicitly stated. Additionally, we suggest including sampling time curves for different numbers of steps in the main paper to substantiate claims about efficiency. It would also be beneficial to provide a more compelling rationale for using GMS over simpler methods like SN-DDPM, especially in light of the modest improvements observed. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand their experimental section to include larger resolution datasets and additional comparisons to further validate their claims.
