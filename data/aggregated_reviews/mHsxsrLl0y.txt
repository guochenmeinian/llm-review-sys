Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a bidirectional data rectification framework, BirDRec, aimed at enhancing the robustness of sequential recommender systems (SRSs) by addressing unreliable input and targets. The authors propose two theoretically guaranteed error-bounded strategies for data rectification, which can be integrated with existing SRSs. Additionally, they introduce a rectification sampling strategy and a self-ensemble mechanism to improve computational efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness across several benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides sufficient theoretical proof for the methods, which is impressive.
- The discussion of related work is clear, outlining differences and connections with existing studies.
- The empirical studies convincingly support the proposed approach's effectiveness, with comprehensive ablation tests and hyperparameter analyses.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not address the limitations of the methods, particularly regarding their applicability in large-scale real-world recommender systems.
- The evaluation is limited to a few benchmark datasets, raising questions about generalizability.
- Some experimental results lack clarity, such as the performance of baselines and the specifics of the self-ensemble mechanism.
- The computational and space complexity analysis is insufficient, which is crucial for assessing scalability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their methods, particularly regarding their applicability in large-scale settings and potential practical issues. Additionally, conducting experiments on diverse datasets and providing a thorough analysis of the computational and space complexity would enhance the paper's contributions. Clarifying the performance discrepancies in experimental results and detailing the self-ensemble mechanism would also strengthen the paper. Finally, including comparisons with more recent baselines would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of BirDRec's effectiveness.
