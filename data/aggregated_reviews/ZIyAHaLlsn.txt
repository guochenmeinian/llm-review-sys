Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion-based image super-resolution (SR) method called ResShift, which aims to enhance efficiency by learning the residual between low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images. The authors propose a novel framework that achieves competitive performance with only 20 sampling steps, outperforming the Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) under the same conditions. The paper includes a thorough analysis of the fidelity-realism tradeoff and extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method effectively reduces the number of diffusion steps while maintaining competitive performance, showcasing the utility of learning residuals.
2. The paper is well-structured and presents a clear flow of information, making it accessible to readers.
3. The authors provide comprehensive ablation studies and theoretical analyses, contributing to a deeper understanding of the model's performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in articulating the unique aspects of the proposed method compared to existing approaches.
2. The comparison with LDM is potentially unfair due to the limitations of the default DDIM sampler used in LDM, which may not be optimal for short sampling paths.
3. The qualitative results exhibit inconsistencies across different images, raising questions about the robustness of the method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by explicitly highlighting what distinguishes their approach from existing methods. Additionally, including a brief figure to introduce ResShift and a conceptual narrative at the beginning of the second chapter would enhance understanding. We encourage the authors to conduct comparisons with other diffusion-based models, such as DDRM, and to address the discrepancies in qualitative results. Furthermore, providing implementation code would facilitate reproducibility, and a discussion on the potential societal impacts of their work should be included. Lastly, clarifying the choice of hyperparameters and their impact on performance would strengthen the evaluation of the proposed method.
