Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the convergence rate of fictitious play (FP) in potential games, particularly focusing on two-player identical payoff games. It demonstrates that FP can require super-exponential time to approximate a Nash equilibrium, with a lower bound established through a recursive construction of a challenging game. The authors provide empirical demonstrations of FP behavior and clarify that the same theorem applies to general N-player potential games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper makes significant progress on understanding the convergence behavior of fictitious play in potential games, proving that any finite-time guarantee must be super-exponential in the number of actions.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making complex concepts accessible, and the inclusion of intuitive examples enhances reader engagement.
- The construction of the game is clever, providing valuable insights into scenarios where FP performs poorly.

Weaknesses:
- The asymptotic lower bound of $\Omega(1/(n^2t^2))$ may not be tight compared to the $O(1/t)$ upper bound.
- There is a lack of detailed discussion on regularity conditions mentioned in reference [1], and how they relate to the findings of this paper.
- The paper could benefit from more background information on FP and potential games, including concrete examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on regularity conditions and their implications for the results presented. Additionally, addressing whether the exponential lower bound holds for stochastic fictitious play would enhance the paper's depth. Clarifying the upper-bound of the convergence rate when regularity conditions are not satisfied would also be beneficial. Finally, including more background information on FP and potential games could provide a stronger foundation for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
