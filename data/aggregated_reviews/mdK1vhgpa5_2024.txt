### Key Points
This paper presents VCoTTA, a variational Bayesian approach for Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), which addresses domain adaptation during continuous shifts at test time. The authors propose a method that combines a pretrained deterministic model with Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) using a variational warm-up strategy and a mean-teacher update mechanism. This approach aims to mitigate error accumulation by updating the student model with a mixture of priors from both source and teacher models, formulated through cross-entropy and Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. The authors highlight that while BNNs are effective in uncertain testing scenarios, their direct application in CTTA can lead to unreliable priors. Experimental results across three datasets, including comparisons with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods such as PETAL, ECoTTA, and Vida, demonstrate the method's effectiveness in addressing the challenges of CTTA and show superior performance on the CIFAR10C dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of VCoTTA's components and a solid theoretical foundation.  
- The originality of the approach is evident, particularly in its integration of Bayesian inference with continual test-time adaptation.  
- The proposed VCoTTA method effectively addresses the issue of unreliable priors in BNNs, enhancing performance in CTTA tasks.  
- The methodology is supported by comprehensive empirical validation and insightful ablation studies that highlight the significance of various design choices.  
- The inclusion of comparative results with other SOTA methods strengthens the paper's contributions and validates the proposed approach.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the application to classification tasks derived from CIFAR10 datasets is questionable, requiring further justification and more realistic benchmarks.  
- The paper lacks clarity in certain areas, such as the rationale behind using EMA updates for the teacher model and the role of data augmentation in VCoTTA.  
- There are inconsistencies in notation and missing standard errors in experimental results, making it difficult to assess the performance of different methods.  
- The manuscript's space constraints limited the inclusion of additional comparisons, which could provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the novelty of continual test-time adaptation applications, particularly by providing more realistic benchmarks. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the motivations behind the design choices, especially regarding the use of EMA updates and the importance of data augmentation. Consistency in notation should be ensured throughout the paper, and standard errors should be included in experimental results to enhance the clarity of performance comparisons. Furthermore, we recommend including additional comparisons with other relevant SOTA methods to provide a broader context for the effectiveness of VCoTTA. Finally, a more detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with VCoTTA would strengthen the manuscript.
