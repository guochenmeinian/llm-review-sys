Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Gaussian process regression technique that utilizes only nearest neighbors for prediction, challenging the conventional approach of using a singular set of data points for hyperparameter estimation. The authors analyze the asymptotic behavior of their method, demonstrating substantial speed improvements and enhanced predictive performance on UCI datasets. They argue that predictive distributions are robust to model misspecifications, particularly in large data limits.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The empirical evaluation yields strong results, and the theoretical analysis provides valuable insights. The paper is well-written, and the proposed method addresses the need for scalable Gaussian process approximations.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks comparisons with other nearest neighbor techniques and overlooks significant aspects of Gaussian processes, such as the importance of covariance kernels and the curse of dimensionality. The structure deviates from standard ML formats, making it difficult to follow. Additionally, the theoretical results may not have practical implications in finite data scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including comparisons with existing nearest neighbor methods, particularly those cited in the reviews. It would be beneficial to delve deeper into the geostatistical literature and clarify the implications of their theoretical results in finite data regimes. We also suggest restructuring the paper to align more closely with standard ML formats for better readability. Lastly, addressing the clarity of Figure 2 and providing a sensitivity analysis regarding the choice of nearest neighbors would enhance the paper's overall quality.
