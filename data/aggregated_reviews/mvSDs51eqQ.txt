### Key Points
This paper presents a study on one-dimensional mean estimation in a beyond-worst-case setting. The authors propose two main contributions: first, they establish indistinguishability results that demonstrate the construction of a "partner" distribution \( q \) from a given distribution \( p \) with finite mean, which preserves moments while having a mean that is significantly different from \( p \). This leads to the conclusion that the sub-Gaussian rate via median-of-means is optimal in general, effectively serving as an impossibility theorem for beyond-worst-case analysis. Second, they introduce a framework of neighborhood optimality, showing that median-of-means is optimal up to a constant.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The question addressed is well-motivated and represents a natural progression from recent work by Lee-Valiant (2020) on median-of-means.  
- The paper is technically solid, with interesting and somewhat surprising contributions.  
- It is well-written and presents intuitive constructions that clarify the impossibility of improving on worst-case optimal sub-Gaussian bounds with only finite mean assumptions.  

Weaknesses:  
- An extension of the results to the multivariate setting would be of interest.  
- The neighborhood-optimality framework, while intriguing, does not yet convincingly demonstrate that it is the definitive approach for advancing beyond worst-case mean estimation.  
- The paper could benefit from clearer definitions and discussions regarding the implications of neighborhood optimality and its limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by explicitly defining "worst case" as the worst over all distributions under certain moment constraints. Additionally, we suggest stating formally in the abstract that the construction ensures \( \frac{dq}{dp} \leq 2 \) at all points. It would also be beneficial to explore the potential for adapting the construction to reflect results for symmetric distributions, as mentioned in the reviews. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the implications of their neighborhood optimality framework and consider addressing the questions raised regarding the necessity of additional assumptions in their claims.
