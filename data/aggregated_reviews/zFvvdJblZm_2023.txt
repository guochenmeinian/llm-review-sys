Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
We note that the paper introduces a novel dataset for Instance Detection (InsDet) comprising high-resolution images of 100 distinct object instances from 14 indoor scenes. The authors propose a baseline method based on the Cut-Paste-Learn strategy and a non-learned approach that achieves state-of-the-art results. The dataset is recognized as a significant improvement over previous datasets, providing a clean and tailored resource for InsDet research. We appreciate the insightful comments from Reviewer Yusx, who commended the paper's quality and clarity. The reviewer highlighted an imbalance in the paper's organization, with excessive focus on the non-learned method and insufficient detail on traditional cut-paste-learn methods. We clarified the meaning of "100 instances from 14 indoor scenes," explained the use of QR codes, and justified the segmentation of foreground instances. Additionally, we provided empirical measures showing that SAM has a high recall on the proposed dataset and included comprehensive ablation studies for cut-paste-learn methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The dataset is clean and specifically designed for InsDet, addressing a gap in available resources.
2. High-resolution images enhance the dataset's utility.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with comprehensive documentation of the dataset and methods.
4. The introduction of a novel non-learned method that performs well is noteworthy.
5. Reviewers noted the dataset's significance in the context of Instance Detection, particularly its broader scene representation compared to existing datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The diversity of backgrounds in the dataset is somewhat limited, primarily featuring indoor scenes of a similar type.
2. The focus on the non-learned InsDet method may overshadow the primary contribution of the dataset and its evaluation benchmark.
3. The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the implications of model performance on the dataset and does not sufficiently explain why existing large datasets like COCO are unsuitable for InsDet.
4. The initial paper's organization needs improvement, with an imbalance in the discussion of non-learned and traditional methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest enhancing the introduction to clarify the distinction between Instance Detection and General Object Detection. Additionally, we recommend including a breakdown analysis based on object sizes rather than solely using "easy" and "hard" tags for evaluation. Presenting the Average Recall (AR) results of proposals, independent of classification accuracy, would also provide valuable insights into the performance differences among methods. We suggest improving the manuscript's organization by balancing the discussion of non-learned and traditional methods. We have moved some ablation studies to the supplement and included additional results on average recall for both method types. We recommend further clarifying the significance of model performance through precision-recall curves and breakdown analyses by object size. Lastly, we have added an illustrative figure to differentiate Instance Detection from general object detection, which we believe enhances understanding. A more thorough discussion on the limitations of the dataset and its practical applications would also strengthen the paper.
