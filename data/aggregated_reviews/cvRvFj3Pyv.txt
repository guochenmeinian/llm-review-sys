### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the interaction between empathy detection (ED) and empathy intent recognition (EIC) tasks, utilizing the BERT model to extract semantic features and employing a cascaded interactive attention module for feature interaction. The authors propose a novel framework, the Cascaded Label Signal Network (CLSN), which enhances ED accuracy through joint training with EIC. The study includes a dataset annotated by three experts and demonstrates the framework's superiority over multiple baselines on the IEMPATHIZE and TwittEmp datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an underexplored area by jointly considering ED and EIC, enhancing understanding of empathy in dialogue.
- The CLSN effectively models interactions between ED and EIC using cascaded attention modules.
- The label signal enhancement module innovatively captures features from both tasks.
- Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset labeling could be expanded to improve the robustness of the method.
- The relationship between ED and EIC is not thoroughly explored, limiting understanding of their interaction.
- Missing results in Table 3 and a lack of detailed explanation for the label signal enhancement module detract from clarity.
- The algorithmic novelty may be limited, and comparisons with relevant baseline models are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the label signal enhancement module to clarify how it extracts relevant features from label information. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the relationship between ED and EIC to enhance understanding of their interaction. Including statistics on the dataset and providing a class-wise performance breakdown in EIC would strengthen the analysis. Furthermore, addressing the missing results in Table 3 and justifying the claim regarding the accuracy improvement of the ED task when introducing EIC would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we suggest considering the reviewers' comments for further refinement.
