Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient neural heuristic method based on meta-learning, termed EMNH (Efficient Meta-learning Neural Heuristic), aimed at solving Multi-Objective Combinatorial Optimization Problems (MOCOPs). The authors propose a shared multi-task model to enhance the meta-learning process and introduce a weight vector-based scaling symmetric sampling approach for stabilization. Additionally, a layered fine-tuning method is proposed to effectively address sub-problems. Experimental results indicate that EMNH surpasses existing neural heuristic methods across three classical MOCOPs and competes well with traditional heuristics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The article tackles the complex issue of MOCOPs, presenting a novel approach that integrates meta-learning, multi-task learning, and layered fine-tuning.
2. The theoretical advantages of the proposed method are analyzed, highlighting accelerated and stabilized meta-learning processes and reduced fine-tuning steps.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the method's superior solution quality, learning efficiency, and generalization ability compared to benchmark methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The discussion on the limitations of the proposed method is insufficient, particularly regarding its applicability to complex or higher-dimensional MOCOPs, sensitivity to weight vector selection, and risks of overfitting or underfitting.
2. The paper lacks detailed explanations of the model architecture, hyperparameter settings, and experimental setup, which may hinder replicability and credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of EMNH, specifically addressing its performance on more complex MOCOPs and the implications of weight vector selection. Additionally, we suggest providing more comprehensive details regarding the model architecture, hyperparameter settings, and experimental setup to enhance replicability. Furthermore, including ablation studies to verify the effects of the proposed methods and analyzing the experimental results in greater depth would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the runtime and efficiency of the fine-tuning process more clearly would benefit the overall understanding of the method's performance.
