Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new correlation statistic termed the "rearrangement correlation" ($r^{\sharp}$), which aims to capture non-linear, monotonic relationships between two samples. The authors provide theoretical results supporting this statistic and conduct extensive empirical analyses, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to traditional correlation measures like Pearson's r. The rearrangement correlation is shown to be particularly adept at estimating the coefficient of determination ($R^2$) in cases where relationships are non-linear. The authors also discuss the potential of using the percentage of variance explained by a LOWESS regression as an alternative method for measuring correlation strength, emphasizing the importance of monotonicity. However, clarity is needed regarding the relationship between $r^{\sharp}(x, y)$ and transformations of $y$, as well as the implications of $r^{\sharp}(x, y) > r^{\sharp}(x, z)$ for understanding the metric's utility.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The rearrangement correlation $r^{\sharp}$ is simple to compute and effectively captures monotonic relationships, outperforming classical measures in certain scenarios.
- The paper is well-written, with clear theoretical proofs and empirical analyses that validate the proposed statistic.
- The introduction of a new correlation measure contributes to the existing literature by addressing limitations of traditional methods.
- The authors acknowledge the importance of theoretical properties and invariance under certain transformations, enhancing the robustness of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on the specific contexts in which $r^{\sharp}$ is most beneficial, particularly compared to other methods like LOWESS regression.
- There is insufficient theoretical exploration regarding the statistic's robustness to outliers and its limiting distribution as sample size increases.
- Some sections, particularly the experimental details, are not adequately described, leading to potential confusion about the methodology.
- The paper lacks sufficient detail in addressing key theoretical questions, which may limit its appeal to a broader audience.
- The relationship between $r^{\sharp}$ and Pearson's correlation, as well as its behavior under various transformations, requires further elucidation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of when to utilize the rearrangement correlation, particularly in comparison to existing methods like LOWESS regression. Additionally, providing a more thorough theoretical analysis of the statistic's properties, including its robustness to outliers and sensitivity to monotonic transformations, would enhance its credibility. We suggest moving the proof of Theorem 1 to the appendix to streamline the main text, and further elaboration on the population interpretation of $|r^{\sharp}(X, Y)|$ would aid in understanding its practical implications. Clarifying the implications of $r^{\sharp}(x, y) > r^{\sharp}(x, z)$ for practitioners would enhance understanding. Furthermore, addressing the relationship between $r^{\sharp}(x, f(y))$ and $r^{\sharp}(x, y)$ in the context of monotonic functions would be beneficial. Lastly, we recommend revising sections of the paper to focus on these critical questions to better engage a wider audience.
