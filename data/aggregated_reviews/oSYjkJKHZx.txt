Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of self-supervised representation learning (SSL) approaches by leveraging low-rank matrix completion techniques. The authors establish a connection between SSL and matrix completion, demonstrating that optimizing SSL objectives corresponds to reconstructing the kernel matrix. Key findings include: (i) the trace maximization formulation encompasses popular SSL methods like SimCLR, BarlowTwins, and VICReg; (ii) a less incoherent matrix facilitates matrix recovery, explaining the reliance on representations over embeddings; and (iii) empirical results indicate that the trace maximization objective performs comparably to existing SSL methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing and theoretical exposition are clear, with an elegant trace maximization formulation that relates various SSL objectives.
- The analysis provides valuable insights into the relationship between incoherence and downstream performance, aligning with empirical findings.
- The paper makes significant theoretical contributions, bridging modern SSL techniques with classical models.

Weaknesses:
- Additional experimentation on the trace maximization approach for small-scale datasets is needed.
- Further exploration of incoherence results, particularly across different SSL methods, would enhance the findings.
- Some experimental details, particularly regarding CIFAR-10, are insufficiently presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of experimentation on the trace maximization approach for small-scale datasets and provide more comprehensive comparisons of incoherence across various SSL methods. Additionally, we suggest including more detailed experimental results for CIFAR-10 to clarify claims of performance equivalence to VICReg. Finally, exploring the application of distributed low-rank matrix completion approaches with theoretical guarantees could strengthen the paper's contributions.
