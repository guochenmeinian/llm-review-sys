### Key Points
This paper presents Self-prompted Chain-of-Thought (SP-CoT) as a method to automatically generate high-quality Chain-of-Thought (CoT) for Open-domain Question-Answering (ODQA) tasks. The process is structured in two stages: generating 2-hop commonsense quadruplets and connecting these to form multi-hop reasoning chains. The authors empirically demonstrate significant performance improvements across four benchmarks. The automated pipeline for generating ODQA datasets shows promise for more complex NLP tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work is well-written with clear motivations and well-designed figures that enhance understanding.  
- The proposed method yields strong performance improvements over zero-shot inference across various benchmarks and datasets.  
- The automated generation of ODMR datasets is reasonable and considers various factors, such as question repetitiveness.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a comparative evaluation with state-of-the-art methods, particularly in multi-hop question-answering.  
- Additional performance data on other CoT variants would provide a more comprehensive view of current methods.  
- The methodology could benefit from more details on the constructed ODMR datasets and the rationale behind the selection of intermediate problems.  
- Missing ablation studies weaken the depth of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative evaluation by including recent state-of-the-art methods in multi-hop QA, such as those from ACL 2023 and 2022. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed description of the constructed ODMR datasets, including their scale and the process for determining the number of intermediate problems. We also suggest including performance data on additional CoT variants to present a complete picture of the current landscape. Finally, conducting ablation studies on the pipeline would strengthen the paper's contributions.
