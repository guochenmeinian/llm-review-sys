### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to denoising user-item interaction behavior in recommender systems by introducing the Personal Loss Distribution (PLD) strategy. The authors identify that traditional methods misclassify noisy interactions due to significant overlap in loss function value distributions between noisy and normal interactions. By analyzing user-specific loss distributions, PLD effectively reduces this overlap and enhances recommendation performance through comprehensive experiments and theoretical analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces PLD, a personalized strategy that effectively addresses the overlap in loss distributions, improving the accuracy of recommendations.
- The method is supported by extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in varying noise conditions.
- The theoretical foundation of PLD is solid, with mathematical proofs validating its approach.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of homoscedastic Gaussian distribution in Theorem 1 is questionable, as the overall loss distributions do not align with this assumption based on empirical observations.
- The selection of backbone models is limited to MF and LightGCN, which may not adequately showcase PLD's effectiveness against more advanced denoising techniques.
- The paper lacks sufficient empirical evidence to support the foundational assumptions of the proposed method and does not explore variations in noise distribution across users.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the Gaussian assumption in Theorem 1, possibly by removing it or providing a more general framework. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a broader range of cutting-edge backbone models in the experiments to better demonstrate PLD's effectiveness. It would also be beneficial to include a case study with real user interactions to illustrate the denoising effects of PLD. Furthermore, addressing the variations in noise levels across users would enhance the applicability of the method in real-world scenarios. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the role of the temperature coefficient $\tau$ in their methodology to strengthen the theoretical foundation of PLD.
