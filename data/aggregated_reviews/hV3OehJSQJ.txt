### Key Points
This paper presents a new TCP mechanism, LingBo, which addresses the instability of RTTmin in wireless networks by predicting its distributions through both offline and online methods. The authors demonstrate that LingBo can achieve improved performance compared to existing TCP mechanisms by accurately perceiving RTTmin. The evaluation includes a comprehensive comparison with various congestion control algorithms, highlighting LingBo's performance in terms of throughput and latency across different network scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is the first to validate the fluctuation of RTTmin using real network traces, contributing valuable insights into its behavior.
- The evaluation is thorough, comparing LingBo against a wide range of relevant TCP mechanisms.

Weaknesses:
- The effectiveness of RTTmin perception is not adequately demonstrated in the evaluation.
- The assumption that RTTmin follows a normal distribution based solely on Figure 5 is arbitrary and requires more data for support.
- Lack of implementation details for LingBo raises questions about its practical applicability.
- The evaluation focuses primarily on latency and throughput, neglecting direct assessment of RTTmin accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the demonstration of RTTmin perception effectiveness in their evaluation. Additionally, providing more comprehensive data analysis to support the assumption of normal distribution for RTTmin would strengthen the argument. Clarifying the implementation details of LingBo, including whether it operates within the Linux kernel or user-space platforms like QUIC, would enhance the paper's robustness. Furthermore, we suggest including evaluations specifically targeting RTTmin accuracy to substantiate the claims of performance improvement. Lastly, addressing the high variance observed in delay during emulated scenarios and discussing its implications would provide deeper insights into LingBo's performance dynamics.
