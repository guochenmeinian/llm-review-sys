### Key Points
This paper presents a method to mitigate "translationese," the linguistic features in translated texts that differ from native writing. The authors propose a novel approach using machine translation and style transfer techniques, which operates directly on translationese text to produce more natively written sentences. Due to the absence of a parallel corpus for validation, the authors introduce an unsupervised validation criterion based on language model loss and semantic similarity loss. The evaluation encompasses fluency, content preservation, and the effectiveness of a translationese detector, achieving a reduction in detection accuracy to random chance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative, combining self-supervised and unsupervised learning without requiring parallel corpora.
- The method effectively reduces translationese, as indicated by automatic classifiers.
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates the challenges and solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relies heavily on automatic metrics, which may not accurately reflect human judgment regarding fluency and content preservation.
- There is a potential risk of degrading already high-quality translations, a scenario not addressed in the paper.
- Some transformations exceed mere structural changes, necessitating a more detailed qualitative analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating manual assessments, such as A/B testing with human translators, to validate the fluency and content preservation of the fixed translationese. Additionally, the authors should address the potential risks of altering high-quality translations and provide a more thorough qualitative analysis of significant transformations in the text. Clarifying the methodology behind the SPE module and the selection of temperature and threshold values would also enhance the paper's transparency.
