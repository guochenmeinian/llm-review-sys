Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the YouTubePD dataset, a publicly available multimodal benchmark for Parkinson’s Disease (PD) analysis, comprising video, audio, and facial landmark annotations from 283 videos of 16 PD subjects and 89 healthy controls. The authors propose three tasks: Facial-Expression-Based PD Classification, Multimodal PD Classification, and PD Progression Synthesis, along with corresponding baseline evaluations. The dataset aims to facilitate research in PD diagnosis and progression and is notable for being the first publicly available dataset featuring multiple modalities. The authors emphasize the dataset's utility for benchmarking generative models in few-shot regimes and highlight the reliability of their annotations, supported by an expert with over 20 years of experience in the PD domain. They also clarify that their dataset generalizes well to real-world clinical data, demonstrating its relevance and applicability. Furthermore, the authors aim to inspire an early screening tool for PD, facilitating earlier diagnosis and treatment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is a significant contribution to PD research, providing multimodal data and being the first publicly available benchmark in PD analysis.
- It includes diverse samples in terms of geography, race, and gender, enhancing its applicability.
- The paper is well organized and clearly written, with a well-defined protocol for dataset collection that can inspire future efforts to create larger PD benchmarks.
- Empirical results indicate that models trained on this dataset generalize effectively to clinical data.
- The authors have a clear ethical framework, having sought consent from public figures and ensuring compliance with legal standards.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset size is relatively small, which may impact model generalization and robustness of findings.
- Annotations appear to be provided by a single expert, raising concerns about bias and the robustness of the dataset.
- The data split methodology allows for the same patient to appear in both training and testing sets, raising concerns about potential data leakage.
- The reliance on YouTube videos may introduce variability not present in controlled clinical settings.
- There is a lack of detailed information on the informed consent process and measures taken to ensure participant anonymity, and potential biases in data collection and analysis are not thoroughly discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset size by including more subjects and videos from various platforms beyond YouTube to enhance diversity and robustness. It would be beneficial to clarify the diversity of the subjects' origins and provide more statistical information about the dataset, including class distributions and correlations. We suggest that the authors consider implementing stricter data splitting protocols to ensure that no patient appears in both training and testing sets, thereby mitigating concerns about data leakage. Additionally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the clinical implications of their work and provide more background on the rationale for their focus on facial and audio features. We recommend improving the transparency of the informed consent process by specifying how consent was obtained, including any forms used and measures for voluntary participation. Finally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion of potential biases in the data collection and analysis process, acknowledging limitations and their influence on results, as well as outlining specific measures taken to safeguard participant data and maintain anonymity throughout the research.
