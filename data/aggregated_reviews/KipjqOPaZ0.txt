Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an information-theoretic analysis of the self-supervised learning algorithm VICReg, introducing a method to study neural networks by shifting stochasticity from the networks to the input data. The authors derive an information-theoretic objective linked to VICReg and validate their assumptions empirically using ResNet-18 across various datasets, including CIFAR-10. They propose a plug-in entropy estimator that enhances the VICReg objective and demonstrate its effectiveness on the CIFAR-10 dataset. Additionally, the paper establishes a generalization bound for VICReg, providing a probabilistic guarantee on its downstream generalization ability. Furthermore, the authors investigate the impact of entropy regularization through various combinations of techniques such as BYOL, SimCLR, PairDist, and LogDet, providing empirical results on datasets like TinyImageNet and CIFAR-100 while addressing theoretical aspects and limitations of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The new analysis perspective is interesting and may have practical implications.
- The theoretical analysis is novel and well-organized.
- Empirical validation of assumptions is provided, enhancing the paper's credibility.
- The authors demonstrate a strong commitment to addressing reviewer feedback and improving the manuscript.
- Empirical results showcase the effectiveness of entropy regularization across different SSL methods.
- The manuscript includes a detailed discussion of theoretical aspects, enhancing the understanding of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- Some explanations, particularly in Section 4, lack clarity and require verification.
- The empirical analysis is limited to CIFAR-10 on ResNet-18, which may not convincingly demonstrate practical implications.
- The claim regarding the plug-in entropy estimator's benefits for other SSL methods lacks empirical support.
- Some results presented may not directly correspond to the original SimCLR and BYOL publications, raising questions about the validity of comparisons.
- The choice of datasets and architectures may limit the generalizability of findings.
- The paper contains significant errors, including missing punctuation, inconsistent notation, and grammar issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in explanations, particularly in Equation 4 and Section 4.1, where the treatment of the invariance term and the sampling of Gaussian noise should be elaborated. The empirical evaluation should be expanded to include larger architectures and more challenging datasets, such as ImageNet or TinyImageNet, to strengthen the paper's claims. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical evidence for the plug-in entropy estimator's benefits beyond VICReg and addressing the limitations of the assumptions made in the paper more explicitly. We also recommend improving the clarity of the theoretical derivation, assumptions, and limitations in the manuscript. Consider presenting results on a unified dataset and architecture pair in the main text, while deferring supplementary results to the appendix for better coherence. Finally, ensure that all empirical results are directly comparable to those in original publications to strengthen the validity of the findings and fix the identified errors and inconsistencies to enhance the overall presentation quality.
