### Key Points
This paper presents the M3LEO dataset, a large-scale, multi-modal Earth observation dataset that integrates synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and optical imagery from Sentinel-2, comprising over 17TB of data and 10 million data chips. The dataset is designed for machine learning applications and includes labeled tasks for model evaluation. The authors provide a Pytorch Lightning interface and propose three software libraries for data downloading, preprocessing, and experiment evaluation, integrating with Google Earth Engine (GEE). Experimental evidence is provided suggesting that SAR data can complement existing optical imagery models. The dataset also includes geographic splits, which are crucial for handling autocorrelated geographic data, and incorporates coherence data, enhancing its utility for remote sensing applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The M3LEO dataset addresses a significant gap in the literature by combining SAR and optical data, which are often treated separately in machine learning contexts.
- It is one of the largest ML-ready multi-modal SAR datasets available, including diverse SAR data types.
- The authors demonstrate careful handling of SAR data, showcasing domain expertise.
- Multiple software libraries facilitate future contributions and reproducibility of experiments.
- The inclusion of coherence data is a notable advantage, enhancing the dataset's utility for remote sensing applications.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's temporal and spatial coverage is limited, which may introduce bias in evaluations and lacks coverage of entire continents (e.g., Africa) and important biomes.
- The Sentinel-2 data is limited to RGB-only and smoothed, reducing its applicability for many tasks.
- The experimental section lacks depth, relying solely on a small UNet model without testing existing pretrained EO foundation models.
- The motivation for the dataset's design and the choice of downstream tasks is unclear, leaving readers uncertain about its intended applications.
- There are no benchmark comparisons with existing datasets, which could provide context for its performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including evaluations with existing pretrained EO foundation models such as Prithvi or Clay, either through fine-tuning or by using their embeddings. This would provide valuable comparisons to the UNet model used. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the Sentinel-2 imagery by including additional spectral bands such as NIR and SWIR, as RGB-only data significantly limits its utility, and clarify the rationale for excluding these bands. Addressing the dataset's sampling strategy to improve diversity and including benchmark comparisons with existing datasets would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we recommend analyzing the geographic bias due to limited coverage and providing visualizations to illustrate the effectiveness of combining coherence data. Clarifying the reasoning behind geographic splits and enhancing the related work section to include more comprehensive comparisons with existing datasets would also strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, articulating the motivation behind the dataset's design and the synergy of the SAR products would better guide the community in utilizing M3LEO effectively.
