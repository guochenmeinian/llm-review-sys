### Key Points
This paper presents a dual contrastive learning method for recommendation systems, termed RecDCL, which integrates batch-wise contrastive learning (BCL) and feature-wise contrastive learning (FCL). The authors claim that this combination addresses limitations of existing methods and enhances recommendation performance. The paper provides theoretical justifications and extensive experiments across multiple datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers a clear explanation of RecDCL and its advantages.
2. The experiments are comprehensive, validating the proposed method's effectiveness.
3. The theoretical analysis connecting BCL and FCL contributes to the understanding of contrastive learning in recommendations.
4. The inclusion of an industrial dataset adds practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for combining BCL and FCL requires further clarification, particularly regarding the benefits of FCL for recommendations.
2. Terminology issues arise, as Barlow Twins and other methods are not strictly contrastive, which may limit the technical contribution.
3. The paper lacks comparisons with more state-of-the-art self-supervised learning (SSL) methods.
4. Some sections, such as the theoretical analysis and Section 3.3, are not sufficiently clear for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind using FCL in recommendations. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed relationship between embedding size and performance, as well as including more competitors in the SSL category for comparison. The authors should clarify the rationale behind the average entropy assessment and provide a more detailed explanation of the DirectAU component in Equation 7. Furthermore, we advise reorganizing technical details, such as the correlation matrix calculation, to enhance self-containment. Lastly, addressing terminology issues and improving the writing and presentation throughout the paper would significantly benefit the overall clarity.
