### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the potential risks of misinformation pollution through large language models (LLMs) and its impact on open-domain question answering (ODQA) systems. The authors propose a threat model to assess how LLMs can generate disinformation and evaluate its effects on ODQA performance. They also introduce three defense strategies: misinformation detection, vigilant prompting, and reader ensemble, supported by preliminary experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an important and timely issue regarding LLMs and misinformation.
- It proposes an intuitive threat model that reveals significant misleading results in ODQA.
- The experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed defense strategies.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is limited to one specific type of ODQA system (retriever-reader), lacking analysis of other types.
- The novelty of the findings is questioned, as the ability of LLMs to generate misinformation is somewhat established.
- The mitigation strategies, particularly those based on QA prompts, lack sufficient detail.
- Some research questions posed in the introduction are not adequately addressed, particularly regarding the extent of misinformation generation and potential harms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail surrounding the creation of QA prompts used in their mitigation strategies. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the equation reported at line 500 to ensure its correctness and meaning. It would also be beneficial to more thoroughly address the research questions in the introduction, particularly regarding the extent of credible misinformation generation and the potential harms associated with its dissemination in various tasks. Further investigation into the effects of increasing the number of noisy documents on ODQA performance is warranted.
