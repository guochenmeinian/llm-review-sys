### Key Points
This paper presents UReader, a multimodal large language model designed for OCR-free visually-situated language understanding tasks. It utilizes instruction tuning on a diverse array of datasets, including documents, tables, charts, natural images, and webpage screenshots. The authors introduce a Shape-Adaptive Cropping Module to enhance the processing of high-resolution images and improve spatial relationship understanding. The experimental results indicate that UReader achieves state-of-the-art performance in 8 out of 10 tasks without fine-tuning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper achieves promising experimental results and demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in multiple tasks.
- The design of the Shape-Adaptive Cropping Module is innovative and effectively addresses the challenges of high-resolution image processing.
- The ablation studies provide valuable insights into the contributions of various components and auxiliary tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The model's performance on unseen datasets and tasks is not thoroughly evaluated, raising concerns about its generalization capabilities.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis with existing OCR-pipeline models, limiting the understanding of UReader's relative performance.
- Some claims regarding the novelty of UReader are questioned, as it may be viewed as an extension of existing models rather than a significant advancement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of UReader's zero-shot capabilities on unseen datasets and tasks to enhance the impact of their work. Additionally, a more comprehensive comparison with OCR-pipeline models would provide clearer insights into UReader's strengths and weaknesses. The authors should also clarify any inconsistencies regarding the training and evaluation datasets, particularly concerning DocVQA. Finally, breaking down Table 2 into multiple tables could enhance clarity regarding the effects of auxiliary tasks and the cropping module.
