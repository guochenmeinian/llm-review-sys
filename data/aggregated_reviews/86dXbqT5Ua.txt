Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a geometry-informed neural operator (GINO) designed to solve computational fluid dynamics (CFD) problems by integrating graph neural operations (GNO) and Fourier neural operators (FNO). The authors demonstrate GINO's ability to adapt to irregular discretized grids and report significant performance improvements on two large-scale datasets. The method aims to achieve discretization invariance and efficiency in processing complex geometries. Additionally, the authors discuss the integration of advanced neural network techniques, including Clifford neural layers, physics-informed U-Net, and multigrid neural solvers, to enhance the GINO model for complex 3D geometries. They propose exploring Clifford-FNO implementations and highlight the potential of multigrid training methods to improve convergence in neural network models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The combination of GNO and FNO effectively leverages local and global information, allowing for efficient processing of irregular grids.
2. The authors provide valuable datasets that could benefit the learning physical simulation community if made publicly available.
3. The paper effectively identifies and discusses relevant advancements in neural network methodologies for fluid dynamics.
4. The exploration of using Clifford neural layers and physics-informed approaches demonstrates a forward-thinking perspective on enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.
5. The consideration of multigrid methods indicates a comprehensive understanding of numerical analysis and its application to deep learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition of the $\kappa$ operator in the graph operator block lacks clarity regarding its purpose and learnability.
2. The paper does not adequately clarify the uniformity of input data types, specifically how SDF features and surface points are associated.
3. Claims of efficient graph construction are not substantiated, particularly regarding the transition from graph processing to regular grids.
4. The evaluation is limited to a single category of shapes, and comparisons with other relevant methods, particularly from the GNN family, are insufficient.
5. The current focus on a single pressure field may limit the immediate applicability of the proposed methods to more complex scenarios.
6. The finite-difference scheme referenced may introduce truncation errors, which could be problematic in turbulent regimes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the $\kappa$ operator's definition and its learnable parameters. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of how SDF features and surface points are processed uniformly. To strengthen claims of efficient graph construction, it is essential to address how the implementation ensures this efficiency. We also suggest including a broader range of datasets and conducting comparisons with representative methods from the GNN family, such as MeshGraphNet, MSGNN-Grid, and BSMSGNN, to enhance the evaluation of GINO's performance. Furthermore, we recommend improving the exploration of Clifford-FNO within the GINO model by incorporating additional fields, such as velocity and stress tensor fields, to fully leverage the capabilities of Clifford neural layers. Investigating physics-informed neural operators that compute exact derivatives from Fourier space could mitigate truncation errors associated with the finite-difference scheme. Lastly, conducting a spectral analysis to study the convergence of frequency in the context of multigrid training could provide valuable insights into model performance.
