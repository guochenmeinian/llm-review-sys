Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Federated Behavioural Planes (FBPs), a method for analyzing, visualizing, and explaining client behavior in Federated Learning (FL) systems. FBPs consist of the Error Behavioural Plane (EBP), which assesses predictive performance, and the Counterfactual Behavioural Plane (CBP), which evaluates decision-making processes. The authors propose a robust aggregation technique, Federated Behavioural Shields (FBS), to enhance security against malicious clients. While the paper claims to improve understanding and control over FL systems, it lacks sufficient experimental evidence and presents significant computational overhead.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach to analyze client behaviors in FL, filling a gap in existing literature.
- It provides a solid theoretical foundation for understanding FL dynamics.
- FBPs enhance interpretability by allowing visual identification of client clusters and trajectories.

Weaknesses:
- The method raises privacy concerns due to the requirement for plaintext local models to create the two planes.
- The computational overhead is substantial, particularly in cross-device settings with high-dimensional data.
- The reliance on a server-side validation set may introduce fairness issues, complicating anomaly detection.
- Experimental settings are overly simplistic, lacking complexity and recent robust aggregation comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the framework overview to better illustrate how the planes are created throughout FL iterations. Additionally, provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs and explore optimization strategies to mitigate overhead. Address scalability concerns by including a theoretical scalability analysis and discussing the applicability of FBPs and FBS to various model types. Introduce additional evaluation metrics that encompass communication efficiency, latency, and energy consumption. Lastly, enhance interpretability for non-experts by including intuitive explanations and practical examples, and consider conducting preliminary real-world validations to demonstrate the methods' applicability.
