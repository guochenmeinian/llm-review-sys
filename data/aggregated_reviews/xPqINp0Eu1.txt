### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the stability of random forests for regression problems, focusing on the coverage probability of prediction intervals derived from out-of-bag errors. The authors propose that their results are applicable to various random forest variants, relying on a light-tail assumption for the marginal distribution of squared responses. Theorems 1, 2, and 3 establish stability properties and coverage guarantees for predictive intervals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an interesting problem regarding the theoretical understanding of random forests.
2. It provides theoretical results on the convergence probability of prediction intervals constructed from out-of-bag errors.
3. The work presents a practical version of random forests, contributing limited but relevant theoretical insights.

Weaknesses:
1. The problem statement is unclear; the authors should clarify whether they are studying the original random forests for regression, random forest intervals, or prediction intervals from out-of-bag errors.
2. The main conclusions lack clarity, particularly regarding the stability of random forests as stated in Theorem 1. The authors should present specific expressions for \nu_{n,B} and discuss factors affecting stability rates.
3. Important definitions, such as "light tail," are missing, which are crucial for understanding the theoretical results.
4. The authors need to clarify the novelty and significance of their results, particularly regarding new technical proofs and practical implications.
5. A stronger theoretical background is necessary, referencing key works in the field, such as those by G. Biau et al. and M. Denil et al.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem statement by explicitly defining the focus of their study. Additionally, the authors should enhance the presentation of their main conclusions, particularly regarding stability rates and the specific expression for \nu_{n,B}. It is essential to include definitions for key terms like "light tail" and to discuss their implications thoroughly. The authors should also clarify the novelty of their contributions, emphasizing any new technical insights and practical guidance that could arise from their results. Finally, we suggest that the authors strengthen their theoretical foundation by citing relevant literature that addresses the stability of random forests.
