### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec), to tackle the out-of-distribution (OOD) recommendation challenge in graph neural network (GNN)-based recommender systems. The authors construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze environmental confounders affecting GNN generalization, revealing that these confounders lead to unstable correlations and poor OOD performance. CausalDiffRec employs backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the true environmental distribution, thus learning invariant graph representations. The theoretical derivation indicates that optimizing the CausalDiffRec objective function promotes environment-invariant representations, resulting in excellent OOD generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is novel and technically sound, effectively using backdoor adjustment and variational inference to enhance OOD generalization.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, with clear figures that facilitate understanding.
- The theoretical analysis supports the method's claims, and extensive experiments validate its effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The meaning of $z_{causal}$ in line 542 is unclear; clarification on whether it denotes latent embeddings or distributions is needed, along with the potential use of the reparameterized method.
- The authors should explicitly define what "environment" refers to in the context of the paper.
- The representation of green and gray dots in Fig. 2 requires clarification.
- The time and space complexity of the proposed method is not discussed, raising concerns about the inference process's efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the definition of $z_{causal}$ and consider utilizing the reparameterized method for its determination. Additionally, the authors should explicitly define the term "environment" as used in the paper. Clarification on the representation of the green and gray dots in Fig. 2 is necessary. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the time and space complexity of CausalDiffRec, as the inference process of DDPM may introduce significant computational overhead.
