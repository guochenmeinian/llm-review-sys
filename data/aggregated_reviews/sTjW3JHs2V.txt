Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for solving NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems on graphs using generative flow networks (GFlowNets). The authors propose modifications to GFlowNets to enhance credit assignment and performance on long trajectories, demonstrating their method's effectiveness through extensive experiments across various problems, including maximum independent set (MIS) and maximum clique. A significant contribution is the introduction of transition-based training and intermediate learning signals, which improve the efficiency of GFlowNet in generating diverse solution candidates. Additionally, this work opens several new follow-up directions for future research in the area of graph combinatorial optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a sound motivation for using GFlowNets in combinatorial optimization.
- The modifications made to GFlowNets are empirically justified through ablation studies and extensive benchmarking against various baselines.
- The authors demonstrate a deep understanding of GFlowNets and provide a clear introduction to their application in combinatorial optimization.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns, demonstrating the value of their work and its potential impact on future research.

Weaknesses:
- The technical novelty is somewhat limited, as many techniques are adaptations of existing ideas in GFlowNet research. The authors should clarify the distinctions between their approach and prior work.
- The selection of baselines for experiments raises concerns, particularly regarding the fairness of comparisons between GFlowNets and other methods.
- The training process and objectives are not clearly articulated, which may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with GFlowNets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing explicit descriptions of each technique used and referencing the original sources of inspiration, particularly in distinguishing their contributions from existing literature. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive comparisons with relevant baselines, particularly those that adopt a sequential perspective similar to GFlowNets. It would also be beneficial to clarify the training objectives and the role of rewards in the GFlowNet framework. Lastly, addressing the limitations of GFlowNet explicitly in the main paper would provide valuable insights for future researchers.
