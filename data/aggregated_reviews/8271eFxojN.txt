Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an identifiability analysis of linear Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) systems, focusing on scenarios with latent variables. It investigates two cases: one with latent confounders that do not exhibit causal relationships and another with confounders described by a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The authors provide sufficient identification conditions and support their theoretical findings with simulations. Additionally, the authors have added two simulations based on reviewer feedback, employing different ground-truth parameter configurations using various seeds. Currently, 10 configurations are applied to the single and multiple trajectory experiments with \(d=3, p=3\), with plans to expand this to 100 configurations and include higher-dimensional cases in the final manuscript. The simulation results provide strong empirical evidence supporting the validity of the proposed identifiability conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper significantly extends the understanding of identifiability in linear ODE systems, enhancing causal inference reliability in complex systems.
- It is well-written and organized, clearly stating necessary assumptions and contributing to the literature by addressing gaps in existing methods.
- The authors have effectively addressed reviewer concerns by enhancing the simulation setup, which increases the diversity of ground-truth examples.
- The additional simulations provide convincing empirical support for the theoretical results.

Weaknesses:
- Symbols such as $x'$ and $A'$ are not clearly defined, potentially confusing readers.
- The assumptions and theorems lack intuitive explanations, which could hinder understanding.
- The current implementation only includes 10 configurations, which may limit the robustness of the findings until the planned expansion to 100 configurations is completed.
- The simulation setup relies on a single ground-truth parameter configuration, which may not adequately reflect practical scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of symbols like $x'$ and $A'$ by providing clear definitions. Additionally, we suggest including intuitive explanations or examples for each assumption and theorem to enhance reader comprehension. To address the simulation concerns, we encourage the authors to promptly incorporate the planned 100 different configurations and higher-dimensional cases in the final manuscript to strengthen the empirical evidence further. Furthermore, providing real-world examples that satisfy the DAG structure assumption would strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
