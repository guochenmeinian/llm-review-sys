Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the online inventory control problem, specifically addressing adversarial demand within a general framework termed Online Inventory Optimization (OIO). The authors propose the MaxCOSD algorithm, achieving $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret under the assumption of lower-bounded demand. The algorithm adapts concepts from online gradient descent, utilizing a cyclical update mechanism and an adaptive learning rate. The authors also analyze the implications of their demand assumptions and conduct experiments to validate the algorithm's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is significant and applicable in real-world scenarios.
- The proposed algorithm is well-structured and easy to understand, with a general framework that encompasses various inventory setups.
- The inclusion of experiments on both synthetic and real-world data supports the algorithm's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed algorithm is questionable, as its analysis appears to follow established online gradient descent techniques, making the $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret less surprising.
- Several claims require further clarification, particularly regarding Assumption 10 and the lower bound analysis, which may lack rigor.
- Experimental results do not convincingly demonstrate MaxCOSD's superiority over existing algorithms, raising concerns about its motivation and effectiveness in adversarial settings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their algorithm by providing a clearer distinction from existing methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the assumptions made in Assumption 10 and refine the lower bound analysis in propositions 13 and 14 to enhance rigor. The authors should also consider including error bars or standard deviations in the experimental results to better illustrate the algorithm's performance. Lastly, addressing the relationship between their method and existing algorithms like AIM could strengthen the paper's contributions.
