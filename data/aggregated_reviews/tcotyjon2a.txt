Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel curriculum reinforcement learning method, CQM, which utilizes a VQ-VAE to learn a quantized goal space and constructs a graph over these goals. The curriculum is guided by uncertainty and temporal distance, facilitating the learning process. The authors evaluate CQM through experiments on PointMazes and AntMazes, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It provides extensive experiments and thorough analysis, showcasing the proposed method's effectiveness.
- The originality of the approach is notable, particularly in its use of a graph structure for curriculum learning and planning.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity regarding the suitability of VQ-VAE for graph-building is lacking, particularly concerning temporal distances between nodes.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method to prior work on representation learning, such as NORL or LESSON, which could help establish its novelty.
- The introduction of new hyperparameters (\(\alpha\), \(\beta\), and \(\kappa\)) for curriculum goal generation lacks clarity on their determination and impact on performance.
- The complexity of the method may hinder understanding, necessitating additional figures or an explicit algorithm description.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by providing additional figures that illustrate the method's details, particularly how the graph is constructed and how data is collected. It would also be beneficial to explicate the comparison against baseline methods to clarify the significance of the results. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors justify the use of VQ-VAE in graph construction and explore the implications of temporal distances more thoroughly. Additionally, a comprehensive comparison with prior work on representation learning should be included to highlight the proposed method's contributions. Lastly, the authors should clarify the selection process for the hyperparameters and investigate how their variation affects performance.
