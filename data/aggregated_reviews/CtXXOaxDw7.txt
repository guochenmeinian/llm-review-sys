Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a robust GNN explanation method for structurally corrupted graphs, addressing the significant impact of noise and corruptions on existing GNN explainers. The authors propose using variational inference to create a more resilient graph representation and formulate the problem as a graph information bottleneck (GIB) optimization problem. The method, V-InfoR, effectively generates explanation subgraphs without structural constraints and shows significant performance improvements across various datasets, including both synthetic and real-world graphs. Additionally, the paper evaluates robustness metrics on the BA-3Motifs and Mutag datasets, revealing that V-InfoR ranks among the top-tier robust methods on the Mutag dataset, demonstrating significant robustness against adversarial attacks. Conversely, on the BA-3Motifs dataset, the model's performance is in the middle range due to the lesser impact of random noise compared to adversarial attacks and the synthetic structure of the BA-3Motifs graph.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the GNN explanation problem in the context of noisy or corrupted graphs, which is novel and practically significant.
2. It considers both minor and severe corruptions, proposing a variational inference-based robust graph information extractor and an adaptive graph information constraint within the GIB module.
3. V-InfoR shows strong robustness on the Mutag dataset, particularly under adversarial conditions, highlighting its effectiveness in handling graph irregularities.
4. The writing is clear, and a theoretical analysis is provided to derive the variational bound of the objective function.
5. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements of V-InfoR compared to current state-of-the-art methods, and the inclusion of detailed robustness metrics enhances the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The necessity of the robust graph representation extractor is questionable when input graphs are reliable and contain minimal noise.
2. The focus is solely on structural corruptions, neglecting potential attribute noise in graphs, which warrants further discussion on generalization to attribute corruptions.
3. Some experimental results, particularly regarding the relationship between minor and severe corruptions, lack clarity and require better illustration.
4. The model's performance on the BA-3Motifs dataset is only moderate, limited by the inherent structure of the synthetic graphs and the nature of random noise.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between minor and severe corruptions in their experimental results. Additionally, a comparison of the proposed model's performance on clean graphs would enhance the credibility of its robustness claims. The authors should also discuss how their methods could be generalized to handle attribute noise. Furthermore, a section on the algorithm's runtime and space complexity should be included to assess its applicability to large graphs. Lastly, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion on the robustness metrics by including the latest results and insights, and address the limitations observed in the BA-3Motifs dataset to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the model's capabilities.
