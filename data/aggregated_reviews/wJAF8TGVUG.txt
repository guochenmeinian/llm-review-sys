Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents S-MolSearch, a semi-supervised contrastive learning framework for ligand-based virtual screening in drug discovery. It effectively utilizes molecular 3D information and binding affinity data to generate soft labels for unlabeled molecules, leveraging inverse optimal transport principles. The framework demonstrates superior performance compared to existing methods on the LIT-PCBA and DUD-E benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with comprehensive experimental settings and comparisons.
- The novel supervision idea and the integration of 3D molecular structures are impactful for drug discovery.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of discussion on the reasons behind performance differences, with only numerical comparisons provided.
- Insufficient experimentation regarding the time required for virtual screening and no results for metrics like AUROC or BEDROC.
- Clarity issues exist in explaining the relationship between certain components and the necessity of soft labels.
- Memory consumption concerns arise from the model's architecture, and the role of 3D structures needs clearer delineation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the reasons for performance differences and provide insights into the impact of soft labels across datasets. Additionally, the authors should include results for experimental metrics such as AUROC or BEDROC and address memory management strategies for larger molecules. Clarifying the role of 3D structures and enhancing the explanation in Section 3.4 with visual aids would also benefit comprehension. Lastly, a more detailed discussion on the model's applicability beyond binding affinity data is suggested.
