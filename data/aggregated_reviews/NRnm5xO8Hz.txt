Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the matrix sensing over graphs (MSoG) problem, a generalization of matrix completion and matrix sensing problems. The authors propose a non-convex regularized optimization method and introduce a novel â„¦-RIP condition to characterize the problem's complexity. The theoretical guarantees provided rely on the incoherence condition, demonstrating that the strict saddle property holds with high probability, thus ensuring convergence to the global minimizer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The work is original, providing the first theoretical results on the optimization landscape of the MSoG problem.  
- The theoretical analysis is rigorous, and the results are well-supported by numerical experiments.  
- The authors effectively compare existing results with their new conditions, enhancing understanding.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the work lacks real-world applications, which diminishes its practical relevance.  
- Some claims are inaccurate, such as the assertion that the matrix completion problem requires $M^*$ to be PSD.  
- The presentation is not reader-friendly, with unclear notations and organization issues that hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by reorganizing sections to better integrate the motivating examples with the problem formulation. Additionally, detailing real-world applications, such as modeling the power state estimation problem, would enhance motivation. The authors should also clarify the intuition behind the design of the incoherence regularizer and its impact on the analysis and sampling rate bounds. Finally, addressing the inaccuracies regarding the PSD requirement in matrix completion would strengthen the paper's claims.
