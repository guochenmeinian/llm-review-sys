Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive dataset, PROSPECT-PTM, aimed at enhancing machine learning applications in proteomics by providing high-quality labeled datasets of post-translationally modified peptides. The authors introduce four extensive datasets containing 1.2 million unique modified peptide sequences and 30 distinct amino acid-PTM pairs. This work addresses the critical lack of high-quality reference data for modified peptides, facilitating various downstream tasks such as retention time and fragment ion intensity prediction. The authors convincingly demonstrate the datasets' utility through benchmarking results, highlighting their significance in advancing proteomics research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with a logical flow that aids comprehension.
2. The datasets’ comprehensiveness addresses a critical gap in existing proteomics research.
3. The meticulous annotation and validation process enhances the datasets’ reliability.
4. The thorough supplement provides extensive details on the dataset's construction and methodologies.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on synthetic data from ProteomeTools may limit generalizability to natural biological samples.
2. The evaluation conclusions may seem obvious, as it is expected that PTMs affect peptide properties.
3. The dataset may not cover all possible PTMs, potentially limiting its applicability.
4. There is a potential for bias in machine learning models trained on this dataset due to the expert system used for annotation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by incorporating more natural biological samples alongside synthetic data. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct more extensive benchmarking against diverse models to fully demonstrate the datasets' impact. It would also be beneficial to clarify the type of mass spectrometer used for data acquisition and to provide user-friendly tools or code to assist researchers in utilizing the datasets effectively. Finally, we encourage the authors to include histograms of Levenshtein edit distances between peptides across splits to alleviate concerns about train-test leakage.
