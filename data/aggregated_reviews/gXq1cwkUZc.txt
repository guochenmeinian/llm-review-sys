### Key Points
This paper presents a Rewrite-Retrieve-Read pipeline for in-context learning, aiming to enhance retrieval-augmented generation by rewriting queries for better retrieval. The authors explore two rewriting methods: one using a frozen LLM and another employing a custom T5-large model trained with reinforcement learning. The approach shows solid results, particularly with the custom query rewriter. The paper evaluates its method on various QA datasets, demonstrating improvements in performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a novel method that shifts the pipeline from retrieve-then-read to rewrite-retrieve-read, which is well-motivated and clearly described.
- Empirical evaluations across multiple QA datasets support the effectiveness of query rewriting.
- The analysis provides insights into the method's inner workings, including specific examples of query rewriting.

Weaknesses:
- Claims of novelty are undermined by similarities to existing work, particularly the DSP paper, which also employs query rewriting for similar tasks.
- The reproducibility of results is questionable due to reliance on a web API and lack of details on the curated dataset for training the T5 model.
- The query rewriting examples show minimal changes, making the impact of the rewriter unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the contribution by explicitly addressing the similarities with existing approaches, particularly the DSP paper. Additionally, providing more details on the warm-up dataset, the specifics of the PPO-based training procedure, and the retriever HIT rate when using the Trainable T5 query rewriter would enhance reproducibility. A more thorough discussion on the variability of API query results and the impact of the rewriter on query changes would also be beneficial.
