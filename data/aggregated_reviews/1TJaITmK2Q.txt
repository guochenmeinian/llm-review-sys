Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for obtaining adaptive topological features for point clouds using persistent homology (PH), introducing an isometry-invariant network architecture for a weight function. The authors propose a method to learn a weighted filtration and theoretically prove that any continuous weight function can be approximated by the composite of two continuous functions that factor through a finite-dimensional space. The study aims to improve classification accuracy for labeled point clouds, particularly in the context of protein datasets, by utilizing features extracted from PH. The authors conducted experiments comparing their method's classification accuracy with existing methods such as Rips, DTM, and DistMatrixNet, noting the complexity of their method and the cubic nature of the computations involved.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of learning filtration through a weight function is innovative and supported by a significant approximation ability theorem.  
- The paper provides detailed mathematical proofs and a clear framework for the proposed approach.  
- The experimental results are convincing, demonstrating the potential of PH in classification tasks, particularly in the context of protein data.  
- The explanation of the dataset and subsampling process is thorough, clarifying the composition of the protein dataset used in experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity on how different weight functions impact the quality of topological features and the criteria for persistent diagrams.  
- There is insufficient motivation for the need for learned filtrations, and discussions on vectorization of persistent homology are flawed.  
- Some reviewer comments indicate a lack of clarity in the authors' responses regarding the limitations and sustainability of their method.  
- The classification method lacks guarantees for performance on larger or different datasets, and the implications of using their method in real-world applications are not addressed.  
- There is a lack of clarity regarding the definition of "types of proteins" and specifics of the dataset composition.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for learned filtrations by providing examples that visualize the advantages over standard filtrations like Rips and Delaunay triangulations. Additionally, we suggest including more comprehensive discussions on the criteria for good weight functions and their theoretical implications. The authors should clarify the differentiability of loss functions concerning topological features and weight functions, as well as provide more details on the data used in experiments. We also recommend improving clarity in their responses to reviewer questions, particularly regarding the limitations of their method and the sustainability of resource requirements. Explicitly specifying the parameter values for k and q used in the DTM filtration and providing references for the computational complexity claims would be beneficial. Furthermore, addressing the potential implications of their method in real-world applications, particularly concerning the use of black-box tools in critical scenarios, is essential. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider providing more rigorous guarantees regarding the performance of their method on various datasets and to visualize the learned weights for the protein dataset, comparing them with the DTM filtration to gain insights into the method's performance.
