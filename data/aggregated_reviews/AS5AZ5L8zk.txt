### Key Points
This paper presents ChatPathway, a proof-of-concept study on utilizing large language models (LLMs) for predicting biochemical reactions and pathways. The authors have curated and assembled a dataset comprising 11,944 reactions and 1,836 pathways from KEGG, enhanced with molecular structural and functional insights from UniProt and 70 PubChem, facilitating easier access. They evaluate LLMs for three tasks: (1) biochemical reaction prediction; (2) metabolism pathway prediction; and (3) regulatory pathway prediction. The authors found that GPT-3.5 excelled in pathway mapping, while Galactica faced challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is extensive and well-curated, providing valuable resources for biochemical research.  
- The evaluation of LLMs on multiple tasks offers insights into their capabilities in biochemical predictions.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited comparisons, as only GPT-3.5 and Galactica were evaluated without exploring other LLMs.  
- Lack of information regarding the public availability of the curated dataset.  
- The performance of the DAVID tool surpasses that of LLMs, raising questions about the integration of such tools.  
- Absence of error analysis, which would clarify the types and percentages of errors in LLM performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparisons by evaluating additional LLMs, such as GPT-4, LLaMA, and biomedical LLMs like BioGPT. Additionally, please clarify whether the curated dataset will be publicly available, and consider augmenting LLMs with the DAVID tool to enhance performance. Finally, we suggest providing an error analysis to detail the types and percentages of errors observed in both LLMs.
