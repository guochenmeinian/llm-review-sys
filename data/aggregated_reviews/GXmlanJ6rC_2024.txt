Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We find that the paper proposes a method to fine-tune a Stable Diffusion model for facial recognition by using an auxiliary model to control face augmentation. The qualitative results appear promising, but the quantitative evaluations are lacking. The authors conduct two evaluations: a cross-comparison of face recognition accuracy with Random Augmentation and an ablation study on mask size effects. However, the evaluations do not adequately compare against common face benchmark datasets, and the accuracy metrics used are biased. Additionally, the masking details are insufficiently explained. The paper also addresses the challenge of generating varied synthetic images while maintaining identity, utilizing a pretrained diffusion model with an object mask and an Adaptation Layer.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
Strengths include a strong motivation for the problem and the innovative approach to data synthesis that preserves identity. The method shows potential for enhancing data variation without saturation as synthetic data increases. However, weaknesses include a lack of qualitative results beyond sunglasses, insufficient comparisons to traditional augmentation methods, and grammatical errors present in the text.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest improving the evaluation by including comparisons with common face benchmark datasets and providing a clearer explanation of the masking percentage and its impact on similarity degradation. Additionally, we recommend showcasing a broader range of qualitative results beyond just sunglasses and addressing the grammatical errors throughout the paper.
