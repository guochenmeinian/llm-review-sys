Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a physical compatibility optimization framework for generating 3D shapes from a single image, integrating mechanical properties, external forces, and rest-shape geometry. The method enhances existing 3D generation pipelines by ensuring stability and accuracy of reconstructed objects under user-defined physical conditions. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through quantitative and qualitative evaluations, including real-world 3D printed results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed optimization framework is novel, versatile, and achieves state-of-the-art results.
- The introduction of physical compatibility is innovative and crucial for real-world applications.
- The paper is well-written, with detailed derivations and a clear presentation of methods and metrics.

Weaknesses:
- Limitations of the proposed method are not adequately discussed in the main paper.
- The focus on optimizing a single object may not align with the title, which suggests broader applicability.
- The discussion of alternative approaches and related work is insufficient, as it is relegated to the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their method in the main paper. Additionally, the authors should clarify the performance overhead associated with their approach by reporting shape complexity and computational time. We also suggest that the authors consider addressing the applicability of their method to multiple coupled objects and explore the potential for correcting connectivity errors during optimization. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a more comprehensive overview of related work within the main text rather than in the appendix.
