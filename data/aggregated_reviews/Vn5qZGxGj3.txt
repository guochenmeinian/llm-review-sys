Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SatBird, a dataset designed for predicting encounter rates of bird species using satellite images and environmental data, incorporating citizen science observations from eBird over 13 years across the continental USA and Kenya. The dataset is segmented into three scenarios: summer and winter in the USA, and a low-data regime in Kenya. The authors evaluate various models, including Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and ResNet-18, to assess their performance on this task. Additionally, the authors propose a novel approach to avian habitat modeling that emphasizes the integration of satellite imagery to predict fine-scale species occurrence patterns beyond traditional environmental data. They address the reliability of presence-absence data from eBird and the potential ecological value of their predictions for habitat conservation, while also acknowledging the limitations of their dataset and the need for further analysis of rapidly changing habitats.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is well-motivated, addressing biodiversity monitoring and distinguishing itself through joint modeling of bird distributions.
- It effectively utilizes domain knowledge by incorporating diverse data modalities and applying heuristic insights from eBird range maps.
- The evaluation spans different seasons and geographical locations, enhancing its applicability.
- The paper contributes significantly to the field of avian habitat modeling by integrating satellite imagery.
- The authors have made substantial revisions based on reviewer feedback, enhancing the clarity and depth of their analysis.
- The dataset is openly available, promoting further research and expansion.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of hyperparameter tuning raises concerns about the representativeness of the reported results.
- The interpretation of the multi-output regression task lacks clarity, particularly regarding the significance of the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values.
- The choice of Cross-Entropy (CE) loss for a regression task is questionable; exploring alternative losses like L1 or L2 could provide insights into performance variations.
- The analysis of results is superficial, lacking depth in understanding prediction errors and temporal shifts in bird distributions.
- The reliability of eBird data has not been systematically assessed, which may affect the validity of the encounter rate estimates.
- The analysis of incorrect predictions and their distribution lacks depth, limiting insights into model performance.
- The evaluation metrics used may not fully capture the model's performance, particularly in the context of species distribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of hyperparameter choices and conduct a hyperparameter search, particularly for the learning rate. It would be beneficial to provide context for interpreting MAE values and to justify the use of CE loss in a regression framework, potentially experimenting with L1, L2, or adaptive losses. A more thorough analysis of prediction errors and patterns should be included, along with an exploration of changes in bird distributions over time. Additionally, we suggest consolidating supplementary materials into a single, well-organized PDF that clearly describes dataset contents and access instructions. We also recommend improving the analysis of incorrect predictions to identify patterns and enhance understanding of model performance. Furthermore, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the reliability of eBird data would strengthen the validity of their findings. Lastly, exploring and reporting additional evaluation metrics that better reflect the model's performance in the context of species distribution would be beneficial. Enhancing the dataset's size and species diversity, as well as including more regions, would also strengthen its utility for conservation studies.
