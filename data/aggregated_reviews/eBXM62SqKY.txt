Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents POP-3D, an approach for open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction from images by aligning 3D features with 2D features from pre-trained MaskCLIP+. The framework employs two heads to predict class-agnostic occupancy and semantic-related features, facilitating language-grounded 3D perception. A new evaluation method tailored to 3D occupancy prediction is introduced, and experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The basic idea is clear, and the illustrations are effective.
- The motivation to tackle open-vocabulary 3D occupancy prediction is strong, and the proposed method is effective.
- The design of decomposed heads for geometry and semantic prediction is logical.
- The self-supervised learning method achieves comparable performance to supervised methods without requiring 3D manual annotations.
- Experiments comparing against the MaskCLIP+ baseline provide a comprehensive view of the proposed method's position among existing solutions.

Weaknesses:
- The method primarily relies on 2D features and pre-trained MaskCLIP+, lacking novelty in exploring 3D data for open-vocabulary perception, making the problem appear more like "pseudo-3D open-vocabulary."
- The paper does not provide sufficient background for 3D open-vocabulary occupancy prediction in driving scenarios, weakening its value.
- The new evaluation protocol addresses specific weaknesses in TPVFormer but does not fundamentally resolve issues present in recent occupancy benchmarks.
- Comparisons are limited to MaskCLIP+ as a zero-shot baseline, neglecting other relevant works that share core technical challenges.
- The evaluation is restricted to one dataset, and the lack of qualitative comparisons to MaskCLIP+ and TPVFormer diminishes the robustness of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of 3D data to enhance the novelty of their approach. Additionally, providing a clearer background for 3D open-vocabulary occupancy prediction in driving scenarios would strengthen the paper's foundation. We suggest expanding the evaluation protocol to include comparisons with more recent occupancy benchmarks and additional relevant baselines beyond MaskCLIP+. Finally, conducting evaluations across multiple datasets would enhance the generalizability of the results.
