Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RAGRAPH, a framework that integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with pretrained Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance their generalization capabilities on unseen graph data. The authors construct a toy graph vector library to facilitate the retrieval of similar graphs, thereby enriching the learning context during inference. RAGRAPH demonstrates superior performance across various tasks, including node classification, link prediction, and graph classification, without requiring task-specific fine-tuning. The authors argue that while the concept may not appear groundbreaking, the framework's ability to dynamically retrieve and integrate relevant data during inference showcases its adaptability and potential applications, particularly in recommendation systems and NLP.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The innovative use of retrieval mechanisms significantly enhances graph learning tasks.
2. The framework is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear presentation.
3. RAGRAPH maintains high performance across diverse datasets, showcasing its robustness and adaptability.
4. The authors have clarified their use of diverse datasets, including large-scale, real-world datasets, and demonstrated significant performance improvements over existing methods.
5. The paper includes additional experiments and analyses, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of the RAGRAPH framework raises concerns about the justification of specific design choices, such as the necessity of all steps in constructing the toy graph vector library and the impact of different similarity measures.
2. Some reviewers perceive RAGRAPH as lacking in novelty as a research idea, suggesting that its main contributions lie in the technical and experimental aspects rather than in the conceptual framework itself.
3. The diversity of datasets used for evaluation is limited, particularly in link prediction, which predominantly relies on e-commerce data.
4. There is a concern regarding the overall impact and originality of the proposed framework within the field.
5. The extensive hyperparameter search space complicates model optimization, and the paper lacks clarity on how to set these hyperparameters effectively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for specific design choices in the RAGRAPH framework, particularly regarding the necessity of the inverse importance sampling strategy and the four similarity measures used in the toy graph retrieval process. Additionally, conducting ablation studies would help clarify the contributions of various components to overall performance. The authors should also enhance the diversity of datasets used for evaluation, incorporating both homophilic and heterophilic datasets. Furthermore, providing detailed guidance on hyperparameter settings and including the specific configurations used in experiments would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we recommend that the authors improve the perceived novelty of RAGRAPH by emphasizing its unique contributions and potential impacts more clearly in the manuscript, as well as incorporating more detailed discussions on the implications of the framework's adaptability and its applications in various domains.
