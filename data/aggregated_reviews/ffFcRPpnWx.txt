Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents **RS-Del**, a novel certified defense that guarantees robustness against insertion, deletion, and substitution of bytes within variable-length inputs, utilizing a randomized smoothing approach. The authors propose a new certification scheme that addresses the limitations of the Neyman-Pearson lemma. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method in malware detection, achieving significant improvements over prior Hamming distance-based approaches. Furthermore, the paper certifies edit distance radii up to 128 bytes with minimal accuracy loss, corresponding to relative radii of 0â€“9% of file size. The authors analyze YARA, a widely used rule-based classification tool, revealing that 83% of matching rules are sensitive to fewer than 128 bytes, indicating that many rules can be evaded by perturbations within the certified radii.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces an innovative threat model that is refreshing in the adversarial machine learning community.
2. The writing quality is high, with clear explanations and structured ideas.
3. The method is easy to implement and shows significant improvement in performance compared to existing methods.
4. The paper addresses real-world considerations, particularly the asymmetric nature of attack profiles in malware detection.
5. The certification method for edit distance radii is robust and applicable to real-world malware detection scenarios.
6. The analysis of YARA rules supports the practical relevance of the findings, showcasing the potential for evasion through localized edits.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper may be better suited for security-focused venues rather than machine learning conferences, as the expertise required to assess its implications in malware is specialized.
2. There are missing references to related works that could strengthen the paper's context and contributions.
3. The empirical evaluation lacks comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly Jia et al. (2022), which is necessary for a more robust analysis.
4. The discussion on the performance of baselines by Jia et al. and Levine & Feizi may lack clarity for readers unfamiliar with the statistical estimation methods involved.
5. The reliance on rounding effects in the binary setting could benefit from further elaboration to enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including Jia et al. (2022) as a baseline comparison, as this is essential for validating their claims. Additionally, the authors should provide more context regarding the implications of their certified guarantees in terms of typical malware sizes and how these guarantees relate to real-world scenarios. It would also be beneficial to clarify the differences between RS-Del and existing methods like randomized ablation, particularly in the context of substitution settings. Furthermore, we suggest improving the clarity of the discussion surrounding the performance of baselines by Jia et al. and Levine & Feizi, particularly for readers less familiar with the statistical methods. Lastly, providing a more detailed explanation of the implications of rounding effects in the binary setting would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
