### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical foundation for the fixed points in the DDIM inversion process, establishing their existence and uniqueness using the Banach fixed-point theorem. The authors propose an optimization criterion to enhance convergence and visual quality in image editing and introduce a text-based approach for unsupervised image dehazing. The effectiveness of these contributions is demonstrated through experiments, although the results show only marginal improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides a clear motivation and necessary background, with well-structured derivations that are easy to follow.  
2. The fixed-point analysis is insightful, and the new optimization criterion is both creative and straightforward to implement.  
3. The experiments, while limited, sufficiently demonstrate the proposed method's potential in image editing and dehazing tasks.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The theoretical conclusions contain inaccuracies that need addressing, particularly regarding the clarity of vector inequalities in the derivations.  
2. The motivation behind certain equations and the implications of key inequalities are not adequately explained, leading to confusion.  
3. The experimental results show only marginal improvements in image editing quality, raising questions about the method's practical merits and its robustness against complex nonlinear degradations.  
4. There is a lack of detailed computational resource requirements and statistical significance tests, which limits reproducibility and interpretability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical derivations, particularly by justifying the assumptions made regarding vector inequalities. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough explanation of the motivation behind key equations and the implications of their findings. We suggest conducting more extensive experiments across a wider range of image restoration tasks to validate the generalization ability of the fixed point theory. Lastly, including detailed computational resource requirements and statistical significance tests would enhance the reproducibility and interpretability of the results.
