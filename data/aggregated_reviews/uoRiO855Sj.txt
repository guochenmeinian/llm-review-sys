Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Incremental Minimax Risk Classifier (IMRC) designed to enhance continual learning by effectively utilizing forward and backward learning to address evolving tasks. The authors provide theoretical guarantees regarding the performance of IMRCs based on expected quadratic changes in tasks and the number of tasks. The method is empirically validated across multiple datasets, demonstrating improvements over existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel approach that relaxes the typical i.i.d. assumption, focusing on independent differences between subsequent task distributions.
- It offers a thorough theoretical analysis and empirical validation, showing performance guarantees and effective sample sizes.
- The experimental design includes a diverse set of datasets and comparisons with multiple baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks depth, with outdated baselines and insufficient discussion on computational complexity and runtime trade-offs.
- The paper is not self-contained, requiring frequent reference to the appendix for understanding methods and datasets.
- The clarity of figures and notation is compromised, leading to potential confusion for readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a table summarizing all notations used. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include comprehensive details about the characteristics of the datasets and how they align with the independence assumption. We suggest discussing the runtime trade-offs associated with the backward learning process and clarifying the implications when the main assumption of independence breaks. Finally, enhancing the presentation of figures, particularly by clarifying the meanings of symbols and lines, would significantly aid reader comprehension.
