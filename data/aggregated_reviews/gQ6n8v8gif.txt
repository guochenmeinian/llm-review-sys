### Key Points
This paper presents HSDirSniper, a novel denial-of-service (DoS) attack targeting Tor onion services by purging descriptor entries from hidden service directories (HSDirs). The authors demonstrate that an adversary can effectively exhaust the cache of a 2GB RAM HSDir, preventing client access to the onion service approximately 92% of the time during the attack. The paper includes a theoretical analysis of the attack's cost and discusses potential defenses, although the practical implementation and ethical considerations of the experiments conducted on the real Tor network raise concerns.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a significant and timely attack that is imperceptible to the target.
- The theoretical estimations align closely with experimental results, indicating a robust evaluation.
- The logical organization of the paper enhances clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical framework lacks clarity, with several equations and terms inadequately explained.
- The experimental setup is insufficiently detailed, raising questions about the validity of the results.
- Ethical considerations regarding the impact of the attack on other services in the Tor network are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical framework by providing detailed explanations for terms and equations, particularly regarding the use of $n_i$ and the implications of $C$. Additionally, we suggest supplementing the experimental section with comprehensive details about the hidden services used, the experimental environment, and how ethical concerns were addressed during the experiments. It would also be beneficial to include a quantitative comparison of HSDirSniper with previous attacks, such as the Eclipse attack, to strengthen the evaluation. Finally, we advise revising the manuscript to eliminate typographical errors and to enhance overall clarity by simplifying the language used throughout the paper.
