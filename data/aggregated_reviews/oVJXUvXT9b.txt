### Key Points
This paper presents ASPIRO, a method for verbalizing single RDF triples as part of data-to-text generation. The authors propose a processing pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) through two main components: (i) n-shot example generation, where a LLM generates verbalizations that are validated by a rule-based parser, and (ii) consistency checking, which further refines the output. The results indicate that ASPIRO achieves competitive performance compared to the finetuned BART model, as evidenced by experiments on the DART and Rel2Text datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work demonstrates the utility of LLMs in generating single RDF triples, reducing the reliance on training data.
- The pipeline's iterative validation process enhances output controllability and reduces erroneous results.
- The paper is well-written, with clear articulation of motivation and contributions, and employs multiple automated metrics for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's readability is hindered by excessive mathematical formulations, obscuring key points.
- The complexity of the processing pipeline raises concerns about its practicality and cost, which are not adequately addressed.
- The limited experimental scope, primarily on the DART dataset, raises questions about the generalizability of the proposed method.
- There is no ablation study provided to assess the importance of individual components.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reducing the number of mathematical expressions and enhancing the readability of Section III. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on other standard datasets such as WebNLG and E2E NLG to validate the method's effectiveness across diverse scenarios. It would also be beneficial to include an ablation study to evaluate the impact of the consistency validator on overall performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider releasing their code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility.
