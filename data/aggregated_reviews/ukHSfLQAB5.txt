### Key Points
This paper presents VilLain, a self-supervised learning method aimed at learning node representations in hypergraphs without relying on external input features or output labels. VilLain employs virtual labels (v-labels) to propagate sparse probability distributions as feature vectors for nodes, resulting in versatile and accurate embeddings applicable to various tasks, including node classification, node retrieval, and hyperedge prediction. The methodology is sound, with tailored loss functions that align with observed higher-order label homogeneity patterns, and the experimental design showcases the method's versatility across multiple tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The requirement-free approach is innovative and addresses significant challenges in hypergraph learning.
- The methodology is well-detailed, with comprehensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of VilLain across various tasks.
- The paper achieves superior performance on multiple downstream tasks, showcasing its applicability.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity in the explanation of loss terms and their motivations needs enhancement, particularly regarding the choice of cosine similarity and normalization techniques.
- Some figures, like Fig. 3, do not adequately represent the overall framework of VilLain, lacking essential elements such as loss functions.
- The paper relies on outdated baselines for certain tasks, necessitating the inclusion of more recent comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of loss term explanations, particularly by providing intuitive justifications for the choice of cosine similarity in Equation 6 and the differing normalization techniques used in Equations 5, 6, and 1. Additionally, we suggest revising Fig. 3 to include all critical components of the VilLain framework or providing a pseudo-code algorithm for better understanding. The authors should also consider incorporating more recent baselines for tasks like hyperedge prediction, node clustering, and node retrieval to strengthen their comparative analysis. Furthermore, addressing typographical errors and enhancing the depth of the homogeneity analysis in Section 4 would improve the overall quality of the paper.
