Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework, termed Multi-modal Zero-shot Offboard Panoptic Perception (ZOPP), designed for autonomous driving applications. The authors propose an innovative approach that integrates zero-shot recognition capabilities with 3D representations from point cloud data, enhancing the model's ability to interpret complex driving environments without extensive labeled datasets. The framework aims to create 3D labels for autonomous driving scenes, leveraging advanced recognition technologies validated on the Waymo dataset.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed work is significant and unique, pushing advancements in autonomous driving.
2. ZOPP is capable of handling diverse data types, making it more robust than existing models.
3. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with extensive experiments yielding good results.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript lacks substantive solutions to labeling constraints and fails to address computational resources, costs, and necessary hardware specifications.
2. The presentation is incoherent, undermining clarity and comprehensibility.
3. The evaluation is limited, providing insufficient empirical evidence to support claimed advancements.
4. The manuscript does not adequately detail training and testing procedures, lacking methodological transparency.
5. The proposed work appears to combine existing modules without significant innovation, despite competitive validation results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by addressing the labeling constraints more thoroughly and providing a specific labeling mechanism to counter these challenges. Additionally, the authors should include details regarding the computational resources, costs, and hardware specifications to enhance feasibility and scalability. We suggest restructuring the manuscript for better coherence and clarity. Furthermore, the authors should provide a comparative analysis with existing works and include detailed information about the training and testing procedures to ensure methodological transparency. Lastly, we encourage the authors to present quantitative results for their point completion module to strengthen the evaluation.
