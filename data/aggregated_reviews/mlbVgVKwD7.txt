Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset that models blockchain transactions as local graphs for individual tokens and relationships between tokens as global graphs, forming a Graphs of Graphs (GoG) system. The authors aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of token classifications and anomaly detection, leveraging a dataset that integrates label information at the token level across multiple blockchain platforms. The authors acknowledge several limitations, including the potential for multiple accounts by a single entity distorting interaction patterns, the incomplete labeling of tokens by blockchain explorers, and privacy concerns arising from the public nature of blockchain data. They emphasize that their model is intended to augment human judgment rather than replace it, with predictions requiring further scrutiny.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is sizeable and valuable for the graph representation learning community.
- The hierarchical graph structure is interesting, and the authors provide detailed documentation of the dataset collection and experimental processes.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The authors have effectively addressed most concerns raised by reviewers, leading to increased confidence in the dataset's utility for the graph machine learning and blockchain community.
- The dataset offers a structured approach to analyzing complex blockchain interactions, highlighting unique challenges and opportunities for machine learning.

Weaknesses:
- The relevance of the proposed learning task is unclear due to vague explanations regarding the creation and reliability of labels.
- The dynamic nature of the dataset is not adequately addressed, particularly in the analysis and experiments.
- The global graph appears static, lacking a dynamic representation that could enhance its utility.
- The dataset's reliance on potentially misclassified tokens and the incomplete labeling of new tokens may limit its predictive capabilities.
- Privacy issues related to linking transactions to wallet addresses could lead to unwanted surveillance or targeted advertising.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of underlying blockchain concepts, particularly regarding 'accounts' and their implications for the dataset. The authors should provide more clarity on the dynamic aspects of the dataset, including temporal features and how they influence the analysis. We suggest that the authors justify the creation of global edges and provide a more detailed explanation of how labels are derived, particularly for categories like 'fraud.' Additionally, we recommend improving the clarity of how labels are derived and what each category represents, ensuring that the labeling process is transparent and well-justified. We also suggest conducting a formal statistical analysis to support claims about the performance of GoG models compared to individual GNN models. Furthermore, addressing the computational demands of GoG models in the context of blockchain data could enhance the robustness of their findings. Finally, the authors should enhance the discussion on the practical value of their model, especially in relation to existing blockchain explorer labels and the ethical implications of misclassification, and consider discussing the implications of using blockchain snapshots more thoroughly, weighing the pros and cons to inform future research directions.
