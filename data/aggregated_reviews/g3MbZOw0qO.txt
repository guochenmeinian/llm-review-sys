Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dual-learning model aimed at reconciling the phenomena of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. The model comprises two learning processes: task-based learning, which is fast and adaptable, and feature-based learning, which is slower and specific to training conditions. The authors demonstrate that their model, structured as a hierarchical neural network, successfully reproduces key findings from perceptual learning experiments, including specificity in condition-specific training and transfer in varied training conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper introduces a novel computational model that effectively addresses the conflicting phenomena of specificity and transfer in perceptual learning. It is well-written, well-motivated, and successfully replicates classical findings from psychophysical experiments, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:  
The modeling choices complicate the interpretation of results and obscure connections to known biological mechanisms. Specific concerns include unclear justifications for weight updates in feature-based learning, the lack of clarity regarding task-based networks, and the absence of ablation studies to support design choices. Additionally, the paper does not adequately address the limitations of non-biological components in the model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their modeling choices, particularly regarding the justification for tying weights in feature-based learning and the implications of task-based networks. It would be beneficial to run ablation studies on all experimental results to enhance interpretability. We also suggest providing more detail on the biological relevance of the model and addressing the limitations posed by its non-biological components. Furthermore, clarifying the definitions of the difficulty and discrimination thresholds, as well as the statistical significance of observed differences, would strengthen the paper.
