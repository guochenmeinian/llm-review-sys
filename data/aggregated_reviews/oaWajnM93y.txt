### Key Points
This paper presents CREAM, a Consistency Regularized Self-Rewarding Language Model aimed at enhancing the performance and reliability of self-rewarding language models (SRLMs). SRLMs utilize the same model for both policy and reward, which can lead to bias accumulation and unreliable preference data. CREAM introduces a consistency regularization approach to ensure preference consistency across iterations, thereby stabilizing training and mitigating bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and logically structured, facilitating reader comprehension of the problem, methodology, and results.
2. It addresses the significant issue of data noise in SRLMs, which is a practical concern in the field.

Weaknesses:
1. The method lacks novelty, as similar regularization approaches addressing pairwise data noise have been explored in prior works, such as those in [1,2]. Other methods, like data distillation, also tackle noise, as seen in [3].
2. Experimental comparisons are inadequate; the paper primarily contrasts CREAM with SRLM, neglecting other relevant methods in preference optimization that also address data noise, such as those in [1] and [2].
3. The method appears to significantly increase computational costs due to the necessity of multiple reward calculations during training for consistency assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by clearly distinguishing CREAM from existing methods addressing data noise. Additionally, the authors should enhance their experimental comparisons by including a broader range of preference optimization techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the computational cost implications of their method and consider potential strategies to mitigate increased resource demands.
