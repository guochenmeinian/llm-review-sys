Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a strategy named FedEgoists aimed at enhancing collaboration in cross-silo federated learning (FL) scenarios, particularly within competitive business environments. The authors propose a theoretically sound framework that effectively addresses the free-riding problem and minimizes conflicts of interest among federated learning participants (FL-PTs). The FedEgoists strategy ensures optimal coalition formation, preventing any coalition from improving its utility by merging with another. The paper validates its approach through experiments on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The research addresses a timely and relevant issue in cross-silo FL, considering both self-interest and competition.  
- The proposed framework is theoretically robust and solves an interesting optimization problem.  
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the FedEgoists strategy, and the presentation is clear and well-organized.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks rigor in certain areas, particularly regarding the central server's role, which introduces a single point of failure and may conflict with FL's decentralized nature.  
- Assumptions about FL-PTs accurately reporting competitive relationships raise concerns about privacy and potential manipulation.  
- The novelty of the graph-related techniques and the clarity of propositions need further elaboration.  
- The experiments are limited in scope, lacking sufficient datasets and baselines to support the findings comprehensively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of the paper by addressing the centralization issue and clarifying the implications of relying on a central server. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the novelty of the graph techniques and the meaning of propositions 1 and 2. To strengthen the empirical validation, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments, including ablation and hyperparameter studies, and considering a broader selection of baseline approaches for comparison.
