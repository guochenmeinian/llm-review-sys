Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Diffusion Trusted Q-Learning (DTQL), a novel method for offline reinforcement learning that introduces a diffusion trust region loss to enhance policy updates. The authors propose a dual-policy framework that combines a diffusion policy trained by behavior cloning with a one-step Gaussian policy, aiming to improve expressiveness and computational efficiency. The empirical evaluation demonstrates DTQL's performance on D4RL benchmarks, showing improvements over traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The diffusion-based trust region loss is novel and interesting.
2. The method is well-motivated, addressing multi-step inference issues in diffusion policies.
3. Solid empirical results provide intuitive understanding and benchmark performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance improvements over existing methods like DQL and IDQL are not substantial, with some experiments showing IDQL outperforming DTQL.
2. The writing contains language issues and lacks coherence, particularly in explaining the proposed method and its necessity.
3. The empirical results rely on a single seed for ablation studies, reducing their reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the writing, particularly in Section 2, by providing more detailed explanations of the proposed method and the trust region concept in Equation 4. Additionally, we suggest that the authors avoid over-claiming the capabilities of the distilled policy and ensure that the empirical results are presented with multiple seeds to enhance their credibility. Finally, consider reorganizing the introduction for better clarity and addressing the language issues throughout the paper.
