Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Bayesian method for separating superimposed sources using diffusion-based generative models, specifically targeting the single-channel source separation (SCSS) problem for RF signals. The authors propose a method that utilizes maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation with an Î±-posterior and employs score distillation sampling (SDS) to enhance performance across varying noise levels. Experimental results indicate significant improvements in bit error rate (BER) and mean squared error (MSE) compared to classical and existing score-based methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly articulates its contributions, including the innovative use of diffusion generative models in a Bayesian framework for source separation.  
- Experimental results demonstrate substantial performance gains, with reductions in BER of up to 95% over traditional methods.  
- The approach could influence future research directions in score-based optimization problems beyond SCSS.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis explaining the superior performance of the proposed method.  
- The requirement for known scale factors and the distribution of interference signals limits the practical applicability of the method in real-world scenarios.  
- The focus on two-source separation may restrict the broader applicability of the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of the proposed method, particularly regarding how the algorithm leads to local extrema and the implications of minimizing the approximated loss. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed explanation of the experimental setup, including justifications for the choice of noise levels and the scaling factor. We also suggest increasing the resolution of figures for clarity and conducting more ablation studies to explore the effects of random versus fixed noise levels. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the assumptions necessary for successful source separation would enhance the paper's robustness.
