Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improved algorithm for the Adaptive Stochastic Quantization (ASQ) problem, enhancing computational efficiency compared to existing methods. The authors propose the QUIVER algorithm, along with its accelerated variant for \( s = 3 \) and an approximation variant, achieving significant reductions in time complexity from \( O(sd^2) \) to \( O(sd) \) and space complexity from \( O(d^2) \) to \( O(sd) \). The paper includes numerical experiments demonstrating these improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a problem of practical relevance and presents clear motivations for adaptivity and unbiasedness.
- Technical aspects, including formulations and proofs, are well-articulated and correct.
- The simulation study is comprehensive and informative.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for ASQ lacks clarity, particularly regarding the source of redundancy and the benefits of stochasticity.
- Presentation issues are evident, including grammatical errors and undefined abbreviations.
- The formal statement of the ASQ problem is delayed, and foundational definitions are insufficiently covered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for ASQ by explicitly discussing the source of redundancy and how the method exploits it. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the benefits of stochasticity compared to classical methods like the Lloyd algorithm. We suggest presenting the ASQ problem earlier in the paper and providing clearer definitions for all parameters and abbreviations. Furthermore, proofreading for grammatical errors and enhancing the overall presentation will strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the role of the SMAWK algorithm and its significance within the QUIVER framework.
