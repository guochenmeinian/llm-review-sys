### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for approximating the per-example gradient norm, leveraging the assumption of normally distributed layer inputs. The authors propose an efficient approximation called Scaled Output Gradient Noise Scale (SOGNS), which operates with linear complexity, contrasting with previous methods that require quadratic complexity. The practical value of this work lies in simplifying gradient norm computation during training and using it as a metric for evaluating large-scale experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is easy to follow, with coherent mathematical grounding.
2. Visual charts enhance understanding of concepts and evaluation of results.
3. The SOGNS method is efficient, providing accurate per-example gradient norms at negligible cost, suitable for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
1. Important information is missing, including a limitations section, risks section, and an ablation study, making it difficult to assess the work's impact on the state-of-the-art.
2. There is no way to reproduce results due to the lack of code links, details on examples, datasets, and hardware setup, which raises questions about the reported results.
3. The practical value of the work is unclear, with insufficient evidence or recommendations on how to utilize the proposed method as a metric.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by including a limitations section, a risks section, and conducting an ablation study to clarify the method's impact. Additionally, providing a link to the code, along with detailed information on the number of examples, datasets, and hardware setup, would enhance reproducibility. Finally, we suggest that the authors clarify the practical value of their work by offering explicit recommendations on how to use the SOGNS as a metric and presenting clearer examples of its benefits.
