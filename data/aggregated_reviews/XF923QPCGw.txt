### Key Points
This paper presents a study on regularized Graphon Mean-Field Games (GMFGs), addressing two primary problems: establishing the existence of a Nash Equilibrium (NE) for any $\lambda$-regularized GMFG and proposing efficient algorithms for learning the NE in weakly monotone GMFGs. The authors utilize weaker conditions than prior works on unregularized GMFGs and $\lambda$-regularized MFGs. They introduce a discrete-time algorithm with a derived convergence rate under weakly monotone conditions and analyze an action-value function estimation procedure, which is absent in existing algorithms for monotone GMFGs. Empirical evaluations support the efficiency of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively uncovers the connection between MFG and GMFG, particularly through the use of $\lambda$-regularized MFG in Proof 1, enhancing understanding of NE.
- The application of policy mirror descent for general function approximation is commendable, adding depth to the methodology.
- The theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithm are convincing, with clear presentation of results and explicit assumptions.

Weaknesses:
- The paper contains numerous notations, which may complicate understanding given the complexity of GMFG.
- Some results, particularly regarding offline RL-based approximation of value functions, may be impractical.
- The Lipschitz assumption on $W$ is questioned for its necessity, and the proof of Theorem 4 lacks surprising elements.
- The experimental results are limited to toy problems, raising concerns about the applicability of findings to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by reducing the complexity of notations and providing intuitive explanations for key concepts, such as weak monotonicity. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the practical implications of the offline RL-based approximation results and addressing the necessity of the Lipschitz assumption on $W$. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with alternative settings to enhance the theoretical context and applicability of the findings. Lastly, providing concrete examples of real-world applications for the existence theorem would strengthen the motivation for the paper's contributions.
