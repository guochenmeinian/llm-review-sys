### Key Points
This paper presents a study demonstrating that LLMs can memorize and retrieve encrypted data while maintaining performance on original tasks. The authors propose using two encryption methods with different data distributions for LLM training, and the experimental results indicate that LLMs can handle encrypted data without degrading task performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces innovative work on LLMs' ability to memorize encrypted data, suggesting potential applications as a watermarking scheme or secret communication channel.  
- It provides a thorough examination of the pros and cons under various configurations.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to AES and Shift cipher, which is acceptable given it is the first work on this topic.  
- The methodology lacks clarity and requires more details or equations for better understanding.  
- The organization needs improvement, particularly in the order of the experiment and methodology sections, and the conclusion is excessively lengthy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by including more details or equations. Additionally, restructuring the organization of the paper, especially the experiment and methodology sections, would enhance readability. Finally, we suggest condensing the conclusion to focus on key findings.
