Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark for vision-language models (VLMs), evaluating them across eight critical aspects: unbiasedness, fairness, knowledge, multilinguality, reasoning, robustness, toxicity mitigation, and perception. The authors compile existing datasets and adapt them through various augmentations, testing 18 VLMs on 19 datasets. The findings indicate that no single model excels across all evaluated aspects, which is a notable observation but not particularly novel.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper provides a significant contribution by establishing a unified evaluation framework for VLMs, covering a broad range of aspects.  
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making it easy to follow.  
- The use of clever augmentations to create new scenarios enhances the evaluation's comprehensiveness.  
- The website interface allows users to explore performance scores in detail.

Weaknesses:  
- The metrics used for evaluation are not comprehensive, particularly lacking in depth for aspects like unbiasedness and fairness.  
- Some findings, such as the lack of a single best model, are not particularly insightful or novel.  
- The paper could benefit from additional discussions on performance trade-offs between the evaluated aspects.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the metrics by including more diverse types, particularly for unbiasedness and fairness, potentially incorporating human validation where necessary. It would be beneficial to delve deeper into the robustness of VLMs, addressing various dimensions such as distribution shifts and adversarial attacks. Additionally, we suggest including calibration and uncertainty aspects from the original HELM work and evaluating the quality of translations used in augmentations. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide tables summarizing performance scores in the paper and discuss potential performance trade-offs among the eight aspects.
