Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SpatialRGPT, aimed at enhancing spatial reasoning abilities in Visual Language Models (VLMs) through a data curation pipeline and the Open Spatial Dataset (OSD). The authors propose a model that integrates depth information for improved spatial representation and evaluation. Experimental results indicate that SpatialRGPT performs comparably to state-of-the-art models on standard visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks and demonstrates practical applications in robotics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a data curation pipeline and the OSD facilitates spatial relation learning and is accessible for future research.
2. The integration of depth information into VLMs is a novel approach that enhances spatial reasoning accuracy.
3. The paper is well-organized and presents strong experimental results, showcasing significant improvements over existing models.

Weaknesses:
1. The use of 3D axis-aligned bounding boxes for object size measurement may lead to inaccuracies, and the authors should provide results on how this affects overall data quality.
2. The annotation process for real-world applications requires manual definition of regions of interest, limiting broader applicability.
3. SpatialRGPT's performance on width and height reasoning is concerning, as it underperforms compared to GPT-4V, raising questions about the utility of the object size data.
4. The evaluation methodology may introduce bias, as the SpatialRGPT-Bench shares the same data creation pipeline as the training data, potentially inflating performance metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the size of SpatialRGPT used in experiments and ensure that the evaluation set questions do not favor the model due to formatting similarities with training data. Additionally, the authors should analyze the impact of using 3D detectors on SpatialRGPT-Bench and clarify the model's architecture, particularly regarding the input of RGB and depth maps. Addressing the limitations and questions raised in the reviews, such as the necessity of updating all model parameters during Visual Instruction-tuning and the representation of region-level features, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, correcting typos and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper will enhance readability.
