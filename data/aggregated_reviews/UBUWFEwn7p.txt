Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new kernel for time-series modeling based on nonlinear vector autoregressive delay embeddings, demonstrating faster and more accurate performance compared to existing kernels. The authors contribute by introducing a kernel applicable to both univariate and multivariate time series, achieving state-of-the-art results on real-world datasets, and establishing theoretical connections to Takens' theorem and state space reconstruction. The method is characterized by a small number of intuitive hyperparameters, making it efficient for smaller datasets, although it may not be suitable for larger ones.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and effectively connects various technical areas, particularly reservoir computing and nonlinear vector autoregressive models. The core idea is elegant, significantly impacting the efficiency of the approach. The authors provide comprehensive discussions on asymptotic complexity, qualitative notes, and visualizations, enhancing understanding. The empirical results indicate that the proposed kernel is both accurate and efficient.

Weaknesses:  
The authors only utilize 122 UCR unimodal datasets, while the latest benchmark includes 128, raising questions about this choice. Similarly, the UEA corpus is underutilized with only 22 datasets instead of the expected 30. The interpretation of graphs, particularly Fig 2, is challenging in black and white. The paper lacks a thorough discussion on the stability of reservoir computing techniques and the implications of hyperparameter choices. Additionally, the complexity analysis could benefit from direct comparisons with competing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the rationale behind using only 122 UCR datasets and 22 UEA datasets. Improving the interpretability of graphs, especially for black-and-white printing, would enhance accessibility. A more detailed discussion on the stability of reservoir computing techniques and the significance of hyperparameter choices is warranted. We suggest including a direct comparison of complexity with competing methods to provide a clearer understanding of efficiency. Additionally, an ablation study isolating the effects of lags and products would help identify their contributions to accuracy. Finally, consider discussing the relationship between the proposed method and Gaussian process models to broaden the context of the work.
