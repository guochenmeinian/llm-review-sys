Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method to enhance language models (LMs) by enabling them to utilize external tools during decoding, such as calculators and retrieval systems. The authors propose a technique where human-written examples of API calls are used to generate a fine-tuning dataset, which improves LM performance across various tasks. The experimental results indicate that the Toolformer outperforms larger models in many scenarios, suggesting a significant contribution to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a novel idea supported by extensive experimental results.
- The proposed method elegantly integrates tools with LMs using limited human-written examples, showcasing the potential to address common limitations of LMs.
- The experimental setup is well-designed, leading to informative analyses and demonstrating performance improvements.

Weaknesses:
- Experiments are limited to GPT-j, a non-instruction tuned model, which raises concerns given the existence of more powerful open-source LLMs like LLaMA and Vicuna.
- The method's dependency on fine-tuning for new tools may hinder broad applicability.
- The use of square brackets for the "<API>" token could interfere with standard text usage, and the paper lacks a thorough error analysis of failure modes during inference.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the breadth of their experiments by including more advanced models such as LLaMA and Vicuna to validate the proposed method's effectiveness. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the sample efficiency and the performance of the model with multiple or nested API calls would enhance the understanding of the method's limitations. An ablation study on the filtering threshold for API-augmented sentences could provide insights into the learnability of tool-use. Finally, a thorough examination of failure cases during inference would clarify the reasons behind the LM's inability to effectively utilize tools.
