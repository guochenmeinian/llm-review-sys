Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into quantization methods for Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on reducing computational and memory resources through lower precision formats. The authors explore block-based quantization methods, particularly Block Floating Point (BFP), demonstrating that these can achieve nearly lossless 6-bit and 4-bit quantized LLMs. The study provides insights into numerical scaling offsets and the impact of mismatches between activation and weight distributions. The authors validate their approach through extensive experiments, comparing their methods against traditional techniques across various language processing tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a comprehensive analysis of quantization methods for LLMs, achieving significant improvements in arithmetic and memory density.
- It introduces innovative non-linear quantization strategies and demonstrates their effectiveness without requiring data calibration or re-training.
- The extensive experiments validate the proposed methods, showing consistent performance improvements across multiple tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in the description of hyperparameter optimization and its implications, making it difficult to fully understand the experimental setup.
- There is no implementation of quantization methods on GPU systems, limiting the demonstration of real speedups.
- The evaluation is primarily focused on language modeling, with limited exploration of other modalities, such as computer vision.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the hyperparameter search description, specifically detailing the search space and the impact of hyperparameter optimization on model performance. Additionally, the authors should consider implementing their quantization methods on GPU systems to demonstrate potential speedups. Providing detailed ablation studies to isolate the impact of block-based quantization and addressing the limitations of their evaluation across different model architectures would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, including specific metrics on memory density sacrifices when using mixed precision would provide valuable insights.
