### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for extracting and converting information from lengthy videos into coherent story text in a zero-shot setting. The authors propose using various multimodal models to aggregate textual information, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in generating high-quality story text and its performance in downstream video understanding tasks. Additionally, the paper introduces a classification dataset for advertising video persuasion strategies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a feasible framework for long video understanding and generation, with detailed design descriptions and experimental validation.
- It releases a dataset for classifying advertising video persuasion strategies, contributing to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed framework shows significant similarity to existing visual understanding frameworks, lacking sufficient novelty.
- The paper does not adequately address the complexities of long video understanding, such as multi-camera transitions and varying video lengths.
- Hallucination examples are provided, but failure examples of individual pipeline components are not discussed.
- Missing details regarding the persuasion strategy dataset, including brand selection and annotator information, weaken the contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their framework by clearly distinguishing it from existing methods. Additionally, the authors should delve deeper into the complexities of long video understanding, addressing aspects like multi-camera transitions. It would be beneficial to include failure examples of individual components in the pipeline and provide more comprehensive details about the persuasion strategy dataset, such as the selection of brands and the number of unique annotators involved. Furthermore, we suggest including metrics like top-5 accuracy and **mAP** for the multi-label nature of persuasion strategies in the dataset. Lastly, the authors should clarify the evaluation process for the zero-shot results on the persuasion strategy dataset.
