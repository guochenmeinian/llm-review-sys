### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to constructing Rashomon sets for sparse generalized additive models (GAMs) using an ellipsoid to approximate the optimal solution set. The authors demonstrate that these Rashomon sets enable users to estimate variable importance, enforce monotonic constraints, and interact with the shape functions of GAMs. The paper includes a rich experimental section, comparing the proposed algorithm with others and showcasing favorable results across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Addresses a novel problem of constructing Rashomon sets for sparse GAMs, highlighting the significance of the research.  
- Provides a new perspective on editable GAMs and proves upper and lower bounds of variance importance.  
- Presents rigorous formulation, a novel algorithm, clear presentation, and favorable experimental results.

Weaknesses:  
- The complexity of approximating the Rashomon set is high, and the experiments do not evaluate the overhead of this process.  
- The paper's focus on a niche problem within the broader ML space may limit its accessibility.  
- Reviewers expressed difficulty understanding certain concepts, such as the distinction between fixed support sets and different support sets, and the implications of high-dimensional constraints in the quadratic problem.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in Section 3.2 by providing further explanation on the distinction between fixed support sets and different support sets. Additionally, it would be beneficial to evaluate and report the computational overhead associated with the complexity of approximating the Rashomon set and the constraints of the ellipsoid in high dimensions. Lastly, addressing the questions regarding the number of bins used in the EBM and the application of the proposed method in the context of bagging multiple GAMs would enhance the paper's comprehensibility.
