### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how neural language models (NLMs) discover linguistic properties, specifically focusing on gender bias. The authors propose that gender biases can persist even in balanced training datasets, challenging the prevailing assumption that imbalance is the sole cause of such biases. By utilizing a controlled setup with artificial languages, the study reveals that NLMs can memorize gender information and infer gender through sentence structure, suggesting a more complex origin of bias in language models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a critical problem with rigorous analysis and convincing experimental results.
- It offers a novel perspective on the emergence of gender bias, potentially informing conditions under which models accurately capture gender information.
- The systematic approach using artificial languages enhances model interpretability.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks engagement with existing literature on gender bias and probing methodologies, limiting its contextual relevance.
- The context-free assumption of the PCFGs may undermine the semantic plausibility of findings, complicating their applicability to natural language settings.
- Results are not directly extrapolatable to other languages or datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating a more extensive review of the current literature on gender bias and probing methodologies. Specifically, addressing how their findings relate to existing research would strengthen the paper's impact. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the limitations regarding the applicability of their results to other languages and datasets. It would also be beneficial to revise the title and abstract to explicitly state that the corpus was developed for French. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on how experiments with artificial data will contribute to understanding biases in contemporary models.
