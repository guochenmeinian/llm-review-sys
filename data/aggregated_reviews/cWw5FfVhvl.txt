### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Memory Of Thought (MoT), which enhances the self-improvement capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) through a two-stage process involving self-thinking and external memory. The authors propose that MoT allows LLMs to improve their performance in reasoning tasks without requiring fine-tuning or annotated datasets. Experimental results indicate that MoT significantly enhances ChatGPT's abilities in arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, factual reasoning, and natural language inference. Each component of the MoT framework plays a crucial role in these improvements, demonstrating its versatility and scalability across different CoT methods and LLMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The MoT framework is innovative, enabling self-improvement of LLMs without external resources.
- Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of MoT across various reasoning tasks.
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, providing strong evidence of the framework's practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed memory module's simplicity raises concerns about the impact of error rates on reasoning outcomes, which the paper does not analyze.
- The implementation involves numerous hyperparameters that require adjustment, yet the paper lacks ablation studies to clarify their effects.
- The novelty of the MoT method is questioned, as it resembles existing self-prompting techniques without sufficient differentiation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the memory module's error rates and their potential impact on reasoning results. Additionally, conducting ablation experiments to clarify the influence of hyperparameters on performance would enhance the paper's rigor. We also encourage the authors to provide a more detailed discussion on how MoT differentiates itself from existing self-prompting methods. Finally, testing the MoT framework on open-source LLMs, such as LLaMA, would broaden its applicability and validate its effectiveness further.
