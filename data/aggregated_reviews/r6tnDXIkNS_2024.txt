Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for inferring neural signed distance functions (SDF) for Gaussian Splatting, integrating a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to represent the SDF. The authors introduce a differentiable pulling operation to align Gaussian points with the zero-level set of the SDF, updating the SDF by pulling neighboring space to the aligned 3D Gaussians. The method employs tangent loss, pull loss, and orthogonal loss to facilitate these operations. Experimental results on DTU and Tanks and Temples datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art reconstruction performance. The authors clarify that their framework, based on 3DGS and NeuralPull, employs a unique pulling loss variant and different implementations for Gaussian normal constraints and SDF gradients. They assert their method's efficiency, requiring about half an hour for scene processing compared to NeuSG's 16 hours. The authors also provide a clear explanation of their reconstruction method using Screened Poisson, where the mesh is generated from points back projected from rendered depth maps rather than raw 3D Gaussians. They argue that while Gaussian positions do not accurately represent surface details, splatting these Gaussians on a 2D plane allows for better geometry approximation. The authors plan to explore integrating Instant-NGP techniques, such as hash encoding and high-frequency positional encoding, in future work and have conducted comprehensive ablation studies on the DTU and MipNeRF360 datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of a differentiable pulling operation with Gaussian Splatting for surface reconstruction is innovative and effective.
- The tangent loss encourages the pulled Gaussians to align with the tangent plane on the zero-level set.
- The method addresses sparsity and non-uniform Gaussian distribution by pulling randomly sampled points to disks.
- The proposed method is efficient, significantly reducing processing time compared to NeuSG.
- The extension to neural pull is noted as novel and interesting, enhancing the elegance of the approach.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of their reconstruction method and the rationale behind using depth maps over Gaussian positions.
- Comprehensive ablation studies are presented, demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The method struggles to reconstruct fine geometric details, as evidenced in Figures 4, 13, and 14, and in visualizations on the TNT dataset, which appear poor despite higher quantitative results.
- Inconsistencies exist between the ablation results in Table 4 and those in Table 2, and the ablation study lacks clarity, with quantitative results on Tanks and Temples and qualitative results on DTU.
- The rendering evaluation does not align with prior works, and using lower resolution training images could enhance rendering results.
- There are concerns regarding the reconstruction quality, particularly in visualizations on the TNT dataset.
- The authors have not yet implemented Instant-NGP techniques, which could enhance reconstruction quality, and there is a lack of exploration regarding parameter options for positional and hash encoding in their experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ablation study and ensure consistency between quantitative and qualitative results. Additionally, addressing the geometric detail reconstruction issue is crucial; providing higher-resolution meshes could demonstrate the method's capabilities better. We suggest incorporating the Eikonal loss to regularize SDF values and clarifying the weight determination for the splatting loss in Eq. 8. We recommend improving the discussion on the relationship between their method and NeuSG, emphasizing the differences and similarities more clearly. Conducting a rendering ablation study on MipNeRF 360 to evaluate the impact of various components on rendering quality would be beneficial. The authors should also explore integrating high-frequency positional encoding and Instant-NGP techniques to enhance surface reconstruction and test these modifications on the Ignatius scene of the TNT dataset. Finally, including an ablation study on normal loss would provide valuable insights into its effects on performance, and exploring more parameter options for positional encoding and grid resolution in hash feature grids would fully assess their impact on reconstruction quality.
