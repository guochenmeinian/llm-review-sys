### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm called Follow the Regularized Leader for online conformal prediction, which does not assume iid samples and addresses validity issues from previous baselines. The proposed method constructs valid confidence sets using a black-box machine learning model by combining a Bayesian prior with the empirical distribution of the data sequence to predict quantiles. The authors demonstrate that this approach simulates a non-linear version of the FTRL algorithm and discuss its potential for answering multiple confidence level queries online, along with convergence bounds.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper contributes to the development of an improved algorithm that enhances validity and robustness in adversarial settings, effectively relaxing common iid assumptions.

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks empirical results comparing the proposed algorithm to various baselines, which would illustrate its practical advantages.  
2. The discussion on adversarial robustness is insufficient, leaving unclear how the algorithm operates within adversarial online learning contexts and what mechanisms ensure its robustness.  
3. There is a need for more discussion on selecting appropriate priors, including their effects on results and sensitivity to prior choice.  
4. The strategy for adapting the step size in the algorithm \(\lambda\) according to shifts in data distribution is not addressed.  
5. Inclusion of more applications in real-world datasets would enhance the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including comparisons with various baselines to demonstrate practical advantages. Additionally, a more detailed exploration of adversarial robustness is necessary to clarify the algorithm's mechanisms in such contexts. We suggest expanding the discussion on the selection of appropriate priors and their impact on results, as well as providing a strategy for adapting the step size \(\lambda\) in response to data distribution shifts. Finally, incorporating more real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
