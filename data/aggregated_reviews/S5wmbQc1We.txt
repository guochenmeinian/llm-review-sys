Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the mechanistic explanation of neural networks learning modular addition, revealing that networks can implement different algorithms, specifically the "clock" and "pizza" algorithms. The authors demonstrate that variations in initialization and hyperparameters lead to the discovery of these qualitatively different algorithms. The findings suggest that even simple learning tasks can yield diverse solutions, necessitating a more nuanced analysis of mechanistic explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and effectively communicates findings in mechanistic interpretability.
- The analysis is thorough, with convincing empirical results that contribute significantly to the field.
- The experiments are comprehensive and address important questions in the area of neural network interpretability.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity could be improved, particularly in the appendix where explanations are sometimes terse and confusing.
- Some claims, such as the prevalence of the "pizza" algorithm in networks with full attention, may be overstated based on the evidence presented.
- The terminology used, such as "symmetricity," may confuse readers and could benefit from more intuitive alternatives.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the appendix by providing more detailed explanations and ensuring consistent notation throughout. Specifically, clarify the relationship between symbols introduced in the appendix and those in the main text. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide empirical bounds for attention rates and circularity thresholds, as well as conduct an ablation study to support their hypotheses. Finally, consider renaming terms like "Q_{abc}" to more intuitive alternatives to enhance reader comprehension.
