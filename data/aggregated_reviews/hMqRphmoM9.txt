### Key Points
This paper presents a comparison of two methods for assessing language models' linguistic knowledge: prompting and direct probability measurements. It reveals that direct probability measurement generally yields better performance than prompting, particularly in evaluating metalinguistic knowledge. The study emphasizes the importance of minimal-pair comparisons and distinguishes between linguistic competence and performance, cautioning against the exclusive reliance on metalinguistic prompts for evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a valid and thorough evaluation of the limitations of prompting in measuring linguistic knowledge.
- It is well-written, with clearly outlined methods and practical implications for the NLP community.
- The study contributes to theoretical discussions regarding the distinction between competence and performance in language models.

Weaknesses:
- The findings are primarily based on English language models, limiting generalizability to other languages.
- The exploration of alternative evaluation methods is insufficient, focusing mainly on metalinguistic prompting and direct measurements.
- The paper does not adequately address the underlying reasons for discrepancies in LLM behavior based on prompt types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by considering evaluations of language models trained on non-English languages. Additionally, including a wider range of evaluation methods and exploring various prompting strategies would enhance the comprehensiveness of the study. We also suggest that the authors clarify the connection between their work and the debate on “LLMs as models of human language processing.” Finally, a more detailed explanation of the linguistic knowledge tested by the word prediction task would strengthen the paper.
