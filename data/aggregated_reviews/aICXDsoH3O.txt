### Key Points
This paper presents a vision on the role of large language models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in enterprise applications, surveying both anecdotal and academic work. The authors provide empirical evidence from an enterprise travel use case and define challenges and recommendations for using LLMs in mission-critical orchestration. The paper highlights the current state of LLMs, discusses their effectiveness compared to specific AI solutions, and raises important research challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is visionary and grounded in sufficient evidence.  
- It outlines interesting research directions focused on specific problems.  
- It is well-written, providing clarity and systematic analysis of LLM performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks novelty and primarily disseminates existing knowledge on LLMs.  
- It may benefit from additional examples beyond the travel use case and a taxonomy of problems.  
- The discussion on explainability, despite its mention, is absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by incorporating additional case studies from various domains to complement the travel example. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on explainability, as it is a critical aspect of enterprise-ready technology. Furthermore, consider developing a taxonomy of problems to enhance the analysis of LLM effectiveness compared to specific solutions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to sharpen their guidance on how the agent paradigm should evolve, making it more incisive.
