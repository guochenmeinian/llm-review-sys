Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SwiFT (Swin 4D fMRI Transformer), a novel architecture that extends the Swin Transformer to model spatiotemporal brain dynamics from high-dimensional 4D functional MRI data. The authors propose an end-to-end learning approach that incorporates a 4D window multi-head self-attention mechanism and absolute positional embeddings, achieving state-of-the-art performance on tasks such as predicting sex, age, and cognitive intelligence. The feasibility of self-supervised pre-training using contrastive loss is also demonstrated, marking a significant advancement in the application of deep learning to fMRI data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a unique application of the Swin Transformer to 4D fMRI data, showcasing originality and technical soundness.
- The ability to leverage large datasets for pre-training enhances performance on smaller datasets, addressing a common challenge in fMRI analysis.
- Experiments conducted on multiple large datasets bolster the credibility and generalizability of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The method's reliance on dividing fMRI sequences into shorter sub-sequences due to memory constraints is a limitation that should be discussed.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of its limitations and potential caveats, which is essential for future research.
- Insufficient exploration of the effects of varying input time sequence lengths on task performance and a lack of detailed comparison with previous literature diminish the depth of the analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their approach, including the implications of memory constraints and the potential sensitivity to noise in the data. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive ablation study on the computational cost compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Clarifying the choice of positive and negative samples in the contrastive losses and including loss curves for different datasets would enhance the understanding of the model's performance. Finally, a more detailed explanation of the preprocessing methods and the ROI system used would be beneficial for readers.
