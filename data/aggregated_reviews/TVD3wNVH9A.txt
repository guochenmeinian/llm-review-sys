Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Bounce (Bayesian Optimization Using iNcreasingly high-dimensional Combinatorial and continuous Embeddings), a novel Bayesian optimization method designed to address the challenges posed by high-dimensional combinatorial and mixed search spaces. The authors propose a trust region management system and utilize a Gaussian process model that partitions input variables into bins, allowing for optimization in lower-dimensional subspaces. The method is evaluated against state-of-the-art benchmarks, demonstrating strong performance across various test problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in real-world optimization involving mixed variable types and high dimensionality, which is often inadequately handled by traditional Bayesian optimization methods.
- The proposed algorithm shows strong empirical results, outperforming existing benchmarks and demonstrating reliability through convergence proof.
- The writing is clear and the structure is well-organized, facilitating understanding of the complex concepts involved.

Weaknesses:
- The paper assumes a high level of familiarity with prior work, particularly BAxUS and trust region management strategies, which may hinder accessibility for some readers. Additional illustrations and explanations, particularly regarding binning procedures and trust region management, would enhance clarity.
- The experimental setup, particularly the limited number of iterations (200), raises concerns about the sufficiency of data for high-dimensional problems, potentially affecting the robustness of the findings.
- The theoretical analysis provided is limited and does not sufficiently address the implications of the assumptions made, such as the noiseless objective function and finite search domain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by providing more background information and illustrations related to BAxUS and trust region management strategies. Additionally, consider expanding the experimental budget beyond 200 iterations for high-dimensional benchmarks to ensure adequate data for the surrogate model. Clarifying the settings used for comparisons with COMBO, BODi, and other benchmarks would also be beneficial. Furthermore, we suggest including a discussion on the limitations of the algorithm, particularly regarding its performance in noisy environments. Lastly, addressing the theoretical aspects of the method, including convergence guarantees and the influence of embedding choices, would strengthen the paper's contributions.
