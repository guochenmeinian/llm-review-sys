Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an effective knowledge distillation framework for semantic segmentation, termed Augmentation-Free Dense Contrastive Knowledge Distillation (Af-DCD). The authors introduce a novel contrastive learning approach that operates on both spatial and channel dimensions to enhance feature alignment, significantly improving CNN-based segmentation performance without data augmentation. The experimental results across five segmentation datasets demonstrate the proposed method's superiority over existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The motivation for the proposed method is clear, addressing the limitations of traditional feature distillation.
2. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the method, with valuable ablation studies and discussions.
3. The method is straightforward and easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should provide an ablation study comparing baseline+L_{Af-DCD} with baseline+L_{fd} to illustrate the independent alignment of dense features.
2. The rationale for being "augmentation-free" is unclear, as the authors claim that augmentations lead to high resource demand, which is disputed by some reviewers.
3. The use of Euclidean distances in contrastive loss is mentioned without explanation.
4. The main contribution, the contrastive loss function L_{AF-DCD}, requires clearer comparisons with and without this loss in the presence of other loss functions.
5. The organization of references and clarity in tables needs improvement, as some methods are not cited properly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for being "augmentation-free" and consider discussing the potential benefits of using augmentations. Additionally, please provide an explanation for the choice of Euclidean distance in the contrastive loss. The authors should also include ablation studies that demonstrate the combination of Channel Contrasting and Spatial Contrasting, as well as the choice of function d in formula 7, to enhance interpretability. Lastly, ensure that all methods in tables are properly referenced to avoid confusion.
