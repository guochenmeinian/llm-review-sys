### Key Points
This paper presents a method that enhances reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) by integrating Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into process supervision. The approach focuses on scoring intermediate reasoning steps rather than just the final answer, allowing for nuanced training. Experiments on mathematical reasoning datasets (MATH and GSM8K) demonstrate significant improvements over baseline methods, with strong generalization to unseen datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative use of MCTS to generate fine-grained supervision for intermediate reasoning steps, addressing limitations of outcome-based training.
- Comprehensive experiments with replications and standard error reporting show substantial performance improvements compared to baseline methods.
- The approach enables greater training efficiency by suggesting data augmentation methods rather than relying on complex reward-based approaches.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is overstated; existing foundational work in MCTS and process supervision is not sufficiently acknowledged.
- Key details, such as the size of the training data and specific comparisons to other MCTS-based approaches, are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by clarifying the following points:
- What does 'm' stand for in Equation 1?
- Why wasn't the proposed approach compared to other MCTS-based approaches, such as those by Luo et al. and Wang et al.?
- What is the size of the data used for training? Specifically, how many problems from Math or GSM-8K were utilized?
- Could the notation for the tree $\{(x^i, p_j^i, s_{j,k}^i, r_{j,k}^i)\}$ be embedded into Figure 1 for better visual alignment and clarity?
- Is this method the first to tackle data augmentation within the process supervision paradigm? If not, could references to related works be provided?
- What are the possible cases of distribution shift in Eq. (2), and can such shifts be minimized by the proposed method?
- Could the authors elaborate on the reasons for the quick convergence observed, particularly regarding the use of self-generated data?
- A more detailed explanation of the MCTS method itself would enhance understanding, particularly its strengths compared to other baseline tools in handling reasoning processes.
