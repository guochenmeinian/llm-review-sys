### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach involving the ablation of refusal vectors, which are responsible for refusal behavior in the model's residual stream, allowing the model to bypass safety mechanisms and complete harmful tasks. The authors identify that safety training in chat mode does not generalize to agentic scaffolding, revealing significant issues with safety training. The experiments utilize refusal vector ablation to enhance safety training across various Llama models, but the technique is shown to be fragile and somewhat ineffective. The paper highlights pervasive problems in the field, including the existence of over 700 "abliterated" models and the one-dimensional nature of safety training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive experiments and a new benchmark setup.
- Generalization of refusal vector ablation is an important step, as agents pose higher risks than chatbots.
- Identification of serious issues with safety training.
- Strong introduction.

Weaknesses:
- The tone of the paper does not reflect serious engagement with critical safety training problems.
- Uncertainty regarding the authors' concern about the proliferation of unrestricted models.
- Confusing reliance on refusal vector ablation in experiments despite its fragility.
- Title and abstract misleadingly emphasize 70B models, while experiments also involve 8B models.
- Section 2 is difficult to follow and lacks clarity and organization.
- Experiments in Section 3 are not comprehensive enough to support the paper's conclusions and should explore the impact of refusal vector ablation on model safety more deeply.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization and clarity of Section 2 to enhance readability. The experiments should be expanded to include a wider range of models, such as Llama-3-8B, to validate the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the fragility of refusal vector ablation more thoroughly and reconsider the messaging around its use in experiments. Finally, we advise revising the title and abstract for clarity regarding the models used in the study.
