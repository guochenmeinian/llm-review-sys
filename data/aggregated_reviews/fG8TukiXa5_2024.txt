Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study of transformer mechanisms in in-context learning, specifically analyzing how different heads function across layers. The authors find that while the first layer utilizes all heads, subsequent layers predominantly rely on a single head. They also propose a preprocess-then-optimize algorithm to explain these observations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents interesting theoretical results.
- It combines empirical and theoretical analyses effectively, demonstrating the proposed learning method's applicability to real transformers.
- The findings regarding multi-head attention contribute to the interpretability of large language models (LLMs).

Weaknesses:
- Theoretical intuition explaining the observed multi-head attention behavior is lacking, limiting the contribution.
- The use of a linear attention-only transformer does not align well with practical LLMs; incorporating softmax attention is recommended.
- The analysis focuses on a simplified linear regression problem, raising questions about its applicability to more complex real-world scenarios.
- The generalization properties are based on a linear model, which may not adequately reflect the challenges of transformer analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by providing a deeper analysis of why multi-head attention behaves as observed. Additionally, incorporating softmax attention would enhance alignment with practical LLMs. The authors should also consider conducting experiments with non-orthogonal designs and including ablation studies to demonstrate the robustness of their findings in more realistic settings. Finally, a convergence analysis similar to existing literature would strengthen the theoretical contributions.
