Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, VQ-Map, for generating Birdâ€™s Eye View (BEV) maps using a generative model akin to Vector Quantized-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE). The authors propose a two-stage training scheme that first trains a BEV generation model and subsequently maps perspective view images to BEV maps using BEV tokens as ground truth. The method aims to address challenges such as occlusion and low-resolution images, demonstrating improved performance on nuScenes and Argoverse benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with intuitive figures that enhance understanding.  
- The proposed tokenization approach is interesting and may offer robustness against noise and geometric changes.  
- The method achieves competitive results, surpassing existing methods on benchmark datasets.

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental comparisons lack state-of-the-art methods, particularly not including reference [17], which outperforms the proposed method.  
- The dataset split for nuScenes is unclear, raising questions about validation and testing procedures.  
- The ablation study parameters and results in Table 4 are not adequately explained, and the novelty of the generative model is questioned due to similarities with prior methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset split for nuScenes, explicitly stating whether validation or testing sets are used for performance evaluation. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, particularly reference [17], to strengthen the experimental validation. The authors should also provide clearer explanations of the ablation study parameters and results in Table 4, including the specific meanings of 'Supervision' in the context of their experiments. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to present more computational complexity results, such as FLOPs/MACs and running time, in their comparisons. Lastly, including visual comparisons against MapPrior could effectively illustrate the advantages of the proposed method.
