Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Hierarchical Encoder-Decoder Network (HEDNet) for 3D object detection using outdoor LiDAR data. The authors propose a multi-scale network architecture that employs encoder-decoder blocks, specifically SED and DED, to effectively model long-range voxel relationships while maintaining computational efficiency. HEDNet is benchmarked on the Waymo Open Dataset and nuScenes, demonstrating competitive detection performance, notably outperforming the prior state-of-the-art DSVT by 50% in speed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper exhibits strong benchmark performance, achieving state-of-the-art results on nuScenes and Waymo datasets.
- The architecture is innovative, utilizing a hierarchical stack-hourglass model that differentiates it from traditional FPN structures and single-stride designs.
- The writing is clear, with well-organized figures and tables, making the ideas easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The work lacks deeper theoretical insights or contributions, raising questions about its generalizability to other 3D deep learning tasks.
- There are inconsistencies in the technical details, such as the conflicting descriptions of the down-sampling layer (RS convolution vs. SS convolution).
- A more fine-grained analysis of the results, particularly on nuScenes, would enhance understanding of the model's performance across different object categories.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical descriptions, particularly resolving the conflict regarding the down-sampling layer. Additionally, providing a detailed step-by-step ablation study from the standard 3D sparse convolutional backbone to the proposed architecture would help clarify the performance improvements. It would also be beneficial to release results on the nuScenes validation set and consider a unified codebase for better reproducibility. Lastly, a discussion on the design choices specific to 3D object detection would strengthen the paper's theoretical contributions.
