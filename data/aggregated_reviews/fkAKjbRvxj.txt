### Key Points
This paper presents "information value" as a new measure of predictability for human acceptability judgments and reading times, based on the distribution of distances between a token and alternative tokens generated from a language model. The authors evaluate three distance metrics and two aggregation methods, finding that information value predicts acceptability ratings better than surprisal and is comparable for reading times. The study also explores derived measures like non-contextual information value.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed measure is novel, easy to calculate, and effective in predicting acceptability ratings.
- The experimental setup is thorough, exploring various language models, distance metrics, and sampling techniques.
- The paper is well-connected to existing literature and offers insights into language processing.

Weaknesses:
- The large number of free parameters raises concerns about the robustness of the findings.
- The framing of information value in relation to surprisal theory needs clarification, as it appears to be a distinct measure rather than an alternative to surprisal.
- The information value metric's representation as a probability distribution is unclear, and the impact of the alternative set size on results is not adequately discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by accurately framing information value as a distinct predictor of processing difficulty rather than an alternative measure of surprisal. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive reporting of results in the main text beyond Table 1. It would be beneficial to discuss the implications of using a uniform mean for reducing distances and explore the potential for weighted distance measures. We also encourage the authors to address the sampling methods used in generating alternative sentences and consider including a statistical report on their distributions. Lastly, enhancing the abstract for better clarity and addressing the limitations of using only English corpora would strengthen the paper.
