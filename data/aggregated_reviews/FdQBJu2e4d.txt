Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AdvBDGen, a novel generator-discriminator framework designed to produce adaptive, prompt-specific backdoor triggers for large language models (LLMs). The authors propose using prompt-specific paraphrases as triggers, enhancing their stealth and resistance to detection and removal. The comprehensive experiments validate the efficacy of AdvBDGen, emphasizing the need for more robust defenses against adversarial backdoor threats.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The prompt-specific stealthy triggers are effective and innovative, addressing a notable gap in the literature.
- The combination of strong and weak discriminators in the adversarial training paradigm is a novel application in backdoor generation.
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and includes extensive experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of AdvBDGen.

Weaknesses:
- The information flow in Figure 1 lacks clarity, and the relationships presented are not apparent.
- The paper would benefit from more clearly defined terms, such as “trigger,” and a more explicit explanation of the motivation behind specific design choices in the AdvBDGen framework.
- While limitations of current backdoor defenses are discussed, further exploration into potential mitigations for fuzzy backdoor triggers would be insightful.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 to enhance visual understanding and ensure text labels are legible. Additionally, we suggest that the authors define key terms more clearly, particularly “trigger,” and provide a more detailed explanation of the motivations behind their design choices in the AdvBDGen framework. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore potential mitigations for fuzzy backdoor triggers to provide a more comprehensive discussion of the attack's limitations.
