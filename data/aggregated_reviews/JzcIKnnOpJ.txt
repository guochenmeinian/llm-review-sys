Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for classification with rejection by learning a density ratio between an "idealized" distribution and the data distribution. The authors propose a risk minimization objective with a $\varphi$-divergence regularization term, allowing the classifier to abstain from predictions when the density ratio is small. The theoretical framework is supported by empirical evaluations, demonstrating effectiveness against existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written, advancing the state of the art in abstaining classifiers.
2. The theoretical contributions are sound, providing a robust foundation for the proposed method.
3. The approach offers a general framework that connects well with existing concepts in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and learning to reject.

Weaknesses:
1. The absence of a dedicated related work section on learning with a reject option limits context.
2. The empirical evaluation is constrained, using only three simple datasets and four baselines, neglecting popular alternatives like softmax response.
3. The experiments lack depth, particularly in high-dimensional settings, which raises concerns about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including a broader range of datasets, such as MedMNIST, and comparing against more established methods like softmax response. Additionally, we suggest revising the experiment section for clarity and depth, possibly using tables to better represent results. The authors should also consider providing a more compact discussion of theoretical concepts and highlight the final objective function for clarity. Addressing hyperparameter sensitivity and the impact of dataset characteristics on the proposed method's effectiveness would further enhance the paper.
