Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents LogiCity, a simulator and benchmark for neuro-symbolic AI that models urban environments using first-order logic (FOL) rules. The key contributions include a customizable FOL-based simulator, two benchmark tasks—Safe Path Following (SPF) for long-horizon sequential decision-making and Visual Action Prediction (VAP) for one-step reasoning—and an empirical evaluation of baseline methods. The authors argue that LogiCity addresses existing benchmark limitations by providing long-horizon reasoning tasks with complex multi-agent interactions and customizable abstractions. Experiments reveal that neuro-symbolic methods generally outperform others but struggle in complex scenarios, highlighting the need for more sophisticated approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The customizable nature of LogiCity allows researchers to adjust concept/rule complexity, facilitating the study of adaptation to new abstractions and compositional generalization.
- The inclusion of SPF and VAP tasks offers a comprehensive evaluation of neuro-symbolic methods.
- The use of first-order logic enhances expressiveness compared to prior work using propositional logic.
- The simulator's design reflects careful consideration of challenges in abstract reasoning and compositional generalization.
- The comprehensive evaluation framework, including metrics like Trajectory Success Rate (TSR) and Decision Success Rate (DSR), provides meaningful insights into system performance.
- The open-source nature of LogiCity promotes reproducibility and collaboration within the research community.
- Empirical results highlight key challenges for current neuro-symbolic methods in handling complex abstractions and long-horizon reasoning.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty in benchmark design is limited; the authors should clarify specific novel aspects of LogiCity beyond increased complexity.
- The paper lacks theoretical analysis; a formal examination of LogiCity's expressiveness or complexity compared to existing benchmarks would strengthen the contribution.
- The evaluation is narrow, focusing mainly on a few neural and neuro-symbolic methods; a broader range of symbolic and hybrid approaches is needed.
- Insufficient ablation studies make it difficult to isolate the impact of different LogiCity components.
- The use of simplified abstract rules raises questions about real-world relevance; the authors should justify how insights will transfer to real-world reasoning tasks.
- A human performance baseline is absent, which would provide valuable context for interpreting AI results.
- The discussion of negative results is limited; a more balanced view would enhance scientific rigor.
- Some evaluation metrics are unclear; the authors should define and justify their criteria more clearly.
- The rendering approach may be overly complex; a more controlled procedural rendering method could be preferable.
- The current rule set may not capture the full range of logical relationships needed for comprehensive evaluation.
- The simulator's environmental complexity may be too simplistic to fully represent real-world reasoning tasks.
- Limited information on computational requirements may hinder reproducibility and accessibility.
- The SPF task faces challenges due to the limitations of existing RL methods, while the VAP task is hindered by the scarcity of literature on FOL reasoning with RGB images.
- LogiCity's deterministic nature and requirement for pre-defined conflict-free rule sets may restrict its applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their experimental validation by comparing LogiCity's performance against a broader range of benchmarks. A deeper analysis of baseline implementations, including failure cases, would enhance the paper's rigor. Incorporating real-world data or more realistic synthetic data could improve the generalizability of findings. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer explanations of technical details, particularly in the simulation setup and task descriptions. A formal theoretical analysis of LogiCity's expressiveness compared to existing benchmarks would strengthen the contribution. Including a wider range of baseline methods and conducting detailed ablation studies would provide a more comprehensive evaluation. The authors should also clarify the evaluation metrics used and refine the rendering approach to avoid unnecessary complexity. Expanding the current set of possible actions to include overtaking maneuvers and multi-lane scenarios could enhance realism. Incorporating randomness into the simulator may also strengthen results. Finally, addressing the scalability of the system and providing a maintenance plan for LogiCity would enhance its long-term usability.
