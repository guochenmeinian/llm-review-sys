### Key Points
This paper presents a comparison between LLM attacks and defenses in cybersecurity, arguing that insights from cybersecurity can enhance LLM defenses. The authors propose several analogies between LLM safety terms and their cybersecurity counterparts, supported by various examples.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The topic is of interest to the community, and insights from cybersecurity are appreciated.  
- The paper is well written and presented.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks detailed discussion on how cybersecurity defenses can be applied as a general defense against a wide range of attacks.  
- The authors do not explore how defenses can be "stacked" within an LLM across different phases, such as pretraining, fine-tuning, and inference.  
- There is no mention of cybersecurity defenses that can provide probabilistic guarantees for LLM safety and their potential applications.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how cybersecurity defenses can be applied more generally against various attacks. Additionally, the authors should provide insights on how defenses can be "stacked" within an LLM during different phases. Finally, we suggest exploring whether any cybersecurity defenses can offer probabilistic guarantees for LLM safety and how they might be implemented.
