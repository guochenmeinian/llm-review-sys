Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for face texture modeling that decouples environmental illumination into multiple light conditions using neural representations. The authors propose a method that reconstructs cleaner textures compared to previous approaches relying on a single environment map. Additionally, the paper addresses the challenge of external shadows in face reconstruction by employing an Adaptive Condition Estimation (ACE) strategy and multiple human face priors. The results demonstrate significant improvements in rendering performance, particularly in minimizing the impact of external shadows.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is the first to tackle the important problem of face reconstruction affected by external shadows, which has been largely overlooked in existing works.
- The proposed approach is novel and effectively addresses the challenges posed by occlusions, yielding impressive results.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with qualitative ablations supporting the evaluation of the method.

Weaknesses:
- The initialization of lighting coefficients lacks explanation, raising questions about sensitivity to these design choices.
- Comparisons against crucial methods, such as Haar-wavelet basis and Albedo from AlbedoMM, are missing, making it difficult to assess the proposed model's improvements.
- The paper does not adequately discuss existing research on occlusions, nor does it provide quantitative results for ablation studies, relying instead on qualitative examples.
- Important citations in the face relighting and shadow removal domains are absent, which could enhance the paper's context and relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the initialization of lighting coefficients to clarify their design choices and sensitivity. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons against Haar-wavelet basis and Albedo from AlbedoMM to better contextualize the contributions of the proposed method. The authors should also consider adding quantitative results for ablation studies to strengthen their claims and include relevant citations from the face relighting and shadow removal literature to provide a more comprehensive discussion of related methods. Finally, exploring a wider variety of foreign shadows in the evaluation would enhance the robustness of the findings.
