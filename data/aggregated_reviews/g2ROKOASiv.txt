Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an incentive mechanism designed to promote honest data reporting in a federated learning environment where participants may engage in spiteful behavior. The authors explore two cases: mean estimation and multi-round stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on strongly convex objectives, demonstrating that a pure Nash equilibrium (PNE) does not exist without intervention. They propose remedies involving monetary payments and punishments to establish a PNE and provide experimental analysis supporting their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a practical and under-explored issue in distributed learning.
- It effectively models strategic behavior among participants rather than purely adversarial actions.
- The authors provide theoretical guarantees and simulation results that support their proposed mechanisms.
- The writing is clear, and the problem formulation is well-positioned within the relevant literature.

Weaknesses:
- The mechanisms only guarantee truthfulness as a Nash equilibrium, leaving open the possibility of other non-truthful equilibria.
- The modeling assumptions, particularly regarding strategy spaces, are seen as cumbersome and unjustified.
- The experimental analysis is limited, relying on a single dataset and model, which may not convincingly demonstrate the robustness of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their modeling assumptions, particularly regarding the strategy spaces and the rationale behind the parameters used. It would be beneficial to explicitly discuss the implications of multiple equilibria and the potential for collusion, as well as to provide a comparison with existing methods in their simulations. Additionally, we suggest including a proof sketch in the main paper to highlight the technical challenges addressed in the analysis and to clarify the limitations regarding the knowledge of participant utilities required for their mechanisms.
