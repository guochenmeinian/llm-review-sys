Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents EpoD, a novel dynamic graph learning model that addresses out-of-distribution (OOD) challenges through prompt learning and structural causal models. The authors systematically analyze existing limitations in OOD literature and propose a self-prompted learning mechanism for inferring environment variables, alongside a dynamic subgraph learning component to exploit these variables effectively. Comprehensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate EpoD's superior performance in various distribution scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the work is clearly articulated, providing a convincing rationale for addressing environment inference and utilization in dynamic graph learning.
- EpoD introduces innovative components such as self-prompted learning and dynamic subgraph learning, which enhance the model's capabilities.
- The experimental design is robust, with extensive evaluations across diverse datasets, including a toy dataset that validates the model's interpretability.

Weaknesses:
- The self-prompted design's ability to capture unobserved environmental factors without overlapping with observable information needs clarification.
- Minor typographical errors are present, such as "more consistent with" in Line 105.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on computational complexity and the handling of new nodes in dynamic graphs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the self-prompted learning mechanism, specifically its unique advantages in inferring unseen environments. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on computational complexity, both time and space, and addressing how the model can adapt to new nodes. Furthermore, the authors should provide more detailed information about the datasets within the main text rather than relegating them to the appendix. Lastly, we encourage the authors to expand the discussion on future work and limitations, potentially exploring applications in sociological analysis.
