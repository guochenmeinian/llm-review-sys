Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a carbon-efficient neural architecture search (NAS) framework, CE-NAS, aimed at reducing carbon emissions during the NAS process by dynamically allocating GPU resources based on predicted carbon intensity. CE-NAS employs a reinforcement learning agent to switch between energy-intensive evaluations and energy-efficient sampling, guided by a time-series transformer that forecasts carbon intensity. The authors demonstrate that CE-NAS achieves competitive accuracy on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets while significantly lowering carbon costs compared to traditional NAS methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on reducing carbon emissions from machine learning tasks addresses a critical environmental issue.
2. The carbon intensity prediction model shows improved accuracy over previous models.
3. The experimental design incorporates various baseline models and real-world data, enhancing applicability.
4. The framework effectively balances energy-efficient sampling and intensive evaluations, optimizing for carbon costs.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are limited to California; results from multiple locations would strengthen the findings.
2. The authors should include additional baseline models for comparison, such as the one proposed by Zhang et al.
3. The overhead of switching between NAS models in response to carbon intensity variations is not addressed.
4. The paper lacks clarity on how practitioners can access real-time carbon emission data, which is crucial for implementing the framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the geographical scope of their experiments by including results from multiple locations to enhance the generalizability of their findings. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more baseline models, specifically the one proposed by Zhang et al., to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their carbon intensity predictor. It is also essential to discuss the overhead associated with switching between NAS models due to carbon intensity variations. Furthermore, we urge the authors to provide guidance on accessing real-time carbon emission data, as this is vital for practitioners looking to implement CE-NAS effectively.
