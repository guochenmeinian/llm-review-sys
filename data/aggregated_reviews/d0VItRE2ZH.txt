Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel technique called Variational Rectified Activation (VRA) for out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, leveraging variational methods to optimize activation functions. The authors propose a method that suppresses both high and low activations while amplifying intermediate ones, demonstrating strong empirical results across various benchmark datasets. The theoretical analysis supports the necessity of these operations, and the method is shown to be compatible with different network architectures and scoring functions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method is well-motivated both intuitively and theoretically, extending existing approaches like ReAct by providing a fine-grained analysis of activation clipping.
2. The simplicity and effectiveness of the VRA method are validated through extensive experiments, outperforming existing post-hoc strategies on benchmark datasets.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, making it accessible to readers.

Weaknesses:
1. The methodology requires prior knowledge of OOD statistics, which may limit its applicability in real-world scenarios.
2. There is a lack of discussion on relevant OOD literature, with important works missing from the references, which could enhance the paper's context and comparisons.
3. The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it closely resembles existing methods like BAST and ASH, with only minor modifications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the relationship between the objective function and the final score. Additionally, please include a limitation section that explicitly addresses the need for OOD statistics. It would also be beneficial to compare the VRA framework with more existing methods and add more baselines to demonstrate its effectiveness. Finally, consider exploring additional operations such as binary and scaling to enhance the method's robustness and applicability across different datasets and architectures.
