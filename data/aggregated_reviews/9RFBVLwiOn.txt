### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to exemplar selection for hybridQA (text+table) using Knapsack Programs, allowing for effective selection under various constraints, such as input length for LLMs. The authors propose SEER, which utilizes nearest neighbor filtering and constraint modules to optimize the selection process. The results demonstrate that SEER outperforms previous methods on standard datasets, providing a solid introduction to the task and relevant algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Excellent application of the knapsack algorithm to exemplar selection.
- Effective handling of input length constraints for LLMs.
- Strong results compared to state-of-the-art competitors.
- Clear motivation and well-structured presentation.

Weaknesses:
- The appendix is excessively large and contains essential information that should be integrated into the main text.
- Lack of qualitative error analysis limits understanding of potential improvements.
- Presentation issues, including layout and clarity, detract from readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the integration of key items from the appendix into the main paper to enhance self-sufficiency. Additionally, including a qualitative error analysis would provide insights for future enhancements. We suggest addressing the statistical significance of results in lines 399-402 and ensuring clarity in Figure 4 by indicating variance in the results. The authors should also consider mentioning the applicability of the knapsack approach to other tasks in the conclusion. Furthermore, we advise correcting grammatical errors and improving the layout of figures and tables for better readability.
