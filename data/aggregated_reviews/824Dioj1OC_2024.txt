### Key Points
This paper studies the challenge of applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to industry-specific applications that require adherence to complex rules. The authors propose a method that includes creating a dataset of rule-applied responses and training the LLM on this dataset to enhance its ability to follow safety rules, particularly in the automotive repair domain. The approach is shown to improve LLM performance compared to simplified rule selection methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper presents a practical and resource-efficient method for adapting LLMs to domain-specific scenarios without extensive post-training on specialized datasets.
2. The use of a simplified rule selection mechanism to generate rule-applied responses is a novel concept that effectively addresses the complexity of managing numerous domain-specific rules.
3. The method allows the LLM to generalize across rules, improving performance in domain-specific tasks even with imperfect initial rule selection.
4. The focus on domains with natural language rules highlights the relevance and practicality of the approach in real-world industrial applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed dataset lacks corresponding metrics to evaluate its quality, making it difficult to assess its reliability and effectiveness.
2. There is a need for comparisons with other models, such as Mistral, to provide context for the performance of the llama2-13b-chat model.
3. The contribution of the paper is unclear, particularly whether the focus is on the dataset or the training method for the LLM.
4. There are errors in author citations and grammatical issues, such as inconsistent capitalization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly distinguishing between the proposed dataset and the training method. Additionally, the authors should include quality evaluation metrics for the dataset and provide comparisons with other models, such as Mistral, to contextualize their findings. Finally, we urge the authors to correct the citation errors and grammatical mistakes throughout the paper.
