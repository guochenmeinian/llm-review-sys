Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HUME, an unsupervised framework for inferring human labels from image datasets. It operates under the assumptions of linear separability and model invariance, utilizing two self-supervised models to generate pseudo labels. The authors demonstrate that HUME achieves state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, including CIFAR-10 and STL-10, outperforming existing unsupervised methods and sometimes even supervised approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- HUME provides a novel perspective on unsupervised learning by focusing on consistent labelings across different representation spaces, offering valuable insights for future research.
- The method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised techniques and shows comparable or superior performance to supervised learning in certain tasks.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly written, and includes comprehensive experiments validating HUME's generalizability.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption of linear separability may not hold for more complex datasets, raising concerns about HUME's scalability to challenging tasks.
- The fairness of experimental comparisons is questionable, as HUME utilizes large pretrained models, which may skew results compared to other unsupervised methods.
- Additional baseline experiments are needed to clarify whether performance gains are due to HUME or the strength of the representation space.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the correlation between their labels and human-provided labels, particularly regarding generalization to other datasets. It would be beneficial to include results for additional datasets in the appendix, as well as an ablation study focusing on the impact of using only MOCO representations. Furthermore, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the differences between inductive and transductive procedures and addressing the computational cost associated with MAML's inner loop iterations. Lastly, including comparisons with fully unsupervised methods like CLIP could enhance the understanding of HUME's effectiveness.
