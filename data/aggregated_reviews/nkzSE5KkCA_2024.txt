Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DEMO, a text-to-video diffusion approach designed to enhance motion synthesis by decomposing text encoding and conditioning into content and motion components. The authors introduce a text motion loss, a regularization to maintain consistency between CLIP encoders, and a video motion loss to align frame latents with actual video motion. The model is trained on WebVid and evaluated against other models for video and motion quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The technical contribution is strong, effectively addressing the need for a motion-focused text encoder.
2. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating enhanced motion quality.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear presentation of the different losses and methodologies.

Weaknesses:
1. The comparison with other approaches lacks fairness due to additional parameters being trained on the text encoder side.
2. The related work section is insufficient, and there is a lack of contrast experiments with other improved methods.
3. Qualitative results are not statistically representative, relying on a limited number of video examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section to provide a more comprehensive context for their contributions. Additionally, incorporating a user study with a larger sample size and conducting ablation studies with at least 50 distinct prompts and 15 independent assessors would enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the methodology for calculating optical flow between attention maps and addressing the reliability of this computation is also essential. Lastly, ensuring that comparisons between generated videos are presented in a single file would facilitate clearer evaluation of the proposed method's advantages.
