### Key Points
This paper presents RiemannGFM, a graph foundation model designed to capture and generalize structural knowledge across diverse graphs. It introduces a structural vocabulary based on fundamental graph substructures—trees and cycles—mapped within a Riemannian geometric space. The integration of Riemannian geometry enables the learning of both local and global graph structures, enhancing adaptability and generalization in cross-domain transfer tasks. The authors demonstrate the model's effectiveness through experiments on four benchmark datasets, comparing it with various baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
+ The development of a graph foundation model that captures structural knowledge is a significant contribution to the graph mining community.
+ The novel use of Riemannian geometry allows RiemannGFM to accommodate diverse graph types, enhancing cross-domain transferability and generalization.
+ Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets and various baseline comparisons validate the model's design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of statistical significance tests raises questions about the reliability of the performance improvements reported in the experiments.
- The focus on only node classification and link prediction tasks limits the model's evaluation; a broader range of tasks should be considered.
- The motivation for using Riemannian geometry and the associations made between tree structures and hyperbolic space, as well as cyclic structures and spherical space, lack sufficient theoretical justification.
- The experimental datasets are limited and unrepresentative, affecting the reliability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors conduct statistical significance tests, such as a two-tailed t-test, to compare RiemannGFM with the strongest baseline/ablation version in each table. Additionally, the authors should explore a wider range of downstream tasks, including node clustering, community detection, and graph-level classification. We suggest providing clearer explanations of the motivation and principles behind the use of Riemannian geometry, as well as a more robust theoretical justification for the associations made between structural types and geometric spaces. Finally, enhancing the organizational structure of the model description and clarifying complex equations would improve readability and comprehension.
