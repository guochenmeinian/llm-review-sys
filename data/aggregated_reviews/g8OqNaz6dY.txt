### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm for computing the probability of a string based on the scores of all derivations in tree adjoining formalisms, utilizing a two-level representation of a controller and controllee, which can be either a context-free grammar (CFG) or a push-down automaton (PDA). The authors build on recent equivalencies among various grammar formalisms to create a unified normal form and introduce semiring-weighted variants. They develop a novel parsing algorithm that improves time and space complexity for these formalisms. The paper includes necessary definitions, formal definitions of the two-level mechanism, and a correctness and complexity analysis of the proposed algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed unified normal form simplifies reasoning about various grammar formalisms and facilitates the generalization of proofs.
- The two-level formalization effectively represents the formalism and leads to efficient parsing algorithms.
- The correctness proofs for the algorithms appear sound.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical results and discussions on potential applications, which raises concerns about its suitability for the venue.
- Some definitions and technical presentations are unclear or inconsistent, leading to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by adding a discussion on potential applications of their work to address concerns about its theoretical nature. Additionally, clarify the definitions of WLD-CFG and WLD-PDA to ensure symmetry and provide a definition for d-strong equivalence, as it is crucial to the findings. We suggest resolving the technical issues with the definition of pop computation and ensuring that the deductive rule system accurately reflects the computations described. Furthermore, we advise including references to figures in the text for better clarity and addressing the notation ambiguities, particularly regarding gamma[A]. Lastly, consider refining the presentation of the two-level formalism to enhance reader comprehension.
