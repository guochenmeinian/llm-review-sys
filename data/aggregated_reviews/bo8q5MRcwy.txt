Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to text-conditioned video generation by framing it as a goal-conditioned reinforcement learning task, termed Unified Predictive Decision Process (UPDP). The method utilizes a diffusion model planner and a task-specific action generator to learn effective control strategies, bypassing traditional reward design and enabling non-Markovian modeling. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the method's effectiveness across various control tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clear and easy to follow.
2. The proposed method is effective and reasonable.
3. Extensive experiments show significant performance gains.
4. Synthesized frames are illustrative and engaging.

Weaknesses:
1. Certain module descriptions, particularly the role of the action in the video-based planner, require further emphasis for clarity.
2. The novelty of combining text-conditioned generation with existing techniques may be limited.
3. Some details, such as the tiling method for trajectory consistency, are unclear and need elaboration.
4. Figure 2 lacks consistency in the widths of noise elements, which could enhance clarity.
5. The relationship between the planner and policy network is not well-defined, necessitating further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detailed descriptions of specific modules, particularly clarifying the role of actions in the video-based planner. Additionally, we suggest extending the discussion on tiling to address questions about its implementation and effectiveness. To enhance clarity, please ensure consistency in the widths of elements in Figure 2. We also encourage the authors to provide a clearer explanation of how the policy network interacts with the planner and the environment. Lastly, restructuring lines 174-183 for clarity regarding the super-resolution and low-temporal-resolution architectures would be beneficial.
