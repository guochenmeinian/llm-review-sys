Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Locally Invariant Explanations (LINEX), an extension of the LIME explanation method, aimed at generating stable and unidirectional feature attributions through the invariant risk minimization framework. The authors argue that LINEX demonstrates improved performance over existing methods like LIME, particularly in terms of trustworthiness, as evidenced by empirical evaluations across various modalities (tabular, image, text) and fidelity and stability metrics. They explore the conceptual connections between LINEX and Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM), detailing similarities in their approaches to data environments and feature importance. The method addresses the instability of explanations in existing models by leveraging Nash Equilibrium guarantees, leading to improved feature attributions and emphasizing that LINEX aims to provide unidirectional explanations, where the behavior of features is context-dependent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The game-theoretic design of the feature attribution method is novel and sound.
- The unidirectionality desideratum is original and sensible.
- The theoretical results provide robust support for the proposed method.
- Empirical evidence supports LINEX's effectiveness through various fidelity and stability metrics.
- The conceptual connection to IRM enhances the theoretical foundation of LINEX.
- The paper is well-written and accessible, with code provided for reproducibility.
- The authors have engaged constructively with reviewer feedback, leading to improvements in the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The work lacks novel qualitative insights into model behavior, focusing primarily on comparisons with existing methods.
- The explanation of LINEX's intuition and its connection to invariance remains unclear, leading to confusion about the stability of feature importance.
- Unidirectionality may not hold in edge cases where minor differences are discriminative.
- The trustworthiness of the feature attribution method is not adequately demonstrated; a user study similar to LIME's would be beneficial.
- The manuscript's dense sections could benefit from clearer organization and simplification to enhance readability.
- The method's applicability is limited to specific models, which may restrict its broader impact compared to more general robustness strategies.
- The paper is difficult to read due to unclear structure and presentation, which could hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's structure by:
- Providing a more accessible explanation of invariant risk minimization (IRM) and clearly defining "environments."
- Simplifying the introduction to Nash equilibrium and ensuring consistent terminology throughout.
- Moving metrics for evaluation to the experimental section and providing detailed explanations for each metric used.
- Clarifying assumptions and definitions, particularly regarding thresholds and the environment generation distribution.
- Considering the inclusion of a user study to validate the trustworthiness of the proposed method.
- Enhancing the motivation for the game-theoretic perspective and its relevance to the explanation stability problem.
- Rewriting sections to better explain the intuition behind LINEX and its connection to invariance, particularly in the introduction and Figure 1.
- Splitting dense paragraphs to enhance readability, especially in sections discussing IRM and the desired behaviors of explanation methods.
- Including at least one use case in the main text to strengthen the paper's practical relevance.
