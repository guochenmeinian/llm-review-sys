### Key Points
This paper presents a refusal token strategy to calibrate and fine-tune refusals in large language models (LLMs). The authors introduce both a single refusal strategy and category refusal tokens to address various types of failures. However, results in Table 3 indicate that the simple single refusal token method performs better, yet the paper lacks a detailed explanation for this discrepancy. Additionally, the issue of refusal consistency across different iterations is not addressed. While the proposed method offers a straightforward approach to enhance LLM control over refusals, the guaranteed benefits of this strategy remain uncertain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The refusal tokens provide an elegant mechanism to improve LLMs' ability to refuse toxic tasks.  
- The paper is well-written, featuring clear logic and diagrams.  
- The authors effectively explain the setups and various thresholding algorithms used, making the new mechanism easier to understand compared to prior work.  
- Convincing experimental results are presented.  

Weaknesses:  
- The performance of the single refusal token method surpasses that of the category refusal tokens without sufficient explanation.  
- The paper does not address refusal consistency between different iterations.  
- The potential benefits of the proposed method are not guaranteed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation regarding the performance of the single refusal token method compared to category refusal tokens. Additionally, addressing the issue of refusal consistency across different iterations would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest testing the new method on different datasets to further validate its effectiveness.
