Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Universal Depth Completion (UniDC) framework that addresses the challenges of generalizing depth completion across various scenes and sensors. The authors utilize a monocular depth foundation model to generate pixel-wise affinity maps and employ hyperbolic geometry to create hierarchical structures from sparse depth data. The proposed method demonstrates effective performance on the KITTI and NYU datasets, achieving superior results in few-shot scenarios compared to existing methods. Additionally, the paper introduces a depth completion model that utilizes a stereo matching network for robust cross-domain generalization. While achieving competitive performance in 1-shot settings, the model does not significantly improve in 10 or 100-shot scenarios compared to VPP4DC, which is pretrained on synthetic datasets. The authors acknowledge limitations in adapting to new representations and the challenges posed by using metric sparse depth as input.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Good performance of the framework**: The proposal significantly outperforms previous VFM-less and VFM-based methods in various few-shot configurations.
- **Competitive performance in 1-shot settings**: The model demonstrates strong results in initial testing scenarios.
- **Novel solution for a known problem**: The paper contributes to the emerging challenge of depth completion that generalizes across different domains and sensors.
- **Comprehensive comparison with existing methods**: The authors clarify evaluation protocols and address concerns regarding the integration of relative-scale 3D knowledge.
- **Clear presentation**: The writing is linear and logical, with clear figures that aid understanding.

Weaknesses:
- **Unfair comparison with VFM-less methods**: The advantage of VFM features in the experiments may skew results, as VFM-less competitors had limited training data.
- **Subpar performance on the online KITTI benchmark**: This raises questions about the model's relevance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- **Missing related literature**: Important works addressing similar problems are not adequately discussed, particularly those that explore zero-shot methods and recent advancements in the field.
- **Insufficient experiments**: The paper lacks comprehensive evaluations, including full in-domain performance, cross-domain performance, and varying-density performance.
- **Ambiguities in the evaluation protocol**: These could mislead comparisons with other models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the fairness of comparisons by including VFM-less methods with similar access to knowledge. Additionally, the authors should expand the literature review to include significant works that address the UniDC problem and recent advancements in the field. Clarifying the evaluation protocol and addressing performance discrepancies on benchmarks will strengthen the paper's credibility. We also suggest conducting further experiments to demonstrate full in-domain performance, cross-domain performance, and varying-density performance to strengthen the claims of generalizability. Lastly, enhancing the model's performance on the KITTI benchmark should be prioritized to align with current standards in the field, and clarifying the implementation details of hyperbolic geometry while discussing its limitations in depth estimation would enhance the paper's depth.
