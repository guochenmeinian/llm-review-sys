Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model aimed at accelerating MRI reconstruction by leveraging inter-image dependencies. The model generates MRI image sequences conditioned on prior images, enhancing reconstruction from undersampled k-space data. Evaluated on the fastMRI dataset, the AID model demonstrates improved performance over standard diffusion models, particularly in reducing hallucinations in reconstructed images. The authors provide a detailed theoretical foundation, including the derivation of the training loss and a sampling algorithm for accelerated MRI reconstruction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The autoregressive formulation effectively utilizes image sequence information, outperforming single-image diffusion models.  
- The incorporation of sequential information with VQVAE encodings is both novel and powerful.  
- Comprehensive experiments validate the model's effectiveness in the MRI context, showing improved reconstruction quality.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation lacks quantitative comparisons with other state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, limiting the robustness of the claims.  
- The paper primarily focuses on 2D images, raising concerns about the model's applicability to 3D reconstruction tasks.  
- The complexity of the VQVAE and transformer-based autoregressive model is not sufficiently justified, and the impact of the diffusion component remains unclear.  
- There is a lack of exploration regarding the model's performance on standard natural image datasets and its computational efficiency compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including direct comparisons with other established MRI reconstruction methods, such as VarNet, to strengthen the claims of superiority. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer discussion on the computational cost of the proposed method, particularly in relation to standard diffusion models. We suggest expanding the theoretical justification for the model and addressing the potential negative societal impacts of the technology. Furthermore, the authors should explore the model's performance on diverse medical imaging modalities and provide insights into its scalability and robustness in clinical settings. Lastly, we encourage the authors to investigate the model's ability to handle multi-modal imaging data and discuss the implications of using AI-generated medical images in practice.
