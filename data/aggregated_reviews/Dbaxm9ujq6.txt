Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents How2comm, a collaborative perception framework designed to balance perception performance and communication bandwidth. The authors propose a mutual information-aware communication mechanism to optimize message transmission, along with a flow-guided delay compensation strategy to address temporal misalignment. Additionally, the framework introduces a Spatio-Temporal Collaboration Transformer to effectively integrate spatial and temporal information. The authors argue that their contributions address the limitations of existing methods, which they believe have been clearly defined in their previous works. They emphasize the importance of tackling multiple challenges in collaborative perception tasks to enhance system robustness, citing the V2X-ViT as an example of a work that successfully addresses various issues simultaneously. The proposed methods are validated through experiments on three datasets, demonstrating improvements in collaborative perception tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces innovative techniques such as mutual information-aware communication and flow-guided delay compensation, addressing significant challenges in multi-agent collaborative perception.
2. The framework is rigorously evaluated across various datasets, showcasing its superiority over existing methods.
3. The clarity and organization of the paper enhance its accessibility and understanding.
4. The authors provide detailed explanations of the system pipeline and main module designs in the Supplementary Material.

Weaknesses:
1. The technical novelty of the proposed methods is unclear, as many contributions appear to be adaptations of existing techniques without substantial new insights.
2. Experimental results are inconsistent with prior work, raising concerns about their credibility.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive evaluation of training costs and inference times, which are critical given the complexity of the proposed framework.
4. Collaboration heterogeneity is not adequately defined or addressed, particularly regarding the fusion of data from different sensor types.
5. The identification of the work as "an industrial product integrated on the assembly line" lacks justification.
6. The use of interrogative sentences in the discussion phase is deemed inappropriate and vague, failing to clearly articulate concerns.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of collaboration heterogeneity and provide a more detailed explanation of how their approach addresses this issue. Additionally, the authors should include a comprehensive ablation study to clarify the contributions of individual components within the framework. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on a wider variety of datasets to strengthen the validity of their claims. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a comparison of inference times with state-of-the-art methods to better illustrate the efficiency of their approach. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity and justification of their claims regarding the industrial application of their work and address the concerns raised in a more direct manner, rather than using interrogative sentences, to enhance the discussion's clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider addressing multiple challenges in collaborative perception tasks to improve robustness and performance, as demonstrated by existing prominent works.
