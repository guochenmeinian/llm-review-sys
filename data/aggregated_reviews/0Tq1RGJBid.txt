Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the linear regression problem and proposes a new sketching method based on data averaging, which aims to improve estimation under large sample sizes. The authors develop both lower and upper bounds on the mean squared error of the estimator and compare it with existing methods theoretically and numerically. The proposed method is shown to outperform uniform random sketching and the IBOSS algorithm in certain scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel estimation method for linear regression, which is significant in statistics and machine learning.
- It provides interesting theoretical results and a careful analysis of lower bounds for estimation error caused by sampling methods.
- The proposed sketching algorithm demonstrates better statistical guarantees compared to sampling-based methods.

Weaknesses:
- The main text lacks experimental results, which are crucial for validating claims; the impressive numerical results are only found in the supplement.
- There is insufficient comparison with the IBOSS algorithm, leaving unclear distinctions between the two methods.
- The presentation is dense and mathematical, making it difficult to follow, particularly regarding the theoretical developments and assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by providing a concise summary of key numerical results in the main text. Additionally, including comparisons against standard sketching methods, such as Gaussian sketch, would enhance the analysis. Clarifying the differences between the proposed method and the IBOSS algorithm is essential. We also suggest addressing minor typographical errors and improving the organization of the paper by moving complex theoretical results to the appendix. Finally, including guidance on statistical inference and providing replication files in the supplementary material would be beneficial.
