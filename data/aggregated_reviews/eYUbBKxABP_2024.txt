### Key Points
This paper presents a formalization of fairness metrics aimed at analyzing discrimination in automated decision-making systems within the UK context. It maps existing literature and legal frameworks onto a decision-theoretic framework, addressing the gap between computational definitions of fairness and those operationalized by courts. The authors propose conditional estimation parity as a legally-informed target and provide recommendations for minimizing unlawful discrimination in machine learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper demonstrates a strong understanding of the nuances of UK law, which is often overlooked in computer science literature.  
- It effectively translates complex legal concepts for a technical audience and situates itself well within existing literature, particularly regarding UK anti-discrimination law.  
- The work addresses significant limitations in current fairness metrics that do not align with legal notions of discrimination.

Weaknesses:  
- Much of the content reads as a review of anti-discrimination law, making it challenging to discern the paper's technical contributions and their novelty.  
- The proposed conditional estimation metric relies on the true data-generating process, which can complicate practical application.  
- Recommendations provided are general and may not significantly advance the field, lacking specificity regarding their novelty compared to existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly stating what is novel and why it matters, particularly in the introduction. Incorporating the case study from Appendix A as a running example throughout the paper would enhance understanding of the practical implications of their formalism. Additionally, we suggest expanding the discussion on measurement and construct validity, referencing relevant literature, particularly from Jacobs & Wallach, and addressing the complexities of using the conditional estimation metric in real-world scenarios. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the distinctions between UK and US anti-discrimination law to strengthen their argument regarding the relevance of their work.
