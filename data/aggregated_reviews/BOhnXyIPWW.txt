### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the interaction between local differential privacy (LDP) and robustness to Huber corruption in multi-armed bandits (MABs), focusing on two scenarios: LDP-then-Corruption (LTC) and Corruption-then-LDP (CTL). The authors provide a tight characterization of mean estimation error and minimax regret in both scenarios, demonstrating that LTC results in worse performance than CTL. They also establish the first performance bounds for cases with corruption occurring both before and after LDP and correct previous errors in regret bounds for locally private, heavy-tailed online MABs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The model integrating both LDP and robustness to Huber corruption is novel, offering a unified algorithm for online MAB with improved minimax upper bounds compared to prior works.  
- The paper introduces new and sharp regret upper and lower bounds for the locally private and corrupt bandit setting, along with a tight characterization of mean estimation error.  
- The presentation of results is clear, with detailed comments and expansive coverage of prior works, contextualizing the contribution within the literature.  

Weaknesses:  
- The MAB algorithms require hyper-parameter tuning.  
- The writing is occasionally repetitive, and the exposition could be simplified to emphasize key intuitions. Propositions 1 and 2 appear redundant given Theorem 1.  
- Clarity is needed regarding the novelty of the mean estimation in Algorithm 1 and the specific technical difficulties addressed in this setting compared to prior works.  
- Some claims, particularly regarding the regret bounds, lack clarity and may require further explanation.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by reducing repetition and simplifying exposition, possibly through a summary table or glossary to clarify the various settings and results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly point out the technical flaws in the previous work referenced, as this would enhance the reader's understanding of the contributions made. Furthermore, providing practical discussions on the implications of LTC and CTL in real-world applications would strengthen the paper's impact.
