### Key Points
This paper presents TopDyG, a topology-aware Transformer architecture designed for link prediction on dynamic graphs. It addresses two significant limitations of existing Transformer-based methods: the loss of triangle information during graph serialization and the over-estimation of high-degree nodes. The authors propose a Ti-Transformer that captures topological features using normalized adjacency matrices and a Mi-Learning strategy that leverages mutual information to mitigate the over-emphasis on high-degree nodes. Experimental results demonstrate TopDyG's superior performance on four public datasets, particularly in high-density graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. TopDyG effectively tackles key challenges in dynamic graph link prediction by integrating topology-aware mechanisms and mutual information learning.
2. The experimental evaluation shows significant performance improvements in NDCG and Jaccard scores compared to state-of-the-art methods, especially on high-density graphs.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the proposed approach and its contributions.

Weaknesses:
1. The method of incorporating topology into the Transformer is overly simplistic and may not fully leverage the global structure of the graph.
2. There is insufficient discussion regarding the scalability of TopDyG for larger graphs with complex topologies, and the computational efficiency compared to existing methods is not adequately addressed.
3. The reliance on degree distribution to mitigate high-degree node over-estimation may undervalue low-degree nodes in graphs with uneven degree distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability of TopDyG when applied to large-scale dynamic networks. A more detailed analysis of the time and space complexity compared to other methods would enhance the understanding of computational efficiency. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative methods for obtaining prior knowledge to mitigate biases introduced by the degree distribution. Finally, incorporating explicit temporal dynamics or higher-order topological features could further enhance the model's performance.
