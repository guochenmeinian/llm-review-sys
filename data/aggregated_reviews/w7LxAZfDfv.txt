Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel contrastive Chamfer distance (InfoCD) for point cloud completion, demonstrating that minimizing InfoCD is equivalent to maximizing a lower bound of mutual information between geometric surfaces, which is crucial for detailed object shape reconstruction. The authors propose this method to address fundamental issues in loss function optimization and conducted extensive experiments across various datasets, achieving promising results that indicate the effectiveness of the proposed method. While results from the KITTI dataset are included, the generalizability of their approach to real-world applications remains uncertain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The idea is interesting, and the paper is well-organized.
2. The authors' efforts to improve the widely-used Chamfer loss are commendable.
3. Extensive experiments yield promising performance results across multiple datasets.
4. The computational time and memory consumption of the proposed method appear reasonable.
5. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, addressing a fundamental problem in point cloud data similarity measurement.
6. The proposed InfoCD loss builds on established metrics and shows significant improvements in performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The generalization ability of the proposed method across different datasets is uncertain, particularly given its supervised nature.
2. Evidence provided does not convincingly demonstrate the broader applicability of the proposed method.
3. Results on real-world datasets, such as KITTI, are not discussed in depth, which is critical for practical applications.
4. The evaluation metric in Table 1 should include L2-CD as per the PCN paper, as a square root is calculated in the evaluation code.
5. There are discrepancies between the equations presented in the paper and the implementation in the code, raising concerns about the accuracy of reported findings.
6. The convergence analysis is weak, relying primarily on experimental results without mathematical proof.
7. The explanation of the "weaker constraint" in the optimization process lacks clarity and could benefit from better visualization.
8. The provided visualizations do not adequately confirm that the correct correspondence remains unchanged.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including results on real-world datasets like KITTI to enhance the practical relevance of their findings. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the evaluation metric in Table 1 to include L2-CD as indicated in the PCN paper. The authors should address the discrepancies between the equations and the code implementation to ensure consistency and accuracy in their results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more robust convergence analysis, potentially including mathematical proofs, and to discuss the efficiency of the proposed method compared to the original CD loss. We also recommend improving the clarity of their arguments regarding the "weaker constraint" of the proposed CD by rephrasing their explanations and including visualizations of real experimental data. Lastly, we encourage the authors to strengthen their evidence for the broader applicability of their method beyond the specific datasets used.
