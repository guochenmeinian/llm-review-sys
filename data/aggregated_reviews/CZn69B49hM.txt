### Key Points
This paper presents HEMS-BC, a novel approach for behavior cloning that enhances sample efficiency by utilizing a psychologically-inspired memory model. HEMS-BC employs the Hybrid Event Memory System (HEMS) to represent states, observations, and state transitions as Bayesian networks, aligning with human memory processes. The method addresses distributional bias by sampling temporal models conditioned on observations, achieving expert-level performance with fewer demonstrations than baseline systems. The experimental setup is clearly defined, utilizing text environments like FrozenLake and CliffWalking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of a psychologically-inspired memory model with Bayesian networks is innovative and contributes to more data-efficient behavior cloning methods.
- HEMS-BC effectively addresses class imbalance in datasets, improving sample efficiency.
- The experimental setup is well-defined, with clear metrics for evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed explanations of the insertion and retrieval algorithms within the HEMS structure.
- The ablation study's baseline system does not incorporate event memory, limiting the comparison's strength.
- Empirical evaluation is confined to discrete, small grid worlds, raising concerns about scalability and the lack of comparison with seminal methods like GAIL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the details regarding the insertion and retrieval algorithms of HEMS to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more robust ablation study that includes a baseline with event memory capabilities. Expanding the empirical evaluation to more complex environments and comparing HEMS-BC with other established behavior cloning methods would strengthen the paper's contributions and address scalability concerns.
