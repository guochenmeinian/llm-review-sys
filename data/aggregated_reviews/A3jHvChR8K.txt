### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework called the Hypergraph-Based Hierarchical Equilibrium Representation (HERT) for semi-open 3D object retrieval, addressing the limitations of traditional methods that only consider single-layer labels. The framework includes two main modules: the Hierarchical Retrace Embedding (HRE) module, which balances representations across multi-level categories, and the Structured Equilibrium Tuning (SET) module, which manages feature overlap and class confusion through high-order correlations. The authors propose this framework to enhance Semi-Open Learning by accommodating multiple hierarchical labels and partial overlaps between training and testing sets. They support their approach with four newly generated datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments and emphasizing the practical application of semi-open learning in real-world scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the HERT framework fills a gap in the literature on semi-open 3D object retrieval and Semi-Open Learning.
- The use of hierarchical labels captures multi-level semantics effectively, aligning with real-world scenarios.
- Comprehensive experiments on newly generated datasets provide strong empirical evidence of the framework's effectiveness.
- The proposed method is easy to read and targets an interesting problem, making it accessible to a broader audience.
- The efficiency of the HERT framework is notable, requiring significantly less training and inference time compared to existing methods.
  
Weaknesses:
- The framework's complexity may hinder practical implementation and extension.
- The proposed coarse-label partition is criticized for being too coarse and lacking practical relevance, needing more detailed examples for better understanding.
- The mathematical symbols and notations are inconsistent and chaotic, leading to confusion.
- There is a lack of diverse baseline comparisons, and citations for compared methods are missing.
- The distinction between Semi-Open Learning and traditional Open-Set Learning could be further clarified.
- The scalability of the method with increasing levels and categories requires additional exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical symbols and notations throughout the paper, ensuring consistency and alignment with descriptions, particularly in Figure 2 and Appendix C. Additionally, we suggest providing more diverse baseline comparisons, including simpler methods, to better illustrate the improvements of the HERT framework. It would also be beneficial to clarify the technical insights and differences between Semi-Open Learning and traditional Open-Set Learning, particularly regarding the implications of hierarchical labels. Furthermore, providing more detailed examples of coarse label generation would enhance comprehension. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the scalability of the method with increasing levels and categories and to provide a detailed analysis of the computational requirements for training and deploying the HERT framework.
