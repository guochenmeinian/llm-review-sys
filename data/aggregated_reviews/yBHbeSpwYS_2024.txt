Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for addressing contextual bias in multi-label image recognition through causal intervention. The authors propose a framework that decouples features, models confounders using k-means clustering, and implements causal interventions via cross-attention mechanisms. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of this approach, demonstrating significant improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to understand.
- The innovative approach effectively captures useful contextual information while suppressing spurious label correlations.
- Comprehensive methodology integrates multiple techniques, enhancing model robustness and accuracy.
- Thorough experimental validation shows consistent improvements across datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The rationale for using the k-means algorithm for confounder modeling requires further explanation.
- The number of cluster centers is fixed at 100; implications of increasing this number are unclear.
- The paper lacks detailed hyperparameter analysis and discussions on method limitations.
- Insufficient experimental evidence for confounder modeling effectiveness; more ablation studies are needed.
- Certain equations and modeling processes, particularly Equation 11, are confusing and need clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why the k-means algorithm is chosen for confounder modeling and clarify the implications of the fixed number of cluster centers. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of hyperparameters and their impact on model performance. More comprehensive ablation studies are needed to verify the effectiveness of confounder modeling. We also suggest clarifying the modeling process, particularly Equation 11, and including pseudocode to illustrate this process. Lastly, a thorough discussion on the limitations of the proposed method, including scenarios where it may underperform, would provide a more balanced view of its applicability.
