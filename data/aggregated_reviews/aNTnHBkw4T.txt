### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of hallucinations in diffusion models, defined as samples generated that lie outside the support of the real data distribution. The authors propose mode interpolation as a key phenomenon, where diffusion models interpolate between nearby data modes, leading to artifacts termed hallucinations. They attribute these hallucinations to the smooth approximation of discontinuous loss landscapes by the diffusion model. The authors also propose a method to detect hallucinated samples using a simple metric, emphasizing the importance of understanding the learned score function's behavior compared to the ground truth score function. Experimental findings demonstrate that hallucinations occur particularly between nearby modes, with a proposed metric effectively filtering out over 95% of hallucinations while retaining 96% of in-support samples. The implications of hallucination removal for recursive training are discussed, alongside new experiments with the DDIM sampler that add depth to the analysis of hallucinations. However, the authors acknowledge the limitations of their method and the need for improved metrics in future work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper introduces the under-explored area of hallucinations in diffusion models, providing a fresh perspective on mode interpolation as a source of these artifacts.  
2. High-quality research is evident through comprehensive experimental design and thorough analysis.  
3. The paper is well-written and clearly structured, making it accessible to both experts and newcomers.  
4. The authors provide a clear explanation of the ground truth and learned score functions, illustrating their impact on sample generation.  
5. Experimental results demonstrate the relationship between sampling timesteps and the frequency of interpolated samples, contributing to the understanding of mode behavior.  
6. The inclusion of new experiments with the DDIM sampler adds depth to the analysis of hallucinations.  
7. The significance of the research lies in its potential to enhance the reliability and accuracy of generative models by addressing hallucinations.

Weaknesses:  
1. The analysis primarily focuses on synthetic datasets, which may not fully capture the complexities of real-world data distributions. The authors should explore the hallucination phenomenon in more complex datasets, such as natural images.  
2. The discussion on the implications of hallucinations for recursive training stability is brief and lacks depth; a more extensive exploration is warranted.  
3. The explanation of mode interpolation as a cause of hallucinations is not entirely convincing, particularly in more complex datasets. Additional evidence is needed to support this claim.  
4. The proposed metric for detecting hallucinations lacks a formal definition and clarity in its calculation, which should be addressed for rigor.  
5. The clarity of terminology, particularly regarding the term "decoder," needs improvement.  
6. The paper lacks a comprehensive discussion of the limitations of the proposed method, which should be addressed in the revision.  
7. There is a noted typo regarding the relationship between interpolated samples and sampling timesteps that requires correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental scope by including more complex datasets, such as CIFAR-10 or CelebA, to validate their findings on real-world data distributions. Additionally, a more in-depth analysis of the implications of hallucination mitigation on recursive training dynamics should be included, potentially with detailed experiments on long-term effects. We suggest providing more evidence for the relationship between mode interpolation and hallucinations in complex cases, including the role of the decoder. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the formal definition of the proposed metric $\texttt{Hal}(x)$ and ensure its calculation is consistent across experiments. We also recommend improving the clarity of the term "decoder" in the revised version and including a detailed discussion of the limitations of their proposed method to provide a more balanced perspective. It is essential to correct the typo regarding the "inversely" proportional relationship between the frequency of interpolated samples and the number of sampling timesteps. Finally, we encourage the authors to include detection results with varying data sizes to demonstrate the generality of the proposed detection metric.
