### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to 3D mesh texturing without explicit UV mapping, proposing UV3-TeD, which represents texture as a point cloud with color features. The authors utilize a point cloud DDPM augmented with a heat diffusion block and farthest-sampled attention mechanism to generate colored point clouds constrained to the mesh surface. The method aims to improve texture generation by mixing intrinsic and extrinsic adjacency in the diffusion process and adding an attention mechanism for long-range consistency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method avoids per-category training and seams on UV maps, offering a fresh perspective on texturing.
- The integration of denoising diffusion with heat diffusion is innovative, suggesting broader applications beyond mesh texturing.
- The paper is well-presented, with clear visualizations that effectively communicate the concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The generated textures often lack high-frequency details, appearing cartoonish or blurred rather than photorealistic.
- There is insufficient experimentation on the Objaverse dataset and a lack of detailed explanations regarding results and comparisons.
- The necessity of using a hybrid architecture for texturing points is not adequately justified, and the benefits of the proposed method over traditional transformer architectures are unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the detail in Figure 3 to better illustrate the entire pipeline. Additionally, including experiments on the Objaverse dataset and providing qualitative analysis examples would strengthen the paper. To enhance the credibility of their claims, the authors should compare their method with existing UV-mapping-based texture generation methods, both quantitatively and qualitatively. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding high-frequency texture generation and providing multi-view rendered results would further validate the effectiveness of their approach.
