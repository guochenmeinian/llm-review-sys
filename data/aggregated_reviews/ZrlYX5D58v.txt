### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to ranking list truncation in legal case retrieval through the proposed framework, MileCut. The authors focus on the multi-view nature of legal documents, specifically the elements of fact, reasoning, and judgment, to enhance retrieval precision and efficiency. MileCut employs a dual encoder to capture comprehensive representations of these elements and utilizes a multi-view truncation module to optimize cut-off decisions. The framework demonstrates improved performance over existing methods across three datasets, including a newly released dataset for Chinese civil cases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The multi-view truncation approach significantly advances legal case retrieval by addressing the complexities of legal documents.
- The inclusion of a case elements extraction module and a multi-view truncation module reflects a deep understanding of the domain.
- The release of the Chinese Civil Case Retrieval Dataset (C3RD) is a valuable contribution for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks detailed experimental statistical analysis, making it difficult to assess the significance of MileCut's improvements.
- There is insufficient discussion on model complexity and resource requirements, which is crucial for practical implementation.
- The limitations and potential failure scenarios of MileCut are inadequately addressed.
- Figures are not always clearly explained, hindering understanding of the system's architecture.
- Ethical considerations regarding the dataset creation are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis of experimental results to provide concrete evidence supporting MileCut's superiority. A thorough discussion of the model's complexity and resource requirements is essential, particularly for large legal databases. The authors should also include a comprehensive examination of the limitations and potential failure scenarios of MileCut. Additionally, clearer explanations of the figures and ethical considerations related to the dataset creation should be provided. Finally, we suggest elaborating on the rationale behind the choice of using 30 randomly selected cases for each query in the COLIEE dataset and discussing the implications of this choice on the study's findings.
