Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GALOPA, a novel paradigm for self-supervised graph learning based on optimal transport theory, which aligns optimal transport plans for graphs and node representations. GALOPA simplifies data requirements by eliminating the need for positive/negative sample pairs and introduces a new loss to share matching information between graph space and representation space. The authors propose two variants of the algorithm: GALOPA(cube) and GALOPA(linear). Experimental results demonstrate that GALOPA achieves state-of-the-art performance and robustness across various benchmark datasets, with GALOPA(linear) showing comparable or superior performance while significantly reducing training times. The optimization process utilizes the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, confirming the convergence properties of the involved gradients.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem addressed is significant, effectively combining graph contrastive learning and graph auto-encoders while avoiding their limitations.
2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with helpful illustrations that enhance understanding.
3. The experimental design is robust, providing convincing interpretations of results that validate the proposed methodology.
4. The paper effectively demonstrates the efficiency of GALOPA(linear) with empirical results showing significant time savings without a substantial loss in accuracy.
5. The authors provide a thorough comparison of the two algorithm variants across multiple datasets, enhancing the robustness of their findings.
6. The use of the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm for optimization is well-articulated, with references to relevant theoretical work.

Weaknesses:
1. The time complexity analysis is inadequately placed in the appendix rather than the main text.
2. There are minor typographical errors that need correction.
3. The authors should conduct Wilcoxon signed rank tests to verify the proposed method's performance in Tables 1-2.
4. The initial concerns regarding the cost of fast algorithms and their impact on model performance were not fully addressed until later in the response.
5. The paper could benefit from additional experiments, particularly on the ogbn-arxiv dataset, to further validate the proposed methods against relevant baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the placement of the time complexity analysis in the main text for better accessibility. Additionally, please correct the identified typographical errors and conduct Wilcoxon signed rank tests for the results in Tables 1-2. It would also be beneficial to provide more detailed information about the experimental setup, including the size of the graph datasets used, and to explain why using only node attributes yields the best performance in Section 6. Furthermore, consider adding an ablation study on the proposed losses to assess their contributions and provide algorithms for computing the transport plan. We also encourage the authors to improve the clarity of their initial discussion regarding the trade-offs of fast algorithms and their impact on model performance. Lastly, including the timing results for both GALOPA(cube) and GALOPA(linear) on the ogbn-arxiv dataset would strengthen the paper's claims regarding efficiency.
