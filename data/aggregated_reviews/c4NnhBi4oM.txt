Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DrivAerNet++, a large-scale multimodal dataset for aerodynamic car design, consisting of 8,000 diverse car designs generated through high-fidelity CFD simulations. The dataset enhances simulation fidelity with a more complex cell structure and includes various data modalities such as 3D meshes, aerodynamic coefficients, and flow data. It supports a wide range of machine learning applications, including design optimization and CFD simulation acceleration, and provides benchmark results for drag coefficient prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- DrivAerNet++ is the largest and most comprehensive dataset for aerodynamic car design, addressing limitations in existing resources.
- It features high-fidelity CFD simulations and diverse car configurations, enhancing its applicability in automotive design.
- The dataset is rigorously validated and well-documented, ensuring reliability for machine learning tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's size (over 39 TB) and complexity may limit accessibility for researchers with limited computational resources.
- It is currently limited to steady-state simulations, which may not encompass emerging design trends or futuristic concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset's accessibility by providing clearer guidelines for handling its complexity and suggest including transient analyses to broaden its applicability. Additionally, we encourage the authors to document the meshing process in detail and consider using multiple solvers beyond OpenFOAM to enhance the reliability of the CFD results. Conducting further ablation studies to explore the dataset's effectiveness across various tasks would also be beneficial.
