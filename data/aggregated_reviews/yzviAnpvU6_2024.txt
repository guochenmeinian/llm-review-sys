Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel zeroth-order optimization method called ReLIZO, which utilizes linear interpolation for efficient gradient estimation. The authors model gradient estimation as a quadratically constrained linear program, allowing for reduced computational complexity by reusing prior queries without additional sample size conditions. The method demonstrates efficacy in various applications, including black-box adversarial attacks and neural architecture search, achieving faster convergence and improved solutions compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing clear explanations and a well-contextualized approach.
2. It introduces a method that enables gradient estimation using arbitrarily sampled vectors, enhancing the zeroth-order optimization process.
3. Extensive empirical evaluations validate the method's performance across simulation benchmarks and real-world applications.
4. The approach effectively combines efficiency with accuracy, as evidenced by comprehensive results and technical details.

Weaknesses:
1. The method's reliance on the choice of reusable distance bounds may complicate implementation due to the need for fine-tuning.
2. The computational overhead from solving the quadratically constrained linear program could be significant for large dimensions.
3. The overall impact of zeroth-order gradient estimation may be limited, particularly in neural architecture search, where optimal performance is not consistently achieved.
4. The random sampling strategy in the ReLIZO algorithm may not be the most effective; more informed sampling strategies could be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the sampling strategy in the ReLIZO algorithm to enhance performance by utilizing known information rather than relying on random sampling. Additionally, addressing the potential computational overhead associated with solving the quadratically constrained linear program for larger dimensions could further strengthen the method's applicability.
