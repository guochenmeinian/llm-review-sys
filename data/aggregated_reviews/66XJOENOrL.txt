Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SRFUND, a benchmark dataset aimed at enhancing form understanding tasks through hierarchical structure reconstruction. It includes 1,592 form images across eight languages, with detailed annotations at various granularities, such as word, text-line, entity, and item table levels. The authors propose that SRFUND addresses existing dataset limitations, providing a structured representation for cross-lingual form understanding. The dataset supports five key tasks: word to text-line merging, text-line to entity merging, entity classification, item table localization, and full document hierarchical structure recovery, validated through extensive baseline experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- SRFUND offers extensive annotations across multiple granularities and languages, making it a valuable resource for diverse form understanding applications.
- The dataset's focus on hierarchical structure recovery addresses a significant gap in current datasets.
- The meticulous construction and validation processes reflect high research quality.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the multi-layered annotation process may limit scalability and usability.
- The tasks supported by the dataset are not clearly defined, making it challenging to assess their impact on comprehensive form understanding.
- The dataset is not large-scale, and the training process lacks sufficient detail.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors simplify the annotation process and provide tools or guidelines to enhance accessibility and usability for a broader audience. Additionally, expanding the range of tasks supported by SRFUND to include multi-modal tasks, such as generating text from forms or vice versa, could increase its utility. We also suggest adding a section in the appendix to discuss limitations in detail, including the types of forms covered and potential inconsistencies with existing datasets. Furthermore, providing clearer descriptions of the training process and including out-of-domain evaluations would strengthen the paper.
