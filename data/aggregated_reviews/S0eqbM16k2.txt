### Key Points
This paper presents Hierarchy-aware Joint Supervised Contrastive Learning (HJCL), a novel approach for representation learning in Hierarchical Multi-Label Text Classification (HMTC). HJCL integrates a ZLPR loss and two label-aware contrastive loss terms, addressing the under-exploitation of label information in traditional methods. By utilizing multi-head attention to extract label-aware embeddings and constructing contrastive pairs based on label hierarchy, HJCL facilitates both instance-wise and label-wise contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on four HMTC datasets showcase HJCL's superior performance compared to existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an effective supervised contrastive learning method leveraging label hierarchy, improving HMTC model accuracy.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate HJCL's promising results across all benchmark datasets, surpassing baselines significantly.
- The manuscript is well-organized, with good visualizations aiding comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- Certain notations lack clear definitions, complicating reader comprehension.
- The ZLPR loss function's distinctiveness may introduce bias, leading to unfair comparisons with other methods.
- The novelty of HJCL is questioned due to existing hierarchical contrastive learning works, necessitating a clearer distinction from prior research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notations and definitions, particularly regarding the attention mechanism and the meaning of variables such as $d$ and $j$. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive comparison with related methods to justify the novelty and significance of their approach. Explicitly addressing the relationship of $\mathcal{N}_\ell$ as the set of negative samples at layer $\ell$ would enhance clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to release data and code to facilitate future research.
