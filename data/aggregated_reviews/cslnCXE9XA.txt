Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for unsupervised style transfer by disentangling content and style representations, challenging the independence assumption between these variables. The authors introduce two theories with proofs of identifiability for both style and content variables, asserting that content can be preserved without style. They propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for style transfer, evaluated against state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrating performance improvements in most metrics. An ablation study highlights the significance of each model component. Additionally, the authors present a model built on CPVAE that incorporates causal influence modules and sparsity regularizations to enhance sentiment transfer performance. They establish domain-varied dependencies between content and style, leading to improvements over baseline models, and introduce a tense transfer task to verify their theoretical insights, demonstrating significant accuracy improvements with their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes to style transfer by removing the independence assumption between style and content.
- It provides robust theoretical support and empirical validation for its claims.
- The framework shows potential for application in various models.
- The authors effectively address previous reviewer concerns and provide substantial revisions to the manuscript.
- The incorporation of domain information and the new tense transfer task are well-articulated and supported by experimental results, showcasing clear improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues exist in the questions section and definitions of key concepts such as "style" and "identifiability guarantee."
- The evaluation is limited to sentiment transfer, restricting broader claims about counterfactual generation.
- The reliance on automatic metrics without human evaluation may not adequately demonstrate the framework's effectiveness.
- The authors' responses to reviewers appear to focus more on soliciting feedback rather than providing comprehensive clarifications on all points raised.
- Some reviewers expressed a desire for more detailed discussions on the implications of their findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly defining key concepts like "style" and "identifiability guarantee." Additionally, the authors should consider expanding the evaluation to include human assessments to validate the effectiveness of their framework beyond automatic metrics. It would also be beneficial to clarify the connection between their model and existing counterfactual generation frameworks, as well as to address the limitations of their evaluation metrics, particularly regarding the BLEU score. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion of their findings' implications, particularly in relation to large language models and their potential benefits from the principles outlined in this work. Finally, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their responses to reviewers by directly addressing all concerns in a more detailed manner.
