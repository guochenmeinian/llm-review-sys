### Key Points
This paper presents a framework aimed at enhancing the efficiency of experiments for estimating personalized treatment effects through an active learning approach. The authors propose selecting the most informative unit-treatment combinations for experimentation, utilizing Bayesian active learning techniques alongside greedy and policy gradient-based optimization strategies to improve batch experimentation. The effectiveness of this approach is validated through experiments on synthetic and semi-synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The originality of this paper lies in its integration of active learning with treatment effect estimation, a combination not widely represented in existing literature. The quality of the paper is commendable, with claims supported by clear theoretical formulations and empirical experiments, supplemented by tabled results and illustrative visuals. The organization and clarity of the paper facilitate a logical progression from problem formulation to method implementation and results.

Weaknesses:  
The paper could benefit from a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the proposed methods, particularly regarding Greedy and Policy-Gradient based optimization compared to Softmax Top-K. Additionally, there is a need for more explanation of the covariate-response curve and the rationale for not including results from the Top-K method. The empirical significance of the findings could be better articulated, and a discussion on potential real-world applications and implications is recommended.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the proposed methods, specifically addressing the limitations of Greedy and Policy-Gradient based optimization in comparison to Softmax Top-K, including aspects like solve time and computational resources. Additionally, please provide more insight into the covariate-response curve and clarify the decision not to include results from the Top-K method. To enhance readability, include descriptive titles and labels in the plots in Appendix A.1. Explicitly state the specific method and dataset in contexts where "our method" and "our dataset" are referenced. Furthermore, please elaborate on how joint mutual information is implemented in the methodology section and clarify how the proposed methodology supports both discrete and continuous treatment options. Finally, consider discussing the empirical significance of the findings and potential real-world applications to strengthen the paper's impact.
