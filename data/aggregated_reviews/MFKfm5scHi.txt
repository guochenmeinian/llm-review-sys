Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents efficient algorithms to approximate the Pareto-optimal set for various bi-objective clustering problems, including k-separation, k-center, k-diameter, k-median, k-means, and k-MSR, utilizing different distance metrics. The authors propose two algorithm types: one for approximating the entire Pareto set for specific combinations of objectives and another for approximating the convex Pareto set for k-median and k-means problems. The theoretical analyses underpinning the algorithms are thorough, and experimental results indicate promising performance across different bi-objective clustering scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and accessible.
- The multi-objective clustering problem is significant for real-world applications, potentially inspiring further research.
- The comprehensive theoretical analysis and systematic coverage of various problem settings represent a solid contribution.
- Well-designed experiments effectively demonstrate the advantages of multi-objective clustering.

Weaknesses:
- The restriction of clustering centers to the point set raises questions, particularly regarding its necessity for approximating the convex Pareto set.
- The paper lacks motivation for studying the Pareto-optimal algorithm and the rationale behind the combination of clustering objectives.
- There is a need for experiments on large-scale datasets and comparisons with faster k-means++ methods.
- The algorithms exhibit polynomial running time, while other problems can achieve linear time optimization.
- Clarity could be improved in sections with heavy mathematical notation and proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for studying Pareto-optimal algorithms and the significance of the single linkage/must-link constraints. Additionally, conducting experiments on large-scale datasets and comparing the proposed algorithms with faster k-means++ methods would strengthen the paper. The authors should also clarify the main technical innovations and reconcile the use of bi-criteria guarantees with multi-objective guarantees. Lastly, an explicit limitations subsection would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
