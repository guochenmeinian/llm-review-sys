Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Rough Transformer (RFormer), an extension of the Transformer architecture designed to process continuous-time representations of time-series data. The authors propose a novel multi-view signature attention mechanism that captures both local and global dependencies by utilizing path signatures derived from the input data. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that RFormer outperforms existing models in terms of predictive performance and computational efficiency across various real-world time-series datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The incorporation of rough path theory into time-series representation learning is a novel approach that is likely to interest the machine learning community.  
- Experiments show significant improvements in accuracy and efficiency, highlighting the utility of multi-view signatures in time-series modeling.  

Weaknesses:  
- The empirical evaluations are limited, primarily focusing on simple tasks and datasets, raising questions about the model's performance on more complex tasks.  
- There is a lack of evaluations on time series forecasting tasks, and comparisons with recent RNN and Transformer models are missing.  
- The paper does not include ablation studies on the architecture's components, nor does it adequately discuss related work, particularly recent advancements in continuous-time models.  
- The motivation behind certain experimental setups, such as frequency classification, is questionable, and the analysis of interpolation methods is insufficient.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical analysis by including more complex tasks and datasets, particularly time series forecasting, to better validate the model's capabilities. Additionally, the authors should conduct comparisons with recent RNN and Transformer models, as well as include ablation studies to clarify the contributions of different components of the architecture. We also suggest enhancing the discussion on related work by integrating it into the main text and contrasting RFormer with closely related models. Finally, the authors should explore the effects of different interpolation methods on predictive accuracy and clarify the motivations behind their experimental designs.
