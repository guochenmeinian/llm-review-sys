Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a modification to NeRF's volume rendering by replacing piecewise constant opacity with piecewise linear opacity, addressing the "quadrature instability." The authors re-derive the quadrature integration method and demonstrate that their approach allows for a precise inverse of the ray termination CDF for importance sampling. Experimental results on standard datasets indicate both quantitative and qualitative improvements in rendering quality, with sharper and more stable outputs across varying viewpoints and distances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles an often-overlooked aspect of NeRF, proposing a novel modification that enhances the accuracy of quadrature estimates.  
- The piecewise linear formulation reduces conflicting ray supervision and leads to a more peaked opacity PDF.  
- Extensive derivations are provided, and the new formulations can be easily integrated into existing NeRF implementations.  
- Experimental results show significant improvements in rendering quality across various metrics.

Weaknesses:  
- The authors overlook a relevant prior work (Wu et al., 2022) that addresses similar integration inaccuracies and may offer more accurate solutions.  
- The paper lacks a thorough comparison of surface reconstruction quality with NeuS.  
- The explanation of inverse transform sampling in NeRF is insufficiently detailed.  
- Numerous grammatical errors and incomplete sentences hinder readability.  
- The experimental section does not adequately explore the impact on geometry reconstruction or computational complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the limitations of their approach, including a comparison with DIVeR and NeuS to clarify the advantages of their method. Additionally, we suggest expanding the explanation of inverse transform sampling in section 3.2 for clarity. The authors should also address the grammatical errors throughout the paper to enhance readability. Finally, including a more comprehensive analysis of the computational complexity and potential geometry improvements in the experimental section would strengthen the paper.
