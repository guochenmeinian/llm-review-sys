Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Objaverse-XL, a dataset containing over 10 million 3D objects, significantly expanding upon the previous Objaverse 1.0 dataset of 800,000 objects. The authors compile this extensive dataset from various sources, including manually designed objects and photogrammetry scans, to address the scarcity of high-quality 3D data. The authors propose that 2D and 3D datasets are complementary, leveraging the scale of 2D datasets for pre-training and fine-tuning on 3D datasets to enhance model generalization. Experiments demonstrate that training models like Zero123 on this dataset leads to improved performance in novel view synthesis, showcasing strong zero-shot generalization capabilities. The dataset provides significant metadata, including CLIP embeddings and various object attributes, facilitating diverse applications beyond mere generation. The release of Objaverse-XL is anticipated to foster further innovations in 3D vision research and enable advancements in tasks such as single image to 3D generation and text to 3D generation, facilitated by integration into the Threestudio framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Objaverse-XL is the largest and most diverse 3D dataset, comprising over 10 million objects, which opens significant new possibilities for 3D vision research.
- The dataset is comprehensively compiled from various sources, ensuring a wide range of object types and characteristics.
- The authors effectively demonstrate the dataset's potential through various experiments and scaling trends, showing significant improvements in model performance, particularly in zero-shot generalization.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with detailed statistical analysis and a commitment to adding documentation and examples for metadata usage.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset lacks detailed metadata, such as object category information, making it challenging for users to retrieve objects for specific use cases.
- Not all objects are of high quality, with some sourced from platforms like Thingiverse exhibiting low resolution and lack of texture.
- The current experiments primarily focus on novel view synthesis, lacking exploration of other downstream applications.
- The paper does not sufficiently explore the dataset's applicability to other tasks beyond novel view synthesis, and there is insufficient clarity on how different applications can benefit from Objaverse-XL compared to Objaverse 1.0.
- The demonstration of a strong shape prior is currently limited, particularly for objects without textures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by providing APIs and an interface for public contributions. Additionally, the authors should include more comprehensive metadata, such as text descriptions and object categories, to enhance usability. It would be beneficial to demonstrate the dataset's applicability to various downstream applications beyond novel view synthesis, including reconstruction tasks and 3D generation. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the potential negative societal impacts of the dataset, particularly concerning the misuse of 3D printing technologies. Clarity regarding the dataset's licensing and access instructions should be improved to facilitate user compliance. We also recommend exploring additional sources for collection, such as re-crawling GitHub or incorporating generative methods like DreamFusion, to enhance the dataset's scale. More generation baseline results and tasks should be included to provide solid conclusions, specifically training models like NeuS and VolSDF on Objaverse-XL. Finally, we encourage the authors to present specific quantities of failed examples within the dataset to provide insights into its quality and to conduct an ablation study to evaluate how the quality and scale of the dataset contribute to model performance.
