Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a query-based adversarial prompt generation method that eliminates reliance on adversarial transferability and local surrogate models. The authors propose a technique that can evade OpenAI and Llama Guard safety classifiers with near 100% success rates. The method modifies the existing GCG attack to enable targeted and proxy-free attacks on aligned language models, demonstrating effectiveness even in black-box scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed improvement is novel and interesting, with comprehensive related works.
- Practical considerations are included, and the breadth of evaluations is commendable.
- The paper is well-written, clearly detailing the attack steps and demonstrating significant improvements in attack success rates.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation setting is confusing, particularly regarding the attack's objectives and success criteria.
- The evaluations do not align with the major contributions, as the surrogate-free attack was only evaluated on open models and not against the actual GPT-3.5 model.
- The paper lacks comparisons against other black-box attacks, limiting its technical novelty.
- The focus is primarily on the attackerâ€™s perspective, with insufficient discussion on defenses or mitigations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation setting by explicitly defining the attack's objectives and success criteria. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons against other black-box attacks, such as those by Andriushchenko et al. and Lapid et al., to enhance the technical novelty. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the surrogate-free attack against a wider variety of LLMs and to discuss potential defenses against their proposed attack. Finally, we suggest that the authors articulate the technical challenges more clearly, particularly regarding the dependency on transferability.
