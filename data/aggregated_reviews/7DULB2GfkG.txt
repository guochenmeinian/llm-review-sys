### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for splitting large graphs into smaller graphs, which are processed with graph neural networks to predict desired properties, specifically applied to learning band gaps of hybrid perovskites. The method addresses complex chemical systems with heterogeneous substructures and demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy in predicting band gaps of hybrid solar cell materials.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is novel and has potential for computing chemical properties, particularly in predicting band gaps.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments lack sufficient detail, particularly regarding the neural network description.
- There is no discussion or comparison with prior works on multi-graph neural networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the description of the experiments and provide a more comprehensive overview of the neural network used. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of previous works on multi-graph neural networks to contextualize their contributions better.
