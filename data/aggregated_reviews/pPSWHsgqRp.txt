Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a label-free routing method, Smoothie, designed to route an ensemble of LLMs without annotated data. Smoothie constructs a latent variable graphical model over semantic embeddings of observable LLM outputs and unknown ground truth, estimating sample-independent quality scores for each LLM and routing to the one with the highest score. The method is evaluated on various generation tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness over supervised routing methods. Additionally, the paper addresses the selection of LLM responses for generative tasks, framing it as a "truth inference" problem that incorporates unstructured textual information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Smoothie effectively utilizes a latent graphical model and embedding language model to estimate LLM quality without labels, making it more applicable than supervised methods.
- Empirical results indicate that Smoothie outperforms other supervised routing methods and can conduct prompt selection.
- The problem of selecting LLM responses is practical and the proposed method is intuitive, showing potential effectiveness.
- The approach creatively applies a Gaussian graphical model, allowing for efficient training from unlabeled data and accurate LLM score estimation.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on embedding methods for semantic similarity limits Smoothie's applicability to semantic-related tasks, neglecting areas like mathematical reasoning.
- Experimental comparisons lack clarity, with chosen metrics being highly abstractive and making it difficult to ascertain routing success.
- The paper does not adequately discuss efficiency, limitations, or the implications of model selection, nor does it provide sufficient detail on related works and theoretical differences with existing literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of experimental comparisons by providing performance statistics of the models used and ensuring that chosen metrics are more transparent. Additionally, the authors should address the limitations and efficiency concerns more thoroughly, discussing the trade-offs between accuracy and the number of parameters. It would also be beneficial to summarize the most relevant works in the main text and clarify the technical differences with existing literature. Finally, we suggest including a graphical representation of the proposed model and ensuring that all symbols are clearly defined.
