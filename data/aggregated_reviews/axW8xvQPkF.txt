### Key Points
This paper presents a new metric for fairness in social influence maximization, termed mutual fairness, based on optimal transport theory. The authors propose a parameter \(\beta\) to balance fairness and efficiency, where \(\beta = 0\) ignores mutual fairness and \(\beta = 1\) enforces it. They also introduce the S3D (Stochastic Seedset Selection Descent) algorithm to optimize mutual fairness. The empirical evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach across various real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the mutual fairness metric is a significant contribution, capturing variability in outreach and providing a more accurate assessment of fairness in stochastic diffusion processes.
- The proposed metric and algorithm are practical, addressing real-world issues in social influence maximization.
- Extensive experiments validate the approach, showing enhancements in fairness while maintaining or improving efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks theoretical guarantees for the S3D algorithm.
- The generalizability from two groups to multiple groups is not convincingly demonstrated, raising concerns about complexity and distance calculations among more than two distributions.
- Some examples presented are extreme and may not reflect real-world scenarios.
- The evaluation of fairness based on utility distribution requires a discussion on depicting the ground-truth utility distribution accurately.
- The clarity of certain figures and metrics is questioned, particularly regarding the effectiveness of mutual fairness compared to existing metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical foundation of the S3D algorithm by providing guarantees. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating the generalizability of the mutual fairness metric to multiple groups with detailed analysis on computational complexity. The authors should also consider using more realistic examples in their motivation and clarify the depiction of ground-truth utility distributions. Furthermore, we advise revising the presentation of figures to enhance clarity and address the concerns regarding the effectiveness of mutual fairness compared to other metrics.
