Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a learning-based framework to compute optimal equilibria in n-player general-sum extensive-form games by leveraging Lagrangian relaxation and transforming these games into two-player zero-sum extensive-form games. The authors propose using regret minimization over conic hulls to solve the resulting saddle-point problem, effectively applying existing algorithms for zero-sum games. The paper includes thorough experimental evaluations demonstrating the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed methods across various games.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is a significant contribution to the field, offering a computationally practical approach to optimal equilibria in n-player general-sum games, enhancing the applicability of game-theoretic methods.
- The originality of the method is notable, and the paper is well-written, making it relatively easy to follow.
- The experimental results are compelling, showcasing a substantial advantage in wall-clock time over LP-based methods and demonstrating the scalability of the approach.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical results primarily focus on the efficiency of converting the problem to minimax equilibria, lacking detailed discussion on optimality in general-sum games.
- The reliance on the revelation principle raises concerns about the conditions under which fixed pure strategies exist and how to effectively find them.
- The notation used in the paper lacks intuitive explanations, and the presentation could benefit from a schematic representation of the mediator-augmented game framework.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the empirical results by providing additional details on optimality, particularly in general-sum games like Sheriff. It would be beneficial to include reference results on optimal equilibria solutions in these games in the appendix. Additionally, consider discussing and comparing existing research on equilibrium solutions for zero-sum games in Stackelberg games to provide contextual background. To enhance reader understanding, include a schematic representation of the mediator-augmented game framework. Lastly, clarify the specific conditions under which the revelation principle applies and how to effectively find fixed pure strategies.
