### Key Points
This paper presents a study on detecting norm violations in interactive live chat streaming platforms, specifically analyzing Twitch comments. The authors propose a new dataset, NormVio-RT, containing 4,583 moderated comments annotated into 15 fine-grained categories. They demonstrate that existing toxicity detection models perform poorly on live stream data, highlighting the necessity for new approaches. The inclusion of additional context, such as audio and video, enhances inter-annotator agreement and model performance, particularly for norms that depend on message relationships.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research problem is highly relevant and has significant practical implications for the NLP community.
- The methodology is thorough, with clear details on data collection, annotation strategy, experimentation, and analysis.
- The paper is well-written and presents novel insights into the differences between synchronous and asynchronous chat platforms.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not adequately explain why existing models have poor precision for toxicity detection, which requires further analysis.
- More information is needed regarding the experimental setup to enhance understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of why existing models struggle with precision in toxicity detection. Additionally, providing more detailed information about the experimental setup would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the claim regarding the evident benefits of additional context for determining norm violations and inter-annotator agreement would also be beneficial. Finally, including a specific example illustrating the utility of multi-user context would enhance reader comprehension.
