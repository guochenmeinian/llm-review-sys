Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a graph neural network-based deep learning model that integrates GNNs and Neural ODEs to predict two-body interactions, particularly in mixed-species collective motion. The authors demonstrate their approach through two numerical experiments, showcasing the model's ability to estimate interaction functions and replicate both individual and collective behaviors. However, the novelty of the contribution is questioned due to the existing body of work on GNN and Neural ODE integration, which the authors do not adequately address.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of GNNs and Neural ODEs is well-motivated and reasonable for modeling two-body interactions.
- The experiments effectively illustrate the model's efficiency and capacity across varying complexities.
- The paper is structured clearly, making it relatively easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The claimed novelty of combining GNNs and Neural ODEs is undermined by prior research, which the authors fail to discuss sufficiently.
- The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing methods for estimating collective motion dynamics.
- High computational costs and long training times are significant limitations.
- The writing is difficult to follow, with insufficient detail on the implementation and methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, particularly those integrating GNNs and Neural ODEs, to clarify their contributions and differences. Additionally, we suggest including a comparative analysis with existing methods such as SINDy or Bayesian optimization for estimating collective motion dynamics. The authors should also consider exploring the method's sensitivity to noise and the potential benefits of incorporating a physics-informed loss to enhance model generalization. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed explanations of the training process and the roles of GNNs and Neural ODEs in their framework.
