### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic methodology for designing pipeline parallelism schedules, focusing on high activation memory and pipeline bubbles. The authors propose a new framework that decomposes pipeline schedules into repeating building blocks, introducing V-shape building blocks (V-Min, V-Half, V-ZB) that offer controllable activation memory. These building blocks reduce peak activation memory compared to the traditional 1F1B approach and achieve higher throughput with fewer pipeline bubbles. Evaluations indicate substantial improvements in throughput and memory efficiency over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a systematic methodology for designing efficient pipeline parallelism schedules, enhancing understanding and optimization.
- The introduction of V-Shape building blocks reflects a structured approach to pipeline parallelism.
- Experimental evaluations validate the practical benefits of the proposed methods, demonstrating significant improvements in throughput and memory efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental results for longer sequence lengths are lacking; 1024 and 3072 sequence lengths are insufficient for state-of-the-art large language models.
- The paper suffers from clarity issues, including numerous typos and grammatical errors, as well as unclear figure captions and discussions in appendices.
- Some sections, such as Section 4.4, are confusing, with unreferenced tables and unclear results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing typos and grammatical errors, particularly in the figures and captions. It would be beneficial to provide more substantive discussions in the appendices and ensure that figure captions clearly explain what is depicted. Additionally, we suggest including experimental results for longer sequence lengths to better align with state-of-the-art models. Clarifying the rationale for using 1F1B as the baseline and discussing the implications of the number of stages in the pipeline would enhance the manuscript's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the optimality of V-Half and other configurations regarding memory and throughput trade-offs.
