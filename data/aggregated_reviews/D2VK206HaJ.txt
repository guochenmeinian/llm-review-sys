Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel facial stylization method called ACFun, which utilizes two modules, the Abstract Fusion Module (AFun) and the Concrete Fusion Module (CFun), to learn abstract and concrete features from style and face images. The authors propose a Face and Style Imagery Alignment Loss to enhance the alignment of style and facial images in latent space, aiming to improve stylization accuracy. The method is validated through extensive experiments, demonstrating its ability to produce high-quality artistic results compared to existing techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed ACFun method addresses limitations in existing facial stylization approaches by effectively combining abstract and concrete features.
- Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of ACFun, yielding visually appealing results.
- The paper is well-structured, facilitating reader comprehension.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on qualitative results raises concerns about the subjectivity of style transfer quality, with some reviewers noting that alternative methods like InstantStyle may yield better outcomes.
- Certain experimental aspects, such as the impact of varying diffusion steps and the influence of gender differences in style and face images, require further exploration.
- The clarity of some sections is compromised by vague language, particularly regarding the alignment loss and specific technical terms that need clearer definitions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors evaluate the model based on user preference through a survey with a sufficient number of participants to objectively assess which stylization is favored.
- The authors should clarify the ambiguous sections identified in the weaknesses, particularly regarding the alignment loss and specific terms like "VQ space" and "binding phenomenon."
- We suggest including quantitative metrics to complement qualitative results, enhancing the robustness of the findings.
- The authors should consider providing additional visual examples to illustrate concepts such as "style leakage" and the extraction of visual elements from style images.
