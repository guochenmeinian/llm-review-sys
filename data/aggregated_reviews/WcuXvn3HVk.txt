### Key Points
This paper presents AERO, a deep reinforcement learning-based approach aimed at optimizing account migration across blockchain shards. It emphasizes reducing cross-shard transactions rather than merely balancing transaction loads. The authors evaluate AERO using a dedicated sharding blockchain system, AEROChain, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods, including Spring, Broker, LB-Chain, and Monoxide, using real Ethereum transaction data. The results indicate that AERO significantly outperforms these approaches in minimizing cross-shard transactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed design effectively addresses the issue of cross-shard transactions.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, considering multiple influential factors, including overhead.
- Real Ethereum transaction data enhances the credibility of the evaluation.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's structure is unconventional, introducing AEROChain before detailing AERO, which may mislead the focus.
- There is a lack of discussion on AERO's integration with other blockchain designs.
- The scalability of the method with real-world blockchain sizes and transaction volumes is uncertain.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's organization by detailing AERO before introducing AEROChain to maintain focus. Additionally, a discussion on AERO's applicability to other blockchain designs would enhance the paper's generalizability. Clarifying how the prefix length is chosen and its implications is essential, as is addressing the consistency of terminology, particularly regarding "SPRING." We also suggest supplementing the experiments to explore the trade-off between load balancing and the quantity of cross-partition transactions. Finally, the authors should consider providing measures to verify the statistical significance of the reported results and clarify their commitment to open science by sharing research artifacts.
