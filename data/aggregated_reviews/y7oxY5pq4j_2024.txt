Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents RobIR, an inverse rendering approach aimed at high-illumination scenes characterized by strong shadows and specular reflections. The authors propose a method that decouples environment lighting from object materials, enhancing albedo estimation without baked shadows. Key innovations include an optimizable ACES tone mapping and a regularized visibility estimation model, which collectively improve the handling of HDR color and shadow occlusions. The experimental results demonstrate superior performance in shadow disentanglement compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed optimizable ACES tone mapping effectively improves inverse rendering results.
- The visibility representation (RVE) enhances accuracy and stability in visibility evaluation.
- The thorough experiments and ablation studies validate the model design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The benefits of ACES tone mapping in shadow removal are not convincingly demonstrated, raising questions about its robustness.
- The method's complexity, involving a two-stage training pipeline, limits its novelty and may lead to over-smoothing of details.
- The evaluation metrics for albedo estimation are flawed, as PSNR alone is insufficient due to scale invariance issues.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the ACES tone mapping's advantages by providing visualizations of the tone-mapping curves and evaluating their accuracy against ground truth. Additionally, the authors should consider incorporating more appropriate scale-invariant metrics for albedo evaluation. It would also be beneficial to address the potential over-smoothing effects of the regularization terms and clarify the method's applicability to metallic and glossy materials. Lastly, including NVS rendering quality metrics in the supplementary material would enhance the comprehensiveness of the evaluation.
