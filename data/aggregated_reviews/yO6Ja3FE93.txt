### Key Points
This paper presents SymRITa, an architecture that integrates symbolic (Horn) rules into a logic transformer for inductive relation prediction in knowledge graphs. The authors propose a method where rules are learned from sub-graphs around target entities and embedded using a conjunction attention mechanism. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that SymRITa outperforms state-of-the-art methods in triple classification and relation link prediction. The paper includes an ablation study assessing the contributions of various components to performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The modeling of symbolic rules is novel and contributes to the interpretability of link prediction.
2. The paper is well-structured and presents promising experimental results against established benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. Certain aspects of the architecture, such as the handling of variable order in the conjunction attention matrix and the scalability of the model, are unclear.
2. The evaluation metrics and the effectiveness of logic extraction require further discussion and analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify how variable order is handled in the conjunction attention matrix, particularly in Section 4.2.2. Additionally, it would be beneficial to provide insights into the significant runtime issues mentioned, possibly by optimizing rule extraction through mutualization among different triples and leveraging existing methods like AnyBurl or AMIE. We suggest including a subsection on the performance of SymRITa in transductive scenarios and elaborating on the experimental setup for inductive reasoning with unseen relations. Furthermore, a clearer explanation of the model's operation, including how negative examples are computed, would enhance understanding. Lastly, we encourage the authors to address the selection of evaluation metrics and provide additional analyses on the sorting results of constructed implicit rules.
