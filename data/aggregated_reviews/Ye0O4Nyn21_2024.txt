Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a real-time version of the SEUDO algorithm, termed realSEUDO, for processing multi-photon calcium imaging (CI) data. The authors propose enhancements that enable simultaneous extraction of regions of interest (ROIs) and time traces, achieving performance that rivals state-of-the-art offline algorithms and surpasses online methods. The algorithm incorporates optimizations such as parallel processing and a feedback loop for real-time cell identification, addressing the limitations of batch processing methods in closed-loop neuroscience investigations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear motivation and concise literature summary.
- The integration of algorithmic components is convincing, leading to impressive speed and performance.
- Extensive experimental validation using both simulated and real datasets demonstrates the algorithm's capabilities.

Weaknesses:
- The main improvements stem from engineering the SEUDO implementation for near real-time performance, raising questions about the novelty.
- The merging procedure appears heuristic and could benefit from earlier discussion in the text.
- Limited comparison with only two algorithms and the unclear rationale for not using more advanced methods or additional datasets.
- The performance drop with larger datasets and the lack of validation with typical cortical recordings are concerning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the merging procedure by discussing its logic earlier in the manuscript. Additionally, expanding the comparison to include more algorithms, such as FIOLA, and utilizing datasets like the Allen Visual Coding - 2P dataset would strengthen the evaluation. We also suggest conducting an ablation study on key components of the algorithm to clarify their contributions. Finally, integrating motion correction algorithms within the realSEUDO pipeline could enhance its usability in diverse experimental settings.
