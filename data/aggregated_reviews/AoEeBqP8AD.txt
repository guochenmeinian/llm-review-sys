Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an integrated approach to anomaly detection in the presence of missing data, addressing the imputation bias inherent in traditional methods. The authors propose a multi-objective learning framework that jointly optimizes imputation and anomaly detection, generating pseudo-abnormal samples in the latent space. Experimental results indicate that this method outperforms conventional "impute-then-detect" approaches across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study tackles a significant problem in anomaly detection with missing values, employing a novel approach.
- The manuscript is well-written and provides a robust theoretical foundation.
- Extensive experiments support the claims made, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- Implementation details are unclear, particularly regarding hyperparameter selection and the handling of missing values.
- The evaluation lacks scenarios with high missing rates, which are common in real-world applications.
- The performance sensitivity to parameter choices and the rationale for using Sinkhorn distance require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of implementation details, specifically how hyperparameters are selected and how missing values are processed before input into the network. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the proposed method under more realistic conditions with higher missing rates, as well as discussing the effectiveness of the method concerning different missing mechanisms. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more insights into the sensitivity of performance to the choice of parameters and the necessity of using Sinkhorn distance.
