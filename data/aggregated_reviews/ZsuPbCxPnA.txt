### Key Points
This paper presents a novel non-autoregressive text editing method that adapts connectionist temporal classification (CTC) to include copy actions, enhancing flexibility and language generalization. The authors propose a method that models editing with latent alignments from CTC, achieving competitive performance on grammatical error correction (GEC) and sentence fusion tasks. Key contributions include: (1) the introduction of copy actions like KEEP for direct modeling of edits; (2) strong performance surpassing prior Seq2Edit models; (3) cross-lingual generalization capabilities demonstrated on German and Russian; and (4) robust analysis revealing the model's flexibility across various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method exhibits good cross-lingual generalization, performing competitively with Seq2Seq models on German and Russian GEC.
- Robust experimental results on GEC and sentence fusion tasks, outperforming previous non-autoregressive methods.
- Clear exposition and thorough evaluation of the proposed method against multiple existing models.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as similar methods have been explored in machine translation.
- Insufficient exposition of the Gamma function implementation; it requires more detailed explanation.
- The large expansion of input length results in slower decoding times.
- The paper contains numerous typos and requires careful proofreading for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exposition of the Gamma function implementation by allocating additional sentences to explain its application. Additionally, addressing the slower decoding times due to input length expansion would enhance the paper's clarity. We suggest a thorough proofreading to correct the numerous typos and improve overall readability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explicitly highlight how their approach differs from similar methods in machine translation to strengthen the paper's novelty claims. Lastly, consider restructuring the paper for better flow and clarity, particularly in dense sections.
