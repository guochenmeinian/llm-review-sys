### Key Points
This paper presents Explore-Instruct, an instruction-dataset-generation approach that models domains and instructions as a graph, generating data through DFS-style traversal until reaching specified depth or breadth limits. The authors propose Alpaca-style generation for data within domains and train llama-7b models. Evaluations indicate that this method outperforms domain-specific models, although it does not fully match ChatGPT's performance. The approach effectively increases instruction set diversity while maintaining low overlap among instructions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method is straightforward and well-explored, yielding good results and interesting analyses regarding data quality.
- The graph search over domain spaces is a novel idea that performs reasonably well, enhancing the diversity of instruction sets.
- Comprehensive evaluation metrics provide insights into the quality and diversity of generated instruction data.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comparisons with other relevant baselines, such as self-instruct and alpaca, which would better highlight the method's improvements.
- There is an unfair comparison with Domain-aware Self-instruct, as it does not utilize exploration steps, and more details on its reproduction are needed.
- The evaluation is limited to a few domains, lacking coverage of more domain-intensive areas like biology or medicine.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparisons by including baseline methods such as self-instruct, alpaca, and Evol-Instruct to better demonstrate the advantages of their approach. Additionally, expanding the evaluation to include more comprehensive test domains, particularly those requiring expert knowledge, would strengthen the claims regarding domain-specific instruction generation. Finally, incorporating human assessments of in-domain instructions alongside model evaluations could provide further insights into the implications of their method.
