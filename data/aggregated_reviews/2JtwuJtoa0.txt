Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PbGMR-GMUS, a method for encoding graphs of physics systems into low-dimensional features, which are reconstructed into desired graph representations. An attention-based model is integrated into flow-based generative models to predict future dynamics in latent space, effectively handling both deterministic and stochastic fluid dynamics. The authors claim superior performance over previous methods, particularly in deterministic setups.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The model effectively learns graph representations in low-dimensional space.
* It utilizes a probabilistic method for simulating dynamics, enabling vivid long-term predictions.
* The approach addresses both deterministic and stochastic fluid dynamics.

Weaknesses:
* There is a missing citation at L62 for GMR-GMUS.
* Figure 1 contains a potential typo: "Coupling layer" may be incorrectly labeled as "Couling layer."
* The caption for Figure 5 is unclear regarding which represents the variance.
* The proposed model appears to be a straightforward extension of GMR-GMUS with simple modifications.
* Lack of ablation studies makes it difficult to assess the contributions of various components to performance improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 5's caption and correct any typographical errors in Figure 1. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to clarify the contributions of virtual pivotal positions, residual connections, and the conditional normalizing flow. It would also be beneficial to provide comparisons with existing learning-based models in Section 5.2 to better contextualize the challenges of predicting stochastic fluid systems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the limitations of their research to provide a broader perspective on potential areas for improvement.
