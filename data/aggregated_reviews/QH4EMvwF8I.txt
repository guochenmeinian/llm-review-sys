### Key Points
This paper presents a query expansion approach called query2doc, which aims to enhance both sparse and dense retrieval systems in information retrieval by generating pseudo-documents through large language models (LLMs). The authors demonstrate that query2doc significantly improves performance on ad-hoc IR datasets and provides publicly available software. The paper includes extensive experimentation across multiple retrieval models, showcasing the robustness and generalizability of the method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed approach effectively utilizes LLMs for query expansion, showing strong performance across various datasets and retrieval models.  
- The paper includes a thorough analysis of the effects of model and labeled data size on query expansion performance.  
- The experimentation is comprehensive, addressing a common shortfall in retrieval papers.

Weaknesses:  
- The method lacks theoretical justification, particularly regarding the empirical nature of repeating queries for sparse retrieval.  
- There is insufficient comparison with other query/doc expansion methods, and statistical significance tests are not reported.  
- The proposed approach may lead to incorrect assumptions about relevant documents, suggesting a need for a validation step and a failure analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for their method, particularly regarding the empirical aspects of query repetition. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons of query2doc with other query/doc expansion methods, such as DPR/ES+Doc2Query, and reporting statistical significance tests. It would also be beneficial to add a validation step to assess the relevance of generated passages and to include a failure analysis to better understand the limitations of the approach. Finally, clarifying the computational complexity and budget used in the experiments would enhance the paper's rigor.
