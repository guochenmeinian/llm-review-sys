### Key Points
This paper presents NORMSAGE, a framework for automatically extracting culture-specific norms from bilingual conversation datasets using GPT-3. The authors provide a method for relevance verification that can assess norm adherence and violation in real-time. The paper broadens the research on social norms beyond a predominantly white, U.S.-centric perspective, and the experiments demonstrate compelling results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and presents a promising approach to automatic norm discovery in multilingual contexts.  
- It proposes a large-scale norm knowledge base for further exploration and provides detailed baseline code and data samples.  
- The authors plan to release their data and code, enhancing reproducibility.  

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on closed-source models like GPT-3 raises reproducibility concerns due to unpredictable updates.  
- The paper lacks explicit research questions and objectives, making it difficult to assess the relevance of the results.  
- The choice of thresholds for correctness probability and grounding score is not justified, and some sections of the paper are poorly structured.  
- The contribution of the framework is questioned, as it appears to rely on simple prompts without addressing multicultural challenges effectively.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their research questions and objectives to better frame their contributions. Justifying the thresholds for correctness probability and grounding score would strengthen the methodology. Additionally, we suggest restructuring the paper to separate results from methods more clearly. Incorporating more competitive baseline models beyond GPT-3 would provide a stronger demonstration of NORMSAGE's advantages. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct additional experiments with open-source large language models and explore extracting social norms from diverse sources.
