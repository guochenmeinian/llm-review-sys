Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents G2D, a novel vision-language pre-training (VLP) framework for medical imaging that learns both global and dense visual representations from radiography images and their associated radiology reports. The key innovation is a pretext task called Pseudo Segmentation (PS), which uses a pseudo mask derived from attention maps to guide the learning of dense visual features during pre-training. The authors demonstrate that G2D outperforms existing medical VLP approaches on various downstream tasks, including classification, segmentation, object detection, and zero-shot visual grounding across multiple medical imaging datasets. Notably, G2D shows strong performance on segmentation tasks even when fine-tuned on very limited data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces an innovative method for learning dense visual representations in medical VLP without requiring pixel-level annotations.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the importance of learning dense representations in medical imaging tasks.
- The method is evaluated on a wide range of downstream tasks and datasets, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.
- G2D consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly on segmentation tasks with minimal fine-tuning data.
- The paper includes thorough ablation studies to validate key design choices.

Weaknesses:
- There is limited theoretical analysis regarding the effectiveness of the pseudo segmentation task.
- The complexity of the approach may hinder implementation and adoption.
- The pre-training process is computationally intensive, requiring significant resources.
- Generalization to other domains beyond medical imaging is uncertain.
- Some comparisons to more recent baselines are lacking, which could strengthen the evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the pseudo segmentation task to clarify its impact on dense representations. Additionally, addressing the complexity of the approach could facilitate wider adoption. The authors should consider exploring techniques to enhance computational efficiency, such as progressive training or curriculum learning. Furthermore, we suggest providing a more accurate description of existing methods to clarify how G2D differs from or improves upon established local alignment strategies. Lastly, the authors should investigate the potential of using the pseudo masks generated during pre-training for weakly supervised segmentation tasks and clarify the alignment of specific text to individual image regions.
