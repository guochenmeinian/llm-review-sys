Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a systematic framework called Bidirectional Explicit Linear Multi-step (BELM) for the exact inversion of diffusion sampling, which includes several existing samplers as special cases. The authors derive an optimal variant, O-BELM, through local truncation error minimization and investigate its theoretical properties, such as zero-stability and convergence. Experimental results validate that O-BELM achieves exact inversion and high-quality sampling, with potential applications in computer vision tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This paper is the first to formalize the exact inversion of diffusion sampling as a rigorous mathematical problem, establishing the bidirectional explicit property as a sufficient condition for achieving exact inversion.
2. O-BELM is introduced as an efficient sampler with theoretical guarantees under mild assumptions.
3. The derivation of local truncation error for general linear multistep samplers within diffusion models is a significant contribution.
4. Comprehensive experiments confirm O-BELM's capabilities in exact inversion and high-quality sampling.
5. The paper is well-articulated and clearly presented.

Weaknesses:
1. A typographical error exists in the caption of Table 3.
2. The paper lacks information on the scheduler settings used in experiments.
3. Some mathematical derivations are too succinct, making them difficult to follow, particularly the transition from equation (30) to equation (31).
4. The paper does not adequately discuss or compare with related works such as NMG, EDICT, and others addressing DDIM inversion limitations.
5. The evaluation metrics may not convincingly support the proposed method, lacking comparison with established benchmarks like DirectingInv.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of mathematical derivations to enhance comprehensibility, particularly in transitions between equations. Additionally, please include a discussion of the scheduler settings used in experiments and correct the typographical error in Table 3. It would be beneficial to provide a thorough comparative analysis with related works and utilize established evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets to strengthen the validation of O-BELM. Furthermore, exploring the integration of O-BELM with advanced image editing tasks and addressing other stability properties could enhance the paper's impact.
