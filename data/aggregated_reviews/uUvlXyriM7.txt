### Key Points
This paper presents an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) framework called CLASS, which includes the development of a proof-of-concept ITS named SPOCK aimed at teaching biology concepts. The authors define an evaluation protocol and provide a qualitative assessment of SPOCK with four experts, demonstrating positive outcomes. The contributions include a novel framework for breaking down complex concepts into manageable problems, the use of large language models (LLMs) for dataset generation, and a practical example of building LLM-based ITS.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The construction of scaffolding and conversational datasets for ITS is a significant contribution.
- The proposed CLASS framework effectively integrates LLMs with learning science principles.
- The qualitative evaluation by domain experts adds credibility to the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation results are subjective, lacking user feedback from students, which limits the assessment of the system's effectiveness.
- Clarity issues arise regarding the definitions and roles of CLASS, SPOCK, and the content index, necessitating clearer explanations and possibly diagrams.
- There is no assessment of the quality of the constructed datasets, and the reliance on GPT-4 raises concerns about generalizability and reproducibility.
- The absence of baseline comparisons for SPOCK and the need for ablation studies weaken the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the document by explicitly defining CLASS, SPOCK, and the content index, potentially including diagrams to illustrate their relationships. Additionally, conducting user tests or experiments to gather student feedback would strengthen the evaluation of the system. It would be beneficial to perform a quality assessment of the generated datasets and explore the framework's construction using open-source models to enhance reproducibility. Finally, we suggest presenting baseline comparisons for SPOCK and conducting ablation studies to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the framework's effectiveness.
