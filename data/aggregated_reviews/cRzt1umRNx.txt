Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of residual networks (ResNets) to non-Euclidean geometries by replacing the Euclidean addition operation with an exponential operation on Riemannian manifolds. The authors propose a method to learn a vector in the tangent space of a manifold and map it back using the exponential map, allowing for transformations between different manifolds. The experiments demonstrate improved performance on hyperbolic and SPD datasets compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical framework is sound and applicable to any smooth manifold metric.
- The proposed method shows empirical improvements over state-of-the-art techniques in hyperbolic and SPD spaces.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation is abstract and not easily accessible to practitioners, particularly in explaining Riemannian geometry and the exponential map.
- The definition of the vector field lacks sufficient formalism and contains inconsistencies, particularly regarding the mapping between tangent spaces.
- The applicability of the method to other non-linear manifolds without closed-form exponential maps remains unclear.
- The paper does not adequately discuss the algorithmic steps for training and evaluating Riemannian ResNets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by including concrete examples of the exponential map and vector fields earlier in the paper. Additionally, we suggest adding one or two algorithms that outline the training and evaluation steps for Riemannian ResNets. It is also crucial to address the inconsistencies in the definition of the vector field and clarify the applicability of the proposed method to other non-linear manifolds. Finally, a discussion on the computational costs compared to standard ResNets would enhance the paper's practical relevance.
