Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the diffusion model-based inversion problem, introducing the Consistent Direct Diffusion Bridge (CDDB) as a modification of the Direct Diffusion Bridge (DDB). The authors analyze existing works, unify them with Direct Diffusion Bridges, and highlight the neglect of data consistency in prior approaches. CDDB incorporates a data consistency term, demonstrating effectiveness across various inverse tasks such as inpainting, super-resolution, and deblurring.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper systematically summarizes current works and clearly delineates the differences from previous methods.
- It is well-supported by theorems and comprehensive experiments, showcasing strong performance on challenging problems.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, particularly in the background section.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method may be perceived as limited, primarily combining existing techniques without sufficient justification for its advantages over similar methods.
- The theoretical analysis lacks depth, particularly regarding the convergence of CDDB and the reliance on previous works without adequate self-containment.
- The paper does not sufficiently address the applicability of CDDB to popular tasks like textual inversion or image translation, raising questions about its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by providing more details on the convergence properties of CDDB and clarifying how it can outperform existing methods like DIS/DDS. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with other supervised methods and conditional diffusion methods in their experiments. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the role of the network \( G_{\theta^*} \) in the algorithm and ensure that the paper is self-contained, particularly regarding the conjugate gradient method and the pseudo-inverse formulation. Finally, addressing the applicability of CDDB to image translation and textual inversion would enhance the paper's relevance.
