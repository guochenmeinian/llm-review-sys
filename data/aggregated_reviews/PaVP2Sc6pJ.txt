### Key Points
This paper presents RoCliCo, the first public corpus for Romanian clickbait detection, comprising over 7,900 manually annotated news samples. The authors adopt contrastive learning with a BERT model to leverage cosine similarity between titles and content for clickbait detection. The empirical results indicate significant potential for future research in this area, and the dataset aims to serve as a valuable resource for developing and evaluating machine learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is novel and well-annotated, providing a valuable resource for researchers.
- The process of creating the dataset is thoroughly explained, enhancing transparency.
- Multiple experiments validate the efficacy of both handcrafted and deep models as baseline methods.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset description lacks specificity regarding domains, article lengths, and annotator qualifications.
- The rationale for separating news platforms in training and test sets is not clearly justified.
- The number of baseline models tested is limited, and the manuscript lacks statistical analysis of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by including specific details such as domains, average article lengths, and the annotator agreement score. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale behind separating news platforms in the training and test sets. To enhance the manuscript's utility, we suggest comparing RoCliCo with popular datasets to highlight its unique contributions. Furthermore, including a precision-recall curve for classification tasks would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of performance. Lastly, the authors should specify hyperparameters and model parameters to ensure reproducibility and facilitate application of their methodology.
