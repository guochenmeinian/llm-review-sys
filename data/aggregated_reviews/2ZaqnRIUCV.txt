### Key Points
This paper presents DPA-RAG, a novel framework designed to address the preference gap between retrievers and language model (LM) readers in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems. The authors clearly define the problem of misalignment between retrieved documents and the knowledge needs of LMs, proposing a three-component framework: preference knowledge construction, reranker-LLM alignment, and LLM self-alignment. Extensive experiments on four knowledge-intensive QA datasets demonstrate that DPA-RAG outperforms various strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing RAG systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-motivated, with clear observations that inform the design principles of RAG systems.
2. The dual preference alignment strategy effectively addresses knowledge misalignment, aligning both the reranker and the LM with knowledge preferences.
3. Innovative query augmentation techniques enhance the quality of preference knowledge, and the experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational cost of the preference alignment process, particularly the multi-grained distillation alignment, may be significant.
2. The reliance on LLM-generated preference scores for pair-wise preference alignment could introduce bias.
3. The data construction process lacks clarity, and the framework's generalizability to different datasets is questionable, as it requires retraining for each dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data construction process, particularly regarding the term "hierarchically sample" and the rationale behind selecting specific document ranks. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the computational complexity of DPA-RAG compared to other RAG methods and consider strategies for optimizing the efficiency of the preference alignment process. It would also be beneficial for the authors to discuss the potential limitations of their approach, especially regarding scalability and generalizability to various tasks or domains. Finally, the authors should provide more insights into the potential risks of filtering processes and ensure that relevant knowledge is not inadvertently removed.
