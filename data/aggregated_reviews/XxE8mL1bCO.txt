Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for reconstructing neural multi-scale signed distance functions (SDFs) from point clouds using an optimization-based approach. The authors propose an iterative pulling technique that optimizes the SDF for each scale, effectively capturing details at varying distances from the surface. The evaluation demonstrates that this method outperforms several existing surface reconstruction techniques across various synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The iterative multi-scale pulling approach is novel and effectively optimizes SDFs for different spatial regions.
- The evaluation is comprehensive, including multiple datasets and a robust ablation study, showing significant improvements over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks consideration of several relevant recent methods in optimization-based surface reconstruction.
- Some important related works are not cited, which could provide context and depth to the research.
- The exposition lacks motivation for certain design choices and is difficult to understand in parts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including recent relevant methods such as Neural-Singular-Hessian and Iterative Poisson Surface Reconstruction. Additionally, the authors should ensure that all relevant related works are cited, particularly in the context of training-free and learning-based methods. 

To enhance clarity, we suggest that the authors provide better motivation for their design choices, particularly regarding the use of features from previous query positions and the scaling factors in their equations. Furthermore, the exposition should be revised for clarity, addressing specific passages that are currently convoluted or unclear.

Lastly, we recommend including an inference time comparison between methods to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach's efficiency.
