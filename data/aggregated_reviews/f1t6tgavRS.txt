### Key Points
This paper presents MULAN, a novel method for causal structure learning in multi-modal settings, specifically targeting root cause localization in microservice systems. The authors propose a framework that includes a log-tailored language model for log representation, a contrastive learning approach for modality-invariant and modality-specific representations, an attention mechanism for assessing modality reliability, and network propagation for root cause localization. The effectiveness of MULAN is demonstrated through experiments on three real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of multiple data modalities significantly enhances the accuracy and reliability of root cause analysis (RCA).
2. The development of specific modules, such as the log-tailored language model and KPI-aware attention mechanism, represents a novel approach to RCA, capturing the intricacies of microservice systems.
3. The validation of MULAN on diverse real-world datasets demonstrates its practical applicability and robustness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a clear delineation of its contributions compared to previous works using multi-modality input.
2. There is insufficient explanation regarding the motivation for separating modality-specific and modality-invariant representations and their subsequent fusion.
3. The overall performance measurement of causal discovery is unclear, and the complexity of the proposed method is not provided.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions in the context of existing multi-modal approaches. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer explanation of the rationale behind the separation of modality-specific and modality-invariant representations and how this enhances RCA effectiveness. It would be beneficial to include metrics for evaluating the correctness of the entire causal graph learned by the proposed method. Furthermore, the authors should address the scalability of MULAN in large-scale data scenarios and provide details on its computational complexity. Lastly, we suggest conducting experiments to elucidate the contributions of the representation extraction module and the graph fusion module to the overall performance.
