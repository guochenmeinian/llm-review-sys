Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ASSEMBLAGE, a binary dataset designed to enhance the availability of benign binaries by generating over 890k Windows PE and 428k Linux ELF binaries from open-source projects. The authors claim that ASSEMBLAGE is reproducible and extensible, catering to diverse configurations across various compiler versions and optimization levels. The dataset and code are publicly accessible, promoting transparency and further research. ASSEMBLAGE addresses the critical challenge of obtaining high-quality benign binaries for machine learning applications, filling a significant gap in the current landscape of binary analysis resources.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Well-motivated dataset:** The authors clearly articulate the necessity of creating a comprehensive binary dataset, emphasizing the scarcity of high-quality benign binaries.
2. **Clear data generation process:** The paper provides a thorough explanation of the dataset generation process, ensuring reproducibility and robustness.
3. **Diversity of the collected data:** ASSEMBLAGE showcases a comprehensive dataset with extensive configurations, making it a valuable resource for various binary analysis tasks.
4. **Practicality in collection and application:** The dataset's effectiveness is demonstrated through detailed benchmarks and case studies, highlighting its potential to improve binary analysis models.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a detailed discussion of existing datasets and their limitations, which would further emphasize ASSEMBLAGE's unique contributions.
2. The description of the dataset generation pipeline could include more technical details about challenges encountered and solutions implemented.
3. There is insufficient quantitative analysis of the dataset's diversity, which could enhance understanding of its richness.
4. The authors do not adequately address the limitations of the dataset or potential areas for future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on existing datasets by providing a comprehensive comparison that highlights ASSEMBLAGE's distinct advantages. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the technical challenges faced during the dataset generation process, particularly regarding compiler flags and build configurations. Including quantitative analyses, such as statistical summaries of binary distributions across configurations, would clarify the dataset's diversity. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of ASSEMBLAGE, discuss potential misuse for malicious purposes, and propose future work to enhance the dataset's robustness and ethical use.
