### Key Points
This paper presents MxDNA, a novel tokenization method for genomic foundation models that diverges from traditional NLP approaches. MxDNA learns a tokenization strategy that accommodates the discontinuous, overlapping, and ambiguous nature of genomic sequences. The tokenization module integrates basic unit recognition and assembly within an encoder pipeline, enhancing global relationships through transformer blocks. The authors benchmark MxDNA against existing models like DNABERT and HyenaDNA, demonstrating its superior performance on genomic benchmarks. Additionally, the authors propose an ablation study on k-mer lengths, showing that varying k-mer sizes can yield distinct advantages across different tasks, with maximum performance surpassing that of single nucleotide tokenization. The authors have also revised the method section and pseudocode for clarity, addressing previous feedback regarding grammatical errors and the need for clearer explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The originality of MxDNA lies in its learned tokenization scheme, which is well-motivated and logically designed to address the inadequacies of NLP tokenization in genomics.
- The end-to-end learning of the tokenization scheme is well-integrated into the model's design.
- The benchmarking against a diverse set of genomic foundational models strengthens the credibility of the results.
- The ablation study on k-mer lengths provides valuable insights into performance variations across different tasks.
- Revisions to the pseudocode and method descriptions enhance clarity and readability.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks clarity and coherence, making it difficult to comprehend as a standalone document. Key details are omitted, and the pseudocode is poorly defined, hindering understanding.
- The writing quality of the paper, including the main text and appendix, requires substantial improvement for better comprehension.
- The introduction of an ambiguous tokenization strategy raises concerns about its effectiveness, particularly regarding the relationship between context and token mapping.
- The explanation of jitter noise needs to be explicitly stated in the manuscript.
- There is no discussion on computational complexity, which is critical given the demands of foundation models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by ensuring it is self-contained, allowing readers to grasp the MxDNA architecture without needing to reference external materials. The pseudocode should be revised to clearly define function calls and operations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the learning process of the tokenization scheme during pretraining and consider varying the k-mer lengths in the ablation studies to explore their impact on performance. 

Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the overall writing quality of the paper to facilitate reader understanding and utilization of the tokenization scheme. It is essential to explicitly state the clarification on jitter noise in the manuscript. Lastly, addressing grammatical errors and providing a more detailed discussion on computational complexity, including training time and FLOPs, would enhance the paper's overall quality.
