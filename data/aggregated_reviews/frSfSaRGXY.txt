Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on causal discovery through the introduction of the Meek separator, which identifies a minimal intervention set that can effectively decompose undirected edges into smaller connected components. The authors propose two randomized algorithms for subset search and causal mean matching, demonstrating logarithmic approximation guarantees. The effectiveness of these methods is validated through experiments on synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide strong theoretical guarantees for their randomized algorithms, achieving logarithmic time complexity.
- The Meek separator is applicable to both subset search and causal matching, with experimental results supporting its effectiveness.
- The logical presentation of the analysis enhances the understanding of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is dense and lacks clarity, particularly in motivating the main concepts and providing intuitive explanations for the Meek separator.
- There is a notable absence of real-world examples to illustrate the practical utility of the proposed methods.
- Readability issues arise from the heavy use of symbols and definitions without sufficient illustrative examples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's clarity by providing more intuitive explanations for the Meek separator and its advantages over alternatives like the Markov blanket. Additionally, including real-world examples would enhance the practical relevance of the work. To aid comprehension, we suggest breaking down Section 2 into subsections for definitions and related work, and incorporating basic examples for key graphical concepts. Furthermore, the authors should ensure that proofs contain sufficient detail and address the specific questions raised regarding the definitions and results presented in the paper.
