### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of three debiasing techniques for neural networks, revealing that while these methods reduce reliance on targeted biases, they may inadvertently lead models to depend on other unidentified biases. The authors conduct three experiments, demonstrating that current bias mitigation strategies can shift model reliance from measurable biases to unknown ones. The paper's findings contribute to understanding the complexities of model debiasing and its implications for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The experimental setup is well described and compelling, providing valuable insights into model debiasing behavior.  
- The paper is well written, with a clear message and an elegant synthetic experiment design that effectively detects debiasing behavior.  

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology and experimental design have key issues, lacking strong support for the conclusions drawn.  
- The synthetic nature of the data may not accurately reflect naturally occurring features, potentially undermining the generalizability of the results.  
- There is a lack of mathematical analysis for each debiasing method's performance, and some sections do not provide clear answers to posed questions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical analysis of each debiasing method's performance to strengthen their conclusions. Additionally, addressing the concerns regarding the synthetic dataset's relevance to real-world applications would enhance the paper's impact. Clarifying the rationale for creating naturalistic data instead of utilizing existing debiasing datasets is essential. We also suggest revising the presentation of figures and equations for better clarity, particularly in Figure 1 and the equations mentioned in lines 322, 324, 330, and 332. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide clearer answers in sections discussing the effectiveness of debiasing procedures.
