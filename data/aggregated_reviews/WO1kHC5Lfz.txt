Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents projection-free optimization algorithms for constrained nonconvex-(strongly) concave saddle point problems, specifically the R-PDCG and CG-RPGA algorithms. The authors provide convergence guarantees for these methods, demonstrating that their iteration complexities are $O(\epsilon^{-6})$ and $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ for nonconvex-concave objectives, and $O(\epsilon^{-4})$ and $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ for nonconvex-strongly concave objectives, respectively. The work emphasizes the advantages of projection-free methods over traditional projection-based approaches, particularly in terms of computational efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed algorithms extend Frank-Wolfe type methods to the nonconvex setting, filling a significant gap in the literature.  
- The paper is well-written and presents clear motivation and applications for the proposed methods.  
- The convergence rates achieved match those of state-of-the-art projection-based methods, indicating strong theoretical contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
- The theoretical novelty is limited, relying on standard proof techniques, particularly Lemma 4.1 and Lemma B.1.  
- The assumption that the set $Y$ is strongly convex for the R-PDCG method may restrict practical applicability.  
- The experimental results are insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding the performance of the AGP algorithm compared to the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the computational efficiency of the FMO oracle compared to projection methods, particularly regarding the nuclear norm constraint. Additionally, clarify the relationship between the strong convexity of the constraint set and the objective function, addressing whether strong convexity is necessary for the inner problem. We suggest including more extensive experimental results to strengthen the paper's claims, particularly regarding the performance of AGP. Finally, consider discussing the choice and setting of parameters $\tau_k$ and $\mu_k$ more thoroughly to enhance clarity and practical applicability.
