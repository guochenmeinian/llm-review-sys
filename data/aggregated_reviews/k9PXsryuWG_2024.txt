### Key Points
This paper presents a study of metric transformations of kernel matrices through a novel mathematical technique termed the representation theory of the hyperrectangle. The authors address three main problems: 
1. Characterizing entrywise transformations that preserve low-rank structure in matrices, demonstrating that polynomials are the only functions (without essential discontinuities of the first kind) that maintain low-rankness. This result extends to "approximately low-rank" matrices and functions with small finite differences.
2. Classifying functions of l_1 norm distance that yield positive semi-definite kernel matrices, concluding that these functions must be completely monotone.
3. Identifying functions that transform one semi-metric space into another, establishing the equivalence between Bernstein functions and transformations of l_1 distances to both l_1 and squared l_2 distances.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear proofs and a logical flow, making it accessible to readers.
- The mathematical rigor and the innovative application of Schurâ€™s lemma to the problems are commendable.
- The results significantly contribute to the understanding of low-rank matrix transformations and kernel methods, likely appealing to the NeurIPS community.

Weaknesses:
- The paper attempts to cover too much material for a conference setting, leading to a rushed presentation and a lack of cohesive narrative.
- Some sections feel disconnected, and the paper would benefit from empirical experiments to validate the theoretical results.
- Presentation issues, such as imprecise statements and excessive forward references, hinder readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the narrative structure of the paper to create a clearer connection between the sections. Additionally, we suggest including empirical experiments to demonstrate the results in Section 2, as this would enhance the paper's impact. It may also be beneficial to consider focusing the paper more narrowly on the results from Section 2, potentially moving Sections 3 and 4 to a subsequent paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to refine the presentation by providing more insights into the proof techniques and addressing the imprecise statements and typos throughout the text.
