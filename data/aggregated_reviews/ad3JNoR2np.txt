Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an online density ratio estimation method designed to adaptively train a predictor in the context of continuous covariate shift. The authors propose a method that estimates density ratios between training and testing distributions using a small number of unlabeled samples, employing a weighted empirical risk minimization algorithm. The theoretical analysis includes a dynamic regret bound, leading to an excess risk guarantee for the predictor. The method is validated through empirical results on synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing algorithms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, providing clear justification and useful theoretical analysis.
- Strong theoretical guarantees on both the ratio function and the learned model.
- The formulation using Bregman divergence allows for generalization of existing methods and effective adaptation to continuous shift settings.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical study is limited, primarily relying on synthetic data and a small real-world dataset, raising concerns about the robustness of results.
- The assumption of linear prediction models may not be sufficient, and the paper lacks discussion on extending the method beyond linear models.
- Important experimental results are located in the appendix, which may not be adequately reviewed by all readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical study by including more diverse datasets and clarifying hyperparameter settings to ensure robustness of results. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly address the limitations of using linear models and discuss potential expansions beyond linear models to inspire future research. Furthermore, moving some preliminary content to the appendix could allow for more critical experimental results to be included in the main text. Lastly, enhancing the presentation of experimental results would improve clarity and impact.
