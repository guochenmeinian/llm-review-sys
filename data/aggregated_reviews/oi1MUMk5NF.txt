Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DISCS, a new package and benchmark designed to unify and enhance the implementation and evaluation of discrete sampling methods. The authors address the challenges of inconsistent experimental settings and the complexity of implementing samplers. DISCS provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating discrete samplers across classical graphical models, combinatorial optimization, and energy-based generative models, offering new insights into scalability and adaptive sampling design.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The importance of discrete sampling is well recognized, and DISCS fills a gap by providing a convenient package and fair benchmarks.
2. The introduction of the local balanced weight function phenomenon offers valuable insights for selecting locally balanced functions.
3. The paper includes a comprehensive set of baselines and examples across various applications, enhancing its utility.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The experimental results lack standard deviations, which are crucial for assessing the reliability of findings.
2. Documentation primarily focuses on high-level usage, with insufficient detail on how to utilize internal functions and samplers outside the provided benchmarks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation to include detailed instructions on how to conveniently plug in new samplers and define experimental setups without concerns about parallelism and evaluation, as claimed in the introduction. Additionally, we suggest including standard deviations in the experimental results to enhance the reliability of the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the documentation of internal functions to facilitate their use in broader contexts beyond the specific benchmarks provided.
