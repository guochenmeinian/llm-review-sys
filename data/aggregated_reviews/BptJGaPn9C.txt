### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called QW-Orthogonality (QWO) for causal discovery in Linear Gaussian Acyclic Models (LiGAMs), focusing on improving the efficiency of computing causal graphs given a permutation. The authors claim that QWO achieves a computational complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$, significantly better than traditional BIC-based methods. The method utilizes a whitening matrix derived from the observed covariance matrix, allowing for efficient score evaluation across varying sample sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is theoretically guaranteed to learn the true graph for a given permutation with sufficient samples.
2. The computational complexity of QWO is notably lower than other methods, such as the BIC-based approach.
3. The approach is elegant and intuitive, with clear advantages demonstrated through experiments.
4. The method can be integrated into existing permutation-based algorithms, enhancing their efficiency.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing quality is inconsistent, with formatting issues in definitions and some repetitive content.
2. Certain definitions, such as in Definition 3.3, lack clarity and precision.
3. The method does not address finite-sample uncertainty, limiting its applicability compared to methods like BIC.
4. The evaluation of the proposed solution is limited to two search-based procedures, which may not fully represent its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and consistency of the writing, particularly in the formatting of definitions and avoiding repetition. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly state the assumptions required for their method, as well as clarify the significance of the orthogonal transformation used in their approach. Addressing finite-sample uncertainty in the context of their method would also enhance its robustness. Finally, a broader evaluation of the proposed solution against more search-based procedures would provide a more comprehensive assessment of its performance.
