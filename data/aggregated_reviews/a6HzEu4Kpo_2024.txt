Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization in time series data using pre-trained large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a tri-level learning framework that integrates sample-level and group-level uncertainties, supported by a theoretical analysis that guarantees convergence. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated through extensive experiments on six real-world time series datasets, showing significant performance improvements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The tri-level learning framework uniquely combines sample-level and group-level uncertainties, providing a comprehensive approach to OOD generalization.
2. The paper includes a solid theoretical foundation, justifying the proposed method and its iteration complexity.
3. The stratified localization algorithm offers a novel solution to the tri-level optimization problem, enhancing scalability and computational efficiency.
4. Extensive experiments validate the method's effectiveness, demonstrating significant performance gains.
5. The study leverages the advanced capabilities of LLMs in time series analysis, contributing to the emerging field of applying foundational models to non-linguistic data.

Weaknesses:
1. The tri-level learning framework may be overly complex for practical applications, potentially limiting its adoption.
2. The proposed method, particularly the stratified localization algorithm, may incur high computational costs, posing a barrier for large-scale applications.
3. The paper could benefit from a more comprehensive comparison with other state-of-the-art methods in time series OOD generalization.
4. There is a need for more discussion on the real-world applicability and potential limitations of the proposed method across various domains.
5. Some sections of the paper are dense and challenging to follow, particularly the theoretical analyses, which may be difficult for a broader audience to understand.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for studying OOD generalization specifically in time series, clarifying why this method is particularly suitable for such data. Additionally, the authors should articulate the necessity of using LLMs more clearly, as the empirical performance gains appear marginal. It would be beneficial to include examples illustrating sample-level and group-level uncertainties in time series data to enhance clarity. Furthermore, we suggest expanding the experimental analysis to include more comparisons with existing methods and discussing the real-world applicability and limitations of the TTSO framework in greater detail. Finally, simplifying the theoretical sections could make the paper more accessible to a broader audience.
