Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for distributed optimization of nonconvex smooth functions in federated learning (FL) with partial participation, proposing A-FedPD to address dual drift issues. The authors claim to achieve a convergence rate of O(1/T) and provide theoretical analysis alongside extensive empirical validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study of convergence in federated learning is significant, and the proposed method addresses an important issue of dual drift.
2. The experiments demonstrate strong performance in communication efficiency and robustness against various stresses.
3. The theoretical analysis provides a clear convergence result, and the numerical results indicate that A-FedPD outperforms existing algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. There is insufficient discussion of the O(1/T) rate in relation to existing methods, particularly Scaffold, and a lack of comparison to other algorithms like 5GCS and TAMUNA.
2. The writing lacks clarity, with vague statements and unusual expressions that obscure the problem definition.
3. The algorithm's memory inefficiency due to storing local dual variables for all clients may limit its practical application.
4. The experimental section does not adequately demonstrate the superiority of A-FedPD over comparison methods, raising concerns about its empirical validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the O(1/T) rate by comparing it with existing results, particularly those related to Scaffold. Additionally, the authors should enhance the clarity of the writing, particularly in the first three pages, to better define the problem and avoid vague expressions. To address memory inefficiency, consider optimizing the storage of dual variables. Furthermore, we suggest including a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods in the experimental section to substantiate claims of superiority. Lastly, clarify the concept of "dual drift" and ensure that the title accurately reflects the paper's focus.
