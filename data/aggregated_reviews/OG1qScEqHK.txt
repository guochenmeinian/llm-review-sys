### Key Points
This paper presents a novel training-free approach for graph anomaly detection called TFGAD, which utilizes singular value decomposition (SVD) to compute transformation matrices for node attributes and local structures separately. The authors propose that TFGAD effectively addresses issues associated with existing reconstruction-based methods, achieving significant improvements in performance, efficiency, and scalability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TFGAD outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning baselines across various benchmark datasets, with AUC-ROC improvements ranging from 4.5% to 35.1%. The method is characterized by its simplicity, requiring no training, and is suitable for large-scale graph data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Originality and significance in addressing key issues in existing methods.
2. Demonstrated superior performance with extensive experiments across multiple datasets.
3. High efficiency and scalability, with significant reductions in runtime and memory overhead.
4. A minimalistic approach that enhances practicality and ease of implementation.
5. Comprehensive evaluation, including a detailed ablation study.

Weaknesses:
1. Lack of in-depth theoretical analysis regarding the mathematical properties and guarantees of TFGAD.
2. Absence of discussion on potential limitations or failure cases, such as sensitivity to graph structures or noise in input data.
3. Limited exploration of real-world applications, with no case studies presented to demonstrate practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by providing insights into the theoretical properties of the SVD-based transformations used in TFGAD and discussing the mathematical guarantees or bounds on its performance. Additionally, addressing potential limitations and failure cases of TFGAD would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the method. We suggest including case studies or real-world applications to demonstrate the method's applicability in practical scenarios. Furthermore, clarifying the relationship between the choice of rank k in truncated SVD and its impact on anomaly detection capabilities would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the comparison with contrastive-based methods and the trade-offs involved.
