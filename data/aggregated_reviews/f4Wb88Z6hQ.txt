### Key Points
This paper presents the Query Instruction Parsing Plugin (QIPP) aimed at addressing the query pattern learning problem in complex logical query answering tasks. The authors identify the pattern-entity alignment bias issue in existing methods, which negatively impacts knowledge graph query embedding (KGQE) performance. QIPP utilizes pre-trained language models to convert input queries into code-like instructions, enhancing the representation of First-Order Logic (FOL) queries. The approach includes a query-guided decoder and a query pattern injection mechanism, purportedly improving the performance of various KGQE models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and facilitates understanding of the presented concepts.
- The identification of the pattern-entity alignment bias problem is noteworthy.
- QIPP shows improvements over existing baseline methods in experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The code-like instructions closely resemble existing query structure representations, with minimal differentiation.
- The rationale for using code-like instructions to reduce noise and redundancy is inadequately explained, and reliance on a pre-trained language model may introduce unexplainable noise.
- The motivation for addressing the pattern-entity alignment bias is insufficiently substantiated, with marginal performance gains over TEMP and CaQR, as shown in Figure 4.
- The case study in Section 4.5 indicates that TEMP and CaQR can accurately identify query patterns, contradicting the authors' conclusions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the advantages of employing code-like instructions and pre-trained language models in reducing noise and facilitating effective pattern learning. Additionally, we suggest including a model variant in the ablation study where parentheses are removed from the code-like instructions to assess their impact. To strengthen the evidence for QIPP's advantages, more comprehensive comparisons with TEMP and CaQR should be presented, clarifying the selection of base models. Lastly, we encourage the authors to enhance the clarity of complex theoretical explanations and ensure that all terminology is well-defined and consistently used throughout the paper.
