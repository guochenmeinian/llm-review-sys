Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the adversarial robustness of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) against adaptive attacks, revealing that while $\ell_1$-based models show robustness against moderate attacks, their performance declines under stronger adaptive attacks due to estimation bias. The authors propose a robust and unbiased graph signal estimator (RUGE) to address this issue and develop a Quasi-Newton Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) algorithm to optimize the non-smooth estimation problem. The empirical evaluation demonstrates that their method significantly enhances GNN robustness without sacrificing clean accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a compelling analysis of the root causes of performance degradation in GNNs under attacks, supported by rigorous experiments and observations.
2. The proposed method is theoretically sound and empirically validated, showing significant improvements over existing baselines.
3. The extensive empirical evaluation across various GNNs and defenses enhances the credibility of the findings.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript suffers from poor writing, making it difficult to follow. Specific phrases and figures lack clarity, such as the unclear meaning of “without the false sense of security” and insufficient details in figures.
2. The contribution of the paper is not clearly articulated, particularly regarding the unified perspective and the relationship between QN-IRLS and standard QN methods.
3. The experiments are limited to only a few datasets, and the inclusion of additional datasets would enhance the applicability of the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing throughout the manuscript, ensuring that all key concepts are well-defined and self-contained. Specifically, clarify the significance of phrases like “without the false sense of security” and provide more detailed captions for figures to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly articulate the contribution of their work, particularly in relation to the experimental results and the connection between QN-IRLS and other QN methods. Expanding the experimental evaluation to include more diverse datasets would also strengthen the paper's applicability.
