Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the problem of answering approximate range queries privately and presents a data structure that mitigates dimension dependence in additive error for utility while incurring a multiplicative factor. The authors propose a method to efficiently implement this data structure. Additionally, the paper explores a variant of Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) for approximately counting neighbors within a fixed radius, providing a differentially private LSH sketch and analyzing the algorithm's theoretical properties. The authors also introduce a new polynomial-time algorithm for differentially private approximate near neighbor counting, achieving improved additive accuracy without dependence on dimension.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with adequate discussion and comparison to prior work.  
- The approach offers a novel trade-off between additive error and approximation factor.  
- The technical contributions are solid, and the analyses appear correct.  
- The solution is simple and elegant, circumventing drawbacks of previous works.  
- The presentation is clear and concise, making the paper enjoyable to read.  

Weaknesses:  
- The privacy guarantee is limited to $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP rather than pure differential privacy, and a discussion on extending to pure differential privacy would be beneficial.  
- The necessity of the multiplicative factor in utility remains unclear.  
- The presentation lacks clarity after the introduction, with detailed analyses overshadowing high-level insights.  
- There is no empirical validation, and the claims regarding space efficiency in approximate nearest neighbor search lack supporting exposition.  
- The improved results are only applicable for small, fixed values of radius \( r \), which is not part of the input.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of the privacy guarantee and explore potential extensions to pure differential privacy. Additionally, clarifying whether the multiplicative factor is necessary for achieving good additive dependence would enhance the paper. We suggest restructuring the presentation to provide a clearer overview of the algorithm and proof strategy, possibly by outlining proofs rather than including them in detail. Including empirical validation and supporting exposition for claims regarding space efficiency in approximate nearest neighbor search would strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the fixed nature of \( r \) and its implications on the results would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the contributions.
