Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the overestimation of decoding accuracy in brain-computer interface (BCI) tasks utilizing EEG signals, attributing high reported accuracies to inherent temporal autocorrelations rather than genuine neural responses. The authors propose a unified framework that highlights the significant impact of temporal artifacts (TA) on various BCI tasks, even in the absence of neural activity. They argue that not all TA can be attributed to noise, as evidenced by the SK dataset, which shows TA across broader frequencies. The findings underscore the need for improved experimental designs and data splitting strategies to enhance the reliability of BCI research and alert BCI researchers to the implications of TA on their experimental designs and model constructions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper introduces a novel problem formulation regarding the overestimation of decoding performance in EEG-based BCIs due to temporal autocorrelations, an innovative perspective not extensively explored in prior research.
2. The use of the watermelon model to eliminate stimulus-driven neural responses is original, allowing for a unique investigation of temporal autocorrelation effects in EEG signals.
3. The framework serves as a valuable reminder for BCI researchers regarding the influence of TA on their tasks, addressing a critical issue in the field that could guide better experimental design and model construction.
4. The findings have significant implications for BCI research, highlighting critical issues that could affect the validity of existing studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The rationale for using a "watermelon EEG dataset" is unclear; the choice of model over potentially more appropriate alternatives needs justification.
2. The authors do not provide a detailed explanation of how temporal autocorrelations specifically affect different tasks or quantifiable metrics to assess this impact.
3. Some reviewers question the novelty of the contribution, suggesting that the issue of TA is already well-known in EEG research.
4. There is a lack of clarity on how the proposed framework distinctly advances the current understanding of TA in BCI tasks.
5. The reproducibility of the experimental design and data splitting strategies across different datasets and conditions is questioned, particularly regarding the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for selecting the watermelon model over other potential models and clarify its scientific rationale. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of the mechanisms by which temporal autocorrelations impact various tasks, including quantifiable metrics for assessment. To enhance reproducibility, the authors should demonstrate the effectiveness of their experimental design across different EEG datasets. Furthermore, we advise the authors to improve the clarity of the novel contributions of their work by explicitly detailing how their framework differs from existing knowledge on TA. Providing more concrete examples of how the framework can be applied in specific BCI tasks would strengthen the paper's impact and relevance. Lastly, proofreading for typos and improving the clarity of figures and technical terms would enhance the overall presentation of the paper.
