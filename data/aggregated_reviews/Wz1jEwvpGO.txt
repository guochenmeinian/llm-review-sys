### Key Points
This paper investigates the false negative issues in dialogue response retrieval, proposing a sequential variational ladder auto-encoder to enhance negative sampling by identifying false negatives. The authors introduce a TRIGGER framework that updates negative samples based on the model's capacity. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods across multiple datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the Ubuntu and Douban benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem of false negatives in dialogue retrieval is well-articulated and supported by thorough experiments.  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and includes a meaningful pilot study in Section 2 that utilizes human evaluation to analyze false negatives.  
- The proposed method shows improved performance over baseline models.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the proposed method is questionable, as the false negative problem has been extensively studied, and the transition logic modeling is not new.  
- The proposed method is complex, with marginal improvements over baselines, and lacks consideration of recent knowledge distillation approaches.  
- The transition from problem identification to proposed methods in the introduction is not smooth, leading to potential confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transition in the introduction to clarify the rationale behind the proposed encoder and framework. Additionally, addressing the novelty of the method in relation to CVAE architecture would strengthen the paper. We suggest including comparisons with recent knowledge distillation-based methods to clarify the contributions. Furthermore, discussing the implications of the proposed method in the context of large language models, such as computational costs and real-world applications, would enhance its relevance. Lastly, increasing the sampling size in the human evaluation and refining the clarity of certain definitions and figures would improve the overall presentation.
