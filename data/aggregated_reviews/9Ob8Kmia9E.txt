Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on auction mechanisms for online advertising involving large language models (LLMs). The authors propose a "token auction" model where bidders influence the generated content by specifying preferred distributions over tokens. They define two incentive properties that align with monotonicity conditions for truthful implementation and explore aggregation functions inspired by LLM training. The paper demonstrates that second-price auctions can be designed without traditional bidder valuation functions, using specific aggregation functions based on KL divergence. The authors argue that their approach is timely and relevant to the evolving ad auction ecosystem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and relevant topic, connecting mechanism design with LLMs in advertising.
- It presents a novel auction model and successfully models preferences for LLM agents.
- The theoretical analysis is well-executed, and the paper is clearly written.

Weaknesses:
- The model may not adequately capture fundamental trade-offs, particularly regarding competing firms and the potential negative value of combined ads.
- Some assumptions and economic modeling aspects require further clarification, particularly concerning bidder preferences and payment calibration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their auction design, particularly regarding welfare enhancement. It would be beneficial to clarify the implications of merging content from competing advertisers and how the proposed mechanism ensures economically sensible outputs. Additionally, we suggest discussing how payments relate to actual monetary values, given the lack of explicit budgets or valuations from bidders. The authors should also consider expanding the related work section to include discussions on incentive generation for learning algorithms in auction contexts. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the statement regarding LLMs being stateless and discuss any implications of session memory on their framework.
