Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Single Image Unlearning (SIU) aimed at unlearning visual recognition of concepts in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). The authors introduce a Dual Masked KL-Divergence (DMK) loss to be jointly trained with cross-entropy loss, and propose MMUBench, a benchmark for evaluating machine unlearning performance. The methodology includes generating Multifaceted Fine-tuning data for various purposes and evaluating unlearning success through metrics like Efficacy and Generality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a novel approach to machine unlearning in MLLMs, defining the problem and proposing an algorithm and benchmark dataset for evaluation.  
- The proposed SIU method is well-structured and demonstrates effective performance in unlearning multiple concepts simultaneously.  
- MMUBench is a valuable resource for future research, offering various evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses:  
- The study is limited by using only a single LLM type (LLAVA), raising questions about the generalizability of results.  
- The paper's structure hampers readability, with crucial details located in the Appendix.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the societal impact of the proposed methods and the necessity of targeting unlearning of visual recognition over factual knowledge.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by integrating crucial details from the Appendix into the main text to enhance readability. Additionally, the authors should clarify whether experimental results are based on multiple random seeds and report standard deviations. It would also be beneficial to discuss the motivation for focusing on unlearning visual recognition rather than factual knowledge, including real-world examples where this unlearning is necessary. Finally, addressing the societal impact of the proposed methods would strengthen the paper's contribution.
