### Key Points
This paper presents ToxiGen-ConPrompt, a pre-trained BERT model designed for implicit hate speech detection, leveraging the ToxiGen dataset generated through ChatGPT. The authors propose a pre-training strategy called ConPrompt, which utilizes positive samples from prompts for contrastive learning. The model demonstrates superior performance in cross-dataset evaluations compared to existing models like HateBERT and fBERT, indicating its generalization ability and effectiveness in reducing identity term bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and organized, showcasing a variety of experiments that validate the proposed method's effectiveness.  
- ToxiGen-ConPrompt exhibits strong cross-dataset performance and addresses identity term bias, enhancing model generalizability.  
- The innovative approach to generating positive samples for contrastive learning is commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- Performance differences in in-dataset evaluations are not significantly pronounced, raising questions about the model's robustness.  
- The reliance on machine-generated data for training may raise concerns regarding data quality and ethical implications, necessitating further discussion.  
- Comparisons with models specifically designed to tackle cross-dataset evaluation degradation are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the characteristics of the ToxiGen corpus compared to the machine-generated data used in related works. Additionally, we suggest conducting comparisons with state-of-the-art models like XLM-R to further validate the proposed approach. A thorough discussion on the implications of using machine-generated data in sensitive domains such as hate speech detection should also be included.
