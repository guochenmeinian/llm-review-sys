Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dataset condensation technique specifically for object detection, introducing a two-stage method termed Fetch and Forge. The Fetch stage involves training a standard object detector on the original dataset, while the Forge stage synthesizes a condensed dataset through model inversion and regularization. The proposed method effectively addresses the challenges of dataset condensation in object detection, which is inherently more complex due to the presence of multiple objects in images. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through experiments on standard datasets like VOC and COCO.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a significant and challenging problem in dataset condensation for object detection, marking a novel contribution to the field.
- The proposed Fetch and Forge method simplifies the process by eliminating the need for complex two-step approaches, making it more accessible.
- Results on common datasets indicate promising performance, suggesting potential for further development.

Weaknesses:
- The algorithm requires optimization, and the description of the second stage (Forge) lacks clarity.
- There are issues with notation, missing definitions, and insufficient implementation details, which hinder reproducibility.
- The paper does not adequately address the role of background context in object detection, nor does it discuss the impact of different input initializations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the second stage of the DCOC, particularly regarding the optimization of each patch in the IPE module. Additionally, please provide a more detailed discussion on the impact of different input initializations and the importance of background context in object detection. We suggest including more datasets for comparison in the experimental section to enhance the persuasiveness of the results. Furthermore, please clarify the notation issues and ensure comprehensive implementation details are provided, including the training epoch for IPE and the specifics of the condensation ratio. Lastly, consider adding a plot that depicts mAP growth relative to the condensation ratio to illustrate performance trends.
