### Key Points
This paper presents a toolkit that addresses the limitations of existing frameworks by improving training speed (up to 3.7x faster), reducing memory consumption, and achieving near-iso-accuracy on benchmarks. The authors highlight the reduction of memory fragmentation and overall memory consumption, enabling the training of larger models with billions of parameters more efficiently. Additionally, the framework is designed as an easy-to-integrate solution for existing AIHWKIT users.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Significant improvements in training speed and memory efficiency.  
- Near-iso-accuracy achieved on benchmarks.  
- Easy integration for existing users of AIHWKIT.  

Weaknesses:  
- Limited discussion on methods to mitigate the 2.71% accuracy drop during fine-tuning with HWA training.  
- Lack of performance demonstration on physical AIMC hardware, which is necessary for further validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the methods used to mitigate the accuracy drop when HWA training is introduced during fine-tuning. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct and present performance tests on physical AIMC hardware to validate the toolkit's effectiveness further.
