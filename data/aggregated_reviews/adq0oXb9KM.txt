Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel class of variational autoencoders, termed Tree Variational Autoencoders (TreeVAE), which utilize a binary tree structure for generative modeling. The authors propose a top-down hierarchical model with binary routing components, iteratively growing the tree every N training steps and employing `NT-Xent` to align learned representations with human perception. The effectiveness of TreeVAE is demonstrated through extensive experiments on binary images, natural images, and text datasets, showcasing its modeling and clustering performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper makes a significant contribution to learning meaningful hierarchical models, addressing an important problem in the field.
2. The solution is creatively presented with a structured approach, including detailed derivations and intuitive notation.
3. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets and baselines validate the method's effectiveness.
4. Convincing visual results and an in-depth appendix enhance the paper's quality.

Weaknesses:
1. Section 2.6 lacks clarity; adding the equation for the auxiliary loss term associated with `NT-Xent` is recommended.
2. The high quality of results may be closely tied to `NT-Xent`, necessitating an ablation study to explore the impact of different methods for integrating prior knowledge.
3. The qualitative results are not clearly explained, raising doubts about the method's ability to generate hierarchies consistent with dataset structures.
4. Missing ablation studies on data augmentation and the maximum depth of the binary tree limit the analysis.
5. The computational complexity of training and the choice of tree-building heuristic require further discussion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve Section 2.6 by including the equation for the auxiliary loss term related to `NT-Xent`. Additionally, conducting an ablation study to assess the impact of various methods for integrating prior knowledge would strengthen the paper. Clarifying the qualitative results and their alignment with intrinsic dataset structures is essential. We also suggest including ablation studies on data augmentation and the maximum depth of the binary tree to provide a more comprehensive analysis. Lastly, a deeper discussion on the computational complexity and the tree-building heuristic's justification would enhance the paper's rigor.
