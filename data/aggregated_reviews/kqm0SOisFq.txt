### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for legal NLP focused on information extraction from legal wills, derived from public domain court documents from two US states. The authors provide approximately 16,000 gold standard annotations and conduct preliminary experiments using GPT-4 for entity and relation extraction. The study highlights the dataset's potential for enhancing legal workflows through AI and discusses the challenges of legal information extraction compared to other domains, such as healthcare. The authors also analyze model errors, revealing issues of overgeneralization and inconsistencies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new corpus for information extraction from legal wills.
- Demonstration of GPT-4's adequacy for legal information extraction tasks.
- Focus on information extraction and linking, which is particularly relevant for legal professionals.
- Interesting comparison with other domains, emphasizing shared challenges.
- Evidence of portability to other US states' legal wills.
- Inclusion of error analysis, providing valuable insights for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's limited scope, covering only a few states and cases, undermines the strength of the claims.
- The importance and novelty of the work, as well as its distinction from other legal information extraction tasks, are not clearly articulated.
- Lack of detail regarding the specific information categories extracted and evaluated, leaving some design choices unexplained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the differences between wills from the two states to provide valuable insights for researchers. Additionally, the authors should clarify the importance and novelty of information extraction on legal wills, justifying their design choices with more details. Expanding the dataset's coverage would strengthen the claims made in the paper. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on the data engineering step involving OCR, as it is a common challenge in legal data collection. Lastly, addressing the evaluation of only the four most common entities and relations would enhance the paper's clarity and relevance.
