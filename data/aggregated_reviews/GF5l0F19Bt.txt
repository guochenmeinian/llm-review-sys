Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset constructed from 10,000 PDF documents related to corporate climate policy engagement, sourced from LobbyMap. The authors propose a pipeline for converting these documents into structured data and benchmark various pre-trained language models (PLMs) on tasks such as detecting page indices, identifying topics, and estimating company stances. The results indicate that Longformer outperforms BERT-based models in handling longer texts. Additionally, the paper analyzes corporate documents to assess environmental policies and the potential for greenwashing, proposing a model to evaluate firms' stances on environmental issues while acknowledging the evolving nature of climate science and inherent biases in their data and model. The revised version includes a related work section and addresses concerns about dataset quality and the implications of their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses a significant gap in utilizing NLP for climate change issues, potentially stimulating further research.
- The construction pipeline is clear and straightforward, with detailed statistics provided for the dataset.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written.
- The inclusion of a related work section enhances the paper's context and relevance.
- The authors have addressed several reviewer concerns, improving the overall quality of the paper.
- The acknowledgment of biases in data and models demonstrates a critical understanding of the limitations of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's quality is questionable due to the reliance on automatic extraction methods without human annotation, raising concerns about noise and accuracy.
- There is insufficient discussion on how this work differentiates from previous efforts in the climate policy domain.
- The evaluation metrics used may not adequately reflect the ordered nature of the tasks, and the choice of baselines could be expanded.
- The F1 score for stances remains weak, indicating potential issues with model performance.
- The paper does not fully explore the risks associated with companies gaming the detection algorithms.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the history of misrepresentation in corporate documents.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset quality by providing statistics or human analysis on the accuracy of text extraction and alignment between evidence snippets and PDFs. Additionally, including a section that discusses how this work differs from prior research would enhance contextual understanding. We suggest incorporating more diverse baselines, such as methods that do not rely on pre-trained language models. Furthermore, consider adding error-based metrics for evaluation to better account for the ordered nature of the tasks. To improve the F1 score for stances, we recommend refining their model and data processing techniques. We also suggest that the authors further explore the implications of companies potentially gaming the detection algorithms to provide a more comprehensive analysis of the risks involved. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand on the historical context of misrepresentation in corporate documents to strengthen their argument.
