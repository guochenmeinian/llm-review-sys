Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PromptCoT, an enhancer that refines text prompts for diffusion-based generative models to improve visual content generation. The system leverages pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned on high-quality image descriptions, aiming to align prompts with the training data. It employs techniques such as contamination, transfer, and a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) mechanism to enhance prompt relevance and coherence. The use of adapters for dataset-specific adaptations ensures computational efficiency. Experimental results indicate significant performance improvements in popular latent diffusion models for image and video generation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The insight that prompts resembling high-quality image descriptions lead to better generation performance is well-founded.
2. Utilizing LLMs to adapt original prompts aligns with the distribution of training samples effectively.
3. The proposed training methods, including continuation, revision, and CoT, are innovative.
4. The creation of corresponding datasets for fine-tuning is beneficial for future research.
5. The approach of using GPT-3 for dataset construction is clever.

Weaknesses:
1. The finetuning of LLaMa is time-consuming; alternatives like prompt learning or LoRA could be considered.
2. A discussion on "Visual Chain-of-Thought Diffusion Models" should be included in the related work section.
3. The potential for building datasets with neural captions should be explored to enhance the training set.
4. The novelty of the prompting technique is questioned, as it lacks differentiation from existing methods.
5. The text revision technique may introduce uncontrollable information, necessitating an analysis of bias and controllability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the novelty of their approach, clarifying how their prompting and CoT techniques differ from existing works. Additionally, please provide an analysis to demonstrate that the enhanced textual inputs are unbiased and controllable. We suggest exploring the feasibility of using prompt learning or LoRA as alternatives to finetuning LLaMa. Finally, consider adding a discussion on the applicability of the proposed methods across various datasets beyond LAION to strengthen the claims made in the paper.
