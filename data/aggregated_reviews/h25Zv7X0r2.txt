### Key Points
This paper presents the "team formation amidst conflicts" problem, a generalization of max-cut, and proposes two approximation algorithms alongside heuristic methods to enhance running time. The authors conduct experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets, demonstrating the algorithms' effectiveness, particularly in educational contexts where they outperform manual assignments by experts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of dependent-rounding techniques on real-world datasets is a notable contribution, as it has not been previously evaluated experimentally.
- The authors provide an equivalent linear formulation that is more efficient than the concave formulation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the algorithms is limited; the deterministic 1/2-approximation and the rounding scheme for the 3/4-approximation were previously known.
- The 3/4-approximation is only applicable for sufficiently large $\lambda$, which is not a requirement for the 1/2-approximation.
- The motivation and contribution of the paper are unclear, and the presentation lacks clarity regarding the differences between computational speedups.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation by including a motivating example and illustrating the limitations of existing works. Additionally, the authors should enhance the presentation of the framework to facilitate understanding of the computational speedups and their effectiveness. Furthermore, we suggest conducting a hyperparameter study on $\alpha$ and providing more illustrations for the proposed variants, particularly for sparse and compact data. Lastly, it would be beneficial to explore larger synthetic instances to assess the scalability of the algorithms.
