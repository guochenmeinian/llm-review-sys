### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for Legal Judgment Prediction (LJP) utilizing MoCo-based Supervised Contrastive Learning, aimed at improving the prediction of relevant criminal charges, law articles, and penalty terms based on case facts. The authors incorporate numerical evidence extraction to enhance the accuracy of penalty term predictions. Empirical results indicate a performance improvement of approximately 1-1.5% over existing methodologies across two datasets (CAIL-Small and CAIL-Big).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The framework effectively leverages numerical data within LJP texts, showcasing notable performance enhancements.  
- The innovative application of momentum contrast-based supervised contrastive learning addresses challenges related to large class numbers and negative example identification.  
- The framework demonstrates versatility, being adaptable to current encoder-based methodologies.  

Weaknesses:  
- The methodology is tailored to a specific setting (3-task Chinese LJP), lacking evidence of applicability to other jurisdictions.  
- The paper does not provide confidence intervals for results, and the reported performance improvements are marginal and may not be statistically significant.  
- The explanation of momentum contrast (MoCo) is insufficiently detailed, making it difficult to grasp its concrete definition.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the specific context of their datasets, explicitly stating that they pertain to LJP in the People's Republic of China. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include confidence intervals for their results and conduct experiments with different random seeds to validate the statistical significance of their findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide a more comprehensive explanation of the momentum contrast (MoCo) methodology to enhance reader understanding.
