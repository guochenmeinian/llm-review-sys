### Key Points
This paper presents a study on translating Swiss German dialects into Standard German, utilizing the STT4SG-350 corpus and exploring the impact of dialect diversity on translation performance. The authors evaluate three model architectures—XLS-R, Whisper, and a transformer model (Trafo)—across various finetuning strategies. The results indicate that transferability between dialects correlates with linguistic distances, and the analysis includes specific linguistic features such as the preterite and vocabulary unique to Swiss German.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The experiments are thorough, well-described, and justified, providing valuable insights for researchers in both Swiss German and other dialects.
- The paper offers a compelling analysis of dialectal differences and their impact on translation, contributing significantly to the understanding of low-resource language translation.

Weaknesses:
- The scope is narrow, focusing primarily on Swiss German, which may limit generalizability to other languages or dialects.
- Some experimental details are unclear or missing, necessitating references to other works for critical information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by including essential model and data details directly in the paper or appendix, rather than requiring external lookups. Additionally, we suggest that the authors compute and report WER (word error rate) and TER (translation edit rate) scores to contextualize their findings within speech recognition and translation frameworks. Addressing the questions regarding the Trafo model's training data and the potential use of CTC for comparison would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, consider reporting additional metrics like chrF alongside BLEU to better capture dialectal differences.
