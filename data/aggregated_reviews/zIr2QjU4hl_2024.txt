Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a conservative fine-tuning method called BRAID, which integrates diffusion models and model-based optimization (MBO) to enhance the performance of pre-trained diffusion models on offline datasets. BRAID optimizes a conservative reward model that includes penalties for deviations outside the offline data distribution, effectively preventing overoptimization and ensuring valid designs. The method is validated through empirical and theoretical analyses, demonstrating its superiority in generating biological sequences and images compared to existing conditional diffusion models and traditional MBO techniques. The authors acknowledge limitations in model selection and hyperparameter tuning, suggesting future research directions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* BRAID employs a conservative fine-tuning approach that includes penalization terms to discourage generating designs outside the offline data distribution, effectively preventing overoptimization.
* The method is supported by both theoretical analysis and empirical results, providing a regret guarantee and demonstrating high-quality design generation across various domains.

Weaknesses:
* Tuning hyperparameters is challenging without online data interaction.
* The method relies on accurate reward and diffusion models for effective performance.
* Theoretical results depend on idealized assumptions that may not hold universally.
* The paper lacks strong comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) offline reinforcement learning methods, such as ReDS, A2PR, CPED, and SCQ.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of their method's relationship with SOTA offline RL methods by including comparative analyses, even if experimental comparisons are not feasible. Additionally, we suggest providing experiments to illustrate the computational burden associated with the proposed methods, particularly regarding the use of two diffusion models. Consideration of alternative generative models, such as GANs or VAEs, along with a comparative analysis of performance and resource usage, would also enhance the paper. Furthermore, clarifying how to obtain the $\hat{g}$ in the pseudo-code of Algorithm 1 BRAID and improving the explicitness of the algorithm in the pseudo-code would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include more multi-metric quantitative results analysis in the image generation task to strengthen their evaluation.
