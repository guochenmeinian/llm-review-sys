Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a part-based learning algorithm for few-shot classification that mitigates incidental correlations during training. The authors propose the DP-ViT framework, which employs a mixture-of-experts formulation to disentangle foreground and background parts, alongside regularization for orthogonality and sparsity. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through experiments on several few-shot learning benchmarks, achieving state-of-the-art performance and confirming the reduction of incidental correlations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm achieves interpretable representations, crucial for few-shot learning.
- The method effectively addresses the harmful impact of image backgrounds during training, as verified by experiments on ImageNet-9.
- The paper demonstrates sound improvements to regularizations in part-based models, enhancing performance on multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The absence of critical ablation studies limits the verification of part-based learning effectiveness, particularly lacking comparisons with a vanilla ViT using the loss $L_{cls}$ and the impacts of $L_{mix}$ and $L_{Q}$.
- Method descriptions contain ambiguities, such as the iterative computation of $z_p$ and $z_d$, and the architecture plot does not clarify input to subsequent blocks.
- The choice of regularization methods lacks sufficient explanation, particularly regarding the use of spectral norms and the necessity of separate background modeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the method description, particularly regarding the computation of $z_p$ and $z_d$, and provide clearer visualizations in the architecture plot. Additionally, we suggest conducting comprehensive ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of part-based learning and the proposed regularizations. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on the rationale behind the choice of regularization techniques and to investigate the effects of varying the number of parts, K, on performance. Lastly, including experiments on cross-domain datasets could further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method.
