Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for nonlinear manifold clustering, supported by a solid theoretical foundation and empirical evaluations on synthetic data and CIFAR datasets. The authors derive geometric conditions that ensure a manifold-preserving representation and demonstrate competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, albeit with some limitations in empirical validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and fits well within the NeurIPS context, addressing a relevant problem with clear geometric interpretations and correct proofs.  
- The theoretical analysis provides insights into the conditions necessary for effective clustering on nonlinear manifolds.  
- The method shows competitive performance on CIFAR datasets, indicating practical applicability.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed method relies heavily on hyperparameters, particularly $\lambda$ and $\eta$, with insufficient guidance on their selection.  
- The empirical evaluation lacks completeness, notably omitting comparisons with the SMCE baseline, which undermines the robustness of the results.  
- The formulation in Eq.(1.1) is viewed as a trivial modification of existing methods, raising questions about its novelty and contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on hyperparameter selection, particularly for $\lambda$ and $\eta$, providing clearer guidelines for practical implementation. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with SMCE in the empirical evaluations to strengthen the credibility of the results. The authors should also clarify the geometric interpretation of the penalty term $1^\top c = 1$ and consider whether the relaxed affine constraint is necessary. Finally, addressing the normalization of input data and exploring connections between linear and affine subspaces would enhance the theoretical depth of the paper.
