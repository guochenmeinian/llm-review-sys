Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the algorithmic complexity of history enumeration and generation in imperfect information games, specifically through the lens of factored observation stochastic games (FOSGs). The authors demonstrate that certain computational problems related to public belief states (PBSs) are generally FNP-complete while also defining a subclass of games where enumeration can be performed in polynomial time. They introduce an MCMC algorithm for generating histories in trick-taking card games, particularly Oh Hell, and empirically validate its effectiveness. Additionally, the paper introduces a history-filtering framework that presents the concept of sparse public states, allowing for polynomial-time enumeration of the FILTER problem. However, the contributions appear disjointed, as the authors do not effectively leverage the separation of "easy" and "hard" problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses an important and original problem, providing rigorous definitions and complexity results.
- The paper is technically sound, with clear presentation in both prose and mathematical descriptions.
- The introduction of a practical generative algorithm for estimating public belief states is a notable contribution.
- The paper provides fundamental complexity results for PBSs and proposes a novel algorithm for approximating PBSs in a specific class of games, which is beneficial for the community.
- The authors acknowledge the importance of their complexity analysis in identifying domains with dense public belief states and developing scalable algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical conclusions regarding the hardness of history enumeration lack deeper insights and appear somewhat expected.
- The paper's structure is disjointed, with a lack of integration between the theoretical analysis and the application to card games.
- There are misrepresentations of prior work, particularly regarding the awareness of tractability issues in games beyond poker.
- The experimental evaluation lacks clarity on the performance implications of using Gibbs sampling in trick-taking games, particularly regarding the impact of value errors on subgame solving techniques.
- The experimental evaluation does not utilize reasonable policies, which undermines the validity of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for the importance of public belief states by incorporating a broader range of relevant literature, including works from decentralized stochastic control and Dec-POMDPs. This will enhance the perceived significance of their contributions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the relationship between their theoretical results and the specific algorithm developed for trick-taking games, potentially by integrating insights from the theoretical section into the practical application. Furthermore, addressing the misrepresentation of prior work is crucial; a comparison with related techniques, such as belief fine-tuning, should be included. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity and flow of the paper by providing more direct commentary in Section 5 on how their complexity results from Section 4 relate to their contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to use more reasonable policies, such as training agents via independent Q-learning in Oh Hell, to evaluate their method more effectively and provide a clearer justification for the relevance of the PBS value error metric in their experiments.
