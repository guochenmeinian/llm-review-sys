Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a distribution-free method for uncertainty quantification in matrix completion, utilizing a conformal prediction framework to construct confidence intervals for imputed matrix entries. The authors propose Conformalized Matrix Completion (CMC; Algorithm 1), which can be integrated with any matrix completion algorithm, assuming a randomized probabilistic measurement model. The method is supported by an intuitive explanation of exchangeability and a theoretical guarantee on average coverage. Numerical simulations are conducted to compare the proposed method against model-based baselines and to assess its stability under varying conditions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The adaptation of the conformal prediction framework to matrix completion is a significant and original contribution, reducing reliance on stringent model assumptions.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly presenting the problem setup, method, theoretical results, and numerical studies, making it accessible to readers.
- The practical implications of the method are noteworthy, addressing a previously underexplored area of uncertainty estimation in matrix completion.

Weaknesses:
- The authors assert that their method is "distribution-free," yet it relies on a probabilistic random observation model, which should be clarified to avoid confusion.
- There is a lack of comparative analysis with existing uncertainty quantification methods, leaving the advantages of the proposed approach unclear.
- The discussion on heavy-tailed noise is insufficiently developed, and the performance differences between the CMC and ALS methods are not substantial enough to warrant the claims made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the assumptions and limitations of their method, particularly the reliance on the probabilistic random observation model. Additionally, including comparative analyses with existing methods would strengthen the argument for the proposed approach's superiority. We suggest elaborating on the performance in the presence of heavy-tailed noise or considering its removal if it does not significantly contribute to the findings. Furthermore, addressing the potential issues with the default uncertainty estimate in Algorithm 1 and discussing alternatives would enhance the robustness of the method. Lastly, revising the caption of Figure 2 for clarity and providing explicit corollaries for the expected weight gap in Section 3.3 would improve the paper's comprehensibility.
