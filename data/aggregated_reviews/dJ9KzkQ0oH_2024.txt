Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to hardware model checking by utilizing neural networks as proof certificates for linear temporal logic (LTL) specifications. The authors propose generating neural certificates from random system executions, which are then verified symbolically. The method demonstrates scalability and efficiency, outperforming academic tools in completion time across various hardware designs in SystemVerilog and competing with leading commercial tools.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach enhances verification in complex hardware designs efficiently through unsupervised machine learning techniques integrated with symbolic reasoning.
- The paper is well organized and well written, with impressive empirical results on the chosen benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The classic algorithm guarantees verification, raising concerns about how deep neural networks can maintain such guarantees.
- The technical contribution appears incremental, closely resembling prior work on neural termination analysis.
- The benchmarks' selection and the time limit for evaluations raise questions about the robustness of the results.
- The paper may not be easily accessible to readers unfamiliar with formal methods, and the title may overclaim the scope of the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper for readers less familiar with formal methods by including additional citations related to ranking functions in LTL model checking. We suggest addressing the concerns regarding the benchmarks' selection and the time limit set for evaluations. Additionally, we recommend including ablation studies to clarify the algorithmic contributions and discussing the tuning of the approach to individual benchmarks in more detail. Finally, we advise the authors to clarify the implications of the proposed method when a system does not meet its specification and to provide more details on the neural network architecture choices.
