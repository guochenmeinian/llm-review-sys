Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a label-free adversarial attack method that utilizes intermediate latents from batch normalized deep image recognition architectures. The authors demonstrate that these latents can generate adversarial examples by minimizing angular deviations without requiring label information. The method shows promise across various architectures, including transformers, and raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities in deployed models due to the leakage of intermediate representations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is well motivated and technically sound, supported by theoretical analysis and experimental results demonstrating its effectiveness compared to single-stage attacks.
2. The experimental results indicate higher attack success rates than traditional methods, showcasing the method's potential.

Weaknesses:
1. The significance of the proposed method is unclear, as its attack success rates are inferior to established methods like PGD, raising questions about its practical applications.
2. Some claims lack validation or clear explanation, particularly regarding the meaning of Figure 1, the advantages of the 2-step process, and the rationale behind using different latents in the loss function.
3. Presentation issues exist, including the separation of attack results into different tables, which complicates comparisons, and the placement of key experimental results in the appendix rather than the main paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims, particularly regarding the significance of their method and the advantages of the 2-step process over 1-step methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide clearer explanations for the claims related to Figure 1 and the use of different latents in their loss function. To enhance presentation, merging tables for better readability and moving key experimental results from the appendix to the main paper would be beneficial. Finally, conducting ablation studies to explore the sensitivity of the proposed method to different hyper-parameters would strengthen the paper's contribution.
