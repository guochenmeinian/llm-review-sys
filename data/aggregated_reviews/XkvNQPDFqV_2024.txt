### Key Points
This paper presents Random Cycle Coding (RCC), a novel entropy coding technique that achieves optimal rate for cluster assignments by utilizing cycle representation of permutations. The method demonstrates significant empirical advantages over previous suboptimal approaches, particularly when the number of clusters approaches the sample size. The authors claim that RCC requires less computational resources, making it more practical for real-world applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed algorithm is innovative, effectively leveraging clustering and permutation properties for optimal compression.  
- Empirical results indicate substantial byte savings across various datasets, particularly in vector databases, enhancing machine learning retrieval processes.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's reliance on existing bits-back coding and random order coding techniques renders it somewhat incremental, lacking a clear presentation of the challenges in combining these methods.  
- The bitrate savings of RCC over ROC appear marginal when the number of clusters is not significantly smaller than the number of elements.  
- Technical details, such as the encoding process and the implications of sorting elements within cycles, are inadequately explained, which may hinder comprehension for those unfamiliar with the relevant literature.  
- The paper does not sufficiently address the significance of clustering assignment compression in practical applications or provide adequate literature references.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical details, possibly by including an illustrative example of Algorithm 1 to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should discuss the practical implications of clustering assignment compression more thoroughly and provide relevant literature to support their claims. Finally, addressing the limitations of the RCC approach, particularly in scenarios where the number of clusters is not close to the sample size, would strengthen the paper's contribution.
