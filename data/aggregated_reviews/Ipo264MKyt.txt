### Key Points
This paper presents a retrieval-based approach to enhance next-word prediction in language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR) personalization. The authors propose that n-gram patterns are specific to domains/users, and integrating LM predictions with n-gram probabilities from relevant users/domains can improve performance. The results indicate a significant reduction in LM perplexities and enhanced ASR performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The novelty of the proposed method and the observed performance improvements are commendable.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's effectiveness compared to competitive baselines.
- The paper is well-written in its latter half and provides thorough descriptions of training and decoding parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The methodology and motivation require clearer explanations, as some basic definitions are missing, leading to confusion.
- Certain sections, particularly Section 4.2 and parts of Section 3.3, are difficult to follow.
- The experimental setup is complex and may hinder reproducibility due to the lack of available datasets and code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by providing clearer definitions of key terms and enhancing the motivation for their approach. Specifically, rephrase the line in L061-064 to better reflect the intended message regarding kNN-LM. Additionally, clarify the meaning of K in line 164 and consider referencing the RAG paper for improved mathematical clarity. We suggest that the authors explain how they calculate the n-gram co-occurrence matrix and the specific domains used for k-NN retrieval in each dataset. Lastly, we encourage the authors to simplify the narration in Section 3.3 and Section 4.2, possibly using algorithmic or mathematical descriptions to enhance understanding.
