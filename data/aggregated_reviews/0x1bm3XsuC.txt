### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to improve unsupervised state detection performance for multivariate time series (MTS) data, addressing high computational overhead, false negative sampling, and optimization for online streaming scenarios. The authors propose E2USD, which utilizes fftCompress and ddEM to reduce computational costs, fnccLearning to enhance negative sampling, and adaTD for online optimization. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of E2USD across six datasets, including Synthetic and MoCap.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized with clear explanations of core components, particularly in Sections 2 and 3.
- Component and parameter sensitivity studies effectively illustrate the impact of each element.
- Intuitive figures enhance understanding of key concepts.
- The integration of fftCompress and ddEM is innovative, addressing significant challenges in unsupervised state detection.
- Comprehensive experiments on real devices add practical relevance, and code availability promotes reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental study lacks an in-depth analysis of how the proposed method improves runtime efficiency.
- The discussion on contrastive learning is insufficient, particularly regarding related work.
- Important details, such as the setup for static threshold detection, are missing.
- The necessity of calculating spectral intervals in the FFTCompress module requires further justification.
- The paper does not provide detailed data presentation during practical validation on an MCU, which could enhance credibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental analysis by providing a detailed explanation of how E2USD enhances runtime efficiency. Additionally, a discussion on alternative approaches to negative pair mining, such as BYOL, would contribute to the completeness of the paper. We suggest including a more thorough conceptual differentiation from TCN to clarify the unique contributions of E2USD. An ablation analysis to assess the importance of individual components, particularly the FFTCompress module, would also be beneficial. Finally, addressing the impact of false positives in streaming scenarios and conducting more experiments on the false negative cancellation method would strengthen the paper's claims.
