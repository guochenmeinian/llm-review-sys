Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive benchmark for continual multimodal pretraining, introducing the FoMo-in-Flux benchmark, which includes 63 datasets and aims to study continual multimodal pretraining under realistic constraints. The authors provide valuable insights into the impact of deployment scenarios, data mixtures, and pretraining data pools on knowledge accumulation and zero-shot retention. The study evaluates various continual learning and finetuning strategies, highlighting parameter-efficient methods like LoRA and model merging techniques such as EMA-merge, while also exploring effective learning rate schedules.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the novel FoMo-in-Flux benchmark fills a gap in the literature, allowing for fine-grained control over data streams and compute budgets.
2. Extensive experiments provide practical insights into optimizing continual pretraining processes, making the research highly applicable to real-world tasks.
3. The paper is well-organized and written clearly, facilitating understanding of complex concepts.
4. A thorough evaluation of various training strategies offers valuable guidance for practitioners.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comparative analysis with existing benchmarks, which could highlight the unique contributions of the FoMo-in-Flux benchmark.
2. Some practical applications may require further experimentation beyond what is presented, limiting the comprehensiveness of the insights.
3. The combination of existing datasets may limit the potential for broader multimodal applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the terminology used, specifically the distinction between 'pretraining' and 'finetuning.' Additionally, we suggest conducting further experiments to explore practical applications and scenarios not covered in the paper. A detailed comparative analysis with existing benchmarks would enhance the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the potential limitations and societal impacts of the work more explicitly in the main text would strengthen the overall presentation.
