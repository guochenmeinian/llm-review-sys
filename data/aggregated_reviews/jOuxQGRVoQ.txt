Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an Iterative Elastic Bins (IEBins) approach for monocular depth estimation, aiming to enhance object boundary clarity through iterative refinement. The authors propose adaptive depth bin ranges for each pixel, which refine with each iteration based on previous estimates, allowing for improved accuracy while accounting for uncertainty. However, reviewers noted that the proposed method still results in blurry object boundaries, particularly in the chair example (Fig. 5). The authors suggest that this blurriness may stem from the classification-regression approach, which produces smoother depth estimates, and the use of pixel-wise loss that lacks direct supervision on the probabilistic distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that the method outperforms existing techniques on benchmark datasets like KITTI and NYU-Depth-v2, although questions arise regarding the choice of six iteration stages and the effectiveness of certain contributions, such as the GRU-based optimizer.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves state-of-the-art accuracy across multiple datasets, showing significant improvements over prior methods.
- The proposed method shows improved depth estimation compared to other methods, as evidenced by sharper results in Fig. 5.
- The ablation studies effectively illustrate the impact of various design choices on performance.
- The overall design of the framework is viewed as quite nice and extendable, offering a clear interpretability of depth predictions.

Weaknesses:
- The method still produces blurry object boundaries, raising questions about its upper bound performance.
- Questions arise regarding the choice of six iteration stages and the potential for improved accuracy with more iterations.
- The contributions, particularly the GRU-based optimizer, are not fully convincing to all reviewers.
- There is concern about the fairness of comparisons in the ablation studies, particularly regarding whether other methods employed similar iterative optimizers.
- The paper lacks a thorough literature review, missing relevant works that could provide context for the contributions made.
- Visualization quality across figures is deemed inadequate, and results should be normalized uniformly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity surrounding the number of iteration stages used, including an analysis of performance with varying numbers of iterations during both training and testing. Additionally, we suggest providing a baseline comparison that isolates the effects of the iterative optimizer from the depth bin types to ensure fair evaluation. The authors should address the issues related to the classification-regression approach and the pixel-wise loss function to enhance object boundary clarity. We also encourage the authors to enhance the visualization quality in all figures and normalize the results uniformly, using a dataset global minimum and maximum for depth maps. Finally, we recommend that the authors provide a more robust justification for the contributions of the GRU-based optimizer to strengthen the paper's impact and address the incomplete literature review by incorporating discussions of related works such as LocalBins and PixelFormer.
