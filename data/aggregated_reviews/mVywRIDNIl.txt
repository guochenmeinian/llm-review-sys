Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into overgeneralization in offline reinforcement learning (RL) and proposes a method called Representation Distinction (RD) to mitigate this issue. The authors argue that RD can be integrated into various offline RL algorithms and demonstrate its effectiveness through experimental results on D4RL benchmarks. The paper introduces the Backup-Generalization framework to analyze the overestimation of critic values and emphasizes the importance of generalization in the training phase.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method significantly enhances the performance of baseline algorithms and can be applied flexibly across different offline RL frameworks.
- The paper is well-structured, clear, and provides a nuanced formalization of generalization issues in offline RL.
- Good ablation studies and technical soundness support the claims made.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental validation is limited, primarily focusing on MuJoCo datasets, which may not sufficiently demonstrate the method's robustness across diverse environments.
- The difference between the proposed RD and existing methods like DR3 is not clearly articulated, and comparisons with DR3 variants are lacking.
- Some sections, such as line 315-316, are difficult to understand, and additional theoretical analysis is needed to clarify the advantages of RD.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by including more datasets, such as AntMaze and Adroit, to substantiate the claims regarding the effectiveness of RD. Additionally, we suggest providing a pseudocode for CQL+RD to enhance clarity and including a theoretical analysis that differentiates RD from DR3. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments with multiple seeds to improve the robustness of the results and clarify any inconsistencies in reported findings. Lastly, addressing the hyperparameter tuning complexity and discussing existing methods for constraining critic approximation could further strengthen the paper.
