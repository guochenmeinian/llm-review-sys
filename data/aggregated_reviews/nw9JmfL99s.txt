### Key Points
This paper investigates the emergence of localized receptive fields (RFs) in supervised neural networks, extending the work of Ingrosso and Goldt. The authors propose that single-neuron models learn localized RFs when trained on data with sufficiently negative excess kurtosis, while positive excess kurtosis leads to delocalized RFs. The study analyzes the time evolution of network weights and demonstrates these findings through simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper addresses a significant topic in machine learning and neuroscience, presenting a novel approach to understanding localized RFs. The proofs appear correct, and the simulations support the theoretical claims. The writing is clear and accessible, making the work suitable for a broad audience.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns include the imprecision in Lemma 3.1 regarding the treatment of time and the limited scope of experiments, which rely on exemplars rather than systematic statistical analysis. The connection between stimulus kurtosis and localized RFs may not generalize well beyond the simplified model presented. Additionally, some figures are difficult to interpret, and the assumptions made for analytic tractability are quite strong.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the precision of Lemma 3.1 by providing a clearer definition of "detect the emergence of localization" and addressing the logic in the relevant paragraphs. The authors should enhance the experimental section by demonstrating that their claims hold statistically over multiple realizations of the data generation process. Furthermore, we suggest improving the clarity of figures by using color and reducing the number of lines, as well as quantifying the outcomes to aid interpretation. Lastly, the authors should consider revising the final paragraph of the conclusion to ensure it ties back to earlier content in the paper.
