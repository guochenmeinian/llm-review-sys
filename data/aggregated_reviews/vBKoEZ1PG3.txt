Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents HAWK, a novel video-language framework designed to understand video anomalies by integrating motion modalities. The authors annotate over 8,000 anomaly videos with language descriptions and generate 8,000 question-answer pairs to enhance training across diverse scenarios. HAWK demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in both video description generation and question-answering tasks, surpassing existing baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework leverages extensive annotations and question-answer pairs, improving training quality.
2. HAWK achieves superior results in video description generation and question-answering tasks, outperforming existing baselines.
3. The problem setup is novel, addressing a gap in current video anomaly detection methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The efficiency of Gunnar Farneback’s algorithm for obtaining motion modality is questioned.
2. The gap between real and virtual anomaly videos in the Ubnormal dataset is not adequately addressed.
3. The focus on motion information may overlook the importance of background information in understanding anomalies.
4. The dataset creation strategy may lead to redundancy in descriptions, suggesting the need for keyframe-based descriptions to reduce complexity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the efficiency evaluation of Gunnar Farneback’s algorithm and address the gap between real and virtual anomaly videos in the Ubnormal dataset. Additionally, consider incorporating background information in the analysis of anomalies and explore the use of keyframes instead of second-by-second descriptions to mitigate redundancy. Lastly, we suggest conducting ablation studies on the LLM backbone to justify the choice of LLaMA-2 7B and to evaluate the contribution of the motion modality more rigorously.
