Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "QH9: A Quantum Hamiltonian Prediction Benchmark for QM9 Molecules," which generates a comprehensive dataset of Hamiltonian matrices for numerous molecules and molecular dynamics trajectories. The dataset is utilized for training machine learning models, evaluated for prediction accuracy. The authors provide insights into the dataset's structure, including energy and molecular dynamics data, and emphasize its relevance for advancing machine learning models in predicting electronic states. Additionally, the paper explores quantum tensor learning tasks using a subset of the QM9 dataset, specifically focusing on 13,831 molecules. The authors clarify their methodology, including training time on specific hardware and modifications required for baseline models when applied to the QH9 dataset. They provide updated results based on the latest QHNet version and discuss the implications of their findings on model performance, particularly concerning out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset of Hamiltonian matrices is comprehensive and allows for a realistic assessment of machine learning models' reliability in predicting Hamiltonian matrices.
- The authors provide clear documentation and source code, facilitating the dataset's use for training and testing alternative models.
- The authors provide comprehensive details on their dataset and methodologies, including training times and hardware specifications.
- They address reviewer comments effectively, updating results and clarifying complex concepts such as the Hamiltonian matrix and molecular dynamics.
- The inclusion of Tanimoto similarity metrics enhances the evaluation of model performance.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks explicit discussion on the selection criteria for molecules in QH9 and does not adequately address the limitations of the work.
- The evaluation is limited to one model, and the paper does not explore how the model performs on prior datasets or provide sufficient context for the optimization step ratio comparisons.
- Some aspects, such as the explicit mention of QH9 encompassing all QM9 molecules, are not clearly stated in the text.
- The treatment of HOMO and LUMO properties could be misleading, as they are described as physical properties despite being virtual.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by explicitly stating the scaling of B3LYP as O(N^4) due to its incorporation of HF and DFT. Additionally, clarify the selection criteria for the molecules in QH9 and vary the training set size to generate learning curves for better insight into required dataset sizes for desired prediction accuracies. 

For the optimization step ratio benchmark metric, we suggest explicitly stating that the baseline is based on a guess matrix rather than random initialization. It would also be beneficial to include standard deviations in the optimization step ratio comparisons and add additional baselines to the tables, such as the lowest achievable optimization step ratio and classical baselines. 

Furthermore, we recommend providing more details on the MD data generation process, including the force field used, trajectory lengths, and time correlation of frames. Ensure that installation instructions for the dataset are clear, and consider providing a permanent DOI for the dataset to enhance accessibility. Lastly, we suggest including insightful results in the manuscript or at least in the Supplementary Material and clarifying the nature of HOMO and LUMO properties to avoid potential confusion regarding their physical observability.
