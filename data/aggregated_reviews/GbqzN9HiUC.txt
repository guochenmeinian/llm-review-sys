Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel analysis of autonomous goal selection based on "latent learning progress" (LLP), proposing that agents aim to maximize progress on a latent variable rather than solely on observable performance. The authors conducted an interesting experiment with human participants to investigate whether latent learning progress influences goal selection. The findings suggest that LLP, alongside performance, significantly drives goal choices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical concept of latent learning progress is well-motivated and novel.
- The experimental design is rigorous and effectively analyzed.
- The modeling approach is thorough, and the writing is clear.
- The literature review is comprehensive, and the work has potential impact within cognitive science.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of latent learning progress is introduced late in the paper and is operationalized only within the specific experimental context.
- The paper lacks broad appeal to the AI community, limiting its potential impact.
- The experimental paradigm is specific, raising concerns about generalizability to real-world tasks and diverse populations.
- The measure of LLP is tailored to the experimental task, questioning its applicability to open-ended tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition of latent learning progress by providing a more general formal definition applicable beyond the specific experimental setup. Additionally, addressing the limitations regarding the generalizability of findings to different tasks and populations would strengthen the paper. We also suggest including effect sizes in the statistical analyses to better convey the behavioral significance of the results. Lastly, consider reformatting the description of the experimental game for clarity and improving the readability of Figure 3 by clarifying the y-axis and possibly using an alternative visualization method.
