Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SeeClear, a diffusion-based method for Video Super-Resolution (VSR) that enhances restoration performance through semantic priors. The authors propose an Instance-Centric Alignment Module (InCAM) and Channel-wise Texture Aggregation Memory (CaTeGory) to effectively utilize semantic information. Experimental comparisons across multiple datasets indicate that SeeClear achieves state-of-the-art performance in VSR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of semantic priors for spatial modulation and temporal correlation significantly improves diffusion-based VSR performance.
2. The design of InCAM allows for alignment using semantic information, effectively reducing pixel inconsistencies.
3. CaTeGory facilitates the transfer of semantic information between frames, enhancing coherence.
4. Extensive experiments validate the proposed method's effectiveness against state-of-the-art techniques.
5. The paper is well-organized, featuring clear layouts and figures.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on pre-trained models for semantic extraction introduces significant computational overhead, limiting applicability; the paper lacks complexity and parameter count comparisons.
2. There is insufficient experimental support for critical hyperparameters, such as the choice of k in InCAM and the number of frames used in super-resolution.
3. The proposed use of wavelet transform to enhance UNet lacks experimental justification compared to simpler methods.
4. Figure 1 is visually appealing but difficult to interpret; clearer explanations of the network structure and inference process are needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 to better illustrate the workflow and connections among modules. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed computational analysis, including parameters, runtime, and FLOPs/MACs, to facilitate fair comparisons. We suggest conducting an ablation study on the wavelet transform to justify its inclusion and comparing the performance of SeeClear with other relevant methods, such as ResShift and Upscale-A-Video. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the rationale behind the choice of hyperparameters and improve the presentation of mathematical notations for better readability.
