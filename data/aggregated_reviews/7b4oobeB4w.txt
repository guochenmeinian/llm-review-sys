Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model to quantify biases in evaluation processes, such as hiring and school admissions, by framing it as a loss minimization problem subject to constraints. The authors propose a framework that incorporates resource constraints and risk aversion, deriving properties of the output densities and applying the model to real-world datasets, including IIT JEE-2009 scores. Additionally, the paper introduces a mechanism that maps "true ability" to "biased ability," allowing for the evaluation of how parameters such as $\tau$ and $\alpha$ influence this transformation. The authors argue that while recovering the density of true abilities from biased abilities may be a goal, it is not always necessary or directly achievable; the focus should instead be on ensuring that outcomes from biased abilities align with those from true abilities. The model aims to assist policymakers in evaluating interventions designed to reduce bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The conception of the model is strong, utilizing the maximum entropy principle to generalize previous models without excessive parameters.  
- The inclusion of risk aversion enhances the framework's ability to model skewed distributions.  
- The authors provide a clear mechanism for mapping true to biased abilities, enhancing the theoretical foundation of their framework.  
- The proposed adjustments to parameters $\tau$ and $\alpha$ are well-articulated, offering insights into bias correction.  
- Empirical validation with real datasets and the evaluation of various interventions demonstrate the model's applicability and interpretability.  

Weaknesses:  
- The exposition is often unclear, making it difficult to grasp the main contributions and the rationale behind design choices.  
- The lack of a formal model of bias and insufficient explanation of how the parameters $\tau$ and $\alpha$ relate to bias contribute to confusion.  
- The overall presentation of the paper remains confusing, indicating a need for significant improvement in clarity and organization.  
- The empirical analysis lacks depth, offering limited insights into actionable interventions for policymakers.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the exposition, particularly in explaining the mechanisms by which information constraints and risk aversion lead to bias. Providing specific examples would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest including explicit theorem statements to clarify the contributions of the model. The authors should elaborate on the mechanism that maps true ability to biased ability in Section 2 and provide a more detailed overview of the proof of Theorem 3.1 in Section 3.1. Incorporating informal versions of key results in Sections D and E, and updating the experimental validation with a train-test split in Section 4 would be beneficial. Finally, addressing the limitations of the model in Section 5, particularly regarding long-term applicability and potential misuse, as well as expanding the empirical evaluation to demonstrate how the model offers qualitatively better insights into policy interventions compared to simpler models, would strengthen the paper's impact.
