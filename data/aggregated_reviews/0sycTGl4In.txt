Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UA-4DGS, a novel approach for reconstructing dynamic scenes from monocular videos. It addresses information loss from large motion and self-occlusion by integrating diffusion priors with pixel-wise uncertainty scores. The authors propose an uncertainty-aware diffusion-based regularization that enhances uncertain regions while preserving certain ones, thus preventing inconsistencies with training images. Additionally, they tackle the initialization problem in Gaussian Splatting for dynamic scenes through dynamic region densification, which improves reconstruction performance and memory efficiency.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly presented and well-structured, making it easy to follow.
- The proposed regularization method effectively reduces inconsistencies with training images.
- Dynamic region densification addresses the missing initialization problem in dynamic regions.
- The effectiveness of UA-4DGS is demonstrated using the DyCheck benchmark with complex object motions.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality is poor, with numerous typographical and grammatical errors, as well as notation misuse. A thorough review is necessary.
- Some assumptions and claims lack validation, particularly regarding the definitions of certainty and the impact of under-reconstruction in dynamic regions.
- The experimental results are unsatisfactory, with significant noise and blurriness, and the evaluation is based on only seven images, which is insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by correcting typographical and grammatical errors throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing further validation for the assumptions made, particularly regarding certainty and under-reconstruction claims. To enhance the experimental evaluation, we recommend expanding the testing to include more datasets and cases, as well as addressing the qualitative performance issues that remain. Furthermore, we advise clarifying the experimental setup to ensure that it aligns with the goal of reconstructing dynamic scenes. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide more details on the caching strategy and the performance of each component when used individually.
