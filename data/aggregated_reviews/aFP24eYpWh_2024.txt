Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a generative model designed to learn the data distribution along symmetry transformation orbits. The authors propose a two-stage method that first employs a self-supervised loss to create an invariant function mapping samples to prototypes, followed by a normalizing flow to model the conditional distribution along each orbit. The approach aims to enhance data efficiency for datasets exhibiting symmetry transformations, demonstrating effectiveness on small-scale datasets like dSprites and MNIST. The paper is regarded as technically strong with novel ideas and good execution, leading to a generally favorable reception from reviewers. The authors plan to enhance the manuscript by incorporating additional architecture and training details, running further experiments with suggested datasets like PatchCamelyon, and including a reference to Mumford and Desolneux.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper introduces a novel framework for learning symmetry transformation distributions, utilizing a flow generative model that offers greater expressivity than traditional Gaussian or uniform distributions.
* The methodology is clearly articulated, with well-motivated design choices.
* Experimental results indicate that the training objective can yield approximately invariant prototypes and that orbital distributions vary across prototypes, enhancing data efficiency in symmetric datasets.
* The paper is well-written with clear motivation and reasonable experimental results.
* Most reviewers acknowledge that their main concerns have been addressed, leading to increased scores.

Weaknesses:
* The practical applicability of the method is questionable, as experiments are limited to small datasets. The authors should explore more complex tasks where symmetry modeling could be advantageous.
* The dimensionality of symmetry transformations is often much lower than that of the data manifold, raising concerns about the necessity of generative modeling for low-dimensional distributions on group orbits.
* The representation of symmetry transformations appears ad-hoc, lacking consideration of the diverse structures of symmetry groups, which could be addressed by discussing relevant literature.
* The clarity of the architecture predicting distributions over group elements is insufficient, with a lack of detail on the loss function and the role of input images in this process.
* There is a remaining request for experiments on a more complicated dataset, which the authors have not yet been able to include due to time and compute limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical relevance of their method by conducting experiments on more complex datasets to demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. The authors should clarify the necessity of using a generative model for low-dimensional distributions and consider simplifying their approach if appropriate. We suggest addressing the parameterization of symmetry transformations more rigorously, potentially incorporating discussions of related works to enhance the theoretical foundation. The authors should provide more detailed explanations of the architecture predicting distributions over group elements, including the loss function and the role of input images, to improve clarity and understanding. Additionally, we encourage the authors to aim for experiments on a more complicated dataset as suggested by reviewer TzHS.
