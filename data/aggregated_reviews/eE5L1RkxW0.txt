Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into high-frequency components (HFC) in images from a long-tailed perspective, focusing on the relationship between HFC and model robustness. The authors demonstrate that the model's underfitting behavior is due to limited information content in HFC and propose a Balance Spectrum Sampling (BaSS) strategy to enhance model learning on HFC. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BaSS across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The investigation of HFC from a long-tailed perspective is both interesting and relevant to model robustness.
2. Detailed definitions and analyses of the frequency long-tailed scenario are provided.
3. The BaSS strategy is simple and efficient.
4. The paper includes a robust set of experiments across multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The re-sampling/re-weighting method may improve tail recognition at the expense of head recognition, potentially weakening the model's ability to recognize low-frequency components (LFC).
2. There are several typos and grammatical errors throughout the paper, such as "counteract" instead of "counteracts" and "enhance" instead of "enhances."
3. The paper lacks a thorough discussion of existing literature and its relevance, which could strengthen the foundation of the research.
4. Baseline comparisons are limited; BaSS should be evaluated against more recent sampling methods beyond PGD-AT, and the differences in frequency distribution before and after BaSS adoption should be included.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanations, particularly regarding the influence of the Pareto principle on their proposed approach. Additionally, please ensure that all definitions, such as those in Eq 2, are clearly articulated. It would be beneficial to include a comparison of BaSS with more recent methods like MART and AWP, as well as an ablation study on the hyperparameters in Eq. 4. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors address the lack of clarity in the experiments and provide error bars to indicate the significance of the results. Finally, please ensure that all typos and grammatical errors are corrected throughout the manuscript.
