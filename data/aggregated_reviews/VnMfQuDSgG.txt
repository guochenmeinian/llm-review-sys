### Key Points
This paper presents a method for evaluating style shifting in social media, integrating both linguistic and non-linguistic factors. The authors propose a personalized neural language model that utilizes "surprisals" to measure deviations in conversational style, incorporating user-level features from social networks. The study claims improved alignment with human annotations and introduces a novel metric for style evaluation based on these factors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The incorporation of non-linguistic factors provides a comprehensive evaluation of style-shifting.
- The analysis reveals valuable correlations between the proposed metric and various conversational factors.
- The framework is relevant for understanding dynamics in social media conversations.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is heavily statistical, lacking linguistic nuance in its metrics.
- The novelty of the proposed architecture is limited, resembling existing models without sufficient differentiation.
- Reproducibility is a concern due to insufficient details on datasets, experimental settings, and the availability of code.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the linguistic nuance captured by their metrics to enhance the paper's depth. Additionally, clarifying the choice of datasets and the time frame for studying style shifts would strengthen the analysis. The authors should also provide a detailed explanation of their feature engineering process and its impact on model performance. Finally, releasing code and data in an anonymized repository would facilitate reproducibility and validation of results.
