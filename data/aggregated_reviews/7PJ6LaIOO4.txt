Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper studies the Multi-Agent Multi-Armed Bandits (MAMAB) problem with a factor graph reward structure, motivated by antenna tilt optimization. The authors propose an asymptotic lower bound involving an optimization problem with an exponential number of variables and constraints, which is relaxed using approximation techniques from probabilistic graphical models. They introduce the ESM algorithm, which balances statistical and computational efficiency, and demonstrate its performance through synthetic and real-world experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The relaxation employs novel techniques from probabilistic graphical models.
- The ESM algorithm is computationally efficient and adaptable to different trade-offs between statistical and computational complexity.
- The algorithm exhibits good asymptotic regret, supported by experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis of the algorithm's performance is somewhat limited, lacking clarity on the approximation's distance from the exact lower bound and the performance of locally tree-like reductions.
- The regret lower bound appears to lack novelty, with proofs relying on established techniques from structured bandits.
- The tightness of the upper bound for regret is not proven, leaving uncertainty about the loss of statistical efficiency.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the algorithm's performance by quantifying the difference between \(C^\star_{\theta}\) and \(C^{\diamond}_{\theta}(m)\) to clarify how far the approximation is from the exact lower bound. Additionally, the authors should address the computational complexity of their algorithm in the acyclic factor graph setting and provide a more thorough comparison against relevant literature, particularly [2] and [36]. Clarifying the choice of action set in the antenna tilt experiment and the implications of letting \(\varepsilon, \gamma \to 0\) in Algorithm 1 would also enhance the paper's clarity.
