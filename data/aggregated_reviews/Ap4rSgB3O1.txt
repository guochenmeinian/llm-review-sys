### Key Points
This paper presents ChargE3Net, an E(3)-equivariant graph neural network designed to predict the charge density of molecules and materials using high-order tensor representations. The authors demonstrate that their model outperforms baseline models across three datasets, providing comprehensive discussions on methodology and results. They introduce a novel metric for quantifying angular dependence and show improved scalability compared to the DFT method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written with comprehensive methodological discussions and results.  
- ChargE3Net consistently outperforms baseline models in benchmarks.  
- The authors effectively analyze the effects of high-order representations and introduce a novel metric for angular dependence.  
- The scalability analysis compared to the DFT method is commendable.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a potential error regarding the software used for generating training data.  
- Clarification is needed on whether the same training-validation-testing split was used for the results in Table 2 and if baseline models were evaluated independently by the authors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the training data generation software to address the potential error. Additionally, we suggest that the authors confirm whether the same training-validation-testing split was utilized for the results in Table 2 and clarify if they independently evaluated the baseline models.
