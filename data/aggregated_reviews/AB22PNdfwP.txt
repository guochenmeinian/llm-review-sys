### Key Points
This paper presents a directed reweighting scheme for edges in graphs through UnGSL, which enhances connectivity from nodes with low uncertainty while weakening it from nodes with high uncertainty. The authors propose utilizing uncertainty as a measure of node quality, which is a novel approach. The paper is well-structured and supported by extensive experiments, demonstrating effectiveness in both semi-supervised and unsupervised scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for UnGSL is clearly articulated, and the intuitive nature of the method is well-explained.
- Extensive and thorough experiments are conducted, including both homogeneous and heterogeneous graphs.
- The theoretical background is well-defined, and the writing is clear.

Weaknesses:
- The definition of ‘quality’ is ambiguous, particularly regarding its relationship with uncertainty.
- The method description is brief and lacks detail, particularly in Section 3.2, where the estimation of node uncertainty and the integration of A∗ with GSL are unclear.
- Experimental validation is limited to a narrow set of datasets, which may not generalize well to more complex, real-world scenarios.
- Formatting issues and citation inconsistencies detract from the overall quality of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the meaning of ‘quality’ in relation to uncertainty and provide a detailed explanation of how node uncertainty is estimated. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of different values for $\tau$ to enhance the method's effectiveness. The authors should also validate UnGSL on larger-scale datasets and traditional GNN models to demonstrate broader applicability. Furthermore, addressing the formatting issues and providing a clear framework diagram would improve the paper's presentation. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the impact of label quality and edge characteristics on performance, as well as to elaborate on the initialization and convergence of learnable thresholds.
