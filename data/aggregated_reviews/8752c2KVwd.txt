### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark for evaluating multilingual dialect-to-standard normalization across four European languages. The main task involves converting broad phonetic transcriptions of dialects into the orthography of standard varieties. The authors compile a multilingual dataset from existing corpora and conduct detailed experiments, evaluating several seq-2seq and MT systems with different splits and normalizations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a thorough discussion of results and error analyses.
- It provides different splits of the same dataset to test various scenarios, which is rare in NLP papers and important for revealing potential artificial gains or losses.
- The appropriateness of the baselines and configurations for the systems used is commendable.
- The multilingual aspect of the benchmark enhances its relevance.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to four European languages with Latin scripts, raising concerns about linguistic diversity and generalizability of findings to other languages.
- The paper makes marginal contributions by compiling a dataset derived entirely from previous works, with only minor modifications.
- The focus on monolingual settings lacks exploration of multilingual training or knowledge transfer methods, which could enhance performance across closely-related languages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the linguistic diversity of the dataset by incorporating dialectal corpora from languages with non-Latin scripts. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct multilingual training/fine-tuning experiments to explore potential improvements in monolingual performance using resources from closely-related variants. Finally, a discussion on how the methodology generalizes to informal scenarios would strengthen the paper's applicability.
