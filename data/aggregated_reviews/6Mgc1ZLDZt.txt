### Key Points
This paper presents FamouSRec, a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework designed to enhance sequence recommendation by utilizing diverse encoder modules that focus on different frequency ranges. The authors propose expert-frequency contrastive learning and expert alignment contrastive learning to improve model specialization. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with solid notations and clear matrix shapes for easy understanding.
- Thorough experimentation on five datasets enhances confidence in the results, comparing various models from the literature.
- The approach effectively addresses architectural biases of previous models by leveraging the MoE framework.

Weaknesses:
- Specific implementation details, such as the size of FamouSRec's model parameters and the expert models used, are unclear.
- The rationale for the architecture design is insufficiently justified, particularly regarding the placement of the gating network and the necessity of multiple encoders.
- The paper lacks comparisons with ensemble learning methods and does not demonstrate the direct impact of the MoE model on handling multiple frequency ranges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of implementation details for FamouSRec, including the model parameter size and the specific expert models used in experiments. Additionally, we suggest providing justifications for architectural choices, such as the placement of the gating network and the use of multiple encoders. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with ensemble learning methods and to conduct experiments that directly assess the MoE framework's impact on frequency coverage. Finally, addressing minor writing issues, such as the definition of parameters and typos, would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
