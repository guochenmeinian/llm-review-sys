### Key Points
This paper follows up on the study initiated by Hanneke et al. (2018) regarding validity-constrained distribution learning. The authors propose a method to improve query efficiency in learning generative models under validity constraints, specifically targeting the output of a distribution $\hat{q}$ that minimizes a loss while ensuring a small mass on invalid samples. The authors explore two scenarios: one where the true data distribution $P$ belongs to the benchmark class $Q$ and the loss function is log-loss, achieving $\tilde{O}(\log|Q|/\min(\epsilon_1^2, \epsilon_2))$ samples with no validity queries; and another where the validity oracle belongs to a class with bounded VC dimension, yielding improved query complexity of $\tilde{O}(d/\min(\epsilon_1, \epsilon_2))$.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors present a robust set of results for special cases of validity-constrained distribution learning, demonstrating significant improvements in query complexity under realistic assumptions. The results are particularly compelling in the realizable setting, where the validity oracle can be bypassed entirely. The use of classic hypothesis testing tools enhances the analysis.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks proof sketches for the main theorems, which could aid in understanding. Certain sections could benefit from more elaboration for clarity, as some sentences are dense and difficult to follow. Additionally, the practical significance of the results remains unclear, raising questions about their applicability in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by including proof sketches for the main theorems in the body to enhance understanding. Additionally, consider elaborating on complex points and ensuring coherence in dense sections to facilitate reader comprehension. It would also be beneficial to discuss the practical implications of the results more thoroughly, providing insights into when the proposed relaxations are appropriate versus when they may not be prudent.
