### Key Points
This paper presents a novel quantum-physics-aware neural network (qpa-NN) architecture aimed at quantum capability learning, specifically predicting error rates in quantum circuits. The authors demonstrate that the qpa-NN achieves a reduction in mean absolute error compared to CNN-based models, indicating improved performance in both experimental and simulated data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The qpa-NN architecture integrates quantum physics principles, offering a fresh perspective in learning-based quantum capability learning.  
2. The model outperforms previous CNN methods in predicting circuit success probability, showcasing commendable results.

Weaknesses:  
1. The dataset's qubit scale, limited to a maximum of 5 qubits, raises concerns about its adequacy for current quantum hardware and classical simulations. The reviewers question the reasons for not utilizing larger datasets, whether due to experimental challenges or model training limitations.  
2. The evaluation method, Process Fidelity (Eq. 3), may face scalability issues, and the explanation of approximations in Section 3.2 lacks clarity. Reviewers seek clarification on whether the proposed approximation method can mitigate exponential computational and storage complexity and request a comparison with estimation methods from Proctor et al. (2022).  
3. The novelty of the approach is questioned, as neural network methods for predicting circuit success probability have been previously discussed. Additionally, the explanation of how qpa-NNs leverage graph structures requires further elaboration.  
4. The scope of noise types considered is limited, with benchmarking conducted solely on small-scale devices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating larger qubit scales to enhance the robustness of their findings. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the approximations used in Process Fidelity (Eq. 3) and discussing their differences from the methods in Proctor et al. (2022). To strengthen the paper's novelty, we encourage the authors to elaborate on how qpa-NNs leverage graph structures and to broaden the scope of noise types considered in their evaluations. Finally, we advise the authors to focus on the challenge of predicting quantum computer behavior using classical neural networks, rather than making broad practical promises.
