### Key Points
This paper presents the Modular Query Plan Language (QPL), a new meaning representation designed to decompose SQL queries into simpler sub-queries. The authors propose that QPL enhances model learning and user comprehension, potentially improving performance in text-to-SQL parsing. The paper claims that QPL outperforms traditional SQL in handling complex queries and offers interpretability benefits. Additionally, the authors augment the SPIDER dataset with QPL annotations, providing a resource for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- QPL's modular structure simplifies complex SQL queries, potentially aiding Large Language Models (LLMs) in understanding intricate logic.
- Experimental results indicate that QPL improves performance in text-to-QPL parsing compared to text-to-SQL parsing.
- The augmentation of the SPIDER dataset with QPL annotations is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental setup does not sufficiently validate QPL's effectiveness, lacking comparisons with existing methods like QDMR and using only the Spider dataset.
- Conclusions drawn from user studies are based on p < 0.06, which is not statistically significant.
- The paper lacks detailed analysis of experimental results and does not adequately explore the application scenarios for QPL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including comparisons with existing methods such as QPL vs. NatSQL and QPL -> QD vs. QDMR, as well as testing on additional datasets like KaggleDBQA, EHRSQL, and BIRD. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct a thorough error analysis to identify specific challenges with QPL compared to SQL. It would also be beneficial to provide a more detailed explanation of how QPL translates to execution plans and validate that QPL produces the same execution results as original SQL queries. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand on the interpretability of QPL in comparison to QDMR, potentially through user studies that illustrate non-expert understanding of both representations.
