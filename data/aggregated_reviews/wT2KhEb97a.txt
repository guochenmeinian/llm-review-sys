### Key Points
This paper presents a study of local algorithms for graph clustering, specifically focusing on computing Personalized Page Rank (PPR) vectors. The authors propose a new algorithmic framework based on the locally evolving set process, which allows for the implementation of existing algorithms like Andersen et al.'s APPR and the development of localized versions of Chebyshev and heavy ball methods. These new methods achieve a dependence on the parameter $\alpha$ of $1/\sqrt{\alpha}$ for some fixed constant value of $\epsilon$. Empirical results demonstrate that these localized methods outperform APPR on several large-scale graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper develops a novel algorithmic framework that encompasses existing algorithms and leads to improved methods for local graph clustering. The theoretical analysis is supported by practical implementations that show superior performance compared to previous algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
A limitation is that the quadratic improvement in dependence on $\alpha$ is only achieved for a specific value of $\epsilon$, not universally. Additionally, the gains from the proposed methods manifest only after a relatively large number of steps, raising questions about their practical applicability in typical local algorithm scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generality of their results by exploring convergence for accelerated methods across all $\epsilon > 0$. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons of downstream tasks and their effects on overall accuracies, such as F-1 scores, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed methods.
