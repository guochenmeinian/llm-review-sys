Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model that captures the dynamics between users and content creators in recommender systems, demonstrating how user preferences shift based on recommendations while creators adjust their content to attract users. The authors establish sufficient conditions for polarization under the assumption that each creator has a non-zero probability of being recommended to every user. They analyze four recommendation designs—Top-k, Truncation, Diversity boosting, and Lower bounding probability—showing that certain designs lead to polarization while others promote diverse clusters. The experimental results using synthetic and Movielens data support the theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is pioneering in considering both user and creator dynamics in recommender systems, providing sufficient analytic conditions for polarization.
- The application of theory to four natural designs is insightful, particularly the findings that rules (3) and (4) lead to polarization while rule (1) fosters diverse clusters.
- The experimental evaluation with synthetic and Movielens data complements the theory, revealing that softmax probability diminishes creator and recommendation diversity over time.

Weaknesses:
- There are gaps in the literature review regarding existing works on creator dynamics in recommender systems, which assume static user features. The authors should clarify how their work is the first to consider both dynamics.
- Some observations, such as the impact of larger $\beta$ on creator diversity, have been previously noted in related works, necessitating a more detailed discussion.
- The user/creator preference updating dynamics require further justification and empirical evidence.
- The assumption that all items can be recommended is unrealistic; a focus on top-k recommendations would be more applicable to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by including a comprehensive discussion of existing works on creator dynamics, particularly those that assume static user features. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide more justification for the user/creator preference updating dynamics and include empirical evidence to support their claims. It would also be beneficial to address the limitations of assuming all items can be recommended by focusing on top-k recommendations in their analyses. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the effects of noise in their model and consider additional simulation results to enhance their findings.
