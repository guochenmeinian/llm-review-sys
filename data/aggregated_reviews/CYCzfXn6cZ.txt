Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Bayesian approach for survival analysis that incorporates time-varying covariates through a hazard function modeled as a squared Gaussian process. The authors derive a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator and predictive distribution, achieving computational efficiencies that scale linearly with the number of observed events. The methodology is evaluated on synthetic datasets, demonstrating comparable predictive accuracy to existing models while being significantly faster. However, the empirical results show limited improvements in accuracy over previous methods, particularly when evaluated on real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a coherent probabilistic formulation for survival analysis, addressing a relevant and underexplored problem.
- It provides a clear presentation of the methodology and empirical validation, making it accessible to a broad audience.
- The proposed model demonstrates computational efficiency, particularly in scenarios with frequently measured covariates.

Weaknesses:
- The empirical results do not show significant accuracy improvements over existing methods, which is disappointing.
- The evaluation is primarily based on synthetic data with limited dimensionality, lacking robust testing on real-world datasets.
- The assumption of piecewise constant time-varying covariates is strong and may limit applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a clear motivational example in the introduction to illustrate the importance of time-varying covariates. Additionally, conducting experiments on widely recognized real-world datasets, such as MIMIC III or the U.K. Cystic Fibrosis Registry, would enhance the model's practical relevance and robustness. It would also be beneficial to discuss the implications of high-dimensional, low-sample size scenarios more thoroughly, including potential strategies for handling such data. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the distinction between exogenous and endogenous covariates and consider comparing their approach with more recent survival analysis methods to provide a comprehensive evaluation of its performance. Lastly, addressing the choice of evaluation metrics, such as using the C-index instead of AUC, would strengthen the analysis.
