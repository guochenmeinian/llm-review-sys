Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents improvements to the training of Rectified Flow (RF) models, specifically focusing on a one-stage training approach that enhances efficiency compared to traditional multi-iteration methods. The authors propose a U-shaped time-step distribution for sampling and a modified LPIPS-Huber loss, demonstrating superior FID scores in the 1-NFE setting on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. They argue that the reflow process, which straightens the ODE, is sufficient for effective sampling, and provide empirical evidence supporting their claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the reflow algorithm, showing that a single reflow can yield nearly optimal solution trajectories.
- The empirical performance is impressive, with results indicating that the improved method is competitive with state-of-the-art distillation techniques.
- The authors conduct thorough ablation studies across multiple datasets, enhancing the credibility of their findings.

Weaknesses:
- The improvements are largely incremental and overlap with existing techniques in the literature, such as Pseudo-Huber loss and initialization with pre-trained diffusion models.
- The rationale connecting the proposed improvements to the empirical observations is weak, particularly regarding the motivation for the new time-step distribution and loss function.
- The notation and presentation in some sections are confusing, which may hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the connection between their observations and proposed solutions, particularly regarding the U-shaped time-step distribution. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the notation issues to enhance clarity, possibly by aligning with the notation used in the original RF paper. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments with more than two-NFE settings to assess the consistency of improvements. Lastly, we advise against including Section 5.3 in the main body, as its relevance appears limited; instead, consider investigating this separately.
