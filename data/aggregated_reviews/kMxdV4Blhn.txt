Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel convolution method based on the \( \ell_p \)-norm, specifically the \( \ell_1 \)-norm, as a substitute for traditional inner products in 3D tasks. The authors propose a tailored optimization approach utilizing Mixed Gradient Strategy and Dynamic Learning Rate Controller, demonstrating competitive performance on ModelNet classification and S3DIS semantic segmentation tasks at lower computational costs. The theoretical foundation includes proving the universal approximation theorem for \( \ell_p \)-norm networks and analyzing their robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed \( \ell_1 \)-norm convolution is innovative and has broad applicability in 3D tasks.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear writing and sufficient experimental validation across various tasks.
- The detailed proof of the universal approximation theorem and the comparative results between different \( \ell_p \)-norm convolutions provide valuable insights for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The writing requires improvement, particularly in detailing the proposed methods and addressing theoretical gaps between empirical results and theoretical guarantees.
- The baseline models lack detailed descriptions, and the layout of some tables needs optimization for clarity.
- There are minor typographical errors and inconsistencies in formatting that should be addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing additional details regarding the proposed methods and their theoretical implications. It would be beneficial to include a formal definition of the \( \ell_p \)-norm space and to clarify the significance of the theoretical results in relation to empirical findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the experimental section by outlining the setup for online learning tasks and considering sequential decision tasks to strengthen the justification for the regret guarantee. Lastly, addressing the minor typographical errors and ensuring uniform formatting throughout the paper will enhance its overall presentation.
