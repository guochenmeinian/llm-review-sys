Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the continual counting problem under a "relaxed" privacy notion, where the privacy budget is a time-dependent function, specifically differential privacy with expiration functions. The authors propose an algorithm based on the pan-private tree-based mechanism, demonstrating that it verifies differential privacy with an expiration function $g(d) \sim 1 + \log^\lambda(d)$, which improves upon existing expiration functions. The paper provides upper and lower bounds for various expiration functions and shows that the proposed algorithm achieves an additive error of $O(\log(T) / \epsilon)$, matching the lower bound.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem is well-motivated and interesting, with potential applications.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The analysis is comprehensive, covering upper/lower bounds and various expiration functions, with clear articulation of main ideas.
- Empirical evaluations validate the theoretical findings.

Weaknesses:
- The technical gap compared to existing works by Dwork et al. and Chan et al. is limited.
- Algorithm 3 lacks intuitiveness, particularly regarding the role of $\lambda$, and its analysis is unclear.
- The motivating examples, particularly the tracking of website visits, do not adequately capture the definition used; for instance, the sensitivity of data may not uniformly diminish over time.
- The description in Section 3.2 is abstract and could benefit from examples similar to those in Bolot et al.
- The results may seem unsurprising given the discussed intuition, and the $\log T$ vs $\log^2 T$ gap is relatively small.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Algorithm 3, particularly by elucidating the role of $\lambda$ and enhancing its analysis. Additionally, providing more motivating examples that accurately reflect the diminishing sensitivity of data over time would strengthen the paper. We suggest including a proper definition of the accuracy of a counting task and the different types of errors. Furthermore, discussing the potential application of matrix mechanisms to improve the constant term in error analysis could be beneficial. Lastly, addressing the possibility of larger gaps between continual release and batch models in the final version would enhance the paper's contribution.
