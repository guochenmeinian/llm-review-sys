Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the ChimpACT dataset, which includes approximately 160,000 annotated video frames of chimpanzee behavior recorded over four years at the Leipzig zoo. The dataset comprises around two hours of video, featuring 23 different chimp identities and annotations for three primary tasks: detection, tracking, and action recognition. The authors establish benchmarks for these tasks, evaluating various existing methods. The dataset is notable for its longitudinal nature and comprehensive behavioral annotations, filling a significant gap in the availability of animal behavior datasets. The authors emphasize that their dataset is the largest available for this purpose, providing detailed evaluations and insights into chimpanzee behaviors. They clarify that their baseline methods emphasize multi-object tracking rather than individual identification and acknowledge the limitations of generalizing findings to wild populations. The authors also discuss their training methodology, noting that pose estimation requires more epochs than tracking tasks, and they have included validation curves to demonstrate model adequacy, making HOTA the primary metric for evaluation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset addresses a critical need for annotated animal behavior data, which is scarce.
- It includes a broad range of tasks and a substantial number of baseline evaluations.
- The writing is clear, and the dataset is well-contextualized within the field of primate ethology.
- The authors have implemented rigorous quality control measures in the annotation process, ensuring reliability.
- The longitudinal approach provides valuable insights into social dynamics and behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset is limited to a single zoo and a specific group of chimpanzees, which may affect generalizability to wild populations.
- The size of the dataset is relatively small compared to other existing datasets for similar tasks.
- The dataset is limited to 2D annotations, which may restrict its applicability.
- The performance of algorithms on the dataset has been suboptimal, attributed to its smaller size and the inherent challenges of chimpanzee behavior.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the annotation process, including inter-annotator reliability and the criteria for selecting video clips.
- The writing and figures require improvement for clarity and effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the dataset by incorporating data from multiple locations or groups of chimpanzees. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of how baseline methods for multi-object tracking are combined with individual identification, as well as addressing the performance discrepancies observed in pose estimation. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the criteria used for sampling the video clips and to clarify the annotation process, including how disagreements among annotators were resolved. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore further hyperparameter tuning to enhance baseline performance and discuss the challenges of occlusion-rich environments with limited pretraining in their revision. Finally, we recommend improving the clarity of the writing and the quality of the figures by providing more specific details or examples.
