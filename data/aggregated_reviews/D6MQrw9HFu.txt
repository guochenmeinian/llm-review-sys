Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FOOGD, a federated learning framework designed to address both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and detection. FOOGD estimates client data distributions using SM3D and incorporates the SAG module to enhance feature consistency. The authors demonstrate FOOGD's effectiveness through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. FOOGD innovatively tackles both OOD generalization and detection in federated learning.  
2. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with thorough derivations and instructive figures.  
3. Extensive experiments validate the proposed methods, showcasing their effectiveness in handling non-IID data with OOD shifts.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The experimental section lacks sufficient detail on statistical analysis methods, affecting result interpretation reliability.  
2. Evaluation metrics such as ACC-IN and ACC-IN-C are not adequately explained.  
3. The related work section is limited and lacks references to significant methods like FedAvg.  
4. No open-source code has been provided, and the paper does not sufficiently address the computational complexity and communication costs associated with the proposed methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by providing a more detailed analysis of OOD to clarify FOOGD's superiority. Additionally, please explain the evaluation metrics ACC-IN and ACC-IN-C. We suggest expanding the related work section to include a discussion on 'concept shift' in federated learning and relevant literature. Furthermore, we advise clarifying the relationships among FOOGD, SM3D, and SAG in the abstract and introduction. Lastly, please consider releasing open-source code to enhance reproducibility and transparency.
