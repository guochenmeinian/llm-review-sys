### Key Points
This paper presents the Sparse Universal Transformer (SUT), a variant of the Universal Transformer that incorporates Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) into its feedforward and multi-head attention mechanisms. The authors propose a new dynamic halting mechanism that simplifies the original approach while enhancing performance. Experimental results indicate that SUT achieves better translation quality, improved compositional generalization, and favorable computational trade-offs across various benchmarks, including WMT 14 English-German.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The SUT architecture is well-motivated and technically sound, effectively combining the efficiency of Transformers with the recurrence of Universal Transformers.
- The new dynamic halting mechanism simplifies the original method and improves performance.
- The paper provides a comprehensive overview of related work and tests against numerous baselines, demonstrating a breadth of experimental methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of contributions related to SMoE and MIM loss is questionable, as they heavily rely on prior work.
- The experimental evaluation lacks thoroughness, particularly in assessing compositional generalization across major datasets.
- Clarity in method descriptions is insufficient, leading to potential confusion regarding the novelty and implementation of the proposed techniques.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of method descriptions, particularly regarding the SMoE and MIM loss, by providing more context and definitions for all variable names used. Additionally, we suggest conducting a more comprehensive evaluation on major datasets for compositional generalization, such as COGS, SCAN, and PCFG, to substantiate claims of improved performance. It would also be beneficial to include standard errors in the reported measurements to clarify the significance of the results, especially in the ablation studies. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the scaling laws for SUT to better understand its performance relative to other Transformer architectures.
