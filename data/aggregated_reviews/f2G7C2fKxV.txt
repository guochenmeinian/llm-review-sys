### Key Points
This paper discusses concerns regarding the usage of large language models (LLMs) in peer reviews and critiques current detection methods, proposing an alternative approach based on semantic comparison. The authors argue that this topic is crucial as LLM usage increases in academic publishing. They present a method that compares the semantic similarity of a given review to an AI-generated review for the same paper, achieving over 95% true positive rate (TPR) with GPT-4o generated reviews, significantly outperforming existing classifiers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors make a compelling case for researching LLM usage in peer reviews and provide a well-written, accessible paper.
- The proposed method demonstrates superior performance in detecting AI-generated reviews compared to state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks novelty, as the proposed method is straightforward and requires more experimental validation across different datasets.
- There is insufficient depth in the analysis of results, and the methodology section needs clarification regarding train/test splits and dataset limitations.
- The use of cosine similarity is questioned, and alternative metrics should be considered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the methodology section by providing details on train/test splits, dataset size, and whether the classifiers were trained on the AI review dataset. Additionally, clarifying the dataset's limitations and providing an example for anchor embeddings would enhance understanding. We suggest exploring clustering algorithms and demonstrating a t-SNE plot to uncover data structures related to the proposed approach. Lastly, addressing potential biases in LLM-based detection models, especially concerning non-native English speakers, would strengthen the paper.
