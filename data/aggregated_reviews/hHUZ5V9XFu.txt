Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Equivariant Flow-Matching (EquiFM) for generating 3D molecules, enhancing both categorical features (atom types) and continuous features (atom coordinates). The authors address limitations of diffusion models, such as instability and sampling inefficiencies, by employing a flow-matching objective to stabilize generative paths for atom coordinates. The model introduces a hybrid generative path for different modalities in atomic feature space and utilizes an efficient ODE solver for improved inference speed, achieving up to a 7% higher validity rate for large biomolecules and an average speed-up of 4.75x.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Equivariant Optimal Transport (EOT) minimizes straight-line distances between paired atoms across all rotations, enhancing robustness.
- The EOT-based training objective is invariant to initial translations and rotations, improving model stability.
- The iterative algorithm for obtaining the EOT map is based on established techniques (Hungarian and Kabsch algorithms), enhancing efficacy.
- The unique alignment of information quantity changes in probability paths improves joint variable modeling.

Weaknesses:
- The use of Hungarian and Kabsch algorithms may introduce computational overhead, affecting efficiency.
- Independent probability paths for variables may overlook certain relationships or interactions.
- The paper assumes prior knowledge, using numerous technical terms and formulas that may alienate broader audiences, such as computational chemists.
- A single rotation matrix for all alignments could miss nuanced differences in complex datasets.
- The model's complexity may hinder implementation on limited computational resources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the following points:
- Provide a thorough discussion on the computational complexity of the EquiFM model and its scalability with increasing molecule size.
- Include performance evaluations on datasets with varying distribution characteristics, such as MOSES, to assess generalization capabilities.
- Discuss the chemical feasibility and synthetic accessibility of generated molecules, potentially using tools like RDKit for synthetic accessibility metrics.
- Clarify the hyperparameter configuration process and its potential impact on results.
- Evaluate model performance using additional metrics, such as novelty and drug-likeness.
- Offer detailed information on the hardware used for training and inference, including GPU model and RAM specifications.
- Elaborate on the methodology behind the reported 4.75x speedup, specifying the baseline model used for comparison.
- Address the limitations discussed in the reviews, particularly regarding the narrow scope of references and baseline metrics, and include a discussion on related works to enhance completeness.
