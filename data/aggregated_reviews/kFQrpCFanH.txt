### Key Points
This paper presents a framework called Dynosaur, which extends instruction-tuned datasets using ChatGPT prompting and data from the Huggingface Datasets Platform. Dynosaur enables faster, cheaper, and higher-quality generation of large-scale instruction-tuned datasets compared to existing methods like Alpaca and Self-Instruct. The authors demonstrate that combining Dynosaur with other instruction-tuning datasets, such as SuperNI, leads to performance improvements, although it still lags behind carefully curated datasets. The study includes thorough evaluations, revealing high correctness levels in the generated data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduces an innovative approach for automatic instruction-tuning data generation.
- Comprehensive evaluations, both automatic and human, support the claims of high correctness.
- The low cost of dataset generation (approximately $12) is a significant advantage.

Weaknesses:
- Writing quality requires improvement, with minor grammar issues and unclear sentences.
- The continual learning section appears rushed and detracts from more critical error analysis and dataset descriptions.
- Experimental results lack convincing comparisons with baseline datasets, raising concerns about the reliability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing quality by addressing grammatical errors and clarifying confusing sentences. The introduction should be more concise, clearly outlining contributions. We suggest minimizing the continual learning section to allow for a more detailed error analysis of the data augmentation. Additionally, we encourage the authors to provide more robust comparisons with baseline datasets like SNI and T0 to strengthen their claims regarding Dynosaur's effectiveness.
