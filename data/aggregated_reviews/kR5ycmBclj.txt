Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NuTrea, a graph neural network (GNN) model designed for Multi-hop Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA). It extends the path-search framework of ReaRev by incorporating bi-directional information to enhance the search for answer nodes, emphasizing the importance of aligning KG paths with question semantics. The model incorporates a tree search scheme to enhance the exploration of knowledge graph contexts through three steps: expansion, backup, and node ranking. Additionally, it introduces the Relation Frequency-Inverse Entity Frequency (RF-IEF) node embedding method, which aims to better characterize ambiguous KG nodes. The effectiveness of NuTrea's Backup module is highlighted through performance comparisons, showing superior results over deeper versions of ReaRev and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on the WebQSP and CWQ datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a tree-search-based GNN method with backup propagation is both intuitive and novel.
- NuTrea is the first to incorporate bi-directional information into KG path-search, enriching the context for searching answer nodes.
- The RF-IEF node embedding method, inspired by TF-IDF, is innovative and shows experimental effectiveness.
- Extensive experiments, including incomplete KG settings, ablation studies, and comparative analyses, are well-executed.
- The empirical results indicate that the Backup module is effective and efficient, outperforming deeper models of ReaRev in handling bi-directional information.

Weaknesses:
- The enhancement over the leading benchmark, ReaRev, is marginal, particularly on the CWQ dataset, and the progress is limited in incomplete KG scenarios.
- There is a lack of detailed comparative analysis with ReaRev, which also employs breadth-first search for adaptive reasoning.
- The paper does not adequately compare NuTrea with other methods that have shown superior results, such as DECAF.
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with unclear explanations regarding model parameters and the backup step's distinctiveness from previous models.
- The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion on the implications of the findings and the limitations of the current approach.
- There is a lack of exploration into how the bi-directional information specifically enhances reasoning capabilities compared to traditional methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis with ReaRev, particularly regarding how the proposed tree search method offers advantages over it. Additionally, the authors should consider including performance evaluations of NuTrea against other node embedding methods, such as PyTorch-BigGraph, to better assess the effectiveness of RF-IEF. It would also be beneficial to conduct experiments on subsets of questions involving "pronouns" and/or encrypted entity names to validate claims about the RF-IEF method. Furthermore, we suggest improving the discussion on the implications of their findings and addressing the limitations of their approach. Clarifying the model's parameter discussions and enhancing the writing quality will strengthen the paper. Lastly, we suggest providing a theoretical analysis of the backup mechanism and its implications for performance, as well as exploring how the incorporation of bi-directional information enhances reasoning capabilities in comparison to existing methods.
