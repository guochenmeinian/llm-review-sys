Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for capturing spatial and temporal correlations in multivariate time series forecasting, enhancing model interpretability. The authors propose a method that bypasses the traditional two-stage learning process, directly generating dynamic structures using a structured matrix basis parameterized through singular value decomposition (SVD). The method aims to address the limitations of existing models, which often struggle with dynamic spatial correlations and high variability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method effectively overcomes limitations of existing models by bypassing the two-stage learning process.
2. The model's interpretability offers users greater insights, enhancing the reliability of results.
3. The paper addresses various traditional time series forecasting limitations and is well-organized theoretically.
4. The dynamic generation of spatial structure is novel and practically valuable.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of implementing the model due to structured matrix bases and SVD may lead to a steep learning curve. The appendix's results for datasets other than Electricity need clarification.
2. The performance gain observed is marginal, raising questions about practical implications and the effect of hyperparameters. The relation to switching dynamic systems and the significance of the dynamic spatial structure require further discussion and empirical comparison.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the practical implications of the observed performance gains and examine the effect of hyperparameters by adding statistics over different random seeds. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the relation to switching dynamic systems and conducting experimental comparisons. Clarifying the computational cost differences in the ablation studies and providing error bars in the results will strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, addressing the limitations and potential societal impacts of the work in more detail would enhance the overall quality of the manuscript.
