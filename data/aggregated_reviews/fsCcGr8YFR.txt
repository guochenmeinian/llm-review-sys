Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for large-scale scene reconstruction and rendering using NeRF, which learns a mesh representation by optimizing vertex positions and neural features through volume rendering. The authors propose dividing the scene into blocks, training a NeRF for each, and utilizing a hierarchical representation with Level-of-Details for efficient rendering. The integration with Unreal Engine allows for interactive rendering and scene composition, demonstrating improved accuracy and speed compared to baselines like instant-ngp, urban-NeRF, and NeRF-w. Additionally, the paper includes comparative experiments with Mega-NeRF on public datasets, addressing suggestions made by reviewers and highlighting remarkable outcomes with UE4-NeRF.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The pipeline for optimizing a mesh representation with volume rendering is technically sound, achieving better accuracy and rendering speed than baseline methods.
- The introduction of techniques to enhance rendering efficiency and quality, such as alpha thresholds and pseudo-depth, is commendable.
- Inclusion of additional comparative experiments enhances the paper's robustness.
- Demonstrated remarkable outcomes with UE4-NeRF.

Weaknesses:
- The overall pipeline resembles that of MobileNeRF, raising questions about the distinctiveness of the proposed method.
- The presentation lacks clarity, with several technical details missing or inconsistent, making it difficult to follow.
- The evaluation is limited to a single dataset, hindering the assessment of general performance.
- The review does not specify any weaknesses or areas needing improvement for the additional experiments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the differences between their method and MobileNeRF, particularly regarding the representation and blockwise training. It would be beneficial to include a validation study comparing their method against MobileNeRF on standard benchmarks like NeRF synthetic and LLFF. Additionally, more details on handling overlaps between blocks and the choice of threshold in Equation 5 should be provided. The authors should also address the opacity calculation in Line 222 and consider revising the title to better reflect the focus on large-scale reconstructions rather than Unreal Engine integration. Furthermore, we recommend improving the clarity of the discussion regarding the outcomes of UE4-NeRF and ensuring that all relevant comparisons are thoroughly detailed. Finally, enhancing the clarity of the writing and ensuring consistent terminology throughout the paper would improve comprehension.
