Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GeoNLF, a novel approach to pose-free large-scale point-cloud registration (PCR) and LiDAR novel view synthesis (NVS). The authors propose a hybrid strategy that combines robust ICP with global optimization of a Neural LIDAR Field (NeLF), introducing a selective reweighting strategy and new geometric losses. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pose estimation and NVS across two datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing clear insights into the optimization procedure.
2. The combination of geometric-based ICP and direct NeRF optimization is novel, with informative figures (e.g., Fig. 3 and Fig. 4) illustrating the optimization process.
3. The experimental results are promising, showing significant improvements over relevant baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The complexity of the proposed approach, with numerous building blocks, raises concerns about its practicality. Additionally, most components, except for the geometric optimizer, yield minimal improvements (as noted in Tab. 3).
2. The optimization time is not discussed; a runtime comparison and analysis would be beneficial.
3. The initialization for LIDAR pose optimization is not adequately addressed, as it relies on perturbed ground truth rather than a truly random starting point.
4. The motivation for the necessity of this approach is unclear, particularly regarding the unrealistic assumption of obtaining sparse LIDAR scans without GPS or odometry.
5. The paper lacks consideration of additional pose registration metrics, such as Inlier Ratio and Feature Matching Recall, complicating comparisons with prior work.
6. Clarification is needed on how inlier/outlier status is determined and how normals are computed, as these details impact reproducibility and gradient backpropagation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section to ensure a better understanding of the proposed method. Specifically, please provide an intuitive explanation for the dropping of the "J" term in Eq. 5 and clarify the use of variables such as P and I across different equations. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on how normals are computed and how inlier/outlier statuses are determined to enhance reproducibility. It would also be beneficial to address the initialization process for LIDAR pose optimization and provide a runtime analysis of the optimization. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the motivation for simulating LIDAR data in a Neural Field and its potential applications in the introduction.
