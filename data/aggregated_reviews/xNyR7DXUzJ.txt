Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to improve Monte Carlo path tracing in real-time applications by utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive sampling and a latent space representation to enhance spatiotemporal information reuse. The proposed framework integrates a sampling importance network and a denoiser, achieving strong performance in terms of quality and latency trade-offs across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly presents the problem and motivation.
- The proposed framework demonstrates strong performance, yielding higher PSNR values compared to previous methods while addressing noise and temporal stability.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is unclear, as it appears to combine existing techniques without sufficient differentiation from prior works.
- There is a lack of detailed discussion on the differences between the proposed method and previous approaches, making it difficult to assess its contribution.
- Evaluation is limited to a small number of scenes, and additional images for qualitative comparison would enhance understanding.
- The inference time and memory consumption comparisons with previous works are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty by explicitly discussing the differences between their method and existing techniques. Additionally, providing a larger scale evaluation with diverse scenes would strengthen the empirical validation of the results. Including a limitations section that addresses potential higher inference times and memory consumption would also be beneficial. Finally, clarifying the dataset details and the training process, as well as visualizing key concepts, would enhance the overall presentation and understanding of the work.
