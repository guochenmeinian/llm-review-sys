### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation of emotion arcs, focusing on how emotions change over time using Lexicon-Only (LexO) and Machine-Learning (ML) approaches. The authors systematically assess automatically generated emotion arcs across 42 diverse datasets in 9 languages, including less-resourced languages through automatic translations of English emotion lexicons. The main contributions include a comparative analysis of the two methods and the promise to release data and code for generating high-quality emotion arcs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers original contributions to the evaluation of emotion arcs, a relatively underexplored area.
- It provides a comparative analysis demonstrating the strengths of LexO methods in generating high-quality emotion arcs.
- The systematic evaluation across diverse datasets enhances the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The paper suffers from weak presentation and clarity, making it challenging for readers to grasp the research methods and findings.
- There is insufficient detail regarding the evaluation of different datasets and the results obtained.
- The evaluation metrics used, such as correlation and RMSE, lack adequate discussion regarding their significance in the context of emotion arcs.
- A thorough quality analysis of the experiments is missing, raising concerns about the reliability of the results.
- Limited discussion on language variations and the impact of out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms is provided, which may affect the understanding of emotion lexicons across cultures.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper to enhance reader comprehension. Including illustrative examples and a diagram to depict the process of constructing emotion arcs would be beneficial. Additionally, a more thorough justification for the choice of evaluation metrics and bin sizes is necessary. We suggest conducting further experiments to substantiate the quality of emotion arcs generated by both LexO and ML approaches. A detailed analysis of the impact of OOV terms and the accuracy of translated emotion lexicons should also be included to strengthen the paper's insights.
