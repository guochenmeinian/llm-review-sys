### Key Points
This paper presents the Distributionally Robust Graph model for out-of-distribution (OOD) recommendation (DRGO), which enhances the robustness of graph-based recommendation systems against noisy data. The authors propose a denoising diffusion model to reduce noise in the latent space and introduce an entropy regularization term for robust optimization. Additionally, they replace the Kullback-Leibler divergence with Sinkhorn distance to effectively handle non-overlapping distributions. The effectiveness of DRGO is validated through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and distribution shifts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO) with diffusion models to address noisy data is a valuable contribution.
2. The theoretical analysis, including generalization error and noise reduction proofs, enhances the credibility of DRGO.
3. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the model's effectiveness across various datasets and distribution shifts.

Weaknesses:
1. The explanation of Sinkhorn DRO is limited, making its application within the model unclear; a more detailed description is needed.
2. The combination of diffusion models and variational graph autoencoders (VGAE) may confuse readers due to their differing theoretical foundations; clarification of their respective roles is necessary.
3. The sampling strategies for OOD and IID are not well explained, requiring further detail for better understanding.
4. The robustness and sensitivity of hyperparameters, such as the number of clusters and centrality threshold, need more discussion, as they may affect performance variability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the Sinkhorn DRO explanation in Section 3.1 to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the roles of VGAE and diffusion modeling to avoid confusion regarding their integration. A comparison with the classic $ \textrm{DiffRec}^{[1]}$ would better highlight the advantages of DRGO. Furthermore, providing a more detailed explanation of the sampling strategies for OOD and IID would aid reader comprehension. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the hyperparameters' robustness and sensitivity is essential to address potential performance variability.
