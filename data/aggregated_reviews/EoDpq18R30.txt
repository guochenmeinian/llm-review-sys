Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of network embedding, introducing two critical properties: discrimination and monotonicity. The authors argue for their importance and illustrate them with examples. They propose a general framework for network embedding algorithms, derive results regarding these properties, and demonstrate that while both can be satisfied with infinite data, they cannot be simultaneously satisfied with finite datasets. The authors derive an optimal expression for node similarity and present the SENSEI embedding procedure, which aims to satisfy both properties to some extent. Empirical results on four real-world datasets indicate that SENSEI outperforms existing methods in link prediction and node recommendation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem addressed is broad, allowing for the reevaluation of many previous works.
- The writing is clear, and the organization of sections is effective.
- Experiments are thorough, featuring ablation tests, multiple baselines, and diverse datasets.
- The discussion of limitations in light of findings (Thm.2) is insightful.

Weaknesses:
- Illustrations, particularly Fig.1, could be enhanced for clarity, as some elements are not well-defined and the figure does not utilize full page width.
- Key terms like "large" and "small" values of p and s should be explicitly defined earlier in the text.
- All demonstrations are relegated to the appendix, making the main text less self-sufficient; key proofs should be included.
- The generality of results is questionable, as the proposed properties are closely tied to specific tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of illustrations, particularly by defining gray bars and the symbolic representation of p(u|v) more explicitly. Additionally, we suggest that the authors define "large" and "small" values of p and s earlier in the text to enhance understanding. Key proofs for Th.1 and Prop.1 should be included in the main text to ensure self-sufficiency. Furthermore, we advise moving the discussion of limitations to the main paper for better accessibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the relationship between the SENSEI approach and its performance on link prediction versus node recommendation tasks.
