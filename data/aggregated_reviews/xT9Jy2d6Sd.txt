Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an enhancement to conversational recommender systems by integrating the Expected Value of Information (EVOI) with bandit learning. The authors propose two key modules: gradient-based EVOI and smoothed key term contexts, resulting in two new algorithms, ConTS-EVOI and ConUCB-EVOI. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of these methods in optimizing query selection and addressing computational challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and logically clear.
- The integration of gradient-based EVOI with conversational bandits effectively addresses computational challenges and improves recommendation efficiency.
- The authors provide rigorous theoretical analysis, demonstrating tighter regret bounds compared to standard methods.
- The evaluation on both synthetic and real-world datasets supports the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed improvements appear independent of the conversational recommender systems context, particularly the gradient-based EVOI, which lacks specific design for CRS.
- The motivation for the proposed methods is unclear, especially regarding the computational limitations of conventional EVOI.
- The paper does not provide a systemic analysis of overarching issues in current bandit methods, making the contribution seem incremental.
- The choice of hyperparameters, such as the learning rate, is not justified, and the impact of variations is unexplored.
- The assumption of a linear reward structure may limit the applicability of the approach in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation behind their proposed methods, providing evidence or real-world data to substantiate claims about the limitations of conventional EVOI. Additionally, a more systemic analysis of current conversational bandit approaches should be included to enhance the perceived contribution of the work. We suggest that the authors justify their choice of hyperparameters and explore the effects of variations on performance. Furthermore, addressing the potential risks of introducing irrelevant queries through random perturbation and discussing scalability and robustness concerns in large-scale applications would add value to the paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to evaluate their methods on datasets that reflect natural conversational needs to strengthen their findings.
