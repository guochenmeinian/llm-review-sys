### Key Points
This paper evaluates classifiers for detecting erroneously recognized text from Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) models applied to Byzantine Greek texts spanning the 10th to 16th centuries. The authors demonstrate that Transformer-based classifiers, particularly BERT, outperform others in this task, revealing performance variations based on the century of the text. This finding suggests that language models are sensitive to historical language changes, indicating the necessity of including data from various periods in HTR training.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents a thorough analysis of the dataset and error patterns.
- It introduces a novel temporal perspective by examining century-based performance differences.
- The study contributes significantly to the Digital Humanities, particularly in the context of Byzantine texts.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a coherent narrative, making it difficult to follow some arguments without re-reading.
- The dataset is relatively small (~2k samples), raising concerns about the significance of the findings.
- There is a perceived lack of novelty, although the approach's usefulness in a new context compensates for this.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's narrative to enhance argument flow and substantiation of claims. Additionally, conducting an explicit ablation study could provide further insights into the generalizability of the findings. The authors should also consider including a qualitative analysis of error types to better understand their implications for the post-correction process. Furthermore, addressing the impact of historical language changes on model performance in more detail would strengthen the paper. Lastly, expanding the dataset or comparing the approach with baseline methods in the literature would enhance the robustness of the study.
