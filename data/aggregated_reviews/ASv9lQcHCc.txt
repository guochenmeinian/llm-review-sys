Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GoMatching, an efficient baseline for video text spotting that enhances tracking through a novel Long-Short Term Matching (LST-Matcher) module. The authors propose a method that leverages a query-based image text spotter, adapting it for video datasets while maintaining robust recognition performance. GoMatching sets new performance benchmarks on multiple datasets, including ICDAR15-video, DSText, BOVText, and introduces the ArTVideo test set for evaluating arbitrary-shaped text.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method effectively extends an image text-spotting mechanism to video text spotting.
2. It introduces a rescoring mechanism to bridge the domain gap between image and video datasets.
3. The LST-Matcher enhances tracking capabilities through a long-short-term matching strategy.
4. The paper includes extensive experimental results demonstrating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an analysis of inference time, which could provide context compared to previous work (TransDETR).
2. The ablation study presents overly simplistic numerical comparisons without detailed analysis or visual results.
3. The methodology section is confusing, particularly regarding the domain gap and the rescoring mechanism's role.
4. There is insufficient discussion of limitations and how the proposed method addresses the initial claims regarding detection and recognition gaps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of inference time and compare it with previous works like TransDETR to provide a clearer context for their results. Additionally, the authors should enhance the ablation study by including more detailed analyses and visual comparisons of experimental results. Clarifying the methodology section, particularly the domain gap and the rescoring mechanism's function, would greatly benefit readers. Finally, a discussion of the limitations of the proposed method should be included to strengthen the overall contribution of the paper.
