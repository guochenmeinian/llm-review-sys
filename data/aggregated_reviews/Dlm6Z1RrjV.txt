Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical exploration of whether strategic agents can overcome uncertainty regarding the payoff structure in repeated interactions to achieve outcomes similar to those in a fully informed scenario. The authors focus on a Stackelberg Game involving two players, where one player is more informed than the other, represented by a precision parameter $p \in [0,1]$. The study investigates the pure Nash equilibria (PNE) of a meta-game where players select decision-making algorithms as their actions. The findings reveal that a perfectly informed player can consistently achieve her Stackelberg value, while the uninformed player may not, particularly when both players lack perfect information.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic is fundamental and relevant to the NeurIPS community.
2. The theoretical findings are clean, concise, and reveal novel insights into learning in strategic environments.
3. The paper is well-written, with clear notations, formal statements, and understandable interpretations of results.

Weaknesses:
1. The theoretical findings are somewhat detached from practical applications, limiting their real-world impact.
2. Some results require further clarification, particularly regarding the intertwining of learning and acting on learned knowledge.
3. The paper lacks a clear explanation of its technical novelty compared to existing work on no-regret learners.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their presentation, particularly by:
1. Providing more details on the relationship between learning and acting in Section 3.2, especially regarding the potential for the less-informed player to adopt the strategy of the informed player after initial rounds.
2. Offering further insight into the non-smooth transition in results when comparing $p_1 = 1$ and $p_1 < 1$ in Proposition 4.2.
3. Clearly articulating the paper's contributions to the existing body of work in game theory and strategic interactions.
4. Including references to related work on "Information asymmetry in repeated games" to enhance the literature context.
5. Correcting identified typos and ensuring that the definitions and conditions in theorems are clearly stated.
