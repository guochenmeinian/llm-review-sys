Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CROMA, a self-supervised representation learning framework for remote sensing and earth observation data that combines contrastive and reconstruction objectives to learn unimodal and multi-modal representations. The framework utilizes cross-modal contrastive learning and introduces X- and 2D-ALiBi to enhance performance by spatially biasing attention matrices. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of CROMA through extensive experiments across multiple datasets, showing its superiority over existing methods like SatMAE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The use of RPE with its 2D extension of ALiBi, particularly addressing the multi-resolution nature of remote sensing data.
- The framework's ability to perform well with a single modality, which is beneficial in scenarios where one satellite may not be available.
- A comprehensive range of experiments and ablation studies that validate the proposed approach's performance across various tasks and datasets.
- The introduction of a novel combination of existing techniques to tackle multi-modal learning in remote sensing.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty as the approach primarily combines existing techniques without significant theoretical innovation.
- Poor organization and clarity in presentation, making it difficult to follow the main contributions.
- Insufficient discussion of the relationship between positive and negative samples, and the rationale behind specific design choices.
- Lack of generalization to other problem domains beyond remote sensing, which could strengthen the work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the paper, particularly in the introduction and related work sections, to provide a more logical flow and clearer connections between CROMA and existing literature. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the novelty concerns by providing a more robust comparison with relevant baselines, such as a "SatMAE + contrastive learning" framework, and clarify the rationale behind the choice of sampling ratios for positive and negative samples. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the generalizability of their approach to other domains beyond remote sensing to enhance the paper's impact.
