### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for integrating AI model inference with smart contract execution in Web3 applications. The authors propose a system that separates deterministic smart contract code, which can mutate state on-chain, from non-deterministic model inference, executed off-chain on TEE providers. The technical quality of the implementation, including precompiled contracts and an attestation service, is sound. However, the utility of this approach in a decentralized context is questioned, particularly regarding the reliance on off-chain storage and the lack of verification for model output values.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposal introduces a novel framework for off-chain model inference.
- A prototype is developed and made available online, demonstrating efficiency compared to existing on-chain solutions.
- The paper is well-written and structured, providing clarity on its goals.

Weaknesses:
- The approach lacks a decentralization dimension, potentially scoring low in that aspect.
- There are concerns about the system's reliance on available storage services and the implications of TEE provider trustworthiness.
- The paper does not adequately address ethical considerations regarding the integration of energy-intensive technologies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the decentralization aspect of the SMART system, particularly how it compares to on-chain approaches that validate model inference outputs through consensus. Additionally, the authors should clarify the implications of off-chain storage reliability and provide a verification mechanism for model outputs to address potential security concerns. A more balanced discussion of related work, particularly on on-chain inference methods and their limitations, would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, addressing ethical implications of combining energy-intensive technologies is crucial for a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed system.
