Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents methods for estimating the Bayes error rate (BER) in multi-class classification, addressing both soft and noisy labels. The authors propose several Bayesian Error Rate estimators, including a median-of-means estimator for robustness against noise and outliers. Theoretical guarantees accompany the methods, and extensive empirical validation is provided through experiments on synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in machine learning, providing valuable insights into multi-class performance estimation.
- Theoretical results are comprehensive, covering various scenarios, including robust adaptations for noisy labels.
- The experimental section convincingly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methods compared to existing estimators.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues arise from poorly introduced definitions and notations, leading to potential confusion (e.g., the definition of Y and the notation $Y_{M:M}$).
- The denoising method in Eq. (11) relies on discrete features, which may limit its applicability.
- The experimental comparisons with other methods are insufficient, primarily focusing on synthetic datasets with limited hyperparameter choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions and notations throughout the paper, particularly in lines 76-78 and line 111. Additionally, a conclusion section should be added to summarize the findings and implications of the work. To enhance the robustness of the denoising method, consider extending it to accommodate continuous features. Finally, we suggest conducting more extensive experiments with diverse datasets to validate the proposed methods against a broader range of existing techniques.
