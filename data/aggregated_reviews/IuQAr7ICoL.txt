### Key Points
This paper presents PAGE, an innovative algorithm aimed at balancing personalization and generalization in Federated Learning (FL). The authors propose a game-theoretic approach that re-envisions the FL process as a cooperative competition between clients and a server, utilizing Markov decision processes and reinforcement learning to achieve equilibrium. The methodology is theoretically sound and supported by extensive experiments demonstrating significant improvements in both global and local prediction accuracy across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The integration of game theory and reinforcement learning represents a novel approach to addressing the balance between personalization and generalization in FL.
2. The paper provides a thorough evaluation of the PAGE algorithm, showcasing its effectiveness through comparisons with state-of-the-art FL methods.
3. The structure of the paper is well-organized, facilitating understanding despite some technical density.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks clarity in explaining complex concepts, particularly in the methodology and algorithm sections, making it challenging for some readers to follow.
2. There is insufficient information regarding the computational overhead of existing methods for proper comparison.
3. The balance between personalization and generalization requires further exploration and justification, as the current claims may not be adequately supported.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and readability of the methodology section, particularly in explaining the algorithm's implementation and the roles of different agents in the game. Additionally, we suggest including a high-level overview of the PAGE method to aid reader comprehension. The authors should provide a detailed discussion of the potential limitations and risks associated with PAGE, including its scalability in real-world applications. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct additional experiments to validate the robustness of PAGE across diverse scenarios and to compare it with related works that address similar challenges in FL. Lastly, we recommend including the overhead of current methods in Table 5 for a more comprehensive evaluation.
