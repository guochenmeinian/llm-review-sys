### Key Points
This paper presents an end-to-end framework for HDR image tone mapping that effectively combines global and local enhancements. The authors utilize the Laplacian pyramid decomposition technique to manage high-resolution HDR images, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and enhancement performance. Global tone manipulation is conducted on low-frequency images using 3D LUTs, while a learnable local Laplacian filter refines high-frequency components, preserving edge details. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods for both 480p and 4K resolutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of local learnable Laplacian filters with global tone mapping achieves new state-of-the-art results for tone mapping.
- The paper is well-organized, clearly explaining the limitations of existing methods and the proposed solution.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness and visual quality.

Weaknesses:
- Generalization to other datasets may require retraining.
- The paper lacks discussions and comparisons with several relevant methods published in the last five years.
- Evaluation metrics do not include TMQI, Fidelity, and Naturalness, which are common in tone mapping operator (TMO) literature.
- Some compared methods, such as CLUT, are not directly relevant to tone mapping, leading to potentially misleading comparisons.
- The paper does not thoroughly analyze computational complexity or runtime, nor does it discuss the limitations of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related methods to include a broader range of recent literature. Additionally, the evaluation metrics should incorporate TMQI, Fidelity, and Naturalness to provide a more comprehensive assessment of performance. The authors should clarify the distinction between TMO and low-light image enhancement in their framework and consider renaming the paper if necessary. We suggest evaluating the framework on more diverse datasets, including real-world photographs and video frames, to better understand its robustness. A detailed analysis of computational complexity and memory usage compared to existing methods would enhance the clarity of performance trade-offs. Finally, the authors should address the potential limitations of their method more thoroughly to inform future applications.
