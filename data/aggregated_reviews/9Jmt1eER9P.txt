Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for designing optimization algorithms using electric RLC circuits, demonstrating that the continuous-time dynamics of these circuits converge to the solutions of corresponding optimization problems. The authors propose a discretization scheme that generates convergent optimization algorithms, supported by theoretical guarantees and experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The novel perspective of using RLC circuits for optimization algorithm design is intriguing and offers a unified framework for various optimization problems.  
2. The authors provide theoretical convergence guarantees for both continuous-time dynamics and discrete-time algorithms.  
3. The paper is comprehensive and well-written, with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The novelty of interpreting optimization problems as RLC circuits is questionable, as this concept has been explored in prior works; more comparisons with existing literature are necessary.  
2. The main theorem appears to be a special case of the Willems stability condition, requiring further clarification of its connections to existing theories.  
3. The paper primarily focuses on strongly-convex settings, leaving the extension to general convex or nonconvex problems unclear.  
4. The convergence rate of the RLC-based algorithm is not adequately discussed, and the additional computational burden of discretization is a concern.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and introduction by specifying that their optimization algorithm design is primarily applicable to convex optimization problems. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough literature review to contextualize their contributions and clarify the relationship between their theorem and Willems' work. It would also be beneficial to discuss the implications of their approach for nonconvex problems and to analyze the convergence rate of their proposed algorithms. Finally, we encourage the authors to include specific examples of "proper" discretization methods in the main body of the paper.
