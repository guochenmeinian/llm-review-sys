Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AUTOGUIDE, a framework aimed at enhancing LLM agents' performance in unfamiliar domains by generating context-aware guidelines from offline experiences. The framework consists of two modules: a context identification module that abstracts the agent's state and a guideline extraction module that produces concise, context-specific guidelines. Evaluation results indicate that AUTOGUIDE significantly outperforms competitive baselines across various complex benchmarks, including real-world web navigation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The design of context-aware guidelines is ingenious, addressing a fundamental challenge in leveraging offline experiences for LLM agents.
2. The proposed framework demonstrates superior performance compared to competitive baselines in complex benchmarks.
3. The writing is clear, and the experimental results are promising, showcasing the method's advantages.

Weaknesses:
1. The advantages compared to related works appear contradictory, particularly regarding inter-task knowledge and context-aware guidelines. Clarification on the percentage of inter-task sharing context and guidelines is needed.
2. Analysis in section 4.2.Q1 is inconsistent with Table 1, creating confusion regarding the comparison of "ReAct+AutoGuide" and "ReAct+ExpeL."
3. There is a lack of explanation on the implementation of "AUTOGUIDE + Reflexion," which is only briefly mentioned.
4. The "Context Identification" module requires handcrafted context definitions per task, raising concerns about how the number of demonstrations might affect task performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the advantages discussed in relation to related works, particularly by providing details on inter-task sharing contexts and guidelines. Additionally, we suggest that the authors ensure consistency between the analysis in section 4.2.Q1 and Table 1. It would also be beneficial to include a detailed explanation of the "AUTOGUIDE + Reflexion" integration in the revised version. Finally, we encourage the authors to address the potential impact of the number of demonstrations on task performance in the context identification module.
