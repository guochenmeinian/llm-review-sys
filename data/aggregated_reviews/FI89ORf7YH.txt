Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Enhanced Core Reading Instruction (ECRI) dataset, a large-scale longitudinal dataset collected from 6,916 first graders and 172 teachers across 44 schools, aimed at predicting early childhood reading performance using advanced machine learning models. The main contributions include the introduction of a novel dataset, empirical evaluation of machine learning models, a self-supervised strategy (MaskMLP) to manage missing data, and the public availability of the dataset and code to foster further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a unique, large-scale dataset that addresses a critical need in early childhood education.
- Application of advanced machine learning techniques, particularly the innovative MaskMLP method for handling missing data.
- The research quality is high, with a well-documented methodology and clear presentation of results.

Weaknesses:
- Limited discussion on the potential negative impacts of using machine learning in education, particularly regarding biases and ethical implications.
- The analysis of demographic variables and their relationship to reading performance could be more comprehensive.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of the ethical and social implications of using machine learning in education, specifically addressing potential biases in the data and the impact of incorrect predictions. Additionally, we suggest expanding the analysis of demographic variables and reading performance predictors, including visualizations that illustrate these relationships. The authors should also consider conducting statistical tests to validate the performance advantages of MaskMLP compared to other models and explore feature importance using various algorithms, such as Random Forest, to provide a more robust analysis. Finally, converting the dataset into different machine-readable formats and hosting it in an open repository would enhance accessibility and usability.
