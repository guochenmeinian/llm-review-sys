### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to referring image segmentation, focusing on predicting pixel-level occlusion based on natural language descriptions. The authors propose a Joint Multi-stage Contextual Embedding Learning Network (JMCELN) that utilizes learnable context embedding for dynamic information storage and a Progressive Alignment Network (PAN) to correct prediction inconsistencies across stages. The paper demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on three referring segmentation datasets, addressing issues of static language reliance and error propagation. Additionally, a Long-Short Relation Awareness Network (LSRAN) is introduced to enhance object relationship modeling.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The JMCELN framework effectively updates context embeddings, improving multi-stage inference for referring image segmentation tasks.
- The PAN significantly reduces error propagation and enhances prediction consistency, with potential applicability to other visual tasks.
- Comprehensive validation on multiple datasets shows superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.
- The paper includes extensive ablation studies, reinforcing the importance of its proposed components.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of JMCELN compared to existing cascade frameworks is not sufficiently clarified.
- Performance improvements are inconsistent across datasets, raising questions about generalizability.
- The paper lacks extensive qualitative examples and a clear comparison with recent methods, such as PolyFormer.
- Certain sections require refinement for better readability and logical flow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how JMCELN differentiates from existing frameworks by providing a detailed comparison with related works. Additionally, conducting more extensive analysis and ablation studies on the Learnable Contextual Embedding (LCE) and PAN could enhance understanding of their effectiveness. To strengthen generalizability, the authors should explore performance across a wider range of datasets. We also suggest including visualizations of instances where the method does not perform as expected to identify limitations. Lastly, refining the writing for clarity and logical flow, particularly in the methods section, would enhance the paper's overall quality.
