### Key Points
This paper presents EfficientCAPER, a novel method for category-level articulated object pose estimation from input point clouds. The framework consists of two stages: first estimating the 6D pose of the free part, then transforming the input point cloud into canonical space to segment and regress the poses of constrained parts. Experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is simple yet efficient, as evidenced in Table 2.
- Transforming the input point cloud into canonical space is a straightforward approach not previously explored in the literature.
- The method shows superior performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks discussion of important related works such as CAPTRA and Ditto, which, while not directly comparable, are relevant.
- The writing quality is poor, hindering the understanding of the paper's contributions.
- The results in Table 3 regarding robustness against self-occlusion do not clarify the conditions under which high occlusion rates (80-100%) occur, nor do they provide qualitative samples.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related works, specifically addressing the differences between EfficientCAPER and methods like CAPTRA and Ditto. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the clarity of the writing to better convey the contributions of the paper. It would be beneficial to include qualitative samples of objects experiencing high self-occlusion rates and to clarify the specific cases leading to such occlusions. Furthermore, we recommend providing a clearer explanation of the method's efficiency, including a detailed discussion of running time and the metrics used in experiments to demonstrate the effect of articulation pose canonicalization. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct more ablation experiments to elucidate the key contributions to the observed improvements in performance.
