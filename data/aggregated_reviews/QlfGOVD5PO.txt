Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a convergence analysis of the actor-critic method using deep neural networks with multiple hidden layers, addressing challenges posed by infinite state spaces. The authors prove a bound on the approximation error for sample-based actor-critic learning, demonstrating convergence rates for both the actor and the critic. Specifically, the convergence rate for the mean squared error of the gradient of the value function and the $\mathcal{N}$ norm of the Q-function is established as $\tilde{O}(1/T^{1/2})$ with an additional error term $\epsilon^2 + O(1/m^{1/2})$. The authors propose modifications to existing lemmas to accommodate infinite dimensions, particularly in Lemmas B.1 and B.12, and emphasize the importance of Lipschitzness for the value function. They also clarify the probabilistic convergence statements, suggesting a more formal approach to convey high probability results. The paper aims to extend previous analyses that focused on linear representations and single hidden layer networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing quality is high, with clear communication of ideas and effective use of tables and figures.
- The paper addresses an important problem in reinforcement learning, enhancing understanding of actor-critic methods with deep neural networks.
- The convergence analysis is a significant theoretical contribution, particularly in allowing for arbitrary network depth.
- The authors provide a convincing response to reviewer concerns, particularly regarding the extension of results to infinite state spaces.
- The paper integrates established literature effectively, proposing a novel synthesis of techniques to analyze actor-critic convergence.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis overlooks key literature that challenges the convergence of critics using non-linear function approximators, potentially leading to divergence.
- The paper's reliance on existing works, particularly those of Tian et al. and Olshevsky et al., raises questions about the novelty of its contributions.
- Some sections, such as the discussion in Section 4.2, lack convincing arguments and formalization, and the treatment of limitations is insufficient.
- The presentation of the appendix is overly technical and lacks clarity, making it difficult for readers to navigate and understand the connections between lemmas and the main theorem.
- The informal language in probability statements may undermine the rigor expected in academic writing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by addressing the literature that contradicts the possibility of convergence with non-linear function approximators. Clarifying the implications of the Bellman iterations and potential error compounding would strengthen the argument. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the discussion in Section 4.2 to provide a more convincing rationale for the claims made. It would be beneficial to include a detailed comparison of actor-critic methods with single versus multiple hidden layers, highlighting specific challenges in proving convergence for each architecture. We also recommend improving the clarity of the appendix by providing a structured overview that highlights the relationships between lemmas and the main theorem. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors adopt a more formal tone in the probability statements, possibly by defining relevant events and articulating convergence results in a manner consistent with established literature, such as in Theorem 8 of Sun et al. [2019]. Finally, we advise the authors to clarify the motivation behind certain assumptions, such as Assumption 2.6, and to discuss the limitations of their approach more thoroughly, including the potential for relaxing assumptions.
