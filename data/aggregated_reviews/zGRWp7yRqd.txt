Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of local-search algorithms for the k-means clustering problem, aiming to develop a practical algorithm with a close to 9-approximation ratio. The authors propose a simple local search algorithm achieving a 10.48-approximation and a more complex variant that matches the lower bound of 9, while also demonstrating faster running times compared to previous work. The paper includes experimental results indicating the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in practice.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written, making the key ideas accessible.
2. The first algorithm effectively balances practicality with a strong theoretical guarantee, utilizing D^2-sampling in conjunction with multi-swap local search.
3. The experimental results show promising performance for the proposed algorithms.

Weaknesses:
1. The approximation ratio of 10.48's tightness is unclear, as is the ratio of 26.64 for the single swap version.
2. The experimental section lacks discussion on the running time of compared algorithms.
3. The complexity of the more advanced algorithm may hinder its practical application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the tightness of the approximation ratios, particularly for the 10.48 and 26.64 values. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion of the running times of the compared algorithms in the experimental section to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider presenting results with larger local search steps and on larger datasets to better assess the scalability and performance of the proposed algorithms.
