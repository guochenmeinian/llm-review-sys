Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called the Riemannian Exponential Augmented Lagrangian Method (REALM) for computing the projection robust Wasserstein (PRW) distance, reformulating the problem as an optimization task over the product of the Stiefel manifold and a subset of Euclidean space. The authors establish the global convergence of REALM and propose an inexact Riemannian Barzilai-Borwein method with Sinkhorn iteration (iRBBS) for solving subproblems, claiming that the complexity of iRBBS matches the best-known results in the literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes REALM and demonstrates its global convergence.
- The development of iRBBS and its derived iteration complexity is noteworthy.
- Numerical experiments indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Some mathematical details are lacking, such as the proof for the relationship in Line 115 and the gradient calculation in Line 124.
- The update for $\theta_t$ in Algorithm 2 appears to be missing.
- The paper could benefit from ablation studies to clarify claims regarding the performance of REALM compared to existing methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the mathematical rigor by providing proofs for key relationships and clarifying the gradient calculation. Additionally, please ensure that the update for $\theta_t$ is included in Algorithm 2. We suggest conducting ablation studies to substantiate claims about the performance of REALM, particularly regarding the definition of "too small" penalty parameters and the specific cases where REALM excels. Furthermore, addressing the writing quality and providing a systematic study to support claims of numerical stability would enhance the paper's clarity and impact.
