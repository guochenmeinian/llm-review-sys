Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a normative principle for the symmetric whitening problem, leading to an online adaptive algorithm that unifies previous works. The resulting algorithm operates as a single-layer network with interneurons and local learning rules, supported by mathematical findings and neuroscience evidence. The authors demonstrate the algorithm's performance on synthetic data and natural images, discussing potential improvements for biological realism.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a neural network solution to the whitening problem that adheres to biological plausibility through online operation and local weight updates.  
- It makes significant contributions to understanding how neuron populations coordinate responses, relevant to both neuroscience and machine learning.  
- The presentation is clear, and the technical evaluations substantiate the claims made.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing lacks clarity in some sections, with important details missing.  
- More numerical experiments are needed to fully assess the framework's performance.  
- The biological plausibility is questioned due to assumptions like linearity of neurons and symmetry in weights.  
- The current code shared does not provide comprehensive insights into the experiments conducted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by addressing specific details, such as changing line 83 to "... where $f_c(\mathbf{M}_c) = \text{Tr}(2 \mathbf{M}_c)$" and explicitly writing the intermediate steps for Equation (4) in the appendix. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of whitening matrix forms in experiments and providing a table of hyperparameters used in each experiment. It would be beneficial to feature and evaluate the more biologically plausible model prominently. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct numerical experiments for Algorithm 3 and analyze the effect of the hyperparameter $\alpha$. Finally, addressing the symmetry of E-I weights could enhance the model's biological relevance.
