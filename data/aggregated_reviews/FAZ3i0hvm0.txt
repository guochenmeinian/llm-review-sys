Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for data valuation that is designed to be privacy-preserving, specifically through a method for computing the data valuation of a point using its Shapley value for the k-nearest neighbors classifier (KNN) in a differentially-private manner. The authors propose a variant called threshold-based KNN (TKNN), which focuses on neighbors within a specified threshold to compute the Shapley value, enhancing robustness and computational efficiency. The paper includes an efficient algorithm for computing TKNN-Shapley in $O(N)$ runtime, leveraging counting queries on the full dataset $D$ to derive necessary quantities for individual data points in constant time. The authors clarify that the distinction between average and summation does not affect the rank of data value scores in the context of mislabeled/noisy data detection. They also introduce a differentially-private version of TKNN, demonstrating its effectiveness through thorough experiments across various datasets, showing that both non-private and differentially-private TKNN-Shapley outperform traditional KNN-Shapley methods. Additionally, the discussion on Joint Differential Privacy (JDP) and the privacy costs associated with their mechanism is thorough, explaining how their approach satisfies JDP while maintaining the same privacy parameter as previously established.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear explanations of Shapley values and KNN Shapley values.
- It provides a thorough analysis of privacy risks associated with KNN Shapley values and introduces a novel approach to mitigate these risks.
- The algorithm's efficiency is well-articulated, demonstrating a linear computational cost.
- The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the advantages of TKNN-Shapley in terms of efficiency and utility.
- The discussion on Joint DP and privacy guarantees is thorough and addresses reviewer concerns effectively.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a discussion on the limitations of KNN Shapley values compared to other Shapley value computation methods, particularly in high-dimensional data contexts.
- Key concepts like collusion resistance and joint differential privacy are not sufficiently defined or differentiated from traditional differential privacy.
- The paper does not adequately position its contributions relative to existing literature on privacy risks associated with Shapley values, notably missing a critical reference from a recent CCS conference.
- Some reviewers expressed a desire for more detailed explanations, particularly regarding Joint DP and privacy costs, indicating that certain concepts may not be fully accessible to all readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of KNN Shapley values, particularly in high-dimensional scenarios. Additionally, it is crucial to define collusion resistance and joint differential privacy in more depth, clarifying their distinctions from traditional differential privacy. The authors should also address the omission of relevant literature on privacy risks related to Shapley values, specifically commenting on the applicability of the attacks described in Luo et al. (2022) against Shapley values computed with DP-TKNN. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors provide a clearer motivation for the necessity of a differentially-private variant by including a simplified version of the membership inference attack in the main text and evaluating DP-TKNN-Shapley under this paradigm. Lastly, addressing the selection of the threshold in TKNN and clarifying the privacy costs associated with releasing Shapley scores would enhance the paper's clarity and impact. Expanding on the guarantees over the whole mechanism and providing more detailed explanations regarding Joint DP and privacy costs could further strengthen the paper's accessibility and impact.
