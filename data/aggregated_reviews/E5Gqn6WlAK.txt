### Key Points
This paper presents a method for dynamic debiased recommendation using a causal graph to analyze item- and time-level biases, employing the inverse propensity score (IPS) method extended to a doubly robust model. The authors aim to correct these biases and include a sensitivity analysis to address unmeasured confounders. The theoretical analysis and extensive experiments validate the proposed framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a robust theoretical analysis linking the proposed method to the ideal learning objective.
- It addresses both item and time-level biases effectively.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the framework's effectiveness, and open-source implementation supports reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as it largely reiterates existing techniques such as temporal IPS and sensitivity analysis.
- The improvement over existing baselines is modest, and the evaluation metrics are restricted to RMSE and MAE, lacking additional metrics like Recall, F1, and NDCG.
- Some experimental scenarios appear impractical for real-world applications, and the authors do not compare their method with stronger existing baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contribution by incorporating more recent models for debiasing and unobserved confounders. Additionally, the evaluation should include implicit feedback metrics, such as NDCG or Hit Rate, to substantiate claims of applicability to both explicit and implicit feedback. We also suggest that the authors compare their method against stronger baselines and consider more practical experimental scenarios. Lastly, clarifying the framework of CDTR and addressing layout issues in the paper would enhance readability.
