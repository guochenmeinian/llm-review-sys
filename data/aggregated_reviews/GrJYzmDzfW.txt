### Key Points
This paper presents a model for short video hate detection, termed MoRE (Mixture of Retrieval-augmented Multimodal Experts), utilizing multimodal inputs and an efficient end-to-end training approach. The model comprises three components: a Joint Multimodal Video Retriever for generating representations across text, audio, and visual modalities; Contextual Knowledge-Augmented Multimodal Experts that enhance modality-specific processing using the Bipolar Hateful Attention Network (BHAN); and a Sample-Sensitive Integration Network that adjusts modality contributions based on sample features. The end-to-end training optimizes both expert networks and the overall framework, improving computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance over state-of-the-art models across multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The model's comprehensive structure effectively adapts to evolving hateful content through contextual information and dynamic weight adjustments.
- The end-to-end training method enhances computational efficiency and allows for joint optimization.
- Extensive experiments validate the model's performance, achieving significant improvements in accuracy metrics.
- The approach addresses a significant societal issue, showcasing practical utility and strong empirical validation.

Weaknesses:
- Audio processing relies on text conversion, potentially neglecting audio-specific features; visual processing may miss frame-to-frame relationships.
- The paper lacks evidence that the end-to-end training does not adversely affect model performance compared to traditional methods.
- Some reported gains in ablation studies lack quantitative data representation, and certain baseline models are outdated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve audio processing by incorporating advanced noise reduction and normalization techniques to capture audio-specific features more effectively. Additionally, implementing noise filtering techniques in the retrieval process could mitigate the impact of irrelevant instances. The authors should also consider expanding the evaluation to include a broader range of datasets to enhance generalizability. Furthermore, providing quantitative data representation in ablation studies and updating baseline comparisons with more recent models would strengthen the analysis. Lastly, addressing potential biases in the model and discussing deployment challenges would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
