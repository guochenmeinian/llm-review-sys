Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two self-consistency methods for formalizing mathematical statements in natural language into Isabelle: symbolic equivalence and semantic consistency. Symbolic equivalence assesses the equivalence of formalized statements using Isabelleâ€™s automated theorem provers, while semantic consistency evaluates the similarity between the natural language translation of the formalized statement and its original meaning. The authors demonstrate that combining these methods enhances the success rate of the autoformalization process across various base models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a novel and significant topic in autoformalization, marking it as the first study on self-consistency methods in this context.
- The results indicate that self-consistency methods show great potential, as evidenced by increasing pass@k accuracy with more trials.
- The framework is well-structured, with clear writing and comprehensive evaluation across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The scope of the autoformalization is limited, as the symbolic equivalence method applies only to theorem statements, not proofs, which diminishes its significance.
- The semantic consistency method does not perform significantly better on its own, raising questions about the choice of BERT for embeddings and the rationale behind the formulae used for combining scores.
- The definition of $\tau$-semantic consistency lacks clarity and is not utilized elsewhere in the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Definition 1, simplifying it to better convey the concept of symbolic equivalence. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed explanation of the rationale behind the chosen formulae for combining semantic consistency scores. It would also be beneficial to explore the use of more advanced models than BERT for measuring embedding similarity and to clarify the average cluster size per problem in relation to symbolic equivalence. Lastly, we encourage the authors to specify how the standardization process aligns variables in Algorithm 1.
