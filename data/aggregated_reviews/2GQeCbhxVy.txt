Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of learning regularizers for inverse problems using a critic-based loss, focusing on gauges of star-shaped bodies. The authors provide theoretical insights into existence and uniqueness within frameworks based on Wasserstein distance and explore extensions to f-divergences. The study connects to existing literature on learned regularization by considering weakly convex regularizers. The authors also leverage tools from star geometry and dual Brunn-Minkowski theory to derive exact expressions for optimal regularizers and discuss neural network architectures that can yield such regularizers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework utilizing star bodies for interpretability in critic-based regularization, addressing significant theoretical gaps and opening new research directions. The rigorous problem setup and methodology contribute to a deeper understanding of data-driven regularizers.

Weaknesses:  
The focus on a specific class of regularizers and critic-based loss functions limits the generalizability of the results. The lack of experimental validation raises concerns about the practical implications of the theoretical findings, making it difficult for practitioners to assess the applicability of the proposed methods. Additionally, some results are complex and may not be easily accessible to a broader audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of complex results to engage a wider audience. Including empirical experiments to validate theoretical constructs would enhance the practical relevance of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest exploring the extension of results to other classes of regularizers and loss functions, as well as providing clearer articulation of the practical implications of the theoretical insights. Additionally, an overview of the paper's organization in the introduction would aid readability.
