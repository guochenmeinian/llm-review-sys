### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of gender biases in generative language models, specifically focusing on LLM-generated recommendation letters. The authors examine biases at lexical and stylistic levels, revealing that models like ChatGPT and Alpaca produce text with a more formal style and positive sentiment when referencing male individuals compared to females. The study highlights the ethical implications of using LLMs for generating recommendation letters, suggesting that such biases could adversely affect female applicants.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important issue regarding gender bias in LLM-generated reference letters, potentially sparking further research in this area.  
- It proposes a comprehensive evaluation framework with novel metrics, such as "language agency," to assess bias.  
- The findings regarding the correlation between hallucination and amplified bias are noteworthy.

Weaknesses:  
- The contribution is limited, primarily identifying the problem without offering insights or strategies to mitigate bias.  
- There is an over-reliance on off-the-shelf classifiers and datasets for measuring formality, sentiment, and agency, with insufficient details on their construction and performance.  
- The writing could be clearer, and some methodological aspects require further elaboration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the framing of the paper to emphasize the ethical concerns surrounding LLM-generated recommendation letters rather than promoting their use. Additionally, we suggest decoupling sentiment from style in the analysis and focusing on more stylistic elements to uncover further insights. Clarifying the dataset construction methodology, inter-rater agreement, and classifier performance metrics is essential for enhancing reproducibility. Lastly, we advise addressing the writing improvements noted by reviewers to enhance clarity and coherence.
