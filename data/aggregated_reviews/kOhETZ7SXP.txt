### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to employing machine learning techniques, specifically through the use of suitably chosen loss functions, to address deficiencies in the Yukawa sector of the Standard Model. The authors focus on the flavor sector, examining two examples of "beautiful" quark textures defined by uniformity and sparsity. They argue that their method is part of a broader effort to automate the learning of physical laws, emphasizing the determination of optimal model parameters while maintaining correctness. Overall, the work aims to quantify and enhance the "beauty" of physical models through optimization procedures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach is original and engaging, making the paper pleasant to read.  
- The results align well with experimental data, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.  
- The focus on quantifying "beauty" in physical models through distinct definitions is a notable contribution.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper may benefit from further elaboration on the implications of the chosen definitions of beauty and their impact on model performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the implications of the definitions of beauty (sparsity and uniformity) on model performance to provide deeper insights into their significance.
