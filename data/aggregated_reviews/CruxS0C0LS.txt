Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decentralized algorithm, PEDESTAL, for efficiently finding second-order stationary points in stochastic non-convex optimization. The authors establish theoretical guarantees indicating that PEDESTAL achieves convergence in \(\tilde{\mathcal{O}} (\epsilon^{-3} + \epsilon_H^{-5})\), which matches state-of-the-art results for first-order stationary points. The algorithm utilizes perturbed gradient descent and STORM techniques in a decentralized manner, requiring no coordination among nodes. Empirical results demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and presents a significant contribution to decentralized stochastic optimization, particularly regarding second-order optimality.
2. The proposed algorithm shows superior performance guarantees and outperforms existing algorithms in numerical experiments.
3. The integration of novel techniques from prior works is commendable and enhances the theoretical contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The stopping criteria require global synchronization, which may not be practical in decentralized settings.
2. The notation \(\tilde{O}(\cdot)\) is not clearly defined, leading to potential confusion.
3. The experimental results lack robustness, as they do not convincingly demonstrate the algorithm's ability to escape saddle points compared to baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation, particularly for \(\tilde{O}(\cdot)\), to ensure readers can follow the theoretical analysis. Additionally, the authors should clarify the termination criteria for the PEDESTAL algorithm, specifically how nodes determine if \(n/10\) satisfy the condition. To strengthen the empirical validation, we suggest including more complex datasets and providing a clear distinction between saddle points and local minima in the results. Finally, enhancing the discussion in Section 3.2.4 to better convey the intuition behind the decentralized implementation would significantly improve the paper's presentation.
