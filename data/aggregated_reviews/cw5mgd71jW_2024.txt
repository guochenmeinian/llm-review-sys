Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on many-shot jailbreaking (MSJ), a method that exploits the extended context capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by prefixing malicious requests with numerous demonstrations of undesirable behavior. The authors demonstrate that the effectiveness of MSJ follows a power law scaling with the number of demonstrations, significantly breaching safety guardrails compared to existing methods. The paper includes extensive experimental evaluations across various models and tasks, analyzes the scaling laws of harmful responses, and discusses potential mitigation strategies, highlighting their limitations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with clear motivation and extensive experimental evaluation.
- The analysis reveals the novel attack surface of jailbreaking prompts and provides valuable insights into the scaling laws of attack effectiveness.
- The work is comprehensive, addressing not only the effectiveness of MSJ but also discussing underlying patterns and potential defenses.

Weaknesses:
- Some experimental aspects could be improved, particularly regarding missing details and error bars in the reported negative log likelihood (NLL) of harmful answers.
- The paper lacks numeric results and tables, relying heavily on plots for visualization, which may hinder clarity.
- The experimental setup is not fully transparent, with proprietary models and insufficient detail on the evaluation algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their experimental details, including the number of samples used to estimate NLL and the standard deviation of these estimates. Additionally, providing numeric results alongside visualizations would enhance the paper's comprehensibility. We suggest that the authors explore the optimization of adversarial suffixes in the in-context setup to further strengthen their findings. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the MSJ method regarding its reliance on extensive demonstrations and potential filtering would provide a more balanced view of the attack's applicability.
