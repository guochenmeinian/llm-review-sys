Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the estimation bias and generalization error of expected calibration error (ECE) in binary classification. The authors provide an upper bound for total bias with an improved convergence rate, applicable to uniform mass and uniform width binning strategies. They also identify the optimal number of bins to minimize total bias and utilize the Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) framework to characterize ECE generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper achieves a tighter bound for total bias compared to previous works.  
2. It provides a comprehensive analysis of estimation bias in ECE, including upper bounds and optimal bin size choices for both UWB and UMB.  
3. Empirical results confirm that the derived bounds are non-vacuous, demonstrating sound theoretical results.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The analysis is limited to binary classification, which restricts its applicability.  
2. Some assumptions, such as Assumption 2, lack sufficient justification.  
3. The writing quality needs improvement, as several arguments are unclear or misleading.  
4. The results require Lipschitz continuity, which may not hold in deep learning models, and the convergence rates depend heavily on eCMI and fCMI measures, which are not clearly defined.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their writing, particularly in sections where arguments are unclear, such as in Lines 244 and 251-252. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more rigorous establishment of a minimax lower bound for the estimation bias that applies to all types of estimators, potentially using existing results from Tsybakov or Le Camâ€™s method. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the connection between Theorems 6 and 5 and discuss the practical implications of their bounds. Finally, we recommend considering synthetic settings where TCE, eCMI, and fCMI are analytically tractable to demonstrate the tightness of the bounds.
