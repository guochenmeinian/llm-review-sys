Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a stochastic optimal control approach to derive Doob's h-transform in infinite dimensions, establishing a connection between solving optimal control problems and learning diffusion generative models. The authors propose two methodologies for applying this derivation: one involving bridge matching with known marginals and another utilizing a network-parameterized h-transform for simulation. The approach is demonstrated through applications in image super-resolution and Bayesian inference tasks in function space.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents an interesting perspective on stochastic optimal control.
- The derivations appear correct, and the connection to optimal control is novel.
- The authors derive a Bayesian inference algorithm using a reference measure and test the method on simple examples.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of deriving Doob's h-transform in infinite dimensions is not clearly articulated, as similar derivations exist in prior literature.
- The motivation for using infinite-dimensional diffusion bridges is weak, and the experiments lack convincing results.
- The presentation is criticized for being more suited to a stochastic calculus journal than a machine learning conference, lacking clarity on the infinite-dimensional perspective's advantages.
- The experiments do not provide quantitative metrics like FID scores for super-resolution tasks, and comparisons to recent methods are insufficient.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction and list of contributions to clearly articulate how their work differs from existing literature, particularly regarding prior derivations of Doob's h-transform. Strengthening the motivation for infinite-dimensional diffusion bridges and enhancing the experimental validation with quantitative metrics and comparisons to state-of-the-art methods would significantly bolster the paper. Additionally, we suggest revising the presentation to better align with the expectations of a machine learning audience, ensuring clarity on the implications of the infinite-dimensional perspective.
