### Key Points
This paper presents a unified framework for time series anomaly detection called Dual-TF, which addresses the time-frequency granularity discrepancy by employing a nested time window approach. The authors propose a method that integrates both time-domain and frequency-domain analyses, utilizing bi-level sliding window techniques to enhance anomaly detection resolution. The paper includes extensive experiments to validate the proposed method against existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, clearly articulating the significance of the time-frequency granularity discrepancy in anomaly detection.
- It provides a comprehensive literature review and demonstrates improved performance through experiments on multiple datasets.
- The proposed methodology is well-formulated and addresses a relevant research problem.

Weaknesses:
- The necessity of the complex solution is unclear, as simpler methods in both domains exist. A baseline comparison is needed to validate the complexity's contribution.
- The paper does not adequately compare against all datasets in the recent benchmark TSB-UAD, leaving the advancement of the state of the art ambiguous.
- Parameter settings and their selection processes are not clearly defined, raising concerns about the fairness of comparisons.
- The presentation of results is disorganized, lacking consistency across metrics, which complicates pattern identification.
- The focus is predominantly on DNN solutions, with insufficient evaluation of data mining methodologies, which are relegated to the appendix.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the necessity of their complex solution by including baseline comparisons with simpler methods. Additionally, a more comprehensive evaluation against all datasets in the TSB-UAD benchmark is essential to substantiate claims of advancement. The authors should clarify parameter settings and ensure consistent comparison methodologies across all experiments. We suggest reorganizing the presentation of results to include all metrics in a unified manner for easier pattern identification. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand their evaluation of data mining methodologies beyond the appendix to provide a more balanced perspective.
