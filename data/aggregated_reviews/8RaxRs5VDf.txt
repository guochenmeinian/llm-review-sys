Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CoLLaM, a comprehensive Chinese legal benchmark consisting of 23 tasks and 13,650 questions sourced from existing datasets, the National Uniform Legal Profession Qualification Examination, and new expert annotations. The authors propose a Legal Cognitive Ability Taxonomy (LCAT) categorizing tasks into six levels: Memorization, Understanding, Logic Inference, Discrimination, Generation, and Ethics. The benchmark evaluates 38 large language models (LLMs), providing insights into their capabilities and limitations in the legal domain. Additionally, the authors conduct a manual evaluation of four generation tasks: Summary Generation, Judicial Analysis Generation, Legal Translation, and Open-ended Question Answering, collecting zero-shot outputs from six models, resulting in 1,200 query-answer pairs annotated three times, totaling 3,600 annotations. The annotation process involved three legal experts from China, with Kappa values indicating reliable annotations. The authors employed a 5-level pointwise scale for quality assessment and reported BERTScore, BARTScore, and ROUGE-L metrics, noting discrepancies between these metrics and human evaluations. They clarify that CoLLaM does not overlap with existing datasets LAiW or LawBench, although some overlap may occur due to the random sampling process, and they provide a detailed analysis of potential overlaps using exact matching and BERTScore to assess similarity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- CoLLaM integrates various data sources, enhancing the benchmark's reliability and relevance.
- The introduction of LCAT offers a structured approach to evaluating legal cognitive abilities.
- The dataset is extensive, allowing for a broad evaluation of LLMs in legal contexts.
- The use of legal experts for annotation enhances the quality and reliability of the evaluation.
- The comprehensive dataset includes diverse tasks and integrates real-world data, enriching the evaluation of LLMs.
- The authors provide a clear methodology for analyzing dataset overlaps, enhancing the credibility of their claims.

Weaknesses:
- There is significant overlap with the LawBench paper, necessitating clearer differentiation and discussion of task similarities and differences.
- The taxonomy lacks specificity to legal AI tasks, raising questions about its necessity compared to existing frameworks.
- The evaluation method for generation tasks relies solely on ROUGE, which may not adequately capture output quality.
- The correlation between automated metrics and human evaluations is not fully consistent, indicating limitations in the automated evaluation methods.
- Some critical areas in legal evaluation, such as ethical reasoning, are inadequately represented in existing datasets.
- The representation of newly annotated examples and the selection process for legal domains require further clarification.
- The response could benefit from more detailed explanations of the implications of the overlap findings.
- There is a lack of discussion on how the dataset can be utilized effectively in practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their contributions by explicitly detailing the overlap with LawBench and articulating what makes CoLLaM more comprehensive. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the taxonomy's relevance to legal AI tasks and providing a more detailed comparison with existing benchmarks. To strengthen the evaluation of generation tasks, we recommend incorporating advanced metrics such as BERTScore and including human evaluation results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the representativeness of the annotated examples and the selection process in Appendix C. We also recommend improving the automated evaluation methods to better align with human assessments, particularly in capturing nuanced aspects of legal reasoning. Additionally, consider expanding the dataset to include more tasks related to ethical reasoning and generative capabilities, ensuring a more comprehensive evaluation of LLMs in the legal domain. Finally, we suggest including practical examples or case studies demonstrating how CoLLaM can be effectively utilized in real-world legal applications.
