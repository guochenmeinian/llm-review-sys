### Key Points
This paper presents WONDERBREAD, the first benchmark specifically designed for evaluating multimodal foundation models in business process management (BPM) tasks beyond mere automation. It addresses critical gaps in BPM research by including a dataset of 2,928 human-annotated workflow demonstrations and introducing six novel BPM tasks that encompass documentation, knowledge transfer, and process improvement. The evaluation results indicate that while state-of-the-art foundation models excel at generating documentation, they struggle with validating workflow completion.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction effectively identifies significant gaps in BPM research, motivating the work.
- The benchmark introduces a human-annotated dataset that includes various BPM functions, providing a comprehensive assessment framework.
- Six novel BPM tasks are defined, with thorough evaluations against state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
- The benchmark relies on data sourced from only four websites, limiting the diversity and generalizability of findings.
- There is insufficient discussion on how model performance might scale with an increased number of training examples.
- The benchmark is based on narrow use cases that may not represent the full spectrum of business processes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the diversity of the dataset by incorporating a broader range of BPM scenarios to enhance generalizability. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed discussion on scalability analysis to address how model performance may change with more training examples. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide more information on the prompts used in baseline experiments, including challenges in prompt engineering and the potential benefits of parameter-efficient tuning to improve quality.
