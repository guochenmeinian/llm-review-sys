### Key Points
The paper presents a lightweight MedSAM utilizing post-training model quantization and other techniques, demonstrating improved performance over the baseline. However, it lacks clarity on various methodological aspects, including data augmentation specifics and model quantization details. The absence of validation scores in the abstract and ground truth segmentation results in evaluations further detracts from the paper's completeness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The proposed method shows better performance than the baseline.
- The paper is structured with sufficient sections providing detailed information.

**Weaknesses:**
- Formatting issues, such as missing ORCID IDs, incorrect table layouts, and inconsistent figure identifiers, undermine the presentation.
- Key methodological details, including the specifics of data augmentation, quantization processes, and the datasets used, are inadequately addressed.
- The paper lacks citations for several claims, diminishing its academic rigor.
- The improvements over the baseline are marginal, with no significant innovations presented.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest addressing the formatting issues by including ORCID IDs, correcting table layouts, and ensuring consistent figure identifiers. The description of post-training model quantization techniques should be expanded, and validation scores must be included in the abstract. We recommend adding ground truth segmentation results in section 4.3 for better evaluation. Additionally, clarity on the modalities oversampled, the augmentation ratios, and the calibration dataset used for fine-tuning the quantized model is essential. Lastly, we advise improving academic writing skills and ensuring all statements are properly cited.
