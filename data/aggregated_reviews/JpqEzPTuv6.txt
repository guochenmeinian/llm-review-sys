Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive empirical analysis of Partial-Label Learning (PLL) methods, identifying mini-batch PL purification as a key factor for achieving high performance. The authors propose a minimal working algorithm, StreamPurify, which simplifies the process of PLL by distilling critical success factors into an accessible design. The analysis covers various aspects of PLL, including training techniques and optimization processes, ultimately attributing the effectiveness of PLL methods to the transition from uniform to one-hot pseudo-labels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a detailed analysis and summary of developments in the PLL field, offering valuable insights for future research.
2. The proposed StreamPurify is simple yet effective, demonstrating improvements over previous methods across different benchmarks.
3. The writing is coherent and logical, facilitating understanding of the field's development and issues.

Weaknesses:
1. The definition and implementation details of mini-batch PL purification lack clarity, particularly regarding the impact of batch size.
2. The novelty of StreamPurify is questionable, as it appears similar to existing methods like CroSel, which may undermine its contribution.
3. The paper does not sufficiently discuss the limitations of the proposed principles or provide theoretical validation for the introduced algorithms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definition and implementation details of mini-batch PL purification, particularly its sensitivity to batch size. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the novelty of StreamPurify by clearly differentiating it from existing methods and providing a more robust theoretical foundation for their proposed principles. Including comparisons on real-world datasets and discussing the practical applicability of the introduced algorithms would also strengthen the paper.
