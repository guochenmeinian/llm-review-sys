Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents E2ENet, a 3D medical image segmentation model aimed at enhancing efficiency and performance. E2ENet employs Dynamic Sparse Feature Fusion (DSFF) for adaptive multi-scale feature integration and a Restricted Depth-Shift mechanism in 3D convolution to maintain low model complexity. Extensive experiments indicate that E2ENet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency, significantly lowering parameter count and FLOPs, particularly on large-scale datasets like AMOS-CT.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- Improved Efficiency: E2ENet significantly reduces parameter count and FLOPs, making it computationally efficient for resource-limited hardware without sacrificing performance.  
- Innovative Mechanisms: The DSFF and Restricted Depth-Shift effectively balance high accuracy with lower computational complexity, presenting a novel approach to 3D medical image segmentation.  
- Robust Validation: Extensive experiments across multiple challenging datasets demonstrate E2ENet's consistent performance, particularly exceeding nnUNet.

Weaknesses:  
- Unclear Backbone Network: The backbone network is ambiguously defined, leading to potential confusion regarding whether it is EfficientNet-based or a different CNN configuration.  
- Segmentation Performance and Kernel Size: The ablation study does not adequately address the suitability of the DSFF kernel size for the BraTS dataset, lacking results for a 3x3x3 kernel size.  
- Lack of Comparison with Recent Lightweight Networks: The absence of comparisons with contemporary lightweight networks limits the evaluation of E2ENet's performance relative to other efficient models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the backbone network description in Figure 2 and the corresponding text to explicitly define its architecture. Additionally, including results for the 3x3x3 kernel size in the ablation study for the BraTS dataset would enhance understanding of the DSFF mechanism's generalizability. Furthermore, we suggest incorporating comparisons with recent lightweight networks specifically designed for medical image analysis to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of E2ENet's performance.
