### Key Points
This paper presents a detailed methodology for handwritten text recognition (HTR) of Old Occitan, encompassing elaborate pre-processing methods, synthetic data generation, and the application of Transformer-based architectures. The authors propose using Swin Transformers and training language models from scratch, contributing novel insights to the field. The experimental design is meticulously planned, allowing for comparisons with various existing systems, which enhances the understanding of HTR for a low-resource language.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Careful experimental design and execution.
- Novel insights from the use of Swin Transformers and training language models from scratch.
- Comprehensive description of procedures and additional analysis in the appendix.
- Demonstrates that good results can be achieved with limited material for a low-resource language.

Weaknesses:
- The clarity of the CER graphs (violin plots) is lacking.
- Conventional methods were not given equal consideration in the experiments.
- The synthetic data generation process is somewhat counter-intuitive and could be improved.
- The scope of handwritten text is limited, focusing primarily on capital letters and two words per card.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of the CER graphs and ensure that conventional methods, such as CNN+LSTM, are included in the experimental analysis. Additionally, we suggest discussing negative results related to the synthetic data generation process to provide a more balanced view. Clarifying the novelty of the proposed techniques and comparing them with other augmentation methods would strengthen the paper. Finally, consider expanding the scope of the handwritten text to include more diverse documents.
