Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new metric, OOD-resistant Adversarial Robustness (OAR), for evaluating post-hoc explanation methods for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). OAR addresses the limitations of existing metrics by performing random perturbations on the complementary part of the explanation result, thereby mitigating the Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) issue. The authors introduce an OOD reweighting block that measures the OOD score of perturbed samples using the reconstruction loss of a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that OAR aligns more closely with ground truth explanations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses a critical issue in post-hoc explanation methods for GNNs, proposing an intuitive metric that mitigates issues present in previous methods.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed metric as a superior evaluation tool.
- The use of graph anomaly detection methods to measure OOD scores is innovative and effective.
- The paper is well-written and well-motivated.

Weaknesses:
- OAR's requirement for training on the original dataset complicates comparisons across different research groups and datasets.
- The simplified version, SimOAR, addresses some concerns but at the cost of significant performance degradation.
- The evaluation of only six backbone explanation methods limits the statistical overview; including more baselines and types of post-hoc methods would enhance comprehensiveness.
- The clarity of terms like "adversarial" and "attack" in OAR may be confusing, as the method does not involve adversarial training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the terminology used in OAR, particularly regarding "adversarial" and "attack." Additionally, the authors should provide a mathematical formulation for the metric RM to clarify its calculation. Expanding the evaluation to include more baseline methods and different types of post-hoc explanation techniques would provide a more comprehensive overview. Lastly, addressing the dependency of OAR on the quality of the VGAE and discussing its implications on performance would strengthen the paper.
