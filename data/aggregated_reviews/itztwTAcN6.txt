### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the growth rate of H-consistency bounds, which subsume excess risk bounds, for various smooth surrogate losses in binary and multiclass classification. The authors establish a tight square-root growth rate near zero for margin-based surrogate losses in binary classification and for comp-sum and constrained losses in multiclass classification, providing both upper and lower bounds under mild assumptions. The work also examines the impact of the number of classes on these bounds and the minimizability gaps.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a novel and solid analysis of H-consistency and excess error bounds, providing valuable guidance for selecting surrogate losses in classification tasks where the target loss is difficult to optimize. 
- It proves both upper and lower bounds for smooth surrogate losses, with fewer conditions than previous works, enhancing its contribution to the field. 
- The clarity of writing and organization aids comprehension, despite a somewhat dry presentation.

Weaknesses:  
- The analysis is limited to smooth surrogate losses, excluding piecewise linear losses like hinge loss, which are prevalent in machine learning applications. 
- The paper lacks intuitive explanations regarding the motivation and implications of the error bounds, as well as insights into the proofs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing a more intuitive statement on the motivation and implications of the error bounds. Additionally, offering insights on how these bounds assist in selecting surrogate functions would enhance the paper's practical relevance. Furthermore, addressing the necessity of the complete hypothesis class assumption and its implications for the growth rate would clarify potential limitations in practical applications.
