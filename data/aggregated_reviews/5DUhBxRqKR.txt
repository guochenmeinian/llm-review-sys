Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called D3 (Drilling Down into the Discourse) for long document question answering (LDQA), leveraging the inherent discourse structure to create a condensed representation for efficient processing. The authors propose techniques that summarize document sections, allowing a large language model (LLM) to identify relevant sections and retrieve fine-grained evidence. The method is evaluated on QASPER and HotpotQA, demonstrating competitive zero-shot performance while significantly reducing token usage. The approach is noted for its effectiveness in computational cost and maintaining state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant challenge in evidence retrieval from long documents, providing a systematic approach that utilizes discourse structure.
- It achieves competitive performance with fewer tokens processed, enhancing computational efficiency.
- The method is straightforward and easily generalizable, making it accessible for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The scalability of the proposed method is limited, particularly regarding its application in open-domain question answering setups.
- The impact of the summarization step using BART$_\textrm{large}$ on overall performance is not assessed, and there is a lack of error analysis to identify potential weaknesses.
- The reliance on document sections may restrict applicability to documents that lack such organization, raising questions about the method's generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the scalability of their method, particularly in adapting it for open-domain question answering scenarios. Additionally, we suggest conducting an error analysis to clarify where the proposed method may falter and assessing the impact of the summarization step on performance. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons based on end-to-end processing times and to address the limitations of using sections in documents. Lastly, we encourage the authors to highlight the main differences between their method and existing baselines in Section 4.
