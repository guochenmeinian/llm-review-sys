Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian policy reuse-based framework called Collaborative Bayesian Policy Reuse (CBPR), which enables collaborative artificial agents to adaptively select optimal policies from multiple networks. The authors extend intra-episode belief to collaborative scenarios, eliminating the need to model human behavior, making it suitable for human-AI tasks. Theoretical proofs demonstrate convergence with non-stationary humans and the establishment of optimal collaboration policies. Evaluations using the Overcooked game show that CBPR outperforms baseline methods, indicating the effectiveness of designing multiple agents.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The integration of intra-episode belief into traditional Bayesian policy reuse to develop CBPR is innovative and original. The authors provide strong theoretical proofs and extensive empirical results that validate the effectiveness of CBPR. The paper is well-structured and clearly written, enhancing the clarity and impact of the findings.

Weaknesses:  
The problem formulation and notations lack clarity, which may hinder understanding. The empirical results suggest only minor improvements, and ablation studies indicate that the parameter $\rho$ has minimal impact, which the authors do not adequately discuss. Additionally, the effectiveness of CBPR heavily relies on accurately predefined meta-tasks, limiting its applicability in complex environments.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem formulation and notations to enhance readability. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of the empirical results, particularly regarding the minor improvements and the role of $\rho$, would strengthen the paper. Testing CBPR in diverse and realistic domains beyond the Overcooked environment would further validate its applicability. Lastly, addressing how the framework handles unpredictable human behaviors and the implications of longer episode horizons would provide valuable insights.
