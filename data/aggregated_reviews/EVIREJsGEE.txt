### Key Points
This paper presents DecoupledRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that separates external knowledge from context to enhance inference efficiency and performance. The authors propose a method that pre-computes key-value (KV) vectors of documents and integrates them into the language model's internal computations. The framework employs a cross-attention mechanism to inject knowledge without altering model parameters, addressing issues related to long contexts and information loss. Experimental results demonstrate the method's effectiveness on LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B, although validation is limited to these models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework effectively addresses training efficiency and long-context issues, showcasing significant novelty and potential impact on the community.
2. The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with ample experimental support for its claims.
3. The authors have made their code available, promoting transparency and reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks experimental validation on a broader range of models and tasks, limiting the generalizability of the findings.
2. Storage efficiency is not discussed, raising concerns about the additional storage requirements for caching KV representations.
3. The complexity introduced by cross-attention and parameter decomposition may affect training and inference efficiency.
4. Missing experimental details, such as dataset statistics and ablation studies, hinder a comprehensive understanding of the framework's performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of DecoupledRAG by including experiments with a wider variety of model series and tasks to demonstrate its generalizability. Additionally, addressing the storage efficiency concerns and providing a comparison with Vanilla RAG regarding storage complexity would enhance the paper. We also suggest including more details on the datasets used and conducting ablation studies to clarify the necessity and replaceability of different components within DecoupledRAG. Finally, evaluating the inference speed and time complexity in comparison to baselines would provide valuable insights into the framework's efficiency.
