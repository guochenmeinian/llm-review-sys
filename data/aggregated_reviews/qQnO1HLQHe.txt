### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of the traditional complex query-answering task into an eventuality-centric complex query-answering task (CEQA) to enhance reasoning at the eventuality level. The authors propose two types of implicit constraints: occurrence constraints, which determine the occurrence of eventualities, and temporal constraints, which establish their order. A novel memory-enhanced query encoding method is introduced, utilizing a computational graph for encoding queries and a memory module for constraint information. The model demonstrates strong performance on a new dataset derived from ASER, with detailed code and dataset construction provided.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of the CEQA task is a significant advancement in modeling reasoning at the eventuality level, with interesting implicit logic constraints.
2. The memory-enhanced query encoding effectively updates query representations based on relevance.
3. The framework is validated against a new dataset, showing strong performance compared to multiple baselines, with comprehensive supplementary materials.

Weaknesses:
1. Clarity issues exist in several sections, particularly regarding the functions used for relation projection and intersection, and the relevance score in Equation 5.
2. The paper lacks exploration of answers without contradictions and does not sufficiently clarify abbreviations in Table 4.
3. The analysis of Table 4 is superficial, requiring more qualitative examples and an ablation study to demonstrate component contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in Section 3.1 by specifying the function used for relation projection and intersection operations. In Section 3.2, the relevance score for Equation 5 should be clearly defined, and the right part of Figure 4 needs further explanation. Additionally, we suggest testing the model on answers without contradictions and providing a more detailed analysis of Table 4 with qualitative examples. An ablation study should also be conducted to illustrate the contributions of each component effectively. Furthermore, consider discussing the ASER dataset and its construction earlier in the paper, as well as comparing CEQA with commonsense reasoning tasks in the Related Work section.
