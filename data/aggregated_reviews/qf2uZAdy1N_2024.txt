### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of representation learning for decision-making in episodic MDPs, focusing on statistical and algorithmic modularity. The authors define "statistical modularity" and prove both impossibility results and conditions under which it holds. They introduce "algorithmic modularity" through a meta-algorithm that balances representation learning with standard RL algorithms, proving a regret bound based on the quality of both the base MDP algorithm and the decoder. The theoretical findings aim to address critical challenges in reinforcement learning, particularly in high-dimensional observation scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is significant, and the introduction of statistical and algorithmic modularity is meaningful.  
- The theoretical results, especially regarding algorithmic modularity, are interesting and elegantly presented.  
- The paper provides solid theoretical foundations and proofs, contributing critical insights to the field of RL.  
- The presentation is clear and accessible, even for those outside the theory domain.  

Weaknesses:  
- The notation and terminology are dense, making comprehension challenging.  
- The paper lacks empirical evaluation, which could help illustrate the theoretical results.  
- The assumption that latent states can be uniquely decoded from observations is a strong claim.  
- Some theoretical results could benefit from more thorough discussion rather than a focus on numerous results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation and terminology to enhance understanding. Additionally, consider reducing the number of theoretical results in favor of more in-depth discussions, particularly regarding the self-predictive estimation idea. It would be beneficial to clarify the use of "latent states" and provide an intuitive definition of "decoder" earlier in the paper. Finally, we suggest incorporating simple empirical experiments to illustrate the theoretical findings and demonstrate their practical applicability.
