Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MotionGS, a novel approach for dynamic scene reconstruction that incorporates explicit motion priors into 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The authors propose an optical flow decoupling module to separate camera flow and motion flow, enhancing motion guidance during the deformation of 3D Gaussians. Additionally, an iterative camera pose refinement module is implemented to optimize both 3D Gaussians and camera poses, addressing inaccuracies in camera pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MotionGS outperforms state-of-the-art methods on datasets like NeRF-DS and HyperNeRF, achieving significant improvements in both qualitative and quantitative results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is clearly written and well-structured, making it easy to follow the problem definition, approach, implementation, and analysis.
2. The proposed method is innovative and straightforward, allowing for easy adoption and integration into existing systems.
3. Extensive experiments and detailed ablation studies robustly validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper does not analyze the time, memory, and storage costs associated with the proposed method, which are crucial for evaluating its practicality.
2. Details on the data sampling mechanism for training are missing, raising questions about the efficiency and feasibility of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of time, memory, and storage requirements to provide a clearer understanding of the computational burden imposed by the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest including details on the data sampling mechanism used for training to clarify how image pairs are selected, as this could significantly impact the overall efficiency of the approach.
