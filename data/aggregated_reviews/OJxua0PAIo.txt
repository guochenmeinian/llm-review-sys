Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on unconstrained (strongly)-monotone finite sum minimization problems, introducing a new algorithm called SEG-FFA. The authors propose that SEG-FFA runs stochastic extragradient (SEG) with potentially two different stepsizes, employs flip-flop shuffling per epoch, and initializes the next epoch using the average of the epoch initialization and the last iterate. They demonstrate convergence rates of $\tilde{\mathcal O}(1/K^{1/3})$ for the monotone case and $\mathcal O(\exp{(-\mu K^\epsilon)\Vert z^0_0 - z^\star \lVert^2} + \tfrac{1}{nK^{4-5\epsilon}})$ for the $\mu$-strongly-monotone case, where $\epsilon \in (0,2/3)$. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively outlines the addressed problem and situates it within the current literature, with clear reasoning behind the algorithm's construction.  
- The proposed SEG-FFA algorithm demonstrates improved convergence rates for convex-concave minimax problems compared to existing methods, with comprehensive proofs and numerical experiments supporting its efficacy.

Weaknesses:  
- The results for the monotone case appear weaker than expected, as the rate $\mathcal O(1/K^{1/3})$ is inferior to the $\mathcal O(1/K)$ rate of deterministic methods like EG, raising questions about the necessity of SEG-FFA in this context.  
- The dependence on the initial point due to the anchoring step may limit practical applicability, and the rates lack clarity regarding dependencies on noise parameters.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the results in the monotone case by downplaying its significance and emphasizing the advantages of SEG-FFA in the strongly-monotone scenario. Additionally, we suggest comparing SEG-FFA against deterministic methods like EG in Table 1 to highlight its performance more effectively. It would also be beneficial to include dependencies on noise parameters in the rates and to clarify the role of the initial point in the anchoring step. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the Lipschitz Hessian assumption and the number of oracle calls in comparisons would enhance the paper's robustness.
