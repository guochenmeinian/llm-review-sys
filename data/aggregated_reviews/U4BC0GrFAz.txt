Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical investigation into whether machine learning models trained on causal features generalize better across domains compared to those trained on all features. The authors find that models utilizing all features outperform those using only causal features in both in-domain and out-of-domain accuracy across 16 prediction tasks. The study challenges the prevailing assumption regarding the external validity of causal modeling techniques, revealing that causal discovery algorithms often fail to select appropriate causal variables.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive empirical analysis across diverse tasks.
- Robustness checks affirm the stability of results.
- Clear and well-structured presentation enhances readability.
- The study provides valuable insights that challenge existing assumptions in the field.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality requires significant improvement, particularly in specificity and academic tone.
- The experimental setup raises concerns about the validity of claims, particularly regarding the selection of causal features and the fairness of model comparisons.
- The paper lacks clarity on the types of distribution shifts considered and whether the test datasets adequately represent domain shifts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and specificity of their writing, particularly in ambiguous statements regarding theories and terms like 'autonomy', 'modularity', and 'stability'. Additionally, the authors should address the validity of their experimental setup by creating a synthetic dataset with known ground truths to strengthen their claims. An ablation study removing one non-causal feature at a time would help clarify the role of non-causal features in model performance. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer description of the distribution shifts considered and ensure that the test datasets reflect significant domain shifts. Lastly, it would be beneficial to explicitly discuss the potential impact of confounders on the performance of causal features.
