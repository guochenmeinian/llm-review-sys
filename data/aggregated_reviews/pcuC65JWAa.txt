Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the concept of the Blackwell discount factor \( \gamma_{bw} \), establishing that any discount-optimal policy for \( \gamma > \gamma_{bw} \) is also Blackwell and average-optimal. The authors derive an upper bound for \( \gamma_{bw} \) based on the bit-size of an MDP instance and extend their findings to robust MDPs. The work aims to reduce the computation of Blackwell-optimal policies to that of discounted policies, addressing a gap in the literature on Blackwell optimality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, effectively presenting complex ideas.
2. The introduction of the Blackwell discount factor is innovative and may facilitate the development of efficient algorithms.
3. The theoretical results, including the upper bound for \( \gamma_{bw} \), are significant and novel.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks concrete applications or motivations for the proposed work, leaving questions about its practical utility.
2. The new definition of Blackwell optimality via \( \gamma_{bw} \) raises concerns about its superiority over existing criteria.
3. The focus on previous literature detracts from the discussion of the new approach, with insufficient elaboration on proof sketches.
4. The upper bound on \( \gamma_{bw} \) may lead to impractically high discount factors, complicating the learning process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing concrete motivation for the use of the Blackwell optimality criterion and examples of practical applications. Additionally, clarifying how the new definition of Blackwell optimality outperforms existing criteria would enhance the paper's impact. We suggest including more detailed discussions on the implications of removing standard assumptions like ergodicity and aperiodicity, as well as providing numerical simulations to demonstrate the advantages of the proposed approach. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the upper bound on \( \gamma_{bw} \) and its implications for real-world applications would strengthen the paper.
