### Key Points
This paper presents a method for answering time-sensitive questions by constructing temporal graphs from existing temporal information extraction systems and investigating fusion methods for integrating these graphs into transformer models. The authors propose two fusion techniques: Explicit Edge Representation Fusion (ERR) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) fusion. Experimental results demonstrate that the ERR approach enhances temporal reasoning capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SituatedQA and TimeQA datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on TimeQA and SituatedQA datasets.
- The methodology is simple, requiring only minor adjustments to the Transformer model's input, and outperforms prior work with fewer parameters.
- The writing is clear and well-organized, making the paper easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks an explicit comparative analysis between the ERR and GNN approaches, leaving the rationale for ERR's superior performance unexplored.
- There is a need for a more comprehensive analysis comparing this approach with others that incorporate textual data into language models.
- The choice of ChatGPT as the representative language model may not be optimal, as more advanced models like GPT-4 might already possess temporal reasoning capabilities without the need for graph data infusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis between the ERR and GNN approaches to clarify the performance differences. Additionally, we suggest including more qualitative examples in the evaluation, as seen in Table 3, to enhance understanding of model behavior. The authors should also consider exploring the application of their approach beyond temporal reasoning to other logical reasoning domains. Lastly, addressing the limitations of the ERR method regarding node and edge marking costs in long contexts would strengthen the paper.
