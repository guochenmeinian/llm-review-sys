Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a decentralized expert system for diagnosing Alzheimer's Disease (AD) that integrates blockchain technology and Federated Learning to enhance data privacy and manage MRI data effectively. The system aims to improve early-stage AD detection by providing a secure platform for patient data submission and AI-driven analysis. However, the manuscript primarily serves as a conceptual proposal, lacking detailed technical descriptions and experimental validation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The work introduces a pioneering integration of blockchain and Federated Learning to address privacy and data management challenges in AD diagnostics.
2. The proposed architecture includes robust anomaly detection mechanisms, enhancing the reliability of early-stage AD predictions.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript lacks extensive comparative data against traditional systems, limiting the validation of its proposed advantages.
2. There is insufficient detail regarding the algorithms used, which may hinder understanding and reproducibility.
3. The complexity of the system may pose usability challenges for less technically adept users, potentially affecting adoption.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript by providing comprehensive experimental validation to demonstrate the effectiveness of their proposed framework. Additionally, including detailed descriptions of the algorithms employed in the system would enhance clarity. It is crucial to address the real-world challenges associated with user engagement and the usability of blockchain technology. Finally, the authors should clarify the primary use case of the decentralized approach and provide a more rigorous justification for their architectural choices.
