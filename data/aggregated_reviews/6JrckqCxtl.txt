Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) designed to learn feature interactions in multivariate predictive modeling by segmenting the input space into polyhedrons. The authors demonstrate that the output of a fully ReLU activated DNN can be expressed in terms of these polyhedrons, which serve as an attention mechanism. PAM incorporates interaction effects by multiplying the distance from the input to each polyhedron, allowing for a piecewise polynomial function interpretation. The authors validate PAM theoretically and empirically across various datasets, achieving superior results in binary classification and brain age prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide an intuitive geometric interpretation of DNNs as piecewise polynomial functions, supported by sound theoretical analysis and empirical validation.
- The paper is well-organized and self-contained, with clear discussions and intuitive figures.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to follow, and the authors should consider using more natural language for their analysis.
- A figure summarizing the proposed method is lacking, and the explanation of k-way interactions is unclear.
- The improvements in AUC scores on the Criteo and Avazu datasets are incremental, and statistical significance tests for these improvements would strengthen the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying the notations and conveying concepts more plainly. Additionally, including a comprehensive overview figure of PAM would enhance understanding. To address concerns regarding the incremental improvements, conducting statistical significance tests for PAM's enhancements would be beneficial. An ablation study comparing the training and inference time of PAM with other methods, as well as an exploration of the implications of overlapping polyhedrons, would provide valuable insights. Lastly, the authors should ensure that all sections, including limitations, are adequately addressed.
