Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new sampling method for diffusion probabilistic models, termed SA-Solver, which utilizes a stochastic approach to enhance sampling efficiency. The authors derive the SA-Predictor and SA-Corrector from the diffusion SDE formulation, employing Lagrange interpolation for improved accuracy. Experimental results on datasets like CIFAR10 and ImageNet demonstrate that the proposed method achieves lower FID scores with fewer function evaluations compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The construction of the alternative SDE and approximation techniques provide a comprehensive framework for efficient diffusion model generation.
2. The writing is clear, and the derivation of SA-Solver is easy to understand, particularly in Section 5.3, which elucidates its relationship with UniPC.
3. The experiments are thorough and convincing, covering various sampling scenarios and demonstrating strong convergence and improved results over traditional ODE solvers.

Weaknesses:
1. The organization of the paper could be improved, as some content appears disjointed.
2. There are concerns regarding the novelty of SA-Solver, as it is viewed as an extension of UniPC, raising questions about its unique contributions.
3. Some experiments are lacking, particularly quantitative comparisons on COCO using a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model.
4. The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method, particularly regarding the choice of the parameter $\tau(t)$.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the paper to enhance clarity. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the novelty of SA-Solver and its contributions beyond existing methods. It would be beneficial to include quantitative evaluations, such as CLIP scores for text-to-image tasks, and to conduct an ablation study to clarify the impact of the predictor-corrector approach versus Lagrange interpolation. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the choice of $\tau(t)$ and consider varying it based on NFE in their experiments. Lastly, addressing the theoretical implications of the stochastic nature of SDEs in relation to Lagrange polynomials would strengthen the paper.
