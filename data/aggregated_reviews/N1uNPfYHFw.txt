### Key Points
We note that the authors extend nnUNet to a bounding box-based model, incorporating a binary mask into an additional channel. The model is fine-tuned on the SA-1B dataset and MedSAM's training data from 11 medical imaging modalities. The paper is clear and well-structured, but it deviates from the challenge template regarding padding. The concept of patch-wise inference is insufficiently detailed, particularly regarding patch size. We recommend estimating FLOPs and CO2 equivalents for completeness. The proposed method yields competitive results, especially in microscopy, but its performance varies across different imaging domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths include the innovative integration of bounding box prompts, the use of established engineering techniques like JIT and OpenVINO for inference speed, and the exploration of pretraining on natural images. However, weaknesses are evident in the lack of clarity regarding the patch-based approach and its benefits, insufficient details on the fine-tuning dataset, and the overall performance being slightly below the MedSam baseline in most domains. The paper also lacks a comprehensive explanation of the training strategy and the incorporation of bounding box prompts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We suggest that the authors standardize the paper format according to the challenge template and provide more details on the training strategy and fine-tuning dataset. Clarifying the patch-wise inference process and its advantages is essential, along with investigating the nnUNet's performance across different imaging modalities. Additionally, we recommend further ablation studies on the bounding box prompt incorporation methods and providing sources for the datasets used to enhance clarity and reproducibility.
