Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Boundary Offset Prediction Network (BOPN), designed to predict boundary offsets between candidate spans and their nearest entity spans, thereby enhancing Named Entity Recognition (NER) performance. The authors propose a multi-class classification approach that incorporates entity type as an input, addressing challenges related to the imbalance between entity and non-entity spans. Extensive experiments on eight NER datasets demonstrate the method's effectiveness, particularly in improving recall.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Extensive experiments conducted on eight datasets from two languages, showcasing the method's effectiveness.
- Clear motivation and problem formulation, with well-explained architecture and modeling aspects.
- The approach effectively leverages relative positioning information between entity and non-entity spans.

Weaknesses:
- The claim of achieving state-of-the-art performance is not substantiated, as results are still below existing benchmarks.
- Recent generative models are not considered in the analysis.
- The performance improvement over existing models is marginal, and the paper lacks a detailed error analysis to identify persistent challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of major error patterns that remain despite outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison of the proposed method with recent generative information extraction models to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Lastly, we advise a thorough proofreading to correct typographical errors and enhance readability.
