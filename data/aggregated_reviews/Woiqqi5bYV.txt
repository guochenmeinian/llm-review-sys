Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a logical regularization method called L-Reg, designed to enhance the generalization ability of image classification tasks through a logical reasoning framework. L-Reg simplifies model complexity by ensuring that generated atomic formulas align with logical relationships between images and labels, promoting balanced feature distribution and reducing extreme weight values in classifiers. Theoretical analysis and experimental results validate L-Reg's effectiveness in various generalization scenarios, particularly in multi-domain generalization and generalized category discovery tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. L-Reg effectively reduces model complexity by balancing feature distribution and minimizing extreme weight values in the classifier.
2. The paper provides a logic-based theoretical analysis and detailed derivation of L-Reg's construction, with experiments validating its effectiveness across different generalization settings.
3. Designed as a plug-in loss function, L-Reg is compatible with most existing frameworks, enhancing its flexibility and practicality.
4. The exploration of the relationship between logical reasoning and visual classification tasks offers new perspectives for research in related fields.

Weaknesses:
1. L-Reg may limit semantic support, potentially leading to decreased performance on known datasets; further analysis of this performance drop is needed.
2. The choice of function g for generating atomic formulas is crucial, yet the authors do not elaborate on how to select or design this function.
3. Details on how L-Reg integrates with existing methods in multi-domain generalization tasks and how to adjust alpha to balance losses require further clarification.
4. The presentation may confuse readers unfamiliar with logical reasoning, particularly in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, necessitating more intuitive explanations of key concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the interpretability of L-Reg beyond the introduction, providing both qualitative and quantitative analyses. Additionally, we encourage the authors to clarify the selection criteria for the function g used to generate atomic formulas. Further elucidation on how L-Reg integrates with existing methods and the adjustment of alpha in multi-domain generalization tasks is also advised. Finally, including comparisons of L-Reg with other regularization methods in terms of generalization ability and interpretability would highlight its advantages more effectively.
