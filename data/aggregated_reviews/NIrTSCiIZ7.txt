Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the BoundaryDiffusion method for semantic image editing using frozen pre-trained Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) and demonstrates its applicability to latent diffusion models (LDMs) like StableDiffusion. The authors analyze the distribution of inverted latent variables compared to prior Gaussian distributions, leading to a method for identifying critical steps for semantic editing. They propose discovering semantic control perturbations through a linear SVM classifier applied to the corresponding semantics at these critical steps, allowing for effective semantic manipulation without additional training of neural networks. The authors plan to release the code and integrate identified semantic boundaries into public platforms for community access, along with revisions promised during the rebuttal to enhance the work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-written and presents a comprehensive analysis of latent spaces and the denoising trajectory from a high-dimensional perspective.
- The method achieves competitive qualitative results without requiring fine-tuning or supervised learning techniques, making it efficient for downstream tasks.
- The authors demonstrate a commitment to improving their work based on reviewer feedback and have confirmed the applicability of their method to LDMs.
- They plan to provide clear theoretical proofs and code access, which will benefit the research community.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity and reproducibility are major concerns, particularly in Section 5, which lacks sufficient detail. The background and motivation sections are also unclear.
- The terminology, such as "semantic boundary search" and "trajectory mixing," adds complexity and may lead to misunderstandings.
- The paper does not adequately compare the proposed method with important baselines, such as classifier guidance, and lacks extensive quantitative results across different models and datasets.
- There are concerns regarding the accuracy of statements related to high-dimensional Gaussian distributions, specifically regarding the concentration of probability mass and the use of the term "volume."
- Some reviewers find the mathematical claims in the paper to be misleading or incorrect, which affects the overall evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity and reproducibility by providing more detailed descriptions in Section 5 and ensuring that all terms are clearly defined and referenced throughout the manuscript. Specifically, restate the definition of "homogeneity" and elaborate on the connections between spatial and semantic differences. Additionally, include comparisons with classifier guidance as a baseline and expand the quantitative results to demonstrate the method's generalization ability across various datasets and semantic attributes. We also suggest that the authors improve the clarity of their statements regarding high-dimensional Gaussian distributions by avoiding the term "volume" and instead stating that "most of the probability mass is concentrated in a thin shell at large radius." Furthermore, we recommend revising Line 180 to eliminate unnecessary claims about volume decreasing to zero as dimensionality increases, as this may confuse readers. Providing a rigorous proof or reference for any mathematical claims made would also enhance the paper's credibility. Finally, consider renaming "trajectory mixing" to avoid confusion and ensure that all references to the appendix are accurate and consistent.
