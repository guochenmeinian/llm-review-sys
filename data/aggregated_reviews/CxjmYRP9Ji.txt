Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new UCB-based Top-Two algorithm (TTUCB) for the best-arm identification problem (BAI), establishing a non-asymptotic upper bound on expected sample complexity valid for any unique best arm instance. The authors demonstrate that TTUCB achieves competitive empirical performance against existing algorithms, including other Top-Two methods. The paper also introduces a generic framework for regret minimization algorithms to address best-arm identification effectively.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, with clear claims and thorough justification of the problem formulation.
- It fills a significant gap in the literature by providing non-asymptotic guarantees for Top-Two algorithms.
- The insights into the theoretical guarantees of TTUCB are comprehensive, and the low computational complexity enhances practical applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The tightness of the non-asymptotic upper bound is not verified, particularly for non-vanishing $\delta$.
- The comparison of the non-asymptotic upper bound with the lower bound shows discrepancies as $\delta \to 0$, indicating potential issues with tightness.
- The experimental results rely solely on synthetic data, lacking insights into real-world applicability and challenges.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the verification of the tightness of the non-asymptotic upper bound in Theorem 2.4 across different values of $\delta$. Additionally, we suggest providing a non-asymptotic lower bound to clarify the best achievable results for TTUCB. It would also be beneficial to include experiments that showcase the finite confidence behavior of TTUCB compared to other algorithms. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the challenges of applying their approach to real-world datasets, addressing potential issues related to data collection and noise.
