Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the PEACE dataset, a comprehensive resource aimed at improving cancer pain management through pharmaceutical care. It includes records for over 38,000 patients, detailing demographics, clinical examinations, treatment outcomes, medication plans, and patient self-perceptions. The dataset is notable for its inclusion of multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) team assessments and long-term follow-ups, which are often absent in existing datasets. The authors demonstrate the dataset's potential through proof-of-concept studies utilizing 11 machine learning algorithms for treatment effectiveness assessment (TEA) and medication recommendation (MR).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Valuable Data**: The PEACE dataset is a significant contribution due to its comprehensive and long-term pain records, which are rare in current datasets. Its geographical diversity helps mitigate biases in medical treatment.
2. **Effective De-identification**: The authors have implemented necessary measures to de-identify patient data, particularly demographic information, while maintaining privacy.

Weaknesses:
1. **Clarity on Medical Professional Rationales**: The manuscript lacks clear presentation of the medical professionals' rationales behind medication plans, which is mentioned but not elaborated upon.
2. **Data Quality Assessment**: Ethical constraints limit access to the dataset, making it difficult to fully assess data quality. Additionally, the manuscript does not adequately address the steps taken to mitigate overfitting in advanced neural network models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the medical professionals' rationales behind medication plans by providing detailed examples or clearer explanations. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to include information about the internal review pipeline for dataset access, such as required documents and estimated review times. Additionally, the authors should discuss the temporal data distribution and clarify whether only a subset of patients has multi-visit data. Addressing these points will enhance the dataset's usability for researchers.
