Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an adaptation of conformal prediction for time series by proposing two novel methods: online regression for tracking quantiles and a scorecasting model for anticipating future quantiles. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for their method and compare it against a benchmark (ACI) across various datasets. The paper addresses the challenges of distribution shifts in machine learning and offers a practical algorithm that maintains safety certification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly articulates its contributions.
- The discussions on the method's limitations are insightful.
- The mathematical proofs and notation are clear and easy to follow.
- Extensive empirical studies demonstrate the method's effectiveness across different datasets.
- The code is organized and readable.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical guarantees are only asymptotic, lacking finite-sample results and comparisons with leading alternatives.
- The only baseline used for comparison is ACI, neglecting other recent proposals like SPCI.
- More details on hyperparameter selection are needed, as excessive parameters may overwhelm users.
- The scalability of the method is unclear for larger datasets.
- The connection to online calibration and control theory is not well-explained.
- Reproducibility is hindered by missing files and unclear instructions.
- Minor writing issues and typos detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical guarantees by including finite-sample results and explicitly showcasing advantages over leading alternatives. Additionally, consider including more baselines for comparison, such as SPCI, and clarify how hyperparameters are chosen, possibly providing an example of adaptive learning. A discussion on scalability for larger datasets is essential, along with a clearer explanation of the connections to online calibration and control theory. To enhance reproducibility, please include the `environments.yml` file, all necessary datasets, and pseudocode for the proposed method. Address minor writing issues and consider reorganizing content for clarity, particularly regarding the control theory connection and the placement of Proposition 3.
