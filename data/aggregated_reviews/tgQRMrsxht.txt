Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to decoding behavioral variables from neural activity recordings using dense silicon probes, bypassing traditional spike sorting. The authors utilize a probabilistic model that employs a mixture of Gaussians to model spike features, which is then applied for decoding. The method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques across various experiments involving mouse and monkey recordings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide an elegant solution to the challenging problem of decoding behavior amidst noisy and overlapping signals.
2. The results are compelling, showing that the proposed algorithm outperforms Kilosort and multi-unit thresholding in various decoding contexts.
3. The core idea and implementation are straightforward, suggesting broad utility for the neuroscience community.

Weaknesses:
1. A significant concern is the potential for noise and motion artifacts due to bypassing spike sorting, which could lead to amplifying contaminating signals. The authors should address whether their method might pick up noise or motion artifacts in the recordings.
2. The novelty of the proposed density-based decoding approach is limited, as similar methods using mixture of Gaussians and generalized linear models have been previously reported.
3. The baseline decoders used for comparison may not have been calibrated properly, raising questions about the fairness of the comparisons.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity regarding the potential impact of noise and motion artifacts on their method's performance. Specifically, they should address whether their technique captures any noise or motion artifacts in the recordings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the inclusion criteria for candidate spike events and explore the effects of different parameterizations on decoding accuracy. It would also be beneficial to compare their method against other state-of-the-art decoders to substantiate claims of superiority. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider applying previously developed clusterless methods to their data to demonstrate how and why those methods may fail.
