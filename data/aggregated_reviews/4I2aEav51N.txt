Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel instance-specific sensitivity method for differentially private queries, termed *reflective inverse sensitivity*, and introduces the *asymmetric sensitivity mechanism*. The authors argue that traditional global sensitivity can lead to excessive noise, negatively impacting utility. By utilizing smooth sensitivity, the proposed method aims to reduce perturbation while enhancing accuracy. The authors provide theoretical privacy and utility guarantees and demonstrate empirical advantages over existing smooth sensitivity methods, particularly in variance estimation and model evaluation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method addresses the challenge of bounding sensitivity without strong prior knowledge, avoiding biases common in existing differential privacy approaches.
- The theoretical analysis appears sound, and the utility results are significant, indicating broad application potential.
- The paper is well-organized and presents clear empirical validation of the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's narrative is occasionally difficult to follow, particularly in the introduction where the concept of "inverse of a function" is introduced without sufficient clarity.
- The utility result, Lemma 4.1, lacks thorough discussion in the main text, making it hard to appreciate its implications.
- The definition of asymmetric sensitivity is unclear, and the motivations behind theoretical results are not convincingly articulated.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction by simplifying complex concepts and providing motivating examples for the inverse sensitivity topic. Additionally, we suggest that the authors enhance the discussion of Lemma 4.1 in the main text to highlight the key takeaways of the utility guarantee. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the definition of asymmetric sensitivity and its advantages over existing mechanisms, potentially by providing concrete examples that illustrate its application and benefits.
