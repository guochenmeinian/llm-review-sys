Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a test-time approach that adaptively modifies attention maps during inference to enhance novel view synthesis. The authors propose an attention map filtering mechanism, modifications to the self-attention mechanism, and a specialized sampling schedule, demonstrating improved geometric consistency and realism without retraining. Experimental results indicate substantial improvements in fidelity and consistency, although the actual performance gains appear limited.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors provide a clear analysis of challenges in the current zero-1-to-3 method for novel view synthesis.
2. The innovative manipulation of attention maps during the denoising process is effective and well-articulated.
3. The paper is generally well-written, with clear figures and a structured methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The computational load increases due to (Re-)Sampling, and an ablation study on the hyperparameter R's impact on results and overhead is necessary.
2. Limited improvement in results necessitates validation on a larger, more diverse dataset.
3. The selection of only 10 objects from GSO for ablation studies may introduce bias; including all objects would ensure a more comprehensive evaluation.
4. The Mutual Self-Attention (MSA) method, while effective, is not a unique contribution as it has been utilized in other works.
5. The lack of qualitative results and comparisons limits the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ablation study by analyzing the impact of the hyperparameter R on both results and computational overhead. Additionally, validating the proposed approach on a larger and more diverse dataset would strengthen the findings. To mitigate potential bias, we suggest including all objects from GSO in the ablation studies. Furthermore, providing qualitative results and comparisons would enhance the evaluation of the proposed method's effectiveness. Lastly, clarifying the unique contributions of MSA in the context of their work is essential.
