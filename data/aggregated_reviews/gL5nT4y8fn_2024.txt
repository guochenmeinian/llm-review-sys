Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Panacea, a novel method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences by framing the alignment task as a Multi-Dimensional Preference Optimization (MDPO) problem. The authors propose a framework that utilizes a single model to identify the Pareto frontier set, allowing for online adaptation to diverse preferences without requiring gradient updates. Panacea demonstrates superior performance and scalability compared to existing techniques, effectively addressing the challenges of multi-objective alignment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. Strong empirical results: Panacea consistently outperforms baseline methods across various alignment problems, showcasing its scalability and efficiency.  
2. Theoretical rigor: The method is supported by solid theoretical proof regarding its effectiveness in recovering the Pareto front.  
3. General applicability: Panacea integrates well with various optimization procedures and loss aggregation methods.

Weaknesses:  
1. Scalability concerns: Despite claims of scalability, the computational cost may be substantial when scaling to larger models and more dimensions.  
2. Empirical limitations: The experiments could benefit from comparisons with a broader range of baseline methods and more diverse datasets.  
3. Theoretical assumptions: The reliance on the expressiveness of the model may limit its practical applicability, as the assumption could restrict the weights to a low-dimensional space.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 to better illustrate the concept of the Pareto front. Additionally, including an algorithmic block of pseudocode for the algorithm would enhance understanding. To strengthen empirical validation, we suggest including training costs and comparisons with a wider array of baseline methods. Furthermore, providing more details on how numerical rewards are generated and ensuring the reliability of these models would be beneficial. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct experiments on smaller models such as MiniCPM and Qwen, and include these results in the appendix for comprehensive evaluation.
