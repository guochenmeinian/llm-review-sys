Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dimensionality reduction method based on the Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, which separates vector fields into curl-free and divergence-free components. It incorporates symmetry constraints to enhance the interpretability of the identified vector fields. The method is applied to various toy models and real-world data, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling dynamical systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in dynamical systems modeling and is the first to utilize symmetries for constructing unique GP models of dynamics.  
- It shows consistent convergence to true parameter values with increasing data and discusses computational complexity.  
- The framework outperforms baselines across various toy models and effectively handles noisy data, with practical applications demonstrated on real-world datasets.  
- The clarity of presentation is commendable, making the work accessible to a broad audience.

Weaknesses:  
- The applicability of the method is limited due to unresolved identifiability issues, particularly for systems without known symmetries.  
- The justification for the interpretability of learned div-free features is insufficiently explained.  
- There is a lack of comparison with existing methods for modeling physical systems, and the paper does not provide code or detailed hyperparameter descriptions.  
- The ocean current experiment's implementation details are vague, and the computational complexity discussion is lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on identifiability issues, particularly for systems lacking known symmetries. Additionally, the authors should provide a clearer justification for the interpretability of the div-free features. We suggest including comparisons to existing methods, such as those by Guo et al. (2005) and Hess et al. (2023), to contextualize the contributions of this work. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to provide code and a comprehensive description of hyperparameters used in the experiments. Lastly, addressing the implementation details of the sparse GP formulation in the appendix and discussing its empirical performance compared to the exact approach would enhance the paper's clarity and rigor.
