### Key Points
This paper presents ABXI, a novel cross-domain sequential recommendation system framework that addresses the prediction mismatch problem in existing models through task-guided alignment. The authors leverage two types of LoRA, namely dLoRA and iLoRA, to extract domain-specific and domain-invariant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ABXI significantly outperforms state-of-the-art CDSR models across various datasets, showcasing its potential to enhance recommendation accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured, with clear explanations and effective illustrations that enhance understanding.
2. The innovative integration of task-guided alignment and LoRA technology contributes to the originality of the work.
3. Extensive experimental validation supports the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough theoretical analysis, including time complexity and resource consumption assessments.
2. The ablation study results indicate that removing task-guided alignment sometimes leads to underperformance compared to traditional methods, suggesting that the effectiveness of LoRAs may be limited.
3. There is insufficient detail regarding the dataset processing and the applicability of the methods to more than two domains.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by including a time complexity analysis and a detailed examination of resource consumption associated with the ABXI model. Additionally, we suggest providing more comprehensive results in the ablation studies to better demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAs and task-guided alignment. Clarifying the impact of the temperature $\tau$ on performance and addressing the potential computational overhead introduced by LoRA modules would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, we encourage the authors to ensure that the code repository is accessible and to elaborate on how the secondary filtering step can be applied to multiple domains.
