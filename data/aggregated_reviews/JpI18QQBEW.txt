### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive investigation into fraud within the online advertising ecosystem, particularly focusing on the misuse of transparency standards like ads.txt and sellers.json. The authors analyze a dataset of over 7 million websites, revealing how fraudulent entities exploit identifier pooling to siphon ad revenue from legitimate publishers. The study introduces AdSparency, a tool designed to enhance transparency and understanding of revenue flows. The findings underscore significant systemic vulnerabilities that have implications for advertisers, publishers, and policymakers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Extensive analysis based on a large-scale dataset (>7 million websites).
2. Introduction of AdSparency as a novel tool for monitoring revenue flows.
3. Clear and concise writing style, with effective use of visualizations to convey complex data.

Weaknesses:
1. Insufficient clarification on the distinction between legitimate and abusive identifier pooling, which may confuse readers.
2. The reliance on voluntary compliance by stakeholders and the lack of discussion on structural issues driving fraud.
3. Some technical details and jargon are inadequately explained, making it challenging for readers outside the field to fully grasp the content.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing explicit criteria for distinguishing between legitimate and abusive identifier pooling, including how edge cases are handled. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the structural issues that contribute to fraud within the advertising ecosystem. To enhance accessibility, we encourage the inclusion of background information and explanations for technical terms and abbreviations used throughout the paper. Finally, we advise the authors to clarify their revenue estimation assumptions and discuss the temporal dynamics of fraud patterns to strengthen the generalizability of their findings.
