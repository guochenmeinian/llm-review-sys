Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a post-processing algorithm aimed at enforcing demographic parity in regression tasks without access to sensitive attributes during inference. The authors analyze a constrained optimization problem for fair post-processing, demonstrating that the solution can be parameterized by dual variables. They discuss the convergence rate and conditions for non-perfect solutions, recommending the use of the SGD3 algorithm for optimization. The paper concludes with empirical evaluations of the proposed algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. This is the first paper to study fair post-processing regressors in the attribute unaware setting.
2. The primal-dual analysis leading to the representation result in lemma 3.1 is interesting and distinct from similar works in classification.
3. The theoretical analysis is thorough, supporting the proposed procedure and the choice of SGD3.

Weaknesses:
1. Discussions on the lipschitzness of $F$ are curt, particularly regarding the choice of hyperparameter $\alpha$ and how SGD3 controls the norm of $G_\alpha$. A brief discussion should be included in the main body.
2. An ablation study illustrating the importance of using SGD3 over other optimizers would be appreciated, along with a discussion of its potential limitations.
3. The choice of hyperparameters associated with SGD3 and discretization is not adequately discussed, raising concerns about their impact on performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve discussions on the lipschitzness of $F$, particularly regarding the selection of hyperparameter $\alpha$ and the control of $G_\alpha$ by SGD3. Additionally, we suggest including an ablation study to highlight the necessity of SGD3 and discussing its limitations. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify how hyperparameters for SGD3 and discretization were chosen in the experiments and their potential impact on performance.
