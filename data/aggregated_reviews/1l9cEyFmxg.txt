Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a self-guidance method for masked generative models (MGMs) aimed at enhancing the diversity and quality of class conditional image generation. The authors address challenges such as the lack of sequential dependencies and ineffective guidance techniques by proposing an auxiliary task for error token correction and utilizing TOAST for efficient model fine-tuning. The method is evaluated against various baselines, demonstrating improvements in image generation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research problem is well-motivated, with a thorough background and related work discussion, including a helpful analogy to continuous diffusion models.
- The paper presents a highly original approach, effectively extending guidance methods from diffusion models to MGMs.
- Extensive evaluation of hyperparameters and qualitative visualizations support the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- Qualitative visualizations do not show significant differences compared to MaskGIT, raising questions about the method's performance at different resolutions.
- Clarity issues exist in some sections, particularly regarding implementation details and the rationale behind hyperparameter choices.
- The lack of visual results from alternative models limits the justification for the choice of TOAST as the most suitable model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in sections that are hard to follow, particularly section 5, and provide more detailed implementation information to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, including visual results for other models would strengthen the justification for TOAST's selection. We suggest conducting experiments on other datasets, such as MSCOCO or Conceptual Captions, to demonstrate the generalizability of the method. Finally, providing more visualizations to accompany the auxiliary task process would enhance understanding.
