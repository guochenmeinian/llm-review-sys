Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian approach for causal discovery from limited interventional samples, demonstrating theoretical guarantees for convergence to the true causal graph with sufficient data. The authors propose an algorithm that constructs a separating system for intervention targets and enumerates causal effects for various configurations, achieving low Structural Hamming Distance (SHD) with fewer samples than existing methods. The experiments validate the proposed method against benchmarks on synthetic data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical analysis is detailed, showing high probability convergence to the true causal graph with sufficient interventional samples.
- The experiments on simulated chordal graphs indicate that the method requires significantly fewer interventional samples to achieve low SHD compared to baselines.
- The use of results from Wien√∂bst et al. (2023) creatively reduces time complexity.

Weaknesses:
- The related work section lacks depth, reading more like a list than a contextual analysis of previous research.
- The method's classification as "Bayesian learning of causal graphs" is misleading; it computes posterior probabilities of specific configurations rather than directly over causal graphs.
- The selection process for intervention targets is unclear, and the authors do not discuss the computational complexity or scalability of their method.
- Experiments are limited to simulated chordal graphs, and comparisons with more diverse graph types and additional baselines are lacking.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section to provide a more contextual analysis of their research within the existing literature. Additionally, clarify the classification of the proposed method to avoid confusion regarding its Bayesian nature. The authors should also elaborate on the intervention target selection process and discuss the computational complexity of their approach, particularly its scalability to larger graphs. Expanding experiments to include various graph types and additional baselines would strengthen the validation of the proposed method.
