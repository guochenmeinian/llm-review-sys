Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the alignment of large language models (LLMs) with human intuitions regarding causal and moral judgments. The authors created a dataset of stories from 24 cognitive science papers, annotating them with factors influencing human judgments. The findings indicate that while newer LLMs show improved alignment with human intuitions, they weigh judgment factors differently than humans. The study contributes valuable insights into LLM behavior and opens avenues for further research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Originality**: The paper offers a novel approach to evaluating LLMs through causal and moral judgment tasks, utilizing a well-constructed dataset from cognitive science.
- **Quality**: The meticulous transcription and diverse responses collected enhance the robustness of the analysis.
- **Clarity**: The methodology and factors influencing judgments are clearly articulated.
- **Significance**: The research is crucial for understanding LLMs' handling of complex moral and causal tasks, with implications for future model improvements.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is primarily focused on OpenAI models, limiting the generalizability of findings. 
- There is a lack of clear comparison with human performance, making it difficult to assess how closely LLMs align with human judgments.
- The analysis of incorrect predictions is insufficient, which could reveal biases in model errors.
- The dataset's limited size raises concerns about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a broader range of LLMs to enhance the comprehensiveness of their findings. Additionally, providing a clear human performance baseline would contextualize the results more effectively. A more detailed analysis of incorrect predictions could identify patterns or biases that inform model improvements. Finally, discussing the generalizability of the findings and testing across a wider range of tasks would strengthen the paper's contributions.
