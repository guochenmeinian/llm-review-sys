### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach, TOD-flow, aimed at addressing the limitations of pre-trained language models (PLMs) in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD) systems by inferring TOD-flow graphs from dialogue data annotated with dialogue acts. The inferred graphs enhance transparency, controllability, and prediction performance in dialogue models, guiding predictions and providing rationale for model outputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves dialogue act classification and end-to-end response generation performance across benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of a novel method for inferring the TOD-flow graph enhances transparency and controllability in task-oriented dialogue systems.
2. The paper includes a comprehensive set of experiments, effectively demonstrating the method's impact on dialogue act classification and response generation.

Weaknesses:
1. Some aspects of the proposed model lack thorough description, leading to ambiguity.
2. The motivation for the proposed approach is unclear, and there is insufficient comparison with existing works focusing on dialogue structures.
3. The evaluation protocol is confusing, particularly regarding the use of off-the-shelf models without tuning on graph-augmented data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model description to eliminate ambiguity. Additionally, we suggest providing a more detailed discussion on the novelty of the approach compared to existing sub-graph applications. The authors should clarify the evaluation protocol and consider including a broader selection of baselines, particularly policy models that utilize traditional methods like BC or RL. Furthermore, elaborating on the training process for generating the TOD-flow graph and the accuracy of GPT-turbo's annotations would enhance understanding.
