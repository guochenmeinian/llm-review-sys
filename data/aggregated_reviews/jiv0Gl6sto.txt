### Key Points
This paper presents Thematic-LM, an LLM-based multi-agent system designed for large-scale thematic analysis (TA). It divides TA into specialized sub-tasks such as coding, aggregating codes, and maintaining an adaptive codebook, while assigning distinct identities to coder agents to simulate diverse interpretations. The authors apply their framework to the Dreaddit and Reddit climate change datasets, yielding insights into social media stress and climate change discussions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The organization and clarity of the writing facilitate understanding.
2. The innovative use of LLM multi-agent collaboration for large-scale TA is commendable.
3. The adaptive codebook enhances the system's performance by allowing dynamic code refinement.
4. The evaluation based on trustworthiness metrics is relevant and preferable to standard metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation of methods lacks clarity and detail, making reproduction difficult. Key elements, such as how new codes are added to the codebook, are inadequately explained.
2. The metrics used, particularly "dependability" and "transferability," require further clarification, as they appear to overlap significantly.
3. The paper does not include human evaluation or feedback, raising concerns about the quality of the output.
4. Comparisons with other thematic analysis methods are limited, which undermines the demonstration of Thematic-LM's advantages.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methods section by providing detailed explanations of key elements and including symbolic representations such as algorithms and examples of prompts and responses. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definitions and distinctions between "dependability" and "transferability." To enhance the evaluation, incorporating human feedback and comparisons with existing thematic analysis methods would strengthen the paper's credibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the ethical implications of their work, particularly in sensitive contexts like mental health.
