Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a physics-constrained framework aimed at enhancing optical neural networks (ONNs) for image classification by addressing key physical errors such as light source instability and exposure time mismatches. The authors propose a specialized loss function and a DNN-based error compensation network, achieving significant improvements in classification accuracy across datasets, with results reaching 96.5% on MNIST. The integration of physical constraints into the training process is motivated by the discrepancies between simulated and real-world implementations of ONNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors introduce a novel approach that effectively integrates quantifiable physical errors into the ONN training process, significantly enhancing classification accuracy.  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly presents the methodology, with adequate detail for a broader audience.  
- Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements, validating the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Weaknesses:  
- The generalizability of the method beyond image classification and its scalability remain unclear.  
- The performance heavily relies on the accuracy of the physical models, which may limit applicability in challenging environments.  
- The discussion on unpredictable errors is insufficient, despite their potential significance in dynamic applications.  
- Limited experimentation on more complex datasets raises questions about the robustness of the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalization of their framework to broader applications beyond image classification and clarify its scalability. Additionally, addressing the limitations posed by the accuracy of physical models and providing insights into the impact of unpredictable errors would strengthen the paper. A more comprehensive analysis of computational costs, including training and inference times, should be included. Finally, we suggest validating the approach on more complex datasets, such as CIFAR100 or TinyImageNet, to demonstrate robustness and effectiveness in varied conditions.
