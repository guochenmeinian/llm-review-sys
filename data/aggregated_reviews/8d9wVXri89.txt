Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Hierarchical INTerpolation Network (HINT), a hierarchical framework that utilizes residuals from observed points to guide target function estimation. HINT consists of multiple lightweight interpolation blocks, where the first block estimates the main component of the target function, and subsequent blocks predict residual components. The framework aims to improve interpolation accuracy through hierarchical local constraints and has demonstrated superior performance compared to existing algorithms across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is easy to follow and well-written, providing concise descriptions of the proposed framework.
2. The Ablation Study effectively validates the proposed auxiliary loss term, masked observed points, and local constraints in HINT.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate HINT's superiority over existing interpolation methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed hierarchical residual refining framework is not clearly articulated, particularly in relation to existing hierarchical residual architectures for time series forecasting.
2. The presentation lacks clarity, with repeated definitions and incorrect expressions that need revision.
3. Experimental results are limited, lacking investigations into performance with varying ratios of observed points and comparisons with more recent methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the novelty of the hierarchical residual refining framework by discussing its distinct contributions compared to existing literature. Additionally, we suggest revising the presentation for clarity, particularly addressing the repeated definitions and correcting inaccuracies. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct more comprehensive experiments, including varying the ratios of observed points and comparing their method with more recent developments in the field.
