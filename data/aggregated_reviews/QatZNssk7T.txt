Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on balanced adversaries in adaptive data analysis (ADA), where the adversary does not have access to the underlying distribution but interacts with an oracle that samples from it. The authors demonstrate that this more realistic adversarial model allows for improved lower bounds on adaptive data analysis. They establish a new formal model of security, termed the "balanced model," and prove that under the assumption of public-key cryptography, the previous lower bounds can be extended to this model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors address a more practical threat model for ADA, which enhances the relevance of their findings.  
- The theoretical results are well-supported, and the paper is presented clearly and formally.  
- The distinction between cryptographic assumptions has potential implications for the field of cryptography.  

Weaknesses:  
- There is a lack of discussion regarding real-world machine learning applications of the results.  
- The absence of a conclusion section leaves the paper feeling incomplete.  
- The theoretical results rely on the assumption of public-key cryptography, which may not be universally accepted.  
- The paper could benefit from a summary table comparing their setting and assumptions with prior works to clarify contributions.  
- The implicit assumption that the mechanism knows the analyst it is competing against may lead to confusion and should be clarified.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors include a summary table comparing their setting, assumptions, and bounds with respect to prior works to better highlight the differences and contributions of the paper. Additionally, we suggest adding a conclusion section to summarize the findings and implications of the research. Clarifying the assumption regarding the mechanism's knowledge of the analyst would also enhance the paper's clarity. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss potential real-world machine learning applications of their results to strengthen the paper's relevance.
