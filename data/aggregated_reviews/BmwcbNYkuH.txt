Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper tackles out-of-domain (OOD) generalization in histopathology, focusing on the consistent shape features of nuclei as domain-invariant markers. The authors propose a method that utilizes segmentation masks and data augmentation to enhance the model's focus on nuclear morphology, which is critical for cancer detection. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach improves OOD generalization compared to existing methods, validating a long-held hypothesis through deep learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical challenge in AI-driven digital pathology, enhancing the reliability of learning-based approaches.
- The experimental evaluations and ablation studies are comprehensive, supporting the proposed methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is poorly structured, with convoluted paragraph organization and complex sentences that obscure the core ideas.
- The methodology description is informal and lacks rigorous mathematical formulations, leading to ambiguity (e.g., unclear meaning of “run a forward pass”).
- The concept of leveraging nuclear shape as domain-invariant markers is not novel, raising questions about the paper's contribution.
- The benchmarking methods are outdated, with the most recent being from 2021, and the authors primarily used ResNet-50 without exploring other architectures like ViT-tiny.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript's structure for better clarity and organization. The description of the proposed methodology should be made more formal and precise, addressing the ambiguity in technical terms. Additionally, the authors should clarify the contribution of their work compared to existing literature and consider employing a segmentation method to extract morphometrics for nuclei, potentially simplifying the diagnosis process. It is essential to benchmark against more recent pathology-specific methods and include a broader range of architectures in experiments. Finally, we suggest adding qualitative experiments, such as visualizing saliency maps, to substantiate the focus on nuclei as a key improvement factor.
