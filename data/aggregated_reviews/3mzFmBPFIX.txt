Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new parameterization for neural metriplectic systems that incorporates structural information about degeneracy conditions into the model. The proposed method requires approximately \(O(n^2)\) learnable parameters for \(n\) state variables, improving upon prior methods that necessitate \(O(n^3)\). The authors provide a deep learning implementation scheme for their approach, which includes learning \(E(x)\) and \(S(x)\) to construct matrices \(L\) and \(M\) from observed trajectories. The system is trained end-to-end on simple physical systems, demonstrating superior performance compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively motivates the need for metriplectic systems that efficiently incorporate dynamical constraints, capturing a potentially interesting class of physical systems.
- The method improves upon the cubic time complexity of existing approaches, with a straightforward implementation that includes an approximation result and experimental validation.

Weaknesses:
- Despite improving scaling from cubic to quadratic, the overall complexity still scales poorly with the number of state variables.
- Current experiments are limited to small benchmarks, and the paper lacks broader applications or insights into real-world physical data that could be modeled.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of the paper by defining mathematical terms such as algebraic brackets and degenerate metric brackets early on or providing relevant citations. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with non-metriplectic methods to enhance the discussion of the significance and applicability of their approach. The authors should also consider refactoring the paper to highlight practical applications of their method, potentially moving dense sections to the appendix for clarity.
