### Key Points
This paper presents the CS2W dataset, a Chinese Spoken-to-Written style conversion dataset comprising 7,237 spoken sentences with four types of conversion problems: disfluencies, ASR transcription errors, grammatical errors, and colloquial vocabulary. The authors propose a thorough analysis of the dataset and benchmark evaluations using five state-of-the-art (SoTA) models, leading to the discovery of a new type of disfluency. The paper also details the annotation guidelines and methodology for dataset preparation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is the first of its kind for Chinese, focusing on multiple conversion problems relevant to downstream tasks.
- The paper provides a well-motivated rationale for the dataset's necessity, comparing it to existing datasets in other languages.
- It includes a sound analysis of dataset statistics and characteristics, along with a comprehensive evaluation of benchmark model performance.

Weaknesses:
- The downstream task performance study lacks convincing evidence of general gains, making it difficult to assess the improvements' applicability beyond the specific translation task.
- The dataset is heavily dominated by disfluencies (87.4%), raising questions about whether this distribution is expected or an artifact of the dataset's creation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset creation process by providing more details on sample selection and annotation guidelines. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include comparisons of disfluency statistics with other datasets to contextualize the findings. We also suggest emphasizing the performance of models fine-tuned on the dataset more thoroughly, as this is a critical aspect of the paper. Finally, addressing the visualization errors, typos, and missing citations would enhance the overall quality of the paper.
