### Key Points
This paper presents an evaluation measure for feature attribution methods and a dynamic approach to determine the optimal number of attributing features (k). The authors utilized DistilBERT for natural language inference on a single dataset, comparing various gradient and perturbation methods. They propose using the ratio of attribution methods for a token, averaged across the sentence, as a measure of relevance. The study concludes that vanilla gradient attribution aligns more closely with human annotations, perturbation methods outperform gradient methods, and higher k values yield greater agreement. Additionally, a basic event detection algorithm is implemented to define k automatically.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- In-depth study of attribution, confirming some findings and contradicting others in the field.
- Evaluation of attribution concerning k, a parameter often overlooked.
- Well-written and clear methodology with valuable insights into feature attribution.

Weaknesses:
- The equation for agreement@k lacks clarity, necessitating further review.
- The authors overlook existing work in event/anomaly detection and implement a new algorithm for dynamic k selection.
- Limited experimental scope due to reliance on a single model and dataset.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the equation for agreement@k to enhance understanding. Additionally, it is essential to include references to existing work in event/anomaly detection, such as the studies at https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.02500 and https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-03526-y. Furthermore, providing more illustrative examples from the dataset, including resulting k values and corresponding agreement scores, would strengthen the discussion. Lastly, consider addressing the typos and clarifications noted, such as defining "surrounding" and providing more informative legends for figures.
