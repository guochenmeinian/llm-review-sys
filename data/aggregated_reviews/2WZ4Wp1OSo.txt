### Key Points
This paper presents a divide-and-conquer paradigm for dialog state tracing (DST) that aims to construct multi-domain models using single-domain dialogs. The authors propose a multi-domain dialog synthesis framework that merges single-domain dialogs to simulate domain relationships, addressing the challenges of manual domain relation definition and data collection. Experimental results on two datasets indicate that this method enhances cross-domain DST performance while reducing data collection costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed methods are novel and address significant challenges in building multi-domain models without requiring extensive multi-domain data.  
- The writing is clear and accessible, facilitating understanding of the concepts.  
- Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, showing improvements in model generalization and cross-domain value transfer.  

Weaknesses:  
- The divide-and-conquer approach may suffer from error propagation due to the independent optimization of the domain classifier and state tracker.  
- The association between the DAC method and the multi-domain dialog synthesis framework is relatively weak, lacking a cohesive unified framework.  
- The investigation is limited to generative DST models using a fixed T5 backbone, leaving the impact of non-generative methods and larger models unexplored.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion surrounding the motivation for their work on DST, particularly by comparing task-oriented dialog systems (TOD) with general-purpose chatbots like ChatGPT. Additionally, the authors should clarify the process of obtaining candidate slots and values during cross-domain inference, and address how to mitigate error propagation in the divide-and-conquer paradigm. Finally, we suggest implementing a method to validate the reasonableness of synthetic dialogs and ensuring that slot pairs in specific contexts are meaningful.
