### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method to evaluate the faithfulness of feature importance (FI) methods by utilizing a counterfactual generator model. The authors propose a two-step process: first, applying a feature importance method to identify significant tokens in an input $x$; second, masking the top 10% of these tokens and generating a counterfactual input $xâ€™$ using an editor model. The evaluation protocol assesses the number of out-of-distribution inputs generated and the correlation of rankings from different FI methods. The authors demonstrate that their method produces fewer out-of-distribution inputs and shows better correlation among rankings than prior methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses an important issue in evaluating the faithfulness of FI methods.
2. It proposes an effective solution to the out-of-distribution (OOD) problem commonly found in traditional methods.
3. The thorough evaluation of various FI methods enhances the generalizability of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The justification for correlating rankings across different faithfulness evaluation protocols is insufficiently motivated.
2. The reliance on negative likelihood to evaluate out-of-distribution inputs may not accurately reflect text quality.
3. The literature on counterfactual generation in LLMs is inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for why high correlation in ranking represents a better method. Additionally, conducting human evaluations could enhance confidence in the results regarding out-of-distribution inputs. We also suggest that the authors clarify the mechanism ensuring the quality of text generated by the counterfactual generator and provide a more detailed explanation of the editor model's role in the attribution evaluation process. Finally, correcting the citation formats and ensuring consistent use of parenthetical citations throughout the text is necessary.
