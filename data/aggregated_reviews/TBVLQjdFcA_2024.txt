Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a FS-3DSeg framework named Generated and Pseudo Content guided Prototype Refinement (GPCPR) for few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation. The authors propose two core components: Generated Content-guided Prototype Refinement (GCPR), which enhances prototypes using semantic knowledge from LLM-generated class descriptions, and Pseudo Query Context-guided Prototype Refinement (PCPR), which reduces class information bias by aggregating reliable class-specific pseudo-query context. A dual-distillation regularization term is introduced to facilitate knowledge transfer between early-stage entities and deeper counterparts. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of GPCPR.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is technically sound and well-written.
- The experiments confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method across various datasets.
- The idea of enriching prototypes with text knowledge is innovative, and the provided visualizations aid in understanding the method.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty is limited, as the use of LLMs for few-shot segmentation has been previously explored in 2D contexts, and the GCPR module lacks specific optimizations for 3D tasks.
- The PCPR module's approach to generating class-specific pseudo-query context is straightforward and closely resembles techniques from prior works.
- The introduction of LLMs may significantly increase computational overhead and inference time, yet the paper lacks a detailed analysis of these costs.
- The experimental evaluation is conducted under an outdated setting, which diminishes the credibility of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of the GCPR module by incorporating specific design optimizations tailored for 3D tasks. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a detailed analysis of the computational costs associated with LLM content generation and multiple refinement stages to clarify the method's practical applicability. It would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method under the corrected experimental settings referenced in the literature to enhance the validity of the results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the robustness of the pseudo mask generation process and its impact on segmentation accuracy.
