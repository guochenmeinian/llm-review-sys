### Key Points
This paper presents a framework that automates the design and evaluation cycle of objects, requiring only input parameters and constraints from the user. The authors propose a generative design process consisting of sampling, estimation, and optimization, applied to various domains such as microfluidics and wave protection structures. While the framework shows potential for improving performance, the clarity and detail in the presentation are lacking, making it difficult to assess the quality and originality of the work.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed framework demonstrates the ability to enhance performance in multiple applications.  
- The general approach to generative design is relevant and could stimulate valuable discussions in various fields.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper suffers from readability issues, with vague problem formulations and insufficiently described methods.  
- There is a lack of baseline comparisons and details about specific models used, hindering reproducibility and evaluation.  
- The originality and significance of the algorithm are unclear, as the results are not adequately interpreted or compared to existing generative designs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by introducing figures and their relevance before they appear, guiding the reader through the figures, and including appropriate labels. Additionally, the authors should provide a more detailed description of the methods, including the physics-based simulators, deep learning surrogate (covering loss function, early stop criteria, architecture), and conversion criteria used in experiments. It is essential to include baseline results for comparison and to clarify how this framework differs from other generative designs in the literature. Finally, enhancing the evaluation section with stronger generative field-specific baselines and thorough assessments will significantly improve the paper's quality.
