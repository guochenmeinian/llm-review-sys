### Key Points
This paper introduces and studies a centralized barter exchange problem (BarterSV) where agents aim to swap items based on a collectively agreed value, maximizing total utility while ensuring that each agent's total received value equals their total given value. The authors demonstrate that the problem is NP-hard and propose a randomized rounding algorithm, BarterDR, which achieves an expected optimal allocation while allowing for a slight violation of the balance constraint. The paper connects BarterSV to bipartite matching and provides a dependent rounding technique that ensures good ex-post allocations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The BarterSV problem is relevant and applicable in real-world scenarios like GAMESWAP and BARDAGAMEEXCHANGE.
2) The paper effectively links BarterSV to the well-studied bipartite matching problem, utilizing established techniques such as LP rounding.
3) The proposed algorithm, BarterDR, guarantees better ex-post properties than previous algorithms like GKPS-DR.

Weaknesses:
1) The novelty of the work appears limited, as many techniques are derived from existing literature.
2) The paper's structure could be improved; important proofs are relegated to the appendix, which may hinder reader comprehension.
3) Section 6 is deemed redundant and lacks substantial discussion or interesting results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and structure of the paper by integrating key proofs or providing intuitive sketches in the main body. Additionally, consider revising Section 6 to enhance its relevance or removing it if it does not contribute significantly. To strengthen the paper's novelty, we suggest exploring more general settings where agents have different valuation functions and investigating potential results related to fairness in the barter exchange.
