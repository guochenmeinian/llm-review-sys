Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on online reinforcement learning (RL) utilizing a local simulator with general function approximation, yielding new statistical guarantees. The authors propose that $Q^*$ realizability and coverability assumptions are sufficient for sample-efficient online RL. They also demonstrate that the Exogenous Block MDP problem is tractable under these conditions and complement their theoretical findings with a computationally efficient algorithm. Additionally, the paper introduces the SimGolf algorithm, which enhances sample efficiency and accuracy in value function approximation, and RVFS (Recursive Value Function Search), which achieves sample complexity guarantees under stronger assumptions like pushforward coverability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is generally well-written and presents a novel approach to leveraging local simulators in online RL, leading to significant theoretical contributions.
- The introduction of SimGolf and RVFS provides strong theoretical analysis and new statistical guarantees.
- The motivation for generalizing RL beyond linear structures is clear and valuable.

Weaknesses:
- Certain terms lack definitions or discussions, potentially due to space constraints, which may hinder understanding.
- The algorithm in Section 4 is highly technical and difficult to follow, with the role of the local simulator underexplained.
- The analysis of SimGOLF and Theorem 3.1 lacks technical novelty compared to existing works.
- The paper deviates from expected NeurIPS formatting, lacking a dedicated conclusion or future work section, and the abstract includes references, detracting from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of technical terms and provide definitions or discussions for key concepts mentioned in the paper. It would be beneficial to simplify the algorithm in Section 4 and explicitly highlight the novelty of the proposed methods. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify their definition of computational efficiency for RVFS and provide a detailed analysis of the number of oracle calls required for convergence. A dedicated conclusion or discussion section should be included to contextualize results and outline plans for empirical validation, addressing the gap between theoretical guarantees and practical performance.
