Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a deep reinforcement learning-based method for solving job shop scheduling problems (JSP) and flexible job shop scheduling problems (FJSP) through a technique called residual scheduling. This approach focuses on removing irrelevant operations and machines from the state representation to enhance performance. The authors claim that their method achieves state-of-the-art results on benchmark instances, demonstrating a zero gap in 49 out of 50 cases with large problem sizes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of residual scheduling is innovative and effectively addresses the complexity of JSP and FJSP.
- The empirical results indicate strong performance compared to existing deep reinforcement learning methods.
- The method is adaptable to both JSP and FJSP, which are significant scheduling challenges.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a comprehensive review of existing literature on deep learning approaches to job shop scheduling, making it difficult to assess the novelty of the proposed method.
- The motivation for the residual scheduling technique is insufficiently justified, and its theoretical underpinnings are not thoroughly analyzed.
- The focus on makespan as the primary performance metric may limit practical applicability, particularly regarding tardiness and on-time delivery.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to clearly delineate the novelty of their work compared to existing methods. Additionally, the motivation for the residual scheduling technique should be better articulated, with a more robust theoretical analysis provided. The authors should also evaluate the introduced attributes in the state representation to ensure they satisfy the Markov property of the MDP. Furthermore, justifying the choice of GIN and the focus on construction heuristics over improvement heuristics should be addressed with empirical validation. Finally, we suggest expanding the performance metrics beyond makespan to include tardiness and other relevant factors for practical applications.
