### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to construct a multilingual colexification graph, ColexNet, from the Parallel Bible Corpus, which is extended to ColexNet+ that includes n-grams as intermediate nodes. The authors demonstrate that ColexNet effectively identifies colexification patterns comparable to the gold standard CLICS and that the embeddings derived from ColexNet+ outperform existing multilingual baselines across three tasks: roundtrip translation, verse retrieval, and verse classification. The methodology includes a two-step alignment process for graph construction and evaluates the embeddings through rigorous experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and addresses a significant number of languages (1,335), making the topic relevant and impactful.
- The proposed approach is simple, sound, and supported by controlled experiments, ensuring minimal variance in results.
- The analysis and results are thorough, with valuable insights into the nature of colexification and its implications for cross-lingual transfer.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on graph construction may overshadow the core contributions related to multilingual embeddings and transfer learning, potentially necessitating a title change.
- The experiments lack comparisons with Transformer-based models, which could provide a clearer context for the performance of the proposed embeddings.
- The evaluation tasks may not fully represent important downstream NLP applications, and the choice of classes in verse classification appears arbitrary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by focusing more on the implications of their findings for multilingual embeddings and transfer learning, possibly by renaming the paper to reflect this focus. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with Transformer-based models, such as XLM-R, particularly for tasks like verse retrieval. It would also be beneficial to enhance the discussion of the limitations associated with using the Bible corpus as the primary dataset, addressing its implications for generalizability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify the algorithm's description, ensuring that all components, such as the outputs of the Conceptualizer, are accurately represented.
