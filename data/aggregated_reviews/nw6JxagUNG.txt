### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of automatic detection of subtle semantic shifts between social communities, focusing on political discourse from Reddit in English and Dutch. The authors analyze existing methods using static and contextualized embeddings and propose a masked token prediction approach. Their experiments reveal that contextualized representations struggle with detecting subtle shifts, while the masked token prediction method shows promise. The study also evaluates models on domain detection and sentiment analysis, providing a comprehensive analysis of various approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough evaluation of different models in a controlled manner, systematically comparing static and contextualized embeddings.
- The analysis is well-supported with meaningful experiments and discussions, contributing novel insights into lexical semantic change detection.
- The paper is clearly written and easy to follow, with a well-thought-out experimental setup.

Weaknesses:
- There is a significant lack of information regarding the dataset, including its nature, size, and ethical considerations related to data collection from Reddit.
- The experimental setup lacks clarity, particularly concerning the extraction of embeddings and the computation of evaluation metrics, which hampers reproducibility.
- The small size of the evaluation dataset (12 target words per language) raises questions about the generalizability of the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset description by providing detailed information about its nature, size, and distribution, as well as addressing ethical concerns related to using Reddit data. Additionally, we suggest including a clearer explanation of the experimental setup, particularly regarding the extraction of embeddings and evaluation metrics. It would also be beneficial to recalibrate the emphasis on the semantic shift simulation section and consider a comparison with findings from Ethayarajh (2019) to enhance the framing of their results.
