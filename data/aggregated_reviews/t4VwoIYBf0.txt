Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL), highlighting that the original GAIL cannot converge to the desired equilibrium. The authors propose Controlled-GAIL (C-GAIL), which achieves asymptotic stability and demonstrates improved convergence, reduced oscillations, and better approximation of the expert distribution across five typical MuJoCo control tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written with clear objectives and a novel approach to GAIL using control theory.
- The theoretical analysis is comprehensive, and the proposed method is simple to implement across various GAIL methods.
- Empirical results validate the theoretical claims, showing enhanced performance and stability.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis relies on several assumptions, and the final implementation is a rough approximation of these results.
- The experimental section lacks comprehensiveness; further validation in more GAIL variants and environments is needed.
- There is insufficient comparison with recent GAIL variants, focusing only on GAIL (2016) and GAIL-DAC (2018).
- A divergence exists between the theoretical motivation and the final algorithm implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by validating the effectiveness of C-GAIL across a broader range of GAIL variants and environments. Additionally, providing a separate discussion on the differences between C-GAIL and similar GAN methods would enhance clarity. It is also suggested to include comparisons with more recent GAIL variants and to elaborate on the implementation details of the linear negative feedback controller. Furthermore, addressing the undefined terms in the manuscript and including the expert reward baseline in Table 2 would strengthen the paper. Lastly, visualizing the state distributions of expert and learned policies would provide more convincing evidence of C-GAIL's effectiveness.
