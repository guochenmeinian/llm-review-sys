### Key Points
This paper presents Beam Enumeration, a method for exhaustively enumerating the most probable sub-sequences from language-based molecular generative models, specifically Augmented Memory. The authors propose a framework that enhances explainability and sample efficiency in generative molecular design through a four-step cycle, which includes beam enumeration and substructure extraction. The integration of on-policy reinforcement learning (RL) aims to improve the explainability of the extraction process. The method is evaluated as sample-efficient on practical molecular optimization benchmarks, achieving higher rewards.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The manuscript is well-written.  
2. The authors provide comprehensive experiments, ablation studies, and hyperparameter tuning.  
3. The empirical results are impressive.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The experimental setup, while robust, only includes Augmented Memory and REINVENT as baselines.  
2. The work heavily relies on Augmented Memory, with marginal additional contributions.  
3. The proposed method is heuristic, lacking a machine learning-based explanation or mathematical foundation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental setup by including additional baselines to strengthen the comparative analysis. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more substantial theoretical underpinning for the proposed method to enhance its credibility. Finally, we encourage the authors to conduct more solid experiments to validate the effectiveness of their approach in future work.
