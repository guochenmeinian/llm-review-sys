### Key Points
This paper presents a high-quality, methodologically rigorous survey of action recognition, integrating various aspects such as data, model architectures, and learning paradigms. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of action recognition, highlighting the transition from handcrafted features to sophisticated deep-learning models, including the role of vision-language models (VLMs) and transformers. The work is significant as it not only reflects on past advancements but also offers a roadmap for future developments, addressing underexplored areas like self-supervised and semi-supervised learning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive analysis of action recognition's evolution from multiple perspectives.
- Clear objectives and a cohesive overview of advancements, trends, and future directions.
- In-depth exploration of the integration of multimodal data and novel learning approaches.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of specific experimental results or quantitative evaluations to assess proposed methodologies.
- Absence of an open-source repository to organize relevant literature and a comparative experimental summary of results.
- Limited critical analysis of real-world challenges, such as computational scalability and ethical considerations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors include original experimental results, create a new taxonomy, or propose a unique framework for action recognition to enhance novelty. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the limitations of existing methods and datasets by providing practical solutions for scalability and annotation costs. Expanding the discussion on dataset biases and including an open-source repository would further strengthen the paper. Lastly, a more critical analysis of current methods' real-world challenges, including privacy concerns and societal impacts, would enrich the overall discourse.
