### Key Points
This paper presents a new time-independent inequality for likelihood ratios in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM), utilizing a PAC-Bayesian approach with a carefully chosen prior. The authors propose an application to GLM bandit models, enhancing a variant of GLM-UCB by improving the regret bound, which eliminates an exponential dependency on the norm of the unknown parameter. The paper discusses several GLM examples and includes minimal numerical experiments, effectively comparing the results with OFULLog+ in both theoretical and practical contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The submission is technically sound and presents a solid contribution to the field, particularly in the context of confidence sequences and bandit algorithms for GLMs. The proof is straightforward and easy to verify, which is a notable advantage over previous works.

Weaknesses:  
- The writing style may mislead readers due to overclaims and inaccuracies, detracting from the paper's quality. The main text primarily states results and describes GLM-UCB+ without sufficient depth, while the supplementary material lacks clarity and organization. Additionally, the experiments are limited in scope, lacking comparisons with relevant baselines and only focusing on logistic bandits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and organization of the supplementary material, ensuring that appendices are clearly titled and presented. The authors should also address the misleading claims throughout the paper, particularly in the abstract and introduction, to maintain a neutral tone. Expanding the experimental section to include comparisons with relevant algorithms, such as Emmenegger 2023 and Faury 2022, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Furthermore, we suggest providing more detailed explanations in Section 3.3 to enhance accessibility for non-expert readers. Finally, addressing the computational feasibility of maximizing the UCB on the proposed sets would significantly enhance the practical relevance of the results.
