### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the robustness of neural NLP models by exploring the relationship between discrete and continuous perturbations. The authors propose a method to connect these perturbations, quantifying their correlation and introducing a regression model, PerturbScorer, to predict this correlation. The primary contributions include quantifying the connection between discrete and continuous perturbations and validating the method through extensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study addresses a significant aspect of NLP research, focusing on model robustness.
2. The approach of applying continuous perturbation to address the challenges of discrete perturbations is innovative.
3. The two-stage methodology for mapping and predicting perturbations is well-structured and effectively demonstrated through experiments.

Weaknesses:
1. Many claims lack strong logical support, leading to ambiguity.
2. The generalizability of the proposed model is questionable due to the limited number of models and datasets studied.
3. Clarity issues arise in the explanation of equations and results, particularly regarding the relationship between discrete and continuous perturbations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims and provide stronger logical support for their assertions. Specifically, clarify the meaning of "correlation" in the context of the data tuple [S, P(S), \epsilon] and address the logical gaps in the verification of assumptions. Additionally, we suggest expanding the range of models and datasets to better demonstrate the generalizability of PerturbScorer. A theoretical proof regarding the existence of the norm-bound would also strengthen the validity of the proposed method. Finally, consider providing clearer explanations for figures and results, particularly in Section 4, and explicitly discuss potential applications of the work to enhance its impact.
