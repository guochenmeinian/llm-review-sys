### Key Points
This paper presents the application of graph neural networks (GNNs) for simulating microbial communities, specifically bacterial communities. The authors effectively motivate the use of GNNs, highlighting their advantages such as permutation invariance and the ability to model complex interactions within bacterial communities. The study provides extensive results and analyses, setting the stage for future research in this area. The authors also introduce a simulation framework for generating artificial data, which aids in benchmarking their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work addresses an interesting and underexplored problem in microbial community modeling.
- The methodology is well justified, showcasing novelty over existing methods.
- The simulation framework offers potential for rigorous benchmarking of future methods.

Weaknesses:
- The method is only compared with a weak baseline (MLP), and no comparisons with other models for bacterial community modeling are provided.
- The R² value is low (~0.3), indicating limited predictive performance.
- There is insufficient discussion on the generalization of the model when trained on larger communities and tested on smaller ones.
- The paper lacks methodological details, such as the connection between bacterial genome features and GNN nodes, and does not provide code for reproducing results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing additional methodological details, particularly regarding the connection between bacterial species/genome features and GNN nodes. We also suggest including comparisons with other baseline models to strengthen the evaluation of the GNN's performance. Furthermore, addressing the low R² values and discussing the limitations and potential biases of the simulation procedure would enhance the robustness of the findings. Lastly, providing code and scripts for reproducing the results would improve transparency and reproducibility.
