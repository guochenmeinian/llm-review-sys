### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of weak regret minimization in dueling bandits, introducing two algorithms: WR-TINF, which utilizes a reduction scheme to multi-armed bandits (MAB) and achieves optimal regret under certain conditions, and WR-EXP3-IX, which performs better when the optimality gap is small. The authors provide a lower bound on weak regret that aligns with the performance of WR-TINF. The work contributes to the understanding of weak regret, which is relevant for practical applications like recommendation systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* **Originality**: The authors apply known techniques to the under-explored problem of weak regret minimization, making a novel contribution to the dueling bandit literature.
* **Quality**: The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with clear proofs and a transparent discussion of limitations, particularly regarding the performance of the algorithms.
* **Clarity**: The paper is generally well-presented, with intuitive explanations and a solid experimental evaluation that supports the proposed algorithms.
* **Significance**: The exploration of weak regret is valuable for practical scenarios, and the established lower bound for WR-TINF aids future research in this area.

Weaknesses:
* **Minor Issues**: Several typographical errors and unclear notations are present, including issues with equations and phrasing that could be improved for clarity.
* **Scope Limitations**: The lower bound does not fully capture the complexity of the weak-regret setting, as it is proved for a narrow sub-family of instances. Additionally, neither algorithm is optimal across all scenarios, necessitating prior knowledge to select the better-performing algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proofs, particularly in Lemma D.2, by including intermediate steps to enhance understanding. Additionally, addressing the minor typographical errors, such as correcting "tan" to "than" and ensuring all equations are properly formatted, would strengthen the presentation. We suggest including the Modified Beat-the-Winner algorithm from [12] as a benchmark in the experiments to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of the unique Condorcet winner in the context of WR-TINF's performance and explore the potential for sublinear strong regret. Lastly, we advise condensing the Introduction, Contributions, and Related Works sections to eliminate redundancy and focus on the main methods earlier in the paper.
