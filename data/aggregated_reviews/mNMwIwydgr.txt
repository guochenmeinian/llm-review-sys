### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of 348 papers on bias in NLP published in the ACL anthology from 2010 to 2023. The authors categorize these papers by the type of social bias investigated, languages studied, and type of contribution. The findings indicate a predominant focus on gender bias and the English language, with under-studied biases such as religion, age, and disability. The paper identifies challenges and opportunities for future research in these areas.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The corpus serves as a benchmark for tracking the evolution of bias research in NLP, revealing progress and gaps.  
- The analysis highlights under-studied biases, languages, and methods, guiding future research directions and emphasizing the need for diversity in bias studies.  
- The authors provide a bias taxonomy and a broad overview of popular research topics, which can help shape community research focus.

Weaknesses:  
- The main contribution is descriptive and lacks new datasets or algorithms, providing only broad future recommendations without technical solutions.  
- The filtering process for paper selection is overly restrictive, potentially missing relevant works.  
- The structure of the findings section is unclear, mixing overview and discussion, and lacking a summarizing assessment of the field's direction.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of the manuscript to enhance readability and clarity in presenting findings. Specifically, a clearer division between prior and present work is needed, along with a tabular or graphical overview of the surveyed paper categories. Additionally, we suggest expanding the keyword filtering criteria to include more relevant terms and consider training a classifier to ensure comprehensive coverage. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more detailed technical solutions and actionable next steps based on their findings.
