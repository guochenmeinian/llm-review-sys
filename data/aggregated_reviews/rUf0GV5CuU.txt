### Key Points
This paper presents FourierHashNet, a novel approach for fast soft set containment search, extending traditional set containment to soft set containment through embedded representations. The authors propose a dominance similarity measure based on hinge distance, transformed into the frequency domain via Fourier transform, facilitating the application of traditional locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) techniques. The paper includes experiments demonstrating that FourierHashNet outperforms existing LSH algorithms on web log datasets, confirming its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed asymmetric dominance similarity measure is significant, enhancing retrieval efficiency and demonstrating a favorable trade-off between query time and retrieval quality.
- The paper is well-written, effectively communicating the technical aspects of the method, including Fourier transform applications and data-sensitive hash code learning.
- The study addresses a new and relevant problem with strong motivation from real-world applications, supported by extensive experimentation.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation and flow of the argument could be improved, with specific suggestions for clarity and consistency in terminology and notation.
- The main contribution is an asymmetric LSH function for a specific similarity function, raising concerns about broader applicability and generalization of the proposed techniques.
- The experimental evaluation lacks competitive baselines, as traditional LSH is no longer state-of-the-art, and comparisons with more advanced methods like FAISS-IVF or HNSW are necessary.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation by addressing specific points such as using standard notation for complex numbers, clarifying the definitions of the hinge distance, and enhancing the layout of experimental results for better readability. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating the generalizability of the proposed framework beyond the hinge distance and exploring its applicability to other search problems. To strengthen the experimental evaluation, we recommend including comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like FAISS-IVF and HNSW, and providing evidence of the hinge distance's significance in practical applications. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the definitions of terms used in the paper and to ensure that all components are cohesively integrated into the overall argument.
