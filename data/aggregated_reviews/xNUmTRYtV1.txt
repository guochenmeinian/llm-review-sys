### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of approximate message passing (AMP) algorithms for reconstructing a rank-1 signal corrupted by a symmetric matrix of block-constant noise. The authors derive the matrix formulation \( Y = x^* (x^*)^T/\sqrt{N} + A \odot \sqrt{\Delta} \) and propose an AMP algorithm that generalizes existing methods for rank-1 signals with Wigner noise. The state evolution is shown to converge and corresponds to the Bayes optimal estimator. Additionally, the authors introduce a spectral method that computes the principal eigenvector of a related matrix, suggesting it may outperform naive estimators.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The mathematical content is sound, with the main theorem proven in supplemental material, adding an algorithmic aspect to a well-studied model.
2. The proposed algorithm is optimal for the problem and is part of a larger class of AMP methods.
3. Numerical illustrations demonstrate the algorithm's performance in a simple case.
4. The linear method presented may replicate the performance of more complex AMP methods for hidden spikes.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks broader context for its technical results, focusing heavily on AMP theory and not sufficiently addressing the information-theoretic aspects of the model.
2. The main theorem is an adaptation of existing results, and while the non-iid noise aspect is somewhat unique, it does not significantly extend existing theorems.
3. The spectral method is inadequately developed, with key points left as conjectures and insufficient clarity on its implications.
4. The paper does not discuss practical considerations or applications, and there is no conclusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the contextualization of their results by discussing the information-theoretic properties of the model and the implications of their findings. Clarifying the significance of the linear method and its relationship to the AMP algorithm would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a rigorous proof for the claims regarding the spectral method's performance, particularly concerning its behavior under varying signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). Addressing the implications of unknown \(\Delta\) and discussing the practical implementation of the AMP iteration would broaden the paper's appeal. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the convergence and stability of the AMP algorithm, as well as its relationship to other estimators, to make the paper more accessible to a wider audience.
