### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to multi-channel fusion in the retrieval stage of recommender systems, addressing significant challenges such as sensitivity to weight combinations and the non-differentiable nature of selection processes. The authors propose a two-part methodology: a globally unified weight assignment using black-box optimization techniques (Cross Entropy Method and Bayesian Optimization) and a personalized weight assignment leveraging policy gradient methods. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets and real-world deployment demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline methods, with notable enhancements in precision, recall, and F-measure.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and organized, effectively motivating the importance of multi-channel retrieval in recommender systems.
- The innovative use of black-box optimization techniques provides a robust solution to the non-differentiable nature of the problem.
- Empirical validation through extensive experiments across multiple datasets and successful real-world deployment supports the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- Some sections, particularly methodology and preliminaries, are overly dense, potentially deterring readers unfamiliar with the techniques.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of computational efficiency and complexity, particularly for the personalized approach.
- Limited diversity in datasets used for experiments restricts generalizability, as all datasets focus on user-item interactions in e-commerce.
- There is insufficient analysis of existing solutions' inadequacies, and the term "inflexible" is not clearly defined.
- The paper does not address the convergence properties of the policy gradient approach or the implications of different initializations on results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology section to make it more accessible to readers unfamiliar with optimization techniques. Additionally, a detailed discussion on the computational efficiency and complexity of the proposed methods, especially regarding the personalized approach, should be included. We suggest testing the proposed methods on a wider variety of datasets to enhance generalizability. Furthermore, the authors should provide a clearer definition of terms like "inflexible" and analyze the convergence properties of their policy gradient approach, including training stability and the impact of different initializations.
