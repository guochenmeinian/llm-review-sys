Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OceanBench, an integrated framework designed to benchmark machine learning (ML) models using ocean satellite data, specifically addressing challenges related to sea surface height (SSH) interpolation. The authors propose that OceanBench can support a variety of oceanographic applications beyond SSH interpolation. They report baseline results from various methods and emphasize the framework's usability for both ML researchers and domain scientists. The authors have added a section to clarify the scope of problems OceanBench can address and have improved the literature review and dataset descriptions to better inform ML practitioners. Although basic visualization scripts are included, a fully developed visualization tool is outside the project's current scope.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**  
- OceanBench provides a comprehensive set of materials, including data, code, and tutorials, facilitating ease of use for researchers.
- The framework promotes benchmarking and reproducibility, allowing fair comparisons of ML models against established baselines.
- The authors have made significant revisions to clarify the scope and applicability of OceanBench, including specific examples of research questions relevant to oceanographers.
- Detailed tables describing dataset characteristics have been added, addressing previous concerns about insufficient information.
- The framework is positioned as a transparent platform that could facilitate the uptake of ML models into operational settings.

**Weaknesses:**  
- The introduction lacks a comprehensive background on the challenges of ocean satellite data, which may hinder understanding for some researchers.
- The paper lacks sufficient details about the datasets used, including critical characteristics such as size, dimensionality, and resolution, which may hinder understanding for ML practitioners.
- There is ambiguity regarding the relationship between OceanBench and its SSH edition, which could confuse users about its scope and applicability.
- The framework currently does not include advanced visualization tools, limiting usability for data exploration.
- Limitations regarding the dataset's geographic and temporal scope were not initially discussed, which could affect its applicability.
- Some technical aspects, such as the reference to a nonexistent equation and the use of acronyms without definitions, detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing a more comprehensive background on the challenges associated with ocean satellite data to enhance understanding for machine learning researchers. Additionally, we suggest that the authors improve the dataset descriptions by including essential characteristics like size, dimensionality, and resolution in the main paper. Clarifying the relationship between OceanBench and the SSH edition will enhance user understanding. We encourage the authors to consider developing more advanced visualization tools to support data analysis, as this would significantly enhance the usability of the OceanBench framework. It would also be beneficial to explicitly discuss the limitations of the dataset in terms of geographic and temporal scope within the main text, rather than relegating this information to the appendix. Lastly, we suggest addressing the confusion surrounding Table 2 in the appendix regarding RMSE results and ensuring that all acronyms are defined upon first use.
