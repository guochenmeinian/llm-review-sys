Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a sparse calculation technique for the attention mechanism in long-context large language models (LLMs) during the pre-filling stage. The authors propose a method that identifies optimal attention patterns—A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparse—offline for each attention head and dynamically adjusts hyperparameters during inference. The method effectively reduces pre-filling latency while maintaining information from long prompts, as demonstrated across three pre-trained LLMs and four datasets. Additionally, the paper analyzes the performance drop on GSM8K, primarily attributed to the extended context version LLaMA-3-8B-262K, which decreased from 78.9 to 63.8. The authors aligned the 8-shot prompt and evaluation script with lm_eval using the original LLaMA-3-8B, maintaining an average prompt length of 800 tokens. Experiments revealed significant performance losses across various methods, with MInference experiencing a 10.5 accuracy drop compared to Full Attention, and StreamingLLM and InfLLM showing declines of 14.6 and 22.3, respectively. The analysis indicates that effective methods currently exhibit considerable performance degradation in short-context scenarios, necessitating further optimization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Impressive results: The proposed method achieves a tenfold reduction in pre-filling latency for a 1M context without sacrificing accuracy.
- Well-motivated: The analysis and figures in Section 2 clearly illustrate key takeaways and effectively support the proposed method.
- Comprehensive summary in the related works section.
- Clear presentation of experimental results and their implications for future work.

Weaknesses:
- Generalizability concerns: The observations from the three LLMs may not apply to other models, particularly regarding the dynamic nature of the block-sparse pattern.
- Limited evaluation on larger models: The models tested are relatively small (<10B parameters), raising questions about the method's effectiveness on larger architectures.
- Insufficient discussion on generation/decoding stage applicability: The paper lacks analysis on whether the proposed method remains effective during the generation phase.
- Significant performance losses in short-context scenarios highlight a critical area needing improvement.
- MInference's severe hallucinations indicate a loss of reasoning capability under increased sparsity rates.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by providing additional analysis on how the observed attention patterns apply to a broader range of LLMs. It would be beneficial to evaluate the proposed method on larger models to ascertain its effectiveness in those contexts. Additionally, we suggest including a discussion on the applicability of the proposed method during the generation/decoding stage, particularly regarding the performance of the Vertical-Slash pattern. Furthermore, we recommend improving the optimization strategies for short-context scenarios to mitigate performance degradation. Addressing the hallucination issues in MInference should also be prioritized to enhance its reasoning capabilities. Finally, clarifying the dataset used in Section 2.2 and addressing the performance of the block-sparse pattern in Figure 3(c) would enhance the paper's clarity.
