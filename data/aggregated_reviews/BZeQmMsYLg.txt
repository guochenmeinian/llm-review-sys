### Key Points
This paper presents XMRED, a novel method for entity disambiguation that formulates the first retrieval stage as an extreme multi-label ranking. The authors aim to reduce the computational time required by contextualized neural language models by constructing a hierarchical label tree using TF-IDF features, derived from either Positive Instance Feature Aggregation (PIFA) or metadata from the Cirrus Search Wikipedia dump. The experimental results demonstrate XMRED's effectiveness and efficiency for the entity disambiguation task.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The novel formulation of the first retrieval stage as a multi-label ranking introduces faster operations compared to traditional contextualized language models.
2. The training of multiple one-versus-all linear SVMs for internal nodes reduces computational costs by focusing on negative samples from the same parent node.
3. The authors provide comprehensive evaluation metrics for both entity disambiguation and document retrieval, showcasing efficiency through comparisons with multiple baselines.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on TF-IDF features for building the label tree lacks experimental support, as other features like text embeddings could be more effective.
2. The reduction of training data for SVM models during tree traversal may lead to overfitting, particularly at the last level of internal nodes.
3. Pre-trained contextualized language models are better suited for integrating new entities into the knowledge base due to their ability to capture semantic matching signals.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental support for the choice of TF-IDF features by exploring alternative feature representations, such as text embeddings. Additionally, the authors should address the potential overfitting of SVM models by providing a more detailed analysis of the training data used at each level of the label tree. Clarifying the adaptability of XMRED to newly added entities would enhance the understanding of its applicability. Lastly, we suggest refining the framework figure for clarity and updating the baseline comparisons to include more recent methods from 2023.
