Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of endogenous distribution shifts in decentralized non-cooperative games, focusing on the performative effects of players' decisions on their environments. The authors establish sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of Nash equilibria (NE) and performative stable equilibria (PSE), and they provide a bound on the distance between these equilibria. A decentralized stochastic primal-dual algorithm is proposed for efficiently computing PSE, achieving sublinear convergence rates for performative regrets and constraint violations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper makes significant contributions to the formulation and solution of decentralized non-cooperative games with endogenous distribution shifts, presenting a richer model than existing works.
2. It bounds the distance between PSE and NE, an important result that characterizes the influence of distribution shift coefficients on equilibrium concepts.
3. The proposed primal-dual algorithm is computationally efficient and decentralized, with a regret rate that aligns with decentralized non-cooperative game settings.
4. Numerical experiments validate the theoretical results, enhancing the paper's credibility.

Weaknesses:
1. The work appears incremental, as it builds on existing studies of non-cooperative games under performativity without addressing fundamental difficulties in optimization found in variational inequalities literature.
2. The algorithm's reliance on players communicating through a graph with an irreducible and doubly-stochastic weight matrix simplifies decentralized optimization, raising questions about its applicability in competitive settings.
3. The analytical techniques of the proposed algorithm seem similar to those in existing literature, potentially limiting its novelty.
4. Some assumptions for the theoretical results require further justification, as they may appear artificial without alignment to the applications considered.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for Assumptions 2.1-2.5, providing examples that align these assumptions with the applications discussed. Additionally, we suggest clarifying how NE can be found under the performativity framework and comparing the proposed algorithm with existing techniques, particularly those in Wood and Dallâ€™Anese (2023). Addressing the concerns regarding the communication model in competitive settings and ensuring proper citation formatting throughout the paper would also enhance clarity and rigor.
