### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale analysis of donation-based scams across five major social media platforms, analyzing over 150,000 accounts and 3 million posts to identify 832 scammers and their tactics, including fake fundraising and cryptocurrency fraud. The authors validate their findings through collaborations with PayPal and Chainabuse, revealing significant gaps in platform safeguards and providing actionable recommendations for mitigating these scams. The study highlights critical vulnerabilities in social media protections against fraudulent donations and aims to establish a foundation for automating the detection and prevention of such schemes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Comprehensive dataset and robust methodology, including collaboration with industry partners for validation.
- The study addresses a critical social issue with significant financial implications, providing valuable insights into fraudulent activities.
- The paper is generally well-structured and presents a clear analysis of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The heavy reliance on proprietary tools like VirusTotal raises concerns about reproducibility and the completeness of data collection.
- The introduction lacks coherence and logical flow, with repetitive ideas that clutter the argument.
- Many critical technical details are missing, such as the selection and validation of keywords, platform-specific contexts, and the representativeness of the dataset, particularly the over-reliance on Telegram.
- The methodology is basic, lacking a learning approach or detailed evaluation of the proposed fraud detection methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the structure and coherence of the introduction to enhance logical flow and reduce repetition. Additionally, the authors should provide more detailed explanations of the technical terms and methodologies used, including how the 78 keywords were chosen and validated. To address concerns about data representativeness, we suggest including a broader range of platforms in the analysis and clarifying the reliability of the Apify API services. Furthermore, the authors should explore the scalability of their recommendations and discuss potential ethical considerations regarding the use of public data. Finally, we encourage the authors to incorporate a learning methodology and evaluate the effectiveness of their fraud detection methods using established metrics.
