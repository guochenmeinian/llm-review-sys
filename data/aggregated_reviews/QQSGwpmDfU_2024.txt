Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Progressive Contrastive Learning with Multi-Prototype method for unsupervised visible-infrared person re-identification (USVI-ReID). The authors propose Hard Prototype Contrastive Learning to emphasize divergence and Dynamic Prototype Contrastive Learning to maintain intrinsic feature variety. The method shows significant improvements over existing approaches, validated by experimental results on benchmark datasets SYSU-MM01 and RegDB, which demonstrate notable increases in mAP and Rank-1 accuracy. Additionally, the authors discuss the potential benefits of person re-identification (ReID) technology over facial recognition, emphasizing its applications in locating missing persons and enhancing customer experiences, while addressing concerns about its use in surveillance and military contexts. They clarify that their research does not raise direct ethical or safety issues, as it is based on publicly available datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is straightforward yet effective, with promising experimental results for the USVI-ReID task.
2. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with a clear motivation for the methodology.
3. The innovative approach of incorporating diversity information into contrastive learning is noteworthy, addressing existing challenges in the field.
4. The results significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods, showcasing the robustness of the proposed methodology.
5. The authors effectively address concerns about privacy and misuse by highlighting the controlled use of ReID in public surveillance.
6. They acknowledge the need for a limitations section and plan to discuss ethical and social implications in future revisions, aligning with NeurIPS guidelines.
7. The rebuttal demonstrates responsiveness to reviewer feedback, leading to an improved evaluation score.

Weaknesses:
1. The reliance on a strong baseline raises questions about the method's performance with alternative baselines, such as ADCA.
2. The introduction of a momentum backbone lacks a thorough explanation of its advantages.
3. The selection strategy for dynamic prototypes may require complex implementation and higher computational resources.
4. The paper lacks a limitations section, and the discussion of results often fails to provide meaningful insights beyond mere comparisons.
5. Some reviewers express skepticism about the appropriateness of publishing work related to surveillance technologies.
6. There is a perceived lack of discussion on the limitations and social implications of the technology in the original manuscript.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dynamic prototype selection strategy and provide more details on the cross-modality association strategy used in the paper. Additionally, we urge the authors to include a limitations section to address the assumptions made in the methodology and the implications of using distance in Hard Prototype Contrastive Learning. It would also be beneficial to conduct ablation studies on the impact of varying the E_CPCL constant and to clarify the relationship between the proposed method and existing literature on unsupervised learning and contrastive learning modifications. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors include a thorough discussion of the ethical and social implications of ReID technology to better align with the expectations of the NeurIPS community.
