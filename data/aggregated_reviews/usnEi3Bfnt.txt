### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to semantic graph parsing by introducing supertags that encapsulate local graph fragments, enhancing the parsing process through a preprocessing step. The authors demonstrate that these predicted supertags, constrained to form valid derivations, improve parsing accuracy and structural generalization metrics on the COGS dataset. The paper also incorporates technical innovations such as reducing argument identification to graph matching and proposing an early stopping criterion based on a different distribution from the test set.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach effectively formalizes local substructures in graphs, supported by strong experimental results.
- The integration of supertagging techniques shows significant performance improvements in semantic parsing.
- The authors transparently discuss limitations and provide insights into their methodology.

Weaknesses:
- Minor inconsistencies in notation and unclear details may hinder understanding for readers unfamiliar with the topic.
- The model's performance is competitive primarily with baseline graph-based parsers, lacking comparison with other structural models like Tree-LSTMs.
- The introduction of supertagging may complicate the parsing pipeline, potentially leading to increased ambiguity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by addressing the inconsistencies in notation and providing more detailed explanations of their approach, particularly regarding the implications of the one-word-one-concept assumption. Additionally, we suggest including comparisons with transformer models and relevant literature to enhance the completeness of the performance analysis. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand their results and discussions, particularly in relation to structural generalization, and to consider integrating insights from recent work on compositional generalization.
