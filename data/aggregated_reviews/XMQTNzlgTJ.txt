### Key Points
This paper presents a high probability convergence bound and almost sure convergence for the stochastic smoothed AGDA method applied to minimax problems in a nonconvex-PL setting. It is the first to provide such guarantees in this context, extending beyond previous results in convex settings. The authors also introduce a concentration bound (Theorem 9) that facilitates deriving high probability convergence results from expectation convergence results for minimax problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant open problem in stochastic smooth nonconvex minimax optimization and proposes the sm-AGDA method, which is theoretically sound and practically effective.
- The analysis includes a high probability complexity bound for the single-loop algorithm, which is a notable contribution.
- The authors provide solid theoretical proofs and experimental results that demonstrate the effectiveness of their method compared to existing algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the proof compared to prior works (references 63 and 68) is unclear, and the authors should clarify this aspect.
- There is confusion regarding the notation for step sizes in theorems and lemmas, which needs clarification.
- The paper lacks a detailed comparison of high probability bounds with existing results in expectation, which is crucial for assessing the contribution's significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their proof's novelty by explicitly discussing how it differs from the approaches in references 63 and 68. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the notation for step sizes in theorems and lemmas to avoid confusion. It would also be beneficial to include a comparison of their high probability bounds with existing expectation results to better contextualize their contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the unique aspects of the sm-AGDA algorithm that contribute to its superior performance in the experimental results.
