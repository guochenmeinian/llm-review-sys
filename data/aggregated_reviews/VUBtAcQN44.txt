Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a trajectory-aware spatial-temporal graph for video salient object ranking (VSOR), integrating instance-level temporal relations alongside spatial correlations. The authors propose a video retargeting method based on their VSOR model, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments. The work aims to enhance video saliency ranking by leveraging both spatial and temporal saliency cues.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The concept of modeling instance-level temporal relations is a clear advancement over previous frame-level approaches.
2. The application of the VSOR model to video retargeting yields promising results.
3. The integration of spatial and temporal saliency cues within a single graph facilitates joint optimization.

Weaknesses:
1. The claim of explicitly modeling motion trajectories is misleading, as the method does not accurately track or re-identify instances but rather approximates trajectories through local contextual features.
2. There is a lack of comparison with the latest salient object ranking methods, limiting the evaluation's comprehensiveness.
3. Experimental results are insufficient, with only a few methods compared, necessitating broader comparisons to strengthen claims of superiority.
4. The paper lacks clarity in certain sections, particularly regarding the motivation for using graph neural networks and the explanation of symbols in equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the accuracy of their claims regarding instance trajectory modeling, ensuring that the methodology reflects true tracking capabilities. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with more recent salient object ranking methods and expand the experimental results to include a wider range of approaches. Clarifying the dataset collection and annotation process with a flowchart would enhance understanding. Furthermore, addressing the confusion surrounding symbols in equations and providing more visual comparisons would significantly improve the paper's clarity and presentation. Lastly, a concise explanation of the performance discrepancies between DAVSOD and RVSOD is necessary for the revised version.
