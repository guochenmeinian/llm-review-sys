### Key Points
This paper presents ExMRD, an innovative framework for Micro-Video Rumor Detection (MVRD) that integrates multimodal data (text, audio, visual) with a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning mechanism called R³CoT. This mechanism involves three steps: Refining the original content, Retrieving relevant domain knowledge, and Reasoning to validate information. The framework aims to enhance detection accuracy while providing clear explanations for classification decisions, thereby improving user trust. The authors also propose a Small Language Reviewer (SLReviewer) to streamline predictions and reduce computational costs. Experiments on real-world datasets indicate that ExMRD significantly outperforms existing methods in accuracy and explanation quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The R³CoT mechanism effectively addresses challenges related to low-quality video content and the necessity for domain knowledge in rumor detection.
- The manuscript includes comprehensive experiments, such as ablation studies and hyperparameter sensitivity analysis, thoroughly evaluating the proposed method.
- The SLReviewer enhances prediction efficiency and reliability, making the framework practical for real-world applications.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient evidence is provided to demonstrate effectiveness on rumors relying more on visual cues or behavioral patterns.
- The issue of outdated information from MLLMs is acknowledged but not adequately addressed, lacking a mechanism for real-time data verification.
- The interaction between textual and visual refining is not fully explored, with no discussion on handling conflicts between these refinements.
- The necessity of the SLReviewer is not clearly justified, and comparisons with larger models for final predictions are absent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the R³CoT mechanism by providing detailed explanations of the individual steps, particularly how the refining and retrieving processes are operationalized. Additionally, the authors should address the criteria for dataset selection and discuss any biases that may affect result generalizability. To enhance the assessment of explainability, we suggest including specific metrics or user studies to evaluate the effectiveness of ExMRD's explanations. Furthermore, elaborating on the weaknesses of baseline methods that ExMRD addresses would strengthen the manuscript. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the practical applications of their work, including deployment scenarios and ethical implications associated with mis-predictions in the context of micro-video content.
