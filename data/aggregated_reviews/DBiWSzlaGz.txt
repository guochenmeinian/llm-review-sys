### Key Points
This paper presents PolySRL, a novel model that learns representations of crystals by integrating stoichiometry and polymorphic structural information. The authors conduct extensive empirical studies on sixteen datasets, including both wet-lab experimental and DFT-calculated data, demonstrating PolySRL's effectiveness in learning stoichiometry representations. The approach not only outperforms baseline models but also addresses uncertainties related to polymorphism, providing a comprehensive uncertainty analysis that enhances its applicability in material discovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. Innovative Approach: PolySRL addresses a significant challenge in materials science by incorporating polymorphic structural information into stoichiometry representation learning.
2. Extensive Experiments: The rigorous evaluation across a wide range of datasets supports the superiority of PolySRL over baseline methods.
3. Uncertainty Analysis: The in-depth analysis of uncertainties offers valuable insights into the model's performance and its complexities, making it a practical tool for material discovery.

Weaknesses:
1. Complexity: The model's multiple components may pose challenges for readers lacking a strong background in machine learning or materials science.
2. Practical Applicability: While the model captures uncertainties effectively, the inclusion of real-world use cases or applications would enhance its relevance in materials science.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how PolySRL performs in predicting new materials that outperform existing ones. Additionally, the authors should analyze the model's ability to advance the understanding of the connection between crystal chemistry and performance in specific applications, as demonstrating these capabilities could significantly enhance the model's impact in the field.
