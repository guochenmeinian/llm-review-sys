Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into how large language models (LLMs) regulate uncertainty in next-token predictions through two types of neurons: entropy neurons and token frequency neurons. Entropy neurons influence model confidence by operating within an unembedding null space, while token frequency neurons adjust the output distribution based on token frequency in the training data. The study includes empirical validation through ablation studies and cross-model analysis, demonstrating the roles of these neurons in managing prediction confidence, particularly in repeated sequence scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extensive experimental validation, including ablation studies and cross-model analysis, provides robust empirical support for the theoretical claims.
- The paper is well-written and accessible, effectively conveying complex concepts.
- It offers a mechanistic explanation of entropy neurons' operation through the unembedding null space and LayerNorm, enhancing understanding of their indirect impact on predictions.

Weaknesses:
- The use of entropy and distance from the token frequency distribution as proxies for confidence may not fully capture the complexity of confidence in language models.
- Variability in how entropy neurons influence model output via LayerNorm across different models suggests that architecture and training parameters significantly affect their roles.
- The connection between entropy neurons and token frequency neurons is unclear, raising questions about their interaction and distinct mechanisms.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between entropy neurons and token frequency neurons, explicitly detailing whether they interact or function separately. Additionally, we suggest providing a more precise definition of confidence in the context of LLMs. The authors should also analyze the impact of different normalization techniques, such as BatchNorm or RMSNorm, on entropy neurons. Furthermore, an exploration of how specific model features and training hyperparameters influence the effectiveness of entropy and token frequency neurons would strengthen the paper. Lastly, expanding the discussion on the results across various models and vocabulary sizes could enhance the overall contribution of the study.
