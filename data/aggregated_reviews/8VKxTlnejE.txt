Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MambaAD, a pioneering framework for multi-class unsupervised anomaly detection utilizing Mamba-based models. The core contribution is the Locality-Enhanced State Space (LSS) module, which integrates Hybrid State Space (HSS) blocks and multi-kernel convolution operations to effectively capture both long-range and local information. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across six diverse anomaly detection datasets, achieving significant improvements in efficiency and accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. MambaAD is the first to apply Mamba in the anomaly detection domain, representing a significant innovation.
2. The experimental results are state-of-the-art, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.
3. The paper is clearly written, with well-structured sections and effective visual aids.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for using Mamba in visual anomaly detection needs strengthening, particularly regarding the challenges of multi-class anomaly detection and the importance of long-range modeling.
2. Performance comparisons with only global/local branches in Table 5 would clarify the influence of individual branches.
3. Although MambaAD shows superior performance on most metrics, it does not outperform other methods on certain metrics, such as AUPRO on VisA, necessitating further analysis.
4. The reliance on a pre-trained CNN encoder raises questions about the implications of using Mamba solely in the decoder.
5. The ablation study in Table 3 appears limited, as only the Hilbert scanning method is utilized out of the proposed five hybrid scanning methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clearly articulate the challenges in multi-class anomaly detection and the significance of long-range modeling. Additionally, we suggest reporting the performance of the model with only global/local branches in Table 5 to better illustrate their individual impacts. An analysis of the metrics where MambaAD does not achieve the best performance, such as AUPRO on VisA, would enhance the discussion. Clarifying the choice of design that relies on a pre-trained CNN encoder while using Mamba in the decoder would also be beneficial. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the ablation study to include comparisons with other decoder architectures and to explore the sensitivity of the method to different scanning methods and directions.
