### Key Points
This paper addresses the challenge of distribution generalization in the traveling salesman problem (TSP) by proposing a novel approach based on genetic curriculum learning (GCL) that incrementally trains on harder distributions. The authors highlight the limitations of the baseline method, HAC, which struggles with instances deviating from a uniform distribution. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms HAC in complex scenarios. Additionally, the authors introduce a new dataset, TSPLib50, consisting of 10k TSP instances sampled from realistic distributions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of genetic curriculum learning to improve distribution generalization is a well-motivated and intuitive extension that effectively addresses the shortcomings of the baseline method.
- The proposed approach is interesting and has substantial contributions and results, improving performance on hard and practical TSP distributions.
- Statistical significance is reported for all experiments, demonstrating improvements in "worst-case" optimality gaps.

Weaknesses:
- The gains over HAC appear modest, raising questions about the practical significance of the enhancements in certain scenarios.
- The significance of the work is questionable, as LLMs have slow inference times and inconsistencies, with RL-based methods generally being more efficient for this task.
- There are concerns regarding the computational resources required for training, as genetic algorithms are often inefficient.
- The authors could have included real-life practical examples to demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and compared results with ChatGPT, which is claimed to have better reasoning capabilities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical significance of their findings by providing more substantial comparisons with existing methods, particularly RL-based approaches. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include real-life examples to illustrate the effectiveness of their approach. We also suggest comparing the results with ChatGPT to highlight the advantages of their method in reasoning capabilities. Finally, addressing the computational efficiency of the genetic curriculum learning approach would strengthen the paper's contributions.
