### Key Points
This paper presents DisamGCL, a novel method aimed at addressing ambiguity in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by identifying and disambiguating nodes through temporal inconsistency and contrastive learning. The authors analyze the impact of ambiguous nodes on representation learning, particularly in underrepresented graph areas, and conduct a fine-grained evaluation of GNN performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors provide a strong motivation for their work and conduct comprehensive experiments that validate the effectiveness of DisamGCL.
- The concept of ambiguous nodes is introduced, which is supported by experimental verification.
- The approach is evaluated using multiple GNN backbones and datasets, enhancing the robustness of the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The detection and correction methods are limited, relying primarily on predictive consistency, which may not fully capture minority regions.
- The experimental section lacks distinctive explanations and visualizations, and the results are based on small datasets, raising concerns about scalability and generalizability.
- The writing is unclear, particularly in defining the relationship between minority nodes and heterophily, which may confuse readers regarding the study's scope.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the introduction and characterization sections, to better convey the contributions of the paper. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed analysis of the experimental results, including comparisons with recent methods from 2023 and a discussion of the training time/cost relative to baseline models. It would also be beneficial to include a code repository link for replicability and to clarify the selection criteria for hyperparameters and the initial value of the memory cell used in their method.
