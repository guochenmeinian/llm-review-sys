Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on learning Multinomial Logit (MNL) parameters with delayed feedback, addressing the challenges of unknown MNL parameters and feedback delays in online advertising. The authors propose two algorithms, DEMBA and PA-DEMBA, for thresholded and non-thresholded settings, respectively, achieving optimal regret bounds of $\tilde{\Theta}(\sqrt{NT})$. The authors provide theoretical analysis and conduct experiments that support their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a first solution to a natural question in online advertising, assuming the results are correct.
- The bounds presented are fairly tight, and the paper includes an extensive literature review.
- The work is well-organized, with clear narratives and derivations, and provides a comprehensive theoretical analysis along with numerical experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The main results could be better presented, as the guarantees for DEMBA and PA-DEMBA appear identical, leading to confusion about their distinct contributions.
- The definition of "feedback observed by the seller" is inconsistent and potentially incorrect, which could invalidate parts of the analysis.
- The analysis does not consider learning the unknown delay distribution, and the setup may be too specific to this problem.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of the main results to clarify the differences between DEMBA and PA-DEMBA, as the current formulation obscures their unique contributions.
- We suggest providing a formal proof of the first passage of the proof of Lemma 4.1 to address inconsistencies in the definition of feedback.
- We recommend including more algorithms for comparison in the experimental evaluation, particularly MNL bandit baselines from related works.
- We encourage the authors to explore the impact of the skewness of the delay distribution on the regret bounds, as this could enhance the theoretical analysis.
