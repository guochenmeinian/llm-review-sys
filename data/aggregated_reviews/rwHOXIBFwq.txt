### Key Points
This paper presents a method for optimizing the stopping rule in Technology-Assisted Review (TAR) within information retrieval. The authors propose integrating text classification into existing counting process approaches to enhance the modeling of relevance rates. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of this integration through experiments on multiple datasets, showing improved stopping performance while maintaining recall.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant problem in information retrieval and proposes a novel solution that integrates text classification into TAR.
- Experiments are conducted on a diverse set of datasets, providing evidence of the method's effectiveness.
- The organization and methodology of the paper are well-structured and detailed.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with existing methods, particularly those utilizing text classification, is insufficient, limiting the evaluation of the proposed approach.
- The analysis lacks depth; it does not sufficiently explore the reasons behind the performance improvements or the limitations of the counting process.
- The improvement achieved is relatively small, and the solution may be considered cumbersome.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with previously published methods that use text classification to provide a clearer context for their contributions. Additionally, a more detailed analysis of the counting process's performance and the reasons for its limitations would enhance the paper's depth. Exploring different rate functions and providing substantial information on the behavior of the stopping rule under various conditions could strengthen the findings. Clarifying the methodology, particularly regarding sample point selection and the definition of relevant documents, would also benefit reader comprehension. Finally, addressing the readability of figures and tables in printed format is advisable.
