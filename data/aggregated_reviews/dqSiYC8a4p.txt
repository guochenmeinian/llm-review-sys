### Key Points
This paper presents IVPSEG, a novel system designed to capture error propagation within WebAssembly (Wasm) programs, utilizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to mine instruction semantics and employing graph neural networks (GNNs) and attention diffusion for optimizing instruction embeddings. The authors demonstrate that IVPSEG outperforms five existing approaches in terms of performance. The research addresses vulnerabilities caused by hardware faults, such as bit flips from RowHammer attacks, and proposes a semantic enhancement to the Code Property Graph (CPG) for vulnerability prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Effective modeling of contextual semantics of instructions, including data and control flow.
- Development of a prototype for fault generation and prediction.
- Empirical results indicate significant performance improvements over prior baselines.

Weaknesses:
- Unclear threat model and lack of evidence supporting the relevance of bit flip incidents in Wasm.
- Missing discussions on limitations and evaluation of efficiency.
- Presentation errors and unclear notations in equations.
- Insufficient analysis of the impact of various GNNs and LLMs on the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the threat model, explicitly addressing the frequency and consequences of bit flip incidents in Wasm systems. Additionally, the authors should discuss the specific challenges that IVPSEG addresses within the Wasm context and clarify why machine learning is necessary for vulnerability detection at the LLVM IR/Wasm binary level. We suggest including an evaluation of IVPSEG's efficiency and generalizability to unseen Wasm programs. Furthermore, enhancing the presentation and providing more detailed analyses of the GNNs and LLMs used would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the related work on vulnerabilities in WebAssembly with Code Property Graphs is essential for a comprehensive discussion.
