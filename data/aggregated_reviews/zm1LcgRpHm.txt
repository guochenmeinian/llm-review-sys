Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for time-series representation learning called Segment, Shuffle, and Stitch (S3). The method segments the original time series into non-overlapping parts, shuffles them in a learned manner, and stitches them back together with the original sequence. S3 is model-agnostic, incurs minimal parameter overhead, and demonstrates performance improvements in classification and forecasting tasks across various base models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method effectively captures inter-relations between distant segments through permutation.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with extensive experiments validating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The differentiability of the sorting process, particularly the calculation of permutation $\sigma$ from $P$, is unclear.
- The baseline models compared, such as Informer, are outdated; incorporating more recent models like Time-LLM, GPT4TS, and PatchTST would enhance the comparative analysis.
- The assumption that modeling non-adjacent dependencies is crucial lacks supporting case studies demonstrating the specific dependencies captured by S3.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the sorting process and its differentiability. Additionally, we suggest including more recent forecasting baselines to provide a clearer understanding of the proposed method's advantages. The authors should also consider adding detailed case studies that illustrate the types of non-adjacent dependencies effectively captured by S3, as well as visualizations of the segment permutations generated. Furthermore, conducting an ablation study would help elucidate the reasons behind the method's performance improvements.
