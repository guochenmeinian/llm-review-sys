### Key Points
This paper studies model-free exploration in low-rank MDPs, proposing an algorithm based on barycentric spanner, which is efficient under a weaker reachability assumption than previous works. The authors analyze both reward-free exploration and downstream reward-based tasks, providing theoretical guarantees. The algorithm, SpanRL, is designed to learn a policy cover efficiently with polynomial sample complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The writing is clear and easy to follow, with a comprehensive summary of prior research and a clear comparison of sample complexity results.
2. The proposed algorithm is modular, effectively combining barycentric spanner for exploration and representation learning, and introduces a novel reachability assumption.
3. The results extend existing work, applying to more general settings with comparable theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
1. The algorithm's efficiency is not empirically validated, raising doubts about its practical performance.
2. The contribution to representation learning is limited, primarily reusing existing algorithms and theoretical guarantees.
3. The paper lacks clarity on sample complexity, as it only provides guarantees on the total number of episodes without detailing the number of samples or trajectories.
4. The reachability assumption, while novel, requires better explanation, as it is less intuitive than previous assumptions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical validation of the algorithm to substantiate claims of computational efficiency. Additionally, the authors should clarify the contribution of the representation learning component and provide a detailed discussion of the algorithms deferred to the Appendix to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to explicitly state the sample complexity in terms of the number of samples or trajectories, as well as to elaborate on the intuition behind the new reachability assumption.
