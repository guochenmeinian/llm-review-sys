### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive overview of biological neural networks, detailing methods for data recording, manipulation, and training. The authors propose that leveraging these networks as computing substrates is significant, providing essential background information relevant to the computing community, which may not be fully aware of the associated challenges.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper offers a valuable introduction to the challenges of utilizing biological neural networks.  
- It serves as a useful primer for the computing community regarding biological neural networks.

Weaknesses:  
- There is skepticism about the feasibility of performing the backwards pass in a differentiable simulator, suggesting that modeling biological circuits may be more complex than the circuits referenced.  
- The discussion is heavily focused on principles and challenges, lacking sufficient exploration of the opportunities and unique computational characteristics of biological neural networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the opportunities and unique computational characteristics of using biological neural networks, balancing it with the challenges presented. Additionally, addressing the skepticism regarding the backwards pass in a differentiable simulator could enhance the paper's depth.
