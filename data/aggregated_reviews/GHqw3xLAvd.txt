### Key Points
This paper presents an end-to-end quantum algorithm for linear quadratic control problems, utilizing a quantum-assisted differentiable simulator that achieves a super-quadratic speedup over classical methods. The algorithm incorporates a novel quantum subroutine for solving the matrix Lyapunov equation, enhancing gradient estimation accuracy and robustness. The authors provide simulated results that support their theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The quantum application to linear-quadratic control problems is novel and offers significant computational benefits.
- The algorithm demonstrates a super-quadratic speedup, marking a substantial advancement in quantum computing for control problems.
- The paper is clearly written and provides numerical evidence of the method's robustness and favorable convergence behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The work is limited to the linear-quadratic control problem, and the experiments are insufficient, focusing only on simple abstract problems rather than practical applications.
- The implementation of the proposed algorithms on current quantum hardware may face challenges due to noise and limited qubit availability.
- The comparison with model-free approaches is not entirely fair, as the proposed method assumes access to the exact model.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by applying the proposed method to more complex, practical problems in the form of LQR. Additionally, the authors should clarify how the quantum algorithm handles cases where sparsity assumptions on matrices A, B, Q, and R do not hold. Providing detailed runtime performance comparisons with state-of-the-art classical algorithms would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, the authors should elaborate on the specific technical innovations of the quantum subroutine compared to existing algorithms and address the robustness of the proposed method to estimation errors in A and B when derived from samples.
