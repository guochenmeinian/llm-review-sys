Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a parametric continuous convolution (PCConv) framework for diffusion MRI (dMRI) that integrates spatial and angular dimensions, specifically addressing angular super-resolution. The authors enhance existing methods by incorporating Fourier feature mapping and domain-specific context, demonstrating competitive performance on various clinical tasks using sparsely sampled data. They also propose a modified parametric continuous convolutional neural network (PCCNN) that emphasizes the necessity of zero-filling in dense tensor computations to manage missing values without affecting gradient updates. The importance of denoising in the preprocessing pipeline is highlighted, particularly through the use of the patch2self method, which enhances angular super-resolution by predicting volumes based on other available data. The authors acknowledge limitations, including the small training dataset and the absence of augmentation techniques due to the complexities involved in dMRI data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method effectively utilizes the geometry of dMRI, addressing a significant gap in typical CNN approaches.
- The application of the PCCNN framework to dMRI demonstrates flexibility and potential for clinical applications.
- The integration of patch2self for denoising shows superior capabilities and is well-implemented within the methodology.
- The paper is well-written, providing a clear mathematical description and extensive experiments that validate the proposed method's performance.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of medical terminology sometimes obscures the motivation and clarity of the approach.
- The novelty of the work is perceived as limited, primarily being an application of existing methods rather than introducing fundamentally new concepts.
- The small sample size of 8 test subjects raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of the results.
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of varying results across experiments, and the absence of clear patterns in the results suggests potential issues with the model's effectiveness.
- There is insufficient exploration of the clinical relevance of super-resolution and the implications of under-sampling in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the data structure in the introduction by elaborating on the relationships between the series, b-vector, and multi-shell. Additionally, make it clear earlier that the goal is super-resolution from synthetically under-sampled data and discuss its clinical relevance, including whether under-sampling is common in practice and its potential to speed up acquisition.

We suggest increasing the sample size to enhance the robustness of the findings and consider cross-validation to provide clearer insights into model performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to conduct an ablation study to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component, particularly the impacts of angular kernel size and fixed radius. Clarifying the rationale behind the use of rotationally-invariant kernels and the necessity of zero-filling in experiments would also strengthen the paper.

A more detailed explanation of baseline methods, particularly how they handle angular data, is necessary to highlight what differentiates this work. Additionally, a thorough discussion of the varying results is needed to enhance understanding of performance discrepancies. We also recommend including a limitations section that discusses the method's performance across different datasets and the implications of using a limited sample size, as well as addressing potential risks associated with super-resolution in clinical settings. Finally, we suggest exploring the integration of equivariant networks as a comparative framework in future work to enhance the depth of the analysis and broaden the applicability of the findings.
