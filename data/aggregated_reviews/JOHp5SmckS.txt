Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel learning framework that utilizes machine learning to approximate chemical simulations, specifically focusing on charge-density prediction, which is proposed as a more generalizable target compared to traditional property predictions. The authors generate a charge-density based DFT dataset using an open-source computational chemistry engine and introduce a new performance metric (s-AUC) to evaluate modeling efficiency. The results indicate that the SCN model can achieve comparable precision to existing methods while being more computationally efficient.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Originality: The authors propose charge-density as a new learning target, motivated by a deep understanding of Kohn-Sham equations, with few prior works addressing this.
- Quality: The introduction of the s-AUC metric and a consistent dataset enhances the precision of modeling error rates.
- Clarity: The performance metrics are well-defined, and figures provide a clear overview of the SCN model's performance.
- Significance: The potential for machine learning models to significantly impact computational chemistry through charge-density modeling is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks comprehensive summary statistics of the SCN model's performance across the entire dataset, making it difficult to assess overall effectiveness.
- There is insufficient demonstration of how charge-density calculations can predict properties from other studies, limiting the significance of the findings.
- The release of related code and data is mentioned but not clearly highlighted in the main paper, which could enhance clarity.
- The evaluation of additional models on the dataset is absent, limiting the scope of the contribution.
- More data on compute efficiency improvements would strengthen the case for the proposed method's benefits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the summary statistics of the SCN model's performance across the entire dataset to enhance clarity and understanding. Additionally, it would be beneficial to demonstrate how charge-density calculations can lead to property predictions, showcasing comparisons with existing methods. Clarifying the availability of the dataset and related code in the main text would also improve transparency. We suggest evaluating additional models on the dataset or providing an explanation for their exclusion to broaden the contribution. Finally, including more data on compute efficiency gains would help substantiate the method's potential advantages.
