Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SEQUOIA, a speculative decoding algorithm aimed at enhancing the efficiency of large language model (LLM) serving through scalable and robust methods. The authors propose a dynamic programming approach to construct optimal token trees, achieving significant speedups of 4.04x for small models and 9.5x for large models with offloading inference. The method is evaluated across various decoding temperatures and sampling methods, demonstrating its robustness and scalability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The algorithm is novel, achieving substantial speedup and maintaining high hit-ratios across different sampling methods.
2. The paper includes extensive experimental results and ablation studies, providing a thorough evaluation of the proposed method.
3. The theoretical foundations for scalability and the dynamic programming approach are well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
1. The construction of optimal trees is more time-consuming than previous methods, potentially limiting the batch size that can benefit from speculation.
2. Comparisons with existing methods, particularly SpecInfer, may not be entirely fair due to differences in tree sizes and configurations.
3. The experimental setup for offloading is not clearly explained, raising questions about the conditions under which speedups are achieved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup, particularly regarding the configurations of the draft and target models during offloading. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive comparison with state-of-the-art methods, including speedups over SOTA approaches. Addressing the questions raised about the dynamic programming algorithm's efficiency and the positional acceptance assumption will also strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, exploring the performance of SEQUOIA with longer context lengths could provide valuable insights for future work.
