Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the phenomenon of "context hijacking" in large language models (LLMs), where repeated context can adversely affect a model's factual recall. The authors formulate an associative memory recall task and theoretically analyze one-layer transformer models, demonstrating their capability in this task and elucidating the roles of individual components. Empirical experiments validate these theoretical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study of how context influences language model generation is crucial for understanding and improving LLMs, particularly regarding hallucinations.
- The theoretical analysis of transformers in associative memory tasks could inspire future research and enhance understanding of transformer components.
- The paper is generally well-written and presents solid empirical evidence supporting its claims.

Weaknesses:
- The extent of context hijacking in more advanced models, such as GPT-4, remains unclear, as attempts to replicate the phenomenon were unsuccessful.
- The associative memory formation lacks semantic modeling, reducing its applicability to powerful models that rely on deeper understanding rather than surface cues.
- The term "associative memory model" is imprecisely defined, and the relevance of a one-layer transformer to context hijacking is questionable, as multi-layer models may better capture the mechanisms involved.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their work, particularly regarding the assumptions made about latent concepts and their generalizability to larger models. Additionally, we suggest including a dedicated "limitations" section that addresses potential negative impacts of context hijacking and the effects of quantization on associative memory. Clarifying the definition of "associative memory model" and providing examples of alternative models would enhance the precision of the argument. Finally, exploring the effects of context hijacking when prompts are placed in different positions within the input could yield valuable insights.
