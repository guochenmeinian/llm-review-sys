Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for spatiotemporal neural point processes (STPP) by introducing AutoInt for efficient integration of the intensity function. The authors convert the original triple integral into line integrals using the divergence theorem and Green’s theorem, while imposing a 3D non-negativity constraint on the integral network. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method across synthetic and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of AutoInt to solve the STPP problem is innovative.
2. The conversion of the triple integral to line integrals using divergence and Green’s theorems represents a strong methodological contribution.
3. The framework enhances model flexibility and accuracy compared to traditional integration methods.
4. Comprehensive experimental validation supports the claimed advantages of the proposed model.

Weaknesses:
1. An important reference on AutoInt for point processes is missing, necessitating clarification of the contributions relative to this work.
2. The presentation of Section 3.5 lacks clarity regarding the advantages of using line integrals.
3. The performance advantage of AutoSTPP over existing methods is not sufficiently highlighted.
4. Some parameters in the equations are not well-defined, and the discussion on limitations is superficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 3.5 by providing high-level explanations of the advantages of line integrals. Additionally, including more experiments on the spatio-temporal Hawkes process with non-separable influence functions would strengthen the paper. We suggest that the authors clarify the performance differences between AutoSTPP and other methods, particularly DSTPP and MonteSTPP. Furthermore, a more thorough discussion of the limitations of the method, including failure cases and complex intensity functions, would enhance the paper's depth. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore and discuss the applicability of their method in challenging scenarios relevant to science and technology.
