Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to cross-domain Federated Graph Learning, addressing the challenges posed by negative domain structural shifts. The authors propose the Generic Spectral Knowledge Sharing (GSKS) to facilitate the sharing of generic spectral knowledge among clients and introduce the Personalized Graph Preference Adjustment (PGPA) to cater to individual client preferences. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods across various scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The observation of spectral biases as reflections of structural shifts is well-motivated, leading to targeted solutions that acknowledge dataset-specific preferences.
2. The paper is coherent and easy to follow, with well-defined visualizations that enhance understanding of the framework and its components.
3. The innovative approach to structural heterogeneity in federated graph learning offers valuable insights for future research beyond cross-domain scenarios.

Weaknesses:
1. There is a lack of comprehensive comparative analysis of existing Federated Graph Learning (FGL) methods, particularly regarding FGSSL, which is mentioned but not discussed in detail.
2. The authors do not sufficiently differentiate their spectral encoder sharing method from other personalized layer methods, such as APPLE.
3. The scalability of the proposed method is not well analyzed, and the communication costs associated with the new architecture are not compared with baselines.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis of existing FGL methods, specifically addressing the shortcomings of FGSSL in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should discuss the differences between their spectral encoder sharing method and other personalized layer methods like APPLE. It is also essential to include experiments that evaluate the scalability of the method, particularly with varying numbers of clients, and to analyze the communication costs associated with the proposed architecture.
