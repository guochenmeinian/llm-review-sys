### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset and dialogue agents for agent-human negotiations, focusing on treating products as bundles for negotiation rather than solely on price. The dataset is generated semi-automatically through dialogue flows based on intents, utilizing a supervised and reinforcement learning paradigm with multiple relevant rewards. The authors provide a comprehensive set of experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of their approach through both automated and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The semi-automatic data collection technique is innovative and addresses challenges in gathering quality data, supported by rigorous post-processing and human evaluation.
- The authors define relevant rewards for negotiation that could inform future research.
- The paper includes a thorough evaluation, showcasing the proposed approach's superiority across various metrics.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed approach lacks clarity, particularly in the reinforcement learning formulation, including the definition of states, actions, and reward structures.
- The focus on win-win negotiations is undermined by an evaluation that primarily considers price, neglecting other items in the bundle.
- The paper does not adequately address existing literature on multi-issue negotiations, leading to misleading claims about novelty.
- There is insufficient critical analysis of the model's performance regarding intent accuracy and handling of bundle items.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the reinforcement learning formulation by explicitly defining states, actions, and the reward structure. Additionally, the authors should revise the evaluation to better capture the negotiation of multiple items in a bundle, potentially by incorporating rewards that reflect these items. It would also be beneficial to include a discussion of existing multi-issue negotiation datasets in the related work section to contextualize their contributions. Furthermore, we suggest adding critical analyses comparing intent accuracy and exploring how the model addresses other items in the bundle. Lastly, the authors should polish figures for clarity and ensure all technical terms and acronyms are defined.
