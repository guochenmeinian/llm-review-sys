Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to causal discovery using exchangeable data, moving beyond the traditional iid assumption. The authors prove causal analogs to de Finetti's theorem, demonstrating that certain conditional independences in an exchangeable distribution allow for the identification of a DAG with latent variables. The proposed causal discovery algorithm is evaluated using synthetic data from multiple environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The causal de Finetti theorems are philosophically significant and provide insightful graphical models that clarify causal mechanisms through latent variables.  
- The conditional independences derived from multiple environments are valuable for causal discovery algorithms.

Weaknesses:  
- The identifiability result is limited to Markovian models.  
- The experiments are simplistic and do not adequately evaluate the proposed method's strengths and weaknesses.  
- The related work section lacks references to foundational concepts and relevant literature, which diminishes the paper's context.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1a and consider either enhancing its expressiveness or removing it. Additionally, we suggest extending the identifiability results to non-Markovian models. The authors should also clearly delineate their contributions relative to existing literature, particularly Jensen et al. (2019) and the historical context of the Independent Causal Mechanism principle. Furthermore, we advise emphasizing the necessity of multiple environments earlier in the paper to clarify the data structure required for their methods. Lastly, we encourage the authors to conduct more comprehensive empirical evaluations, including comparisons with other causal structure learning algorithms such as FCI and GES.
