### Key Points
This paper presents a new method for gaze target detection (GTD) that introduces a depth-infused saliency map (DISM) and a multi-module fusion (MMF) architecture. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through comparisons with state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and conduct ablation studies to assess the impact of each module. The paper is well-structured, with a strong introduction and a comprehensive literature review addressing challenges in utilizing 3D information in 2D modalities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of the depth-infused saliency map is a notable contribution to the field.  
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, providing detailed information on methodology, experiments, and evaluations.  
- Thorough evaluation against multiple baselines enhances the credibility of the findings.  

Weaknesses:  
- The related work section lacks a clear discussion of limitations that the current work addresses.  
- Section 3.1, particularly subsections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, requires clearer explanations regarding the calculation of pseudo-labels for the DISM map.  
- The rationale for optimizing DISM using the Jaccard distance is not adequately discussed.  
- The analysis of the proposed method is insufficient, particularly regarding the performance on the GOO dataset and the evaluation of the DISM model itself.  
- The paper relies on pre-trained models from other datasets, raising questions about the source of performance improvements.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by clearly summarizing the limitations of previous approaches that their work addresses. Additionally, we suggest revising Section 3.1 for clarity, especially in subsections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2, to better explain the calculation of pseudo-labels. A brief discussion on the choice of the Jaccard distance as a loss function should be included. We also encourage the authors to validate their claims regarding the GOO dataset by testing reduced resolutions on other datasets. Furthermore, the evaluation of the DISM model's ability to predict pseudo-labels should be included, along with an exploration of how GTD performance would improve with ideal DISM maps. Lastly, sharing the source code would promote reproducibility in the field.
