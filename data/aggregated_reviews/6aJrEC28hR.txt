Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents graph-tuple neural networks (GtNNs), which extend GNNs to handle multiple graphs with a shared node set and non-commuting graph operators. The authors develop a mathematical theory to demonstrate the stability and transferability of GtNNs, culminating in a universal transferability theorem. They also introduce graphon-tuple neural networks (WtNNs) to aid theoretical derivation and provide experiments on synthetic data to support their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The authors propose a novel theoretical framework for GtNNs that quantifies transferability and stability, including a Universal transferability Theorem.  
2. A generative method for the graph sequence is introduced, enhancing the theoretical framework.  
3. The definition of WtNNs aids in theoretical derivation and contributes to the literature on GNNs.

Weaknesses:  
1. There are no experiments on real data to validate the transferability and stability gains compared to GNNs.  
2. The theoretical background is insufficiently detailed.  
3. The paper lacks clear reasoning phases connecting different sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the sections on non-commutative polynomials and operator filters by discussing related work on algebraic signal processing and defining neural networks on arbitrary measure spaces. Combining Corollaries 2 and 3 into a single corollary would enhance clarity. A more detailed explanation of Example 6 is necessary for better understanding. Including experiments with real data would strengthen the paper, despite its primarily theoretical contributions. A short conclusion should be added in the camera-ready copy. Additionally, clarify the introduction of "block operator" norms in line 494 and ensure that \| \cdot \| consistently refers to the \ell^2 norm throughout. Reorganizing Lemma 14 to precede its proof and adding more details to the proof of Theorem 7 would improve the paper's rigor. Lastly, consider releasing an anonymous GitHub repository to enhance reproducibility.
