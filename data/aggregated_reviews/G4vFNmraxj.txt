Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents GEMCODE, the first co-crystal design AI pipeline, which comprises four components: SMILES-based models for coformer generation, classification models for co-crystal property prediction, an evolutionary algorithm for coformer optimization, and a GNN for predicting co-crystal formation probability. The authors validate their approach through experiments on each component and the entire pipeline, establishing a comprehensive framework for co-crystal design. Additionally, the authors propose to address out-of-distribution generalization by splitting data based on Tanimoto Similarity, which maximizes dissimilarity among subsets. They acknowledge the challenges of applying molecular scaffolding due to the dataset's moderate size and the diversity of coformer structures. The significance of polymorphism in predicting mechanical properties is also recognized, with plans to enhance their models with additional theoretical validation methods for future co-crystals.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of generative AI into co-crystal design is significant for drug development, establishing a baseline framework that includes datasets, property prediction, coformer generation, optimization, and validation.  
- The paper is well-structured, with detailed experimental results and clear logic, making it easy to follow.  
- Extensive use of existing frameworks and datasets enhances the study's thoroughness, and the experimental evaluation is comprehensive.  
- The authors provide a comprehensive rebuttal and address reviewer concerns effectively.  
- The proposed method of using Tanimoto Similarity for data splitting is a promising approach to improve generalization.  
- The novelty and significance of the work in the context of pharmaceutical production and crystal engineering are well acknowledged by reviewers.

Weaknesses:  
- The accuracy and F1 scores of property prediction models are below 0.8, raising concerns about the impact of these biases on coformer generation and optimization.  
- The separation of coformer generation and optimization into two steps lacks justification, as both share the same property objectives without similarity constraints.  
- The validation of generated co-formers is limited, with a lack of comprehensive experimental testing to support claims about the pipeline's effectiveness.  
- The influence of polymorphism on mechanical property predictions is downplayed, despite its underreporting in literature.  
- The correlation between crystal structures' mechanical properties and intermolecular interactions requires further validation.  
- The diversity of generated coformers is not sufficiently explored beyond novelty metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by better organizing the various molecular representations and model architectures used throughout the pipeline. Additionally, we suggest including a more advanced hyperparameter tuning method, such as Optuna, for coformer generation to enhance model performance. It would be beneficial to quantify the coverage of chemical space using metrics beyond % validity and % novelty, and to provide clarity on the definitions of validity and novelty in the context of generated molecules. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to expand the validation experiments to include synthesis and physical testing of predicted co-crystals, as this would significantly strengthen the claims regarding the effectiveness of GEMCODE. We also recommend improving the discussion on the significance of polymorphism in their models and including a more robust validation of its influence on mechanical properties. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a deeper analysis of how intermolecular interactions affect predictions, particularly considering diverse bonding types. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the use of baseline models like Guacamol for multi-objective optimization tasks, ensuring that comparisons with their approach are clearly articulated.
