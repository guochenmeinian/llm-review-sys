Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the necessity for additional contrastive loss in diffusion models to reduce the Kullback-Leibler divergence, \(D_{KL}(p_t|| p_t^{SDE})\). The authors propose a method that combines contrastive loss with existing techniques, supported by theoretical analysis and empirical results demonstrating improved performance in pre-trained diffusion models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively analyzes the gap \(D_{KL}(p_0|| p_0^{SDE})\) to enhance diffusion models, providing a novel solution that is interesting despite not being the first of its kind.
2. The authors clearly articulate the utility of contrastive loss for diffusion models, offering valuable insights for future research.
3. Experimental results indicate robust performance when integrating the contrastive loss function with state-of-the-art acceleration methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The representation of the first item in the loss function \(I_{InfoNCE}(x_t^{SDE}, x_j^{SDE})\) resembles consistent loss, necessitating further analysis on the distinct roles of the second item and the differences between consistent and contrastive loss.
2. The discussion of discretization error in Section 3 overlooks other significant errors, such as estimation error from \(s_\theta\), which warrants a more comprehensive analysis.
3. The out-of-distribution (OOD) detection results are unsatisfactory, and the relationship between these results and the main contribution of the paper remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their analysis of the second item in the loss function \(I_{InfoNCE}(x_t^{SDE}, x_j^{SDE})\) to clarify the differences between consistent and contrastive loss. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed examination of other errors in the sampling process, particularly the estimation error from \(s_\theta\). To enhance the clarity of the OOD detection results, we advise the authors to explicitly connect these findings to the main contributions of the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to include qualitative comparisons and ensure that the code for reproducing results is made available.
