### Key Points
This paper presents a Procedure-Encoded Surgical Knowledge-Augmented Video-Language Pretraining (PeskaVLP) framework that addresses challenges in surgical video-language pretraining (VLP) by employing a hierarchical knowledge augmentation approach. The authors propose a system that integrates language supervision with visual self-supervision to enhance data efficacy and tackle spatial-temporal challenges in surgical scene understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot transferring performance and generalist visual representation across multiple surgical datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a unique hierarchical knowledge augmentation approach using large language models (LLMs), significantly improving the quality and diversity of textual data.  
- The PeskaVLP framework innovatively combines visual and language supervision, effectively addressing spatial-temporal challenges in surgical scene understanding.  
- Methodology is validated through extensive evaluations on datasets like Cholec80 and AutoLaparo, showing substantial performance improvements.  
- The clarity of presentation, with well-organized sections and effective visual aids, enhances comprehension.  
- The originality of the approach and detailed discussion on model architectures contribute significantly to advancing surgical data science.

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset size is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of findings; expanding the dataset to include more diverse surgical procedures is necessary for robustness.  
- The paper lacks a detailed methodology for handling ASR errors in transcriptions, which could be strengthened by providing specific techniques for improving transcription accuracy.  
- The practical implementation of the PeskaVLP framework in real-world surgical contexts is not thoroughly discussed, necessitating a detailed exploration of integration strategies and potential technological barriers.  
- Concerns exist regarding the potential standardization of text descriptions due to LLM augmentation, which may impact real-world applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by expanding the dataset to include a more extensive and diverse sample of surgical procedures. Additionally, the authors should provide specific methods for handling ASR errors in transcriptions and discuss their impact on analysis. A thorough discussion on the practical implementation of the PeskaVLP framework in clinical workflows, including strategies for addressing technological barriers, would enhance the manuscript. Furthermore, addressing potential negative societal impacts, such as data privacy and ethical concerns, is essential, along with a detailed discussion on data security measures and user consent protocols.
