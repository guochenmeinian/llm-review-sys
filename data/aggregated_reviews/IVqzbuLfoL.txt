Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a differentiable pruning strategy for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that focuses on pruning overlapping fragments rather than the traditional 3D Gaussian pruning. The authors propose an adaptive pruning framework that dynamically optimizes thresholds for each Gaussian fragment, leading to improvements in rendering speed and quality. The method is validated across various datasets and devices, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing rendering efficiency without compromising visual fidelity. Additionally, the paper evaluates three rasterization-based rendering pipelines—Mip-Splatting, GS-MCMC, and RAIN-GS—showing that the proposed fragment pruning method consistently improves rendering speed across these pipelines while achieving significant speed increases and higher PSNR values compared to original methods and baseline pruning techniques.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a thorough analysis of the efficiency bottleneck in the rendering pipeline and introduces a novel concept of fragment pruning.
- The adaptive optimization of pruning thresholds for Gaussian fragments results in significant improvements in rendering speed and quality.
- The experimental results validate the proposed method's effectiveness in both static and dynamic scenes.
- The proposed fragment pruning method enhances rendering speed by 1.4x to 1.9x across various pipelines while maintaining or improving rendering quality.
- The method demonstrates better accuracy vs. efficiency trade-offs compared to existing primitive-level pruning techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with a broader range of state-of-the-art Gaussian primitive pruning methods, particularly in dynamic scenes.
- The baseline selection for static scenes is unreasonable, as it primarily includes neural radiance field methods rather than rasterization-based methods relevant to 3DGS.
- Mini-Splatting was not included in the additional experiments due to time constraints, limiting the comprehensive evaluation of the proposed method's compatibility with all relevant techniques.
- The title and abstract do not accurately reflect the paper's contributions, and the concept of "fragment" is not clearly defined.
- The method's insight into learning Gaussian-wise thresholds lacks clarity, and the potential for naive methods to achieve similar results is not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with additional state-of-the-art Gaussian primitive pruning methods, particularly in dynamic scenes. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the baseline selection criteria for static scenes to focus on rasterization-based methods relevant to 3DGS. The integration of Mini-Splatting in future experiments should be prioritized to provide a more complete assessment of their method's compatibility with existing optimization pipelines. The title and abstract should be revised to better reflect the contributions of the paper, and the definition of "fragment" should be made clearer. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to elucidate the rationale behind learning Gaussian-wise thresholds and to address the potential effectiveness of naive methods in achieving similar outcomes.
