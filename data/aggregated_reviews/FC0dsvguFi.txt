Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Lung250M-4B, a novel dataset designed for intra-patient lung registration, comprising 248 paired CT scans from 124 patients along with corresponding lung vessel point clouds. The dataset addresses limitations of existing datasets, such as inadequate sample sizes and limited motion ranges, and includes a comprehensive evaluation of various registration methods. The authors provide preprocessing code and tools to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, the paper emphasizes the integration of image and point cloud data for medical applications, highlighting the potential for hybrid models that leverage the strengths of both data types. The authors conduct extensive benchmarking against various training setups, demonstrating the performance of models trained on the Lung250M-4B dataset compared to previous datasets. They also provide a detailed analysis of the accuracy and reliability of automatic corrField labels, which, while less precise than manual annotations, offer a denser and more cost-effective alternative.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is larger and more comprehensive than existing datasets, providing a valuable resource for researchers.
- The authors offer a clear description of the methods used for dataset generation and conduct a thorough evaluation of registration methods.
- The inclusion of both image and point cloud data represents a significant advancement in the field.
- The paper effectively addresses the reliability of automatic corrField labels and their impact on model performance.
- Additional experiments and results enhance the understanding of the dataset's influence on training outcomes.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset remains relatively small compared to the potential needs of the research community.
- There is a lack of detailed analysis regarding the accuracy and reliability of the correspondence labels, particularly automatic labels compared to manual annotations.
- Some aspects of the comparison with state-of-the-art methods could be further clarified to strengthen the argument.
- The paper could benefit from a more extensive comparison with existing registration datasets and methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by exploring a potential hybrid model that effectively leverages both image and point cloud data. Additionally, including more comparative methods in Table 2, particularly focusing on point-based registration methods, would enhance the evaluation. A detailed analysis of how corrField serves as a correct label should be provided, emphasizing its accuracy. Furthermore, we suggest elaborating on Figure 3 (c) to clarify the significance of the results presented. We also recommend improving the clarity of the comparison between models trained on the Lung250M-4B dataset and those trained on in-domain datasets, particularly regarding the implications of using manual landmarks. Lastly, providing more detailed insights into the potential biases in the dataset and their clinical implications, as well as enhancing the discussion around the accuracy of automatic labels in relation to manual annotations, would strengthen the paper.
