Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a learning pipeline named VLG-CBM, which enhances concept bottleneck models (CBMs) by utilizing open-domain object detectors for generating accurate concept labels and excluding irrelevant concepts. The authors introduce a metric called Number of Effective Concepts (NEC) to mitigate information leakage in CBMs, allowing for fair comparisons among different models. The authors argue that their contributions address limitations in existing literature, particularly regarding empirical observations and the lack of theoretical grounding. Experimental results demonstrate that VLG-CBM achieves improved performance while maintaining similar NEC levels across five standard datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The application of a grounding model for generating accurate concept labels is effective, as evidenced by experimental results.
2. The theoretical analysis of random CBMs elucidates the issue of information leakage, and the NEC metric provides a valid means to measure information provided to CBM classifiers.
3. The paper is well-written, facilitating comprehension of its main ideas.
4. The authors provide a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline that effectively addresses concept faithfulness in CBMs.
5. The NEC metric enhances the interpretability and flexibility of concept choices, improving the evaluation of CBM performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper only reports experimental results under controlled NEC conditions, hindering comparisons with previous works in conventional settings.
2. The approach of using a detection or grounding module for image annotation is not novel, as it has been explored in prior works, limiting the originality of the method.
3. The NEC's ability to control information leakage is unclear, and a study of time and compute complexity is necessary due to the reliance on large object detectors.
4. Some reviewers expressed concerns about the perceived novelty of the contributions, particularly regarding the new metric.
5. The generalizability of the method across various datasets was questioned, although additional results were provided to address this.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of VLG-CBM's performance under conventional settings to facilitate easier benchmarking against previous works. Additionally, an ablation study on the effectiveness of the grounding model and its impact on concept generation should be included. Providing qualitative examples of labeling results using Grounding-DINO would enhance understanding of the auto-labeled dataset's quality. Furthermore, addressing the concerns regarding the generalizability of the method and the potential limitations of relying on pre-trained models would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest including a section on the time complexity of concept set generation to provide a comprehensive analysis of the proposed method's efficiency.
