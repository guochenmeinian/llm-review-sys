### Key Points
This paper presents Graph Wave Networks (GWNs), a novel approach to dynamic Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that utilizes the graph wave equation instead of the traditional heat diffusion process for message-passing mechanisms. The authors argue that existing dynamic GNNs are limited in capturing wave-like propagation characteristics inherent in graph structures. By transitioning from a first-order partial differential equation to a second-order one, the paper theoretically and empirically demonstrates improved performance and enhanced temporal stability. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical framework, extensive experimental validation, and establish connections to spectral GNNs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is logically structured and effectively identifies the shortcomings of heat diffusion in dynamic graph message-passing.
2. It employs concise language, avoiding redundancy, and includes a comprehensive literature review.
3. The mathematical rigor and thorough validation support the stability advantages of the proposed model.
4. Extensive experiments demonstrate enhanced performance and stability across various datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments rely on "toy datasets" with limited node counts, raising questions about the model's scalability to larger datasets.
2. The heterophily datasets used may suffer from node duplication issues, potentially undermining the model's claimed superiority.
3. The baselines compared are outdated; incorporating more recent models would strengthen the paper's claims.
4. The mathematical formulations may be challenging for readers lacking a strong background in graph signal processing or partial differential equations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental validation by testing the proposed model on larger-scale datasets, such as ogbn-arxiv and Amazon-ratings, to demonstrate its effectiveness and scalability. Additionally, addressing the potential issues of node duplication in the heterophily datasets would enhance credibility. Updating the baseline comparisons with more recent models would further substantiate the claims made. Lastly, providing more intuitive explanations or simplified derivations of the mathematical formulations would increase accessibility for a broader audience.
