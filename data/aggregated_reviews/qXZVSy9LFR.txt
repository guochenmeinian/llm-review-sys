Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning system called Emotion-LLaMA, which integrates audio, visual, and textual inputs. The authors constructed the MERR dataset, consisting of 28,618 coarse-grained and 4,487 fine-grained annotated samples, to facilitate model training. The MERR dataset is derived from the MER2023 dataset and includes over 70,000 unannotated samples from publicly available media, with necessary permissions obtained. The Emotion-LLaMA model employs specialized encoders and instruction tuning, demonstrating promising performance across various datasets, including EMER, MER2023, and DFEW. The authors address concerns regarding data privacy, fairness, reproducibility, and broader impacts, emphasizing their commitment to ethical standards and the absence of significant biases in their findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, clearly detailing data annotation and model design, which enhances reproducibility.  
- Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance in emotion recognition and reasoning.  
- The methodology provides a valuable paradigm for emotion annotation of multimodal data.  
- The authors have taken steps to ensure data privacy and ethical compliance, including contacting original dataset authors for consent clarification.  
- The MERR dataset is designed to mitigate biases, with detailed scoring criteria provided to confirm fairness.  
- The open-source nature of the dataset enhances reproducibility, with comprehensive documentation available for researchers.  

Weaknesses:  
- The innovation is limited, relying on existing methods without addressing key problems.  
- The MERR dataset lacks systematic evaluation for label quality, raising concerns about its validity.  
- The selection procedure for the dataset remains unclear, particularly how samples were specifically chosen from MER2023.  
- There is insufficient detail regarding the connection between Action Units (AUs) and emotional expression, as well as the stability of this connection across contexts.  
- The complexity of the methodology and high computational resource requirements are not adequately justified.  
- The refinement process of annotations by LLaMA-3 lacks clarity, particularly concerning the protocols for human annotators and the definition of "preferences."  
- Insufficient analysis of experimental results and missing details on fine-tuning processes diminish credibility.  
- Training details necessary for understanding the approach are not fully included in the main paper, and there is a need for a more thorough human evaluation of the annotation process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the systematic evaluation of the MERR dataset's label quality to validate its contributions. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the selection process for videos in the MERR dataset by providing a detailed explanation of how samples were selected from MER2023. The authors should include references to support the connection between AUs and emotional expression, addressing the stability of this connection in various contexts. It is essential to clarify the LLaMA-3 annotation refinement process, including the protocols for human annotators and the definition of "preferences." Furthermore, we recommend incorporating more training details into the main paper to enhance understanding and conducting a more comprehensive human evaluation of the annotation process to be reported. Finally, justifying the chosen methodology and addressing the complexity and computational resource requirements would enhance the paper's rigor.
