### Key Points
This paper presents a new technique for cross-lingual abusive language detection, proposing MIXAG, a vicinal risk minimization-based data augmentation method. The authors aim to address resource scarcity in target languages by leveraging data augmentation and continual pre-training for domain adaptation. The experiments indicate that MIXAG significantly improves performance in multi-domain and multi-lingual environments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the novel data augmentation method MIXAG, which interpolates instances based on the angle of their representations, offers a fresh perspective.
- The paper effectively addresses the challenge of resource scarcity in target languages, providing practical solutions for enhancing model performance.

Weaknesses:
- Quantitative results are not convincing enough to demonstrate the superiority of MIXAG over existing methods, with unclear evaluations regarding its performance compared to baselines.
- Limited comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, such as XLM-R, and a lack of extensive ablation studies weaken the overall argument.
- The paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of MIXAG's impact on model performance and clearer presentation of results, particularly in figures and tables.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their quantitative results and provide a more detailed comparison with existing baseline methods. It would be beneficial to conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the contributions of data augmentation and domain adaptation. Additionally, we suggest including a more thorough explanation of the MIXAG method to enhance interpretability and insights into its effectiveness. Finally, we advise restructuring the paper to ensure important findings are not relegated to appendices and to replace bar graphs with tables for clearer presentation of numerical results.
