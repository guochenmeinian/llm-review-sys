### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance literature retrieval from PubMed for encephalitis-related research using a transformer-based embedding model. The authors propose a method that retrieves relevant literature even when exact keywords are absent, leveraging a dataset of query-document pairs generated by ChatGPT. The experimental results indicate the superiority of the embedding-based model over traditional keyword-based search engines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset and model are valuable contributions to the community.
- The code is clear and easy to read.
- The motivation for the research is strong, addressing a critical need in medical literature retrieval.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental results are limited, lacking a comprehensive performance assessment on the entire dataset.
- The paper provides insufficient information on the collected dataset, including data distribution and sample queries.
- The evaluation results require more interpretation and analysis.
- The explanation of how contrastive loss is calculated and how data variants contribute to this calculation is unclear.
- The title is overly long and could be shortened for clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a large-scale quantitative assessment of the model's performance, presenting metrics such as recall in a tabular format. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed information about the dataset, including its distribution and sample queries. Clarifying the calculation of contrastive loss and the use of data variants in this context is essential. We also advise shortening the title for conciseness and moving the "Links" section to footnotes for better layout. Finally, adding a graphical diagram to outline the pipeline would enhance the paper's clarity.
