Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on first-order stochastic algorithms under Markovian noise, differing from traditional i.i.d. noise. The authors propose SGD-like algorithms with variable batch sizes, particularly employing a randomized batch size strategy to balance noise variance and bias. They introduce an accelerated SGD algorithm that converges in the smooth strongly convex regime, with convergence rates dependent on the mixing time, maximal gradient noise, condition number, and strong convexity parameter. The paper also explores non-convex settings and variational inequalities under Markovian noise, introducing a Randomized Extra Gradient method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written and accessible, addressing an interesting topic in stochastic optimization under Markovian noise. The novel accelerated SGD analysis and the randomized batch size technique contribute to a near-optimal algorithm, supported by general lower bounds. The exploration of variational inequalities under Markovian noise is also a significant contribution.

Weaknesses:  
Concerns arise regarding the noise assumption, particularly the definition of the noise parameter $\sigma^2$, which may lead to confusion. Additionally, the non-convex rate comparison with existing literature is inadequate, as it overlooks stronger results from previous works. The paper lacks numerical experiments to validate theoretical claims, which is a notable limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the noise assumption, particularly regarding the definition of $\sigma^2$, and consider discussing its implications in Table 1. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer comparison of their results with related works, particularly addressing the non-convex rates and the absence of mixing time in some references. Including numerical experiments would enhance the paper's impact and validate the theoretical results, particularly regarding the linear dependence on mixing time.
