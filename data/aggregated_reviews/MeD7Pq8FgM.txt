### Key Points
This paper presents a method for estimating inner product matrices from incomplete data, focusing on eigenvalue corrections using random matrix theory, particularly the Marchenko-Pastur Law. The authors aim to enhance the accuracy of inner product and Euclidean distance matrices, which are vital for maximum inner product search (MIPS) and nearest neighbor search (NNS), especially under high missingness conditions. The approach is theoretically grounded and demonstrates robust performance in data imputation and similarity calibration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel, theory-driven approach that effectively addresses eigenvalue distortions in inner product matrices due to missing data.
- It provides rigorous theoretical analysis, including optimality proofs and error bounds, which validate the proposed method.
- Extensive experiments across multiple datasets show significant improvements over baseline methods in estimation error and similarity search tasks, particularly in high missing rate scenarios.
- The method's applicability to both i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. data enhances its relevance across various contexts.

Weaknesses:
- The method's robustness across diverse missing mechanisms, particularly MNAR, is insufficiently emphasized, as the theoretical development relies on the MCAR assumption. A clearer explanation of how the method generalizes to other scenarios would strengthen its claims.
- Some mathematical descriptions, especially regarding the Marchenko-Pastur Law, may be complex for readers lacking a strong background in random matrix theory, hindering accessibility.
- The paper lacks a discussion on potential failure cases, particularly regarding the neglect of eigenvector correction, which could impact tasks like clustering or dimensionality reduction.
- The experimental evaluation is limited to image datasets, raising concerns about generalizability to real-world information retrieval (IR) applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the method's applicability to various missing mechanisms by providing a detailed explanation of how its strengths enable generalization beyond the MCAR assumption. Additionally, simplifying the mathematical descriptions and providing intuitive explanations of key concepts, such as the Marchenko-Pastur Law, would enhance accessibility for a broader audience. A discussion on the implications of neglecting eigenvector correction and its potential impact on related tasks should be included to strengthen the paper's contribution. Finally, expanding the experimental evaluation to include standard IR test collections and a wider range of datasets would provide stronger evidence of the method's practical impact.
