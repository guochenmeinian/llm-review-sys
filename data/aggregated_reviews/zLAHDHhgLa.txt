### Key Points
This paper presents a new decoding method for dialogue response generation, termed isotropic and proximal search (IPS), which is based on the principles of locality and isotropy. The authors designed a decoding objective that optimizes for locality by maximizing the average cosine similarity between newly generated words and previously generated ones, and for isotropy by minimizing the cosine similarity between generated words and past utterances. The method was evaluated against other decoding strategies using two datasets, demonstrating superior performance in both automatic evaluations (BERTScore, MAUVE, G-EVAL) and human evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel decoding algorithm that effectively incorporates locality and isotropy, which are crucial for conversational responses.
- Comprehensive evaluations, including automatic metrics and human assessments, indicate that IPS-generated responses are superior to those generated by other methods.

Weaknesses:
- The ablation study's setup is confusing, particularly regarding the comparison of metrics (G-EVAL vs. MAUVE) and the rationale behind specific comparisons.
- There is a lack of direct analysis demonstrating how IPS enhances proximity and isotropy, as the employed metrics are generic.
- The human evaluation involved only five annotators, which may not provide sufficient statistical significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the setup and purpose of the ablation study, particularly the rationale for comparing different metrics. Additionally, we suggest providing a more direct analysis of how IPS improves proximity and isotropy, rather than relying solely on generic metrics. Increasing the number of annotators in the human evaluation could enhance the statistical significance of the findings. Furthermore, including more qualitative examples and surface-level statistics (e.g., utterance length, vocabulary coverage) would help assess the effectiveness of IPS more thoroughly. Lastly, we advise adjusting the claims in the conclusions and abstract to reflect the results of statistical significance tests.
