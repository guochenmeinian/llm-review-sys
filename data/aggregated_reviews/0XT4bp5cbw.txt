### Key Points
This paper presents "Ensemble Mashups: A Simple Recipe For Better Bayesian Optimization," introducing MMMA-BO (Multi-Model-Multi-Acquisition Function Bayesian Optimization), a framework that ensembles multiple Gaussian Process (GP) kernels and acquisition functions (AFs) to enhance Bayesian Optimization (BO) performance. The authors address the critical influence of kernel and AF selection by sampling pairs from predefined pools at each iteration, reducing the risk of suboptimal choices. Extensive experiments on 16 test functions from Botorch's suite demonstrate that MMMA-BO outperforms single-level ensemble methods in gap metrics, simple regret, and cumulative regret. The paper also analyzes various ensemble strategies, including fixed uniform weights and performance-guided adaptive weights.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Innovative Ensemble Approach**: The integration of multiple kernels and acquisition functions in a unified framework represents a significant advancement, offering a more comprehensive solution than previous methods.
2. **Comprehensive Experimental Evaluation**: The evaluation across 16 diverse test functions, with 25 independent simulations for each, provides robust empirical evidence of effectiveness.
3. **Clear Algorithmic Description**: The algorithm diagrams offer a clear and concise description of the MMMA-BO process, facilitating understanding and potential replication.

Weaknesses:
1. **Limited Theoretical Analysis**: The paper lacks a theoretical foundation explaining why ensembling both kernels and AFs improves performance, which would strengthen the contribution.
2. **Scalability Concerns**: There is no discussion on how MMMA-BO scales with an increasing number of kernels and AFs, which is crucial for understanding its applicability to high-dimensional problems.
3. **Ablation Studies Missing**: The absence of ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of ensembling kernels versus AFs limits understanding of the synergistic benefits.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis by providing insights into the convergence properties of MMMA-BO. Additionally, discussing computational complexity and scalability with an increasing number of kernels and AFs would enhance the understanding of the method's applicability. Finally, we suggest including ablation studies to systematically evaluate the contributions of each component in the ensemble, clarifying whether the combined approach offers synergistic benefits or if gains are primarily due to one component.
