### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the WANDA technique for pruning parameters in large language models (LLMs) to enhance safety by reducing successful jailbreaking attempts. The authors demonstrate that pruning up to 30% of an LLM's parameters can increase attention interaction with malicious tokens and elevate perplexity for jailbreak prompts, leading to fewer successful jailbreaks. The study also reveals that moderate pruning (around 20%) may initially improve defenses against jailbreaking, while results indicate that Llama-2 and Vicuna models exhibit robustness to attacks post-pruning, contrasting with Mistral's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical issue of LLM safety alignment through a novel pruning method.
- Experimental results across various malicious tasks suggest that pruning reduces successful jailbreak attempts while maintaining predictive performance.
- The findings regarding the unexpected robustness of pruned models are intriguing and contribute valuable insights into model behavior.

Weaknesses:
- The relationship between increased attention on malicious tokens and reduced jailbreak success remains unclear.
- The description of how WANDA prunes LLM parameters lacks clarity, necessitating a brief overview of the method.
- The writing quality requires improvement, particularly in sections that lack organization and rigor.
- Some results do not exhibit a consistent pattern, particularly with Mistral, and contradictory findings arise between different jailbreaking approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the WANDA pruning method by providing a brief description of its mechanics. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the writing quality for better organization and rigor, especially in the sections noted. Further theoretical analysis correlating interpretation methods with experimental results would strengthen the paper. Lastly, addressing the inconsistencies in findings, particularly regarding Mistral and the differing trends in jailbreaking tests, would provide a more cohesive narrative.
