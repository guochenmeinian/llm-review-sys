### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for generating adversarial passages to enhance the retrieval effectiveness of dense retrieval bi-encoder models. The authors aim to create passages that are likely to be ranked in the top k results for a set of queries by clustering training queries and iteratively modifying a random passage. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through empirical studies, showing that the generated passages frequently appear in ranked lists across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The investigation into the susceptibility of bi-encoder retrieval models to adversarial attacks is a significant contribution.
- The paper is well-structured, clearly explaining the methodology and providing sufficient empirical evidence of the attack's effectiveness.
- It includes basic experiments for defense strategies, showcasing a comprehensive approach.

Weaknesses:
- The paper primarily focuses on the bi-encoder architecture, lacking exploration of other dense retrieval architectures, such as cross-encoders or learned sparse representations.
- There is insufficient investigation into the similarity of queries across different collections relative to the training data, which affects the evaluation of poisoning vulnerability.
- The attack method bears similarities to the existing HotFlip technique, raising questions about its unique technical contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract and introduction by explicitly stating that their findings apply only to the bi-encoder architecture. Additionally, the authors should introduce and cite other dense retrieval architectures and include experiments with ColBERT in the Appendix. To enhance the evaluation, an investigation into the similarity of queries in different collections relative to the training data should be added. Finally, the authors should address the similarities with HotFlip to clarify their technical contributions and include comparisons to state-of-the-art works in the field.
