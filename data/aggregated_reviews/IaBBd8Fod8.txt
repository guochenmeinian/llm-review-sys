### Key Points
This paper presents a randomized pruning strategy adapted from iterative magnitude pruning (IMP), generating multiple masks based on weight magnitude and evaluating them for one epoch to select the best one. The authors propose that this method introduces controllable randomness, leading to improved performance across eight GLUE datasets. The approach is noted for its clarity, supported by readable pseudo-code, and demonstrates state-of-the-art results in various tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The method achieves consistent improvements over existing state-of-the-art pruning techniques.  
- The theoretical justification for the method's effectiveness is reasonable, and extensive experiments validate its performance.  
- The clear presentation and pseudo-code enhance reproducibility.

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of how randomness outperforms determinism lacks depth, and the motivation for using controllable randomness over magnitude-based methods is insufficiently articulated.  
- The performance gains are often minimal, with many improvements being less than 1%.  
- The training overhead introduced by the mask selection process is not adequately analyzed, and the computational costs associated with the proposed method remain unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of how randomness provides advantages over deterministic methods, particularly in relation to magnitude-based approaches. Additionally, a detailed comparison of the computational costs and training overhead of their method versus IMP should be included to clarify the practical implications of their approach. Furthermore, addressing the questions regarding the evaluation and selection of pruning masks, as well as the application of their method to larger models, would strengthen the paper.
