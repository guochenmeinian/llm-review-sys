Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the expressive power of pooling operators in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), deriving conditions under which a pooling operator can fully preserve the expressiveness of preceding Message Passing (MP) layers. The authors classify existing pooling methods based on their ability to distinguish non-isomorphic graphs using the Weisfeiler-Lehman (WL) test and introduce a new dataset, EXPWL1, to empirically validate their theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with effective theoretical and empirical analyses.
2. The introduction of the EXPWL1 dataset is a significant contribution, facilitating the evaluation of pooling expressiveness.
3. The empirical results align well with the theoretical predictions, demonstrating the effectiveness of pooling operators that meet the derived conditions.

Weaknesses:
1. The discussion on the limitations of the work is insufficient, particularly regarding the applicability of results to continuous node features.
2. The presentation of experimental results could be improved, particularly in Figure 3, which lacks standard deviation bars.
3. The classification performance is evaluated on a limited dataset, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of their work, explicitly addressing cases where their theory may not apply. Additionally, we suggest including standard deviation bars in Figure 3 to better represent the variability of accuracy across datasets. The authors should also consider expanding their experimental evaluation to include comparisons with a broader range of pooling operators and datasets, such as those mentioned in the reviews, to strengthen their claims. Furthermore, clarifying the relationship between the ability to retain graph information and the expressiveness of pooling operators would enhance the theoretical foundation of the paper.
