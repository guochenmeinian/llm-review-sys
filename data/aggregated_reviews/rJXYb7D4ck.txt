### Key Points
This paper presents a tagging-assisted encoder-decoder model for aspect-opinion-sentiment triplet extraction (ASTE), enhancing the decoding process through an additional sequence labeling task. The model identifies aspect and opinion terms while the decoder pairs them using these labels. The authors demonstrate state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across four datasets and validate the model's effectiveness in related tasks such as AOPE and ABSA. The proposed Tagging-Assisted Generation Model with Encoder and Decoder Supervision (TAGS) further improves semantic information utilization and extraction of implicit aspects and opinions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The combination of sequence labeling and generative approaches effectively enhances performance in ASTE tasks.  
2. Experimental results across four datasets validate the proposed approach's effectiveness, including in sub-tasks like ABSA and AOPE.  
3. The paper is well-written, with thorough ablation studies and analyses that clarify the model's contributions.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The work is somewhat incremental, relying on previously established algorithms without significant novelty.  
2. There is a lack of detailed discussion on the practical applications, scalability, and compatibility of the TAGS model with various data types.  
3. The paper does not compare the TAGS model against a broader range of state-of-the-art methods, limiting the evaluation of its effectiveness.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the potential practical applications of the TAGS model, including its scalability and compatibility with different data types. Additionally, we suggest including a comparison with a wider range of state-of-the-art methods for ASTE to provide a more comprehensive evaluation. Finally, addressing the limitations of the TAGS model, such as sensitivity to hyperparameters and performance on diverse datasets, would strengthen the paper.
