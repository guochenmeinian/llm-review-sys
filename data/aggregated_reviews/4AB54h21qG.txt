Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlexSBDD, a novel deep generative model that enhances structure-based drug design (SBDD) by incorporating protein flexibility in the generation of 3D ligand molecules. It utilizes Apobind to create apo structures from known holo structures and employs advanced flow matching to learn apo-holo dynamics, achieving efficient generation of drug-like molecules in 20 steps. Experiments demonstrate that FlexSBDD outperforms traditional methods, including auto-regressive and diffusion-based models, in generating high-affinity ligands.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The focus on protein flexibility addresses a critical limitation in current SBDD methods, enhancing the model's relevance.
2. The methodology respects the characteristics of different modalities, employing various flow matching techniques that improve sampling efficiency.
3. The paper introduces innovative approaches such as data augmentation and a well-composed geometric neural network architecture, contributing to performance improvements.
4. Experimental results are compelling, showcasing the effectiveness of the proposed model.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation primarily follows standard SBDD methods, lacking thorough discussion on the quality of Apobind-generated apo structures and the implications of protein flexibility on affinity.
2. The model does not adequately demonstrate its capability for conformational searches in cases where apo and holo pockets differ significantly.
3. There are concerns regarding the stochastic nature of ligand generation, which may lead to biased docking scores.
4. The architecture's novelty is diminished as similar flow matching techniques have been previously implemented in other works.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by providing a more detailed analysis of the quality of Apobind-generated apo structures and the generated holo structures. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on how protein flexibility enhances affinity for fixed holo structures. It would be beneficial to include more focused results on the binding interface and to clarify the connection between apo structures and affinity in fixed holos. Furthermore, addressing the methodological choices regarding side-chain conformation predictions and including atom numbers in comparative tables would enhance the rigor of the analysis. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore flexible docking tools to compare the performance of FlexSBDD against other baselines.
