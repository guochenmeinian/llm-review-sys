### Key Points
This paper presents the Authentication Workflows Accessibility Review and Evaluation (AWARE) framework, a semi-automated tool designed to assess various authentication methods for security and accessibility issues specifically for blind and visually impaired users. The study explores critical challenges faced by these users in authentication systems, particularly with two-factor and passwordless methods, and systematically evaluates a range of screen readers and authentication mechanisms. The findings identify vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations for developers to enhance the usability and security of authentication workflows.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a significant research question, contributing to a more inclusive web authentication environment.
- The semi-automatic approach of AWARE is reasonable and aids in evaluating authentication mechanisms prior to user studies.
- Comprehensive examination of various authentication methods and screen readers, yielding interesting conclusions.

Weaknesses:
- The delineation between insights from this work and prior works integrated into AWARE is occasionally unclear.
- The discussion of findings could benefit from a more high-level summary, potentially shortening the detailed analysis in Table 3.
- Lack of technical details regarding the framework's design, implementation, and experimental setup diminishes clarity and impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the insights derived from their work versus those from prior studies, particularly in Section 4.3. Additionally, providing a high-level summary of findings would enhance readability. We suggest incorporating more technical details about the framework's design and implementation, including how errors in speech-to-text conversion are handled and whether the framework was tested on mockup systems or existing websites. Furthermore, including information on the experimental design, the number of testers, and their expertise would strengthen the methodology. Lastly, we encourage the authors to consider extending the AWARE framework to accommodate other accessibility devices, such as Braille displays, and to explore the potential for enhancing automation to reduce manual intervention.
