Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on hypothesis testing for discrete distributions, focusing on identity, closeness, and uniformity testing using a predicted data distribution. The authors propose an "augmented tester" that reduces sample complexity when the prediction is accurate, while remaining robust against inaccuracies. The paper includes lower bounds to justify the optimality of the proposed algorithm and provides experimental evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The idea of augmenting hypothesis testing with additional information is compelling.  
- The proposed algorithm effectively reduces sample complexity when predictions are accurate, and the inclusion of lower bounds enhances the paper's comprehensiveness.  
- The paper is well-motivated, thoroughly detailed, and includes experimental validation.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's structure is somewhat unconventional, presenting theorems before introducing the algorithm, which may confuse readers.  
- Some key details are relegated to the appendix, potentially detracting from the main narrative.  
- The comparison with related works, particularly regarding "perfect predictors," may lead to confusion.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by introducing the proposed algorithm earlier to enhance clarity. Additionally, providing more intuition behind the algorithm and its use of additional information would be beneficial. We suggest clarifying the comparison with related works, particularly regarding the notion of "perfect predictors," to avoid confusion. Lastly, consider including a more detailed mathematical setup for applications involving evolving unknown distributions to strengthen the argument.
