### Key Points
This paper presents a training-free memory selector, TRAMS, aimed at enhancing memory efficiency in Transformer-XL models. The authors propose a ranking-based method for selecting top-k memory tokens, demonstrating its effectiveness through experiments on datasets like WikiText-103 and enwik8. The results indicate a reduction in perplexity (PPL) and bits per character (BPC) when using TRAMS compared to standard Transformer-XL.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the proposed method.
* TRAMS is a novel and effective memory-selection algorithm that integrates easily with existing transformer-based models.
* The experimental setup is comprehensive, and the authors compare their method with state-of-the-art techniques.

Weaknesses:
* There is a lack of detailed discussion on the results and their implications.
* The paper would benefit from more experimental results and theoretical justifications to support the claims.
* Incomplete content makes it challenging to grasp the full context and impact of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of discussion regarding the results to provide insights into their implications. Additionally, we suggest including more experimental results to strengthen the claims made about TRAMS. The authors should also consider providing theoretical justifications for their method to enhance its robustness. Furthermore, addressing the incomplete content will help clarify the paper's overall impact.
