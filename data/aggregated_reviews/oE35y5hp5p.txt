Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We note that the paper presents a vision language model-based agent for autonomous driving, utilizing a closed-loop simulation on Carla, which is a novel approach. Additionally, the LoRA fine-tuning method employed is more efficient than that of previous works, such as GPT-Driver. We recommend acceptance of this paper.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
The strengths of the paper include its innovative use of closed-loop simulation and the efficiency of the LoRA fine-tuning method. However, we identify a weakness in the lack of comparison with related work, specifically Agent-Driver, which could enhance the paper's context and relevance.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest including a comparison with Agent-Driver to strengthen the paper's contributions and situate it within the existing body of research.
