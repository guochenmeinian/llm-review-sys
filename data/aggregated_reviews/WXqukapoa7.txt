Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel policy, DISC, aimed at managing uncertain perturbations in dynamical systems by learning a confidence parameter online. The authors focus on integrating predictions from machine learning (ML) tools into linear quadratic control (LQC) frameworks, addressing the reliability issues of ML predictions. The key innovation of DISC is its ability to dynamically learn the confidence parameter, enhancing performance regardless of prediction accuracy. Theoretical results provide competitive ratio bounds for DISC under various conditions, and experiments validate its effectiveness in real-world scenarios such as drone navigation and voltage control. The DISC algorithm requires minimal computational overhead similar to model predictive control (MPC), primarily due to the disentanglement algorithm and the online learning procedure for the confidence parameter $\lambda$. The computational cost of disentanglement is generally efficient, with the FastICA algorithm completing in under a second, and the online learning procedure involves gradient computation that can be efficiently executed within seconds. Preliminary results for nonlinear mixing functions are promising, although more challenging.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a dynamic confidence parameter that adapts online is a significant advancement in integrating ML predictions into control systems.
- The paper offers theoretical guarantees for DISC, demonstrating its robustness and consistency through competitive ratio bounds.
- Experimental validation in real-world applications confirms DISC's practical relevance and effectiveness.
- DISC's adaptability to varying prediction accuracy and environmental changes is a valuable feature for real-world applications.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of the computational efficiency of the DISC algorithm.
- The rebuttal significantly enhances the manuscript's clarity, addressing potential reader confusion.
- Preliminary results for nonlinear mixing functions are encouraging, indicating potential for further exploration.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions, such as the continuity and invertibility of the mixing function, which may not hold in all scenarios.
- The datasets used in experiments may not fully capture the diversity of real-world applications.
- The method's complexity may pose challenges for implementation in real-time systems with limited computational resources.
- The writing is difficult to follow, with abstract concepts and technical details introduced without proper definitions.
- Some clarifications may seem obvious but are necessary for readers unfamiliar with the details.
- The implementation details regarding the FTRL procedure for learning $\lambda_t$ require further elucidation to ensure clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by defining abstract concepts and technical terms more explicitly, particularly in the introduction. Additionally, the authors should provide a clear update rule for the confidence parameter $\lambda_t$ to enhance reproducibility. We suggest including a more extensive comparison between DISC and existing robust control methods to clarify its performance in terms of consistency and robustness. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the implementation details regarding the FTRL procedure for learning $\lambda_t$, specifically addressing whether a gradient-based method is used or if a closed-form solution is available. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the extension of DISC to nonlinear dynamical systems and provide preliminary results or insights on this potential direction.
