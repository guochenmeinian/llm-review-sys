### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach to enhance topic segmentation in long documents through two methods: Topic-aware Sentence Structure Prediction (TSSP) and Contrastive Semantic Similarity Learning (CSSL). TSSP aims to improve the model's understanding of sentence structure related to topics, while CSSL focuses on learning semantic similarities and differences between sentences. The experimental results indicate significant improvements in topic segmentation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the problem statement and proposed solutions.
- The introduction of TSSP and CSSL provides fresh perspectives on topic segmentation.
- Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed methods have limited applicability beyond topic segmentation, which may reduce their impact on the broader research community.
- The additional computational cost of TSSP and CSSL is unmeasured, raising concerns about their practicality.
- Details regarding the sampling of negative pairs in CSSL and the random replacement of topics in TSSP are unclear.
- The motivation for the methods lacks depth, and the novelty is questioned due to similarities with conventional approaches.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the methodology by providing detailed explanations on how to sample negative pairs in CSSL and how to replace topics in TSSP. Additionally, addressing the potential computational costs associated with TSSP and CSSL is crucial. We suggest incorporating recent advancements in topic contrastive learning to strengthen the paper's relevance and impact. Finally, enhancing the motivation for the proposed methods and ensuring that the design is specifically tailored for long documents would improve the overall quality of the work.
