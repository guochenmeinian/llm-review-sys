### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Poisson-Gamma Dynamical Systems (PGDSs) to model non-stationary dynamics by allowing transition matrices to evolve over time, utilizing three variations of Dirichlet Markov chains. The authors develop a fully-conjugate Gibbs sampler for inference through Dirichlet-Multinomial-Beta data augmentation techniques. Experiments indicate improved predictive performance compared to existing models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The extension of PGDS models to incorporate time-varying transition dynamics is significant and relevant.
- The proposed Dirichlet Markov chains enhance the model's ability to capture non-stationary dependencies.
- The development of a closed-form Gibbs sampler for posterior inference is noteworthy.

Weaknesses:
- The assumption that the transition kernel is static within each sub-interval limits the model's flexibility. The authors should justify their choice for discrete-time transition kernel changes.
- The evaluation of experimental results lacks statistical rigor, particularly in the confidence intervals and comparisons with benchmark methods, raising concerns about the claimed improvements in data smoothing and forecasting performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the static transition kernel within sub-intervals and explore the implications of allowing varying lengths for these intervals. Additionally, please clarify the number of learnable parameters and the computational complexity associated with each proposed model. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest providing the parameters for benchmark methods in the appendix, bolding indistinguishable results in Table 2 using statistical tests, and reassessing conclusions based on these evaluations. Lastly, consider merging overlapping sections to streamline the presentation.
