Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an extension of Nesterovâ€™s accelerated gradient algorithm to N-player games, termed "follow the accelerated leader" (FTXL). The authors propose both continuous and discrete-time versions, demonstrating super-linear convergence when initialized close to the Nash Equilibrium (NE). The method's effectiveness is validated through simulations. The integration of momentum and regularization into the algorithm allows for quadratic convergence rates, which are shown to be applicable under various information oracles, including bandit feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents a significant and novel contribution with clear explanations of the accelerated algorithm and its local super-linear convergence.
- The rigorous analysis and simulations confirm the theoretical results, particularly the accelerated convergence rates.
- The integration of momentum and regularization is a novel viewpoint that enhances the understanding of convergence in finite N-person games.

Weaknesses:
- The requirement for sufficiently close initialization to the NE is not clearly defined, and the authors should clarify the implications of this condition.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding the assumptions on the convexity of the payoff function, leaving questions about the convergence properties in non-convex scenarios.
- The transition to the continuous-time version (FTXL-D) could be smoother, and the correspondence between variables in the game and the HBVF interpretation needs clarification.
- The notation for continuous and discrete-time regimes could be better distinguished to enhance readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions regarding "sufficiently close" initialization and discuss the likelihood of iterates falling within this "good neighborhood." Additionally, the authors should provide a sketch of the proof highlighting the main techniques used to achieve quadratic convergence in non-convex settings. A smoother transition in the explanation of FTXL-D and clearer analogs between game variables and HBVF interpretations would enhance understanding. Finally, including a table to distinguish notations for continuous and discrete-time regimes would improve readability.
