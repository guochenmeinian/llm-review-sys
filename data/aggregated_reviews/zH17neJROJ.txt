### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for constructing equivariant kernels in Gaussian processes (GPs) that alleviates the computational burden associated with traditional integration methods, particularly in molecular chemistry applications. The authors introduce an "integration-free equivariant kernel" build-up approach, demonstrating significant reductions in computational demands while maintaining promising modeling performance. The methodology involves identifying a fundamental domain, a projection mapping, and a section, which are crucial for the kernel construction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The problem definition is clear and accessible, making the paper valuable for both chemists and the broader machine learning community.
- The inclusion of a toy example aids in understanding the proposed methodology and highlights computational performance improvements.
- The concluding perspectives are well-thought-out and visionary.

Weaknesses:
- The transition to the example setting is confusing, as $\mathbf{x}$ is initially defined as $\mathbf{x} \subset \mathbb{R}^{3\times s}$, but the example uses $D=\mathbb{R}^3$.
- In Section 4, the notation for $p$ should be clarified, and the type of norm used for $\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\rVert_2^2$ needs specification.
- Units should be included on the y-axes in Figure 1.
- The LogS score requires explanation.
- The empirical evaluation is limited, lacking an ablation study for the integration-based approach and a comparison with Glielmo et al. (2017).
- A section in the appendix introducing practical aspects for a non-technical audience would enhance understanding, particularly regarding the derivation of $A$, $\Pi$, and $s_\Pi$.
- Limitations of the proposed method are not discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the transition to the example setting for clarity. In Section 4, please clarify the notation for $p$ and specify the norm used for $\lVert \mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}'\rVert_2^2$. Additionally, include units on the y-axes in Figure 1 and provide an explanation of the LogS score. Expanding the empirical evaluation to include an ablation study and a comparison with Glielmo et al. (2017) would strengthen the paper. We also suggest adding an appendix section to introduce practical aspects of working with equivariant kernels for a non-technical audience. Finally, discussing the limitations of the proposed method would provide a more balanced perspective.
