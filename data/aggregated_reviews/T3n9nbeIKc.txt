### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis and mitigation of dataset biases in Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks with long answer choices. The authors propose two methods: Adversarial Data Synthesis (ADS), which generates synthetic factual and counterfactual data, and Intra-sample Counterfactual Training (ICT), which enhances model training through intra-sample differentiation. The methods are evaluated across multiple benchmarks, showing consistent improvements in model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses the significant issue of dataset bias in VQA tasks and offers innovative methods for mitigation.  
- The ADS method effectively synthesizes data to reduce biases, while the ICT method improves model training.  
- The structure of the paper is clear, and it provides extensive empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:  
- The synthetic image generation may introduce noise, necessitating additional human supervision to control quality.  
- The inference process appears to be time-consuming, with insufficient analysis comparing its time consumption to other baselines.  
- The backbone model used is considered somewhat outdated, and the overall performance improvement is not markedly superior to previous methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quality control of synthetic images to mitigate noise issues. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the time consumption of the proposed methods compared to other baselines. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider utilizing more state-of-the-art models, such as OFA or BLIP2, to enhance the relevance and performance of their approach.
