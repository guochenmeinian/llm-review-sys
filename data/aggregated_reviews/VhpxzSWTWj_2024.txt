Aggregated Review:
**Key Points**  
We note that the findings demonstrate the system's ability to expand its repertoire of landmarks over time, successfully completing navigation tasks of varying complexities, from basic point-to-point navigation to complex multi-landmark objectives with natural language instructions. Based on the experiments and ablation study, we recommend a `weakly accept` for this paper.

**Strengths and Weaknesses**  
The strengths of the paper lie in its effective demonstration of the system's adaptability and performance across diverse navigation tasks. However, the review does not explicitly mention any weaknesses, indicating a generally positive assessment.

**Suggestions for Improvement**  
We suggest that the authors consider further elaborating on the implications of their findings and possibly addressing any limitations identified during the experiments to enhance the paper's overall impact.
