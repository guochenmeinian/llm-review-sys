### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to off-policy evaluation (OPE) in contextual bandit settings, introducing the Policy Convolution (PC) estimator. The authors address the distribution shift between logging and target policies, which often leads to high variance in importance sampling, particularly in large action spaces. The PC estimator utilizes action embeddings to create a bias-variance trade-off by convolving the logging and target policies. The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the PC estimator through simulations and experiments, highlighting its potential to reduce mean squared error in scenarios with significant policy mismatches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The concept of the PC estimator is innovative and effectively addresses a critical gap in off-policy estimation.
- Extensive evaluations showcase the robustness of the PC approach across various scenarios.
- The paper is well-structured, facilitating comprehension of core concepts and methodologies.
- Clear discussion of the assumptions underlying the PC approach enhances understanding of its applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of figures is cluttered, making it difficult to interpret results.
- The abstract lacks specificity regarding the focus on the contextual bandit problem.
- Insufficient theoretical justification for the claim that "offCEM" and "groupIPS" are special cases of PC.
- Comparisons primarily focus on basic policy estimators, neglecting other methods utilizing latent action information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their figures to enhance interpretability by reducing clutter and using distinct line styles. Additionally, the abstract should explicitly state the paper's focus on the contextual bandit problem. To strengthen the theoretical foundation, we suggest providing formal derivations to clarify the relationships between PC and other methods, such as "offCEM" and "groupIPS." Furthermore, the authors should consider including comparisons with other latent action information methods to validate the effectiveness of the PC estimator comprehensively.
