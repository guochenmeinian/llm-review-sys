Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an autoencoder-based object detection model that predicts object positions in an unsupervised manner, providing theoretical guarantees on detection error. The authors analyze how error relates to encoder and decoder receptive field sizes, object sizes, and Gaussian widths, validating their theoretical predictions through synthetic experiments and CLEVR-based evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with a valuable investigation into the theoretical bounds of unsupervised object detection.  
- The method offers theoretical guarantees on recovering true object positions, enhancing interpretability and robustness compared to traditional approaches.  
- The analysis of existing models, such as SAM and CutLER, reveals their error rates in relation to the proposed method's bounds.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation primarily relies on synthetic datasets, raising concerns about generalizability to real images and videos.  
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on experimental implementation, including training procedures, input-target pairs, and overfitting prevention.  
- The authors do not sufficiently justify the requirement for dynamic objects or the Gaussian assumption, and the decoder's ability to reconstruct complex shapes beyond spheres is unclear.  
- The related works section could better differentiate between object representation learning and explicit object position detection.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their training procedures and the significance of positional encoding in the model. Additionally, the authors should address the generalizability of their findings by including experiments on real images or videos. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the model's performance on non-rigid or partially occluded objects. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of dynamic objects in their approach and explore potential methods for handling more complex shapes. Finally, we encourage the authors to refine the related works section to emphasize the distinctions between their method and others focused on unsupervised object localization.
