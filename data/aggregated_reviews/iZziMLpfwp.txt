### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for reconstructing graphs using Personalized PageRank (PPR) embeddings, unifying various PPR-based node embedding methods. The authors propose two methods for graph topology recovery—an analytical method and an optimization method—demonstrating through extensive experiments that PPR-based embeddings retain more topological information than random-walk-based embeddings. The work offers novel insights into the capacity of PPR and provides a solid theoretical foundation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Innovative Framework: The introduction of the PPREI framework is a significant contribution.
- Comprehensive Theoretical Analysis: The paper includes rigorous proofs supporting the efficacy of the proposed methods.
- Extensive Empirical Validation: Experiments on real-world large graphs validate the proposed methods.
- Unified Approach: The framework integrates various PPR-based methods, simplifying the design of interpretable node embeddings.

Weaknesses:
- Limited Visualization Diversity: The reliance on line charts limits data presentation; a broader range of visualization techniques is needed.
- Insufficient Explanation of Motivation: The motivation for PPR-based embeddings is inadequately addressed, relying too heavily on prior experimental results.
- Lack of Clarity in Architecture Description: The absence of schematic diagrams makes understanding the model architecture challenging.
- Scalability and Efficiency Considerations: The paper lacks a detailed discussion on scalability and computational efficiency for large-scale applications.
- Open Source Availability: The absence of open-sourced code restricts replication and further research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the practical applications of PPR-based node embeddings, particularly in fields like social network analysis and bioinformatics. Additionally, a more explicit discussion of the paper's limitations, including challenges in implementing the PPREI framework across different graph types, would enhance clarity. We suggest including a schematic diagram to better illustrate the model architecture and considering a wider variety of visualization techniques for data presentation. Furthermore, addressing the scalability and computational efficiency of the PPREI framework in large graphs is crucial. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide open-sourced code to facilitate replication and further exploration of their findings.
