### Key Points
This paper presents a model for spatial representation in the hippocampal formation, utilizing a residue number system (RNS) to encode positions as high-dimensional, complex-valued vectors. These vectors are integrated into a single representation through a conjunctive vector-binding operation, supported by a modular attractor network that reflects grid cell modules in the entorhinal cortex. The model claims robustness to noise, high-resolution encoding, and effective path integration, while also proposing testable hypotheses for future experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The RNS approach maximizes coding range and spatial information per neuron.  
- The integration of principles from neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence provides a comprehensive framework.  
- The model is supported by rigorous theoretical analysis and empirical experiments, demonstrating noise robustness and precise spatial representation.  

Weaknesses:  
- The model lacks direct analyses demonstrating its effectiveness in compositionality.  
- There is minimal comparison to existing models regarding coding range, robustness to noise, and biological plausibility.  
- The complexity of the model may hinder practical implementation and validation in biological systems.  
- The evaluation primarily relies on simulated trajectories without external references to assess its empirical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the model by providing direct analyses to demonstrate its effectiveness in compositionality and by including comparisons to existing models regarding coding range and robustness. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify the biological plausibility of the RNS as a coding mechanism and propose specific experiments to empirically test the model's predictions. It would also be beneficial to address how the model's complexity can be reconciled with biological realities, ensuring that the theoretical framework aligns more closely with neurobiological details.
