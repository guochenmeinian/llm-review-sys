Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents AutoDP, an innovative AutoML framework designed for multi-task learning (MTL) in electronic health records (EHR) that optimizes task grouping and model architecture. The authors propose a surrogate model-based optimization approach that efficiently explores a vast search space, demonstrating superior performance on the MIMIC-IV dataset compared to traditional single-task and automated methods. The framework aims to reduce human intervention in the design process, thereby enhancing prediction accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- AutoDP introduces a novel automated approach that reduces reliance on human experts, streamlining the identification of optimal task combinations and architectures.
- The use of surrogate model-based optimization and a progressive sampling strategy is innovative and efficient, leading to improved performance.
- Experimental results validate the efficacy of AutoDP, showcasing substantial gains over existing methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a runtime comparison with other baselines, raising questions about the claimed "feasible search cost."
- Generalization concerns exist regarding the applicability of AutoDP beyond disease prediction in EHR data.
- The architecture search space is not sufficiently detailed, and the paper does not discuss model interpretability, which is crucial for clinical decision-making.
- Limited evaluation on a single dataset restricts the generalizability of findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Figure 1 to enhance its comprehensibility for readers unfamiliar with EHR modeling. Additionally, consider incorporating AUPRC as an evaluation metric to address potential class imbalance in clinical prediction tasks. To bolster the generalizability of AutoDP, we suggest conducting experiments on additional EHR datasets and discussing the transferability of the model to different clinical scenarios. Furthermore, providing more details on the architecture search space and the progressive sampling strategy would enhance understanding. Lastly, addressing privacy concerns related to EHR data and discussing data imbalance issues would strengthen the paper's contributions.
