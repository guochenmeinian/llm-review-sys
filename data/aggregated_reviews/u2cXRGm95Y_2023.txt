Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents UrbanKGs, a unified urban knowledge graph dataset aimed at enhancing urban spatiotemporal predictions. The dataset comprises millions of triplets from New York and Chicago. The authors implement 15 KG embedding methods and evaluate them on the KG completion task, integrating the embeddings into spatiotemporal models for five downstream forecasting tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of KG embeddings. Additionally, the authors propose a method for enhancing downstream tasks by concatenating learned KG embeddings with spatiotemporal features. They acknowledge the need for clarity regarding the training and integration of KG embeddings and have made corrections to inconsistencies in the text, while also addressing limitations in their approach and discussing future enhancements.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with an interesting premise of using urban knowledge graphs to enhance downstream tasks.
2. A comprehensive range of KG embedding methods is implemented, with empirical results indicating that product space-based methods yield superior performance.
3. Significant improvements in five downstream USTP tasks validate the effectiveness of the embeddings and suggest new research avenues.
4. The availability of the complete dataset (13.71 GB) and the authors' responsiveness to reviewer comments have led to significant improvements in clarity and detail.

Weaknesses:
1. The dataset's accessibility is limited, as only part of it is available on GitHub, and the complete dataset is not accessible via Google Drive.
2. The paper lacks clarity regarding the licenses for the code and dataset, and there is no dataset maintenance plan mentioned.
3. Instructions for data preprocessing and reproducing experimental results in the GitHub repository are unclear and insufficiently detailed.
4. There was an initial lack of clarity regarding dataset availability and preprocessing instructions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve dataset accessibility by providing the complete dataset and clarifying licensing information. Additionally, a dataset maintenance plan should be included. The authors should enhance the clarity of the GitHub repository by providing detailed instructions for data preprocessing and experimental reproduction. Furthermore, we suggest unifying the terminology for "spatiotemporal" throughout the document and addressing minor inconsistencies in the text, such as clarifying the platform for querying road network data and providing explanations for terms at their first occurrence. Lastly, the authors should consider including standard deviations in their results to better illustrate variance and address the limitations of their dataset in relation to generalizability across different urban contexts.
