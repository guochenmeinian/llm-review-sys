### Key Points
This paper investigates the impact of self-influence scores in identifying self-influential examples, which are hypothesized to be memorized and difficult to predict from other examples. The authors propose that these scores are properties of data rather than dependent on model architecture and initialization. The study explores the stability of self-influence scores against various model states and architectures, and demonstrates how this knowledge can enhance training and out-of-distribution generalization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The contribution is novel, with well-executed experiments that support the findings.
- The idea of using self-influence scores for data filtering is intriguing and has potential practical applications.
- The analysis of stability and effectiveness across diverse datasets and tasks demonstrates the generality of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The results regarding the stability of influence functions may not withstand statistical scrutiny, as only two results are compared.
- The experimental setups lack clarity, making reproducibility challenging; specific hyper-parameter choices are not well-defined.
- The paper's organization is criticized, particularly the placement of the related work section in the appendix and the awkward introduction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setups by providing specific hyper-parameter choices and their impact on performance. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the concerns regarding the stability of self-influence scores by including a larger sample set for analysis. The authors should also consider reorganizing the paper to enhance readability, possibly by moving background sections to the appendix and refining the introduction to introduce the concept of self-influence earlier. Finally, it would be beneficial to compare the proposed self-influence score with existing data filtering techniques to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of its effectiveness.
