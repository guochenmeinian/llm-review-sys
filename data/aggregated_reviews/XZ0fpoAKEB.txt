### Key Points
This paper presents a critical examination of the train-test paradigm in machine learning (ML), arguing that it often fails to provide valid performance assessments in complex social systems. The authors introduce the concepts of (\epsilon,\alpha)-validity and (\epsilon,\alpha)-invalidity for inference validity, demonstrating that there is "no free delivery service" of data for ensuring inference validity on a global scale. The study employs the MovieLens benchmark dataset to illustrate these issues and suggests remedies such as participatory data curation and open science.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper addresses a significant issue regarding the limitations of the train-test paradigm in AI systems, particularly in complex social environments.  
2. It provides formal proofs of epistemic limitations, establishing a robust theoretical foundation for its claims.  
3. The writing is formal and clear, making the content accessible and engaging.  
4. The proposed validity framework offers metrics for evaluating model performance across different distributions.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The prescriptive argument of the work is unclear, with expectations for more implications beyond identifying the problem.  
2. The formal proofs may be too complex for practitioners lacking a strong mathematical background.  
3. Suggested remedies lack detailed implementation strategies, potentially limiting their applicability.  
4. The results may not generalize well to other contexts due to their dependence on specific social systems and data collection methods.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the prescriptive argument by providing more concrete implications of their findings. Additionally, consider simplifying some theoretical discussions or providing intuitive explanations to enhance accessibility for practitioners. It would be beneficial to elaborate on how suggested remedies, such as participatory data curation, can be practically implemented in real-world scenarios. Finally, including more examples or case studies beyond the MovieLens benchmark could strengthen the argument regarding validity issues in diverse AI systems.
