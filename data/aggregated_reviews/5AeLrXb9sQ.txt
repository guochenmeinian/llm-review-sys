Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TARSS-Net, a novel framework aimed at enhancing radar-based semantic segmentation by effectively integrating temporal information. The framework introduces two key modules: the Target-History Temporal Relation Encoder (TH-TRE) for analyzing relationships between time frames, and the Temporal Relation Attentive Pooling (TRAP) for aggregating temporal data. The authors claim that TARSS-Net achieves superior performance compared to traditional methods while maintaining manageable computational complexity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a well-constructed algorithm that significantly improves performance in radar-based semantic segmentation tasks.
- It provides a comprehensive review of existing methods and challenges in the field, enhancing the understanding of radar semantic segmentation.
- The rigorous ablation studies support the efficacy of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clear hypotheses and reasoning regarding the effectiveness of the proposed temporal modeling paradigm, which may confuse readers.
- There is insufficient emphasis on the design motivation behind key modules, particularly TH-TRE, leading to a lack of clarity on its intended purpose.
- Formatting and visualization issues hinder the reader's comprehension, such as the misrepresentation of tensor dimensions in figures.
- The experimental section does not adequately compare the proposed method with the Self Attention (SA) model, which could provide a more rigorous analysis of performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their hypotheses and reasoning to better articulate the effectiveness of their temporal modeling paradigm. Additionally, the authors should emphasize the design motivations behind the TH-TRE module to enhance reader understanding. We also suggest revising the paper's formatting and visualizations for better clarity, ensuring that tensor dimensions are accurately represented. Finally, we encourage the authors to include a comparison with the SA model in their experimental analysis to strengthen their claims regarding performance.
