Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new metrics for evaluating a model's ability to recover a world model, guided by the Myhill-Nerode theorem for deterministic finite automata (DFA). The authors propose three metrics: compression precision, distinction precision, and distinction recall, which assess coherence and distinguishability of sequences in relation to the DFA. They argue that their metrics, which focus on the behavior of model outputs, are crucial for understanding world model structure. The authors trained a GPT model on New York City taxi rides, finding that while classical methods indicated strong performance, the new metrics suggested a failure to learn the world model. This highlights the potential of the proposed metrics as valuable evaluation tools, successfully differentiating between models previously thought to have correct world models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The work is well-motivated, well-written, and presents interesting metrics.
- Detailed ablation studies on training data enhance the study's rigor.
- The evaluation framework addresses a significant question regarding the implicit world models of neural LMs.
- The proposed metrics provide a novel approach to evaluating world models based on output behavior, allowing for comparisons across different models and implementations.
- The authors validate their metrics against established benchmarks, demonstrating their effectiveness in identifying discrepancies in world model performance.

Weaknesses:
- Generalizability of the proposed metrics is limited, as they are applicable only when the true world model is a DFA, which may not hold for all scenarios, such as Logic Puzzles.
- There is a lack of inter-metric consistency, raising concerns about the reliability of the metrics when they yield conflicting results.
- The proposed metrics may struggle with high false positives, indicating a potential inability to detect actual learning of the world model.
- The reliance on decoding hyperparameters raises concerns about the metrics' sensitivity and reliability, particularly in distinguishing between models with subtle performance differences.
- The evaluation methods may not fully account for the complexities of real-world applications, as they primarily focus on artificial data.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of the proposed metrics to accommodate scenarios beyond DFA models, particularly in natural language contexts. Additionally, addressing the inter-metric consistency issue is crucial; the authors should clarify how to interpret conflicting results among the metrics. We suggest improving the clarity of how decoding hyperparameters influence metric values, particularly regarding the differences observed between top-p and top-k decoding methods. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the implications of their metrics in more realistic settings, ensuring they can differentiate between models in practical applications rather than just in controlled environments. Lastly, including a dedicated section on limitations and future research directions would strengthen the paper's overall contribution, as well as clarifying the rationale behind the importance of evaluating multiple accepted sequences, especially when top-1 predictions are commonly used in practice.
