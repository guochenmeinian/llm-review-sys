### Key Points
This paper presents a novel concept of "graph resilience" to measure the complexity of density estimation in multivariate settings, particularly under the assumption of a Markov property with respect to an underlying undirected graph \( G \). The authors demonstrate that the sample complexity for estimating such densities scales with the graph's resilience rather than the dimension \( d \). Several examples are provided where resilience can be computed or bounded, contributing solidly to the literature on density estimation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The concept of resilience is original and well-defined, particularly illustrated in Figure 3.  
- The paper is well-written, with clear exposition and thorough related work, making it accessible to readers.  
- The results are novel and of interest to researchers in high-dimensional statistics.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks sufficient intuition for defining \( r \) and does not provide a proof sketch for the main theorems in the main text, which is crucial for a theoretical paper.  
- There is no discussion of practical applications or limitations, and the relationship with classical methods like kernel density estimation is unclear.  
- The writing is not sufficiently clear for non-specialists, and some claims lack robust support, particularly regarding lower-dimensional manifolds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper to make it more accessible to a broader audience, particularly by elucidating the relationship with classical methods. Additionally, we suggest including a proof sketch of the main theorems in the main text rather than relegating it to the appendix. Providing simulation results on synthetic data would also help empirically validate the theoretical findings. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to discuss practical applications of graph resilience in density computation and to address limitations regarding the applicability of their findings in real data scenarios. Lastly, clarifying the computational aspects of resilience calculation, including potential algorithms and their costs, would enhance the paper's contributions.
