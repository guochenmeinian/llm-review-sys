### Key Points
This paper presents a deep learning method, MarketFCNet, aimed at approximating market equilibrium in large-scale contextual markets, where buyers and goods are represented by their contexts. The authors propose an unbiased training loss and introduce a metric called Nash Gap to quantify the deviation between the learned allocation and the market equilibrium. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of MarketFCNet, demonstrating competitive performance and significantly reduced computation time compared to traditional methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of using deep learning for large-scale market equilibrium computation is notable, with a clear definition of the contextual market modeling problem.  
- The theoretical derivation of the loss function and experimental analysis support the effectiveness of the proposed method.  
- The paper is well-written and presents a natural motivation for the research, filling a gap in the literature.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a proof of convergence for the training algorithm and does not provide the training curve or implementation code.  
- Clarity issues arise, making it difficult to understand the meaning of each proposition.  
- The significance of the large-scale contextual market equilibrium is not well articulated, leaving questions about real-world applications.  
- The proof of unbiasedness in Section 4.2 appears hand-wavy, and the effects of dimension $k$ on performance are unclear.  
- The paper does not address potential overfitting or the interpretability of the learned allocation function.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed explanations of each proposition and ensuring that the proof of unbiasedness is formalized. Additionally, the authors should include a discussion on the convergence of the training algorithm and provide the implementation code for reproducibility. To enhance the practical usability of MarketFCNet, consider incorporating domain-specific constraints to improve interpretability and addressing potential overfitting through regularization techniques. Finally, exploring heterogeneous context representations could broaden the applicability of the method to diverse market scenarios.
