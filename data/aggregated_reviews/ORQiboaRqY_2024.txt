Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the effectiveness of small-sized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) in solving linear programming (LP) problems, specifically focusing on polylogarithmic-depth, constant-width GNNs. The authors propose a novel GNN architecture, GD-Net, which demonstrates superior performance in solving packing and covering LPs compared to traditional GNN models. The theoretical foundation is established by proving that such GNNs can effectively simulate a variant of the gradient descent algorithm, potentially leading to more efficient mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) solvers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper establishes an innovative link between the AK algorithm and GNNs, which could inspire future research in the field.
2. The introduction of GD-Net contributes to GNN-based LP and MILP solvers, showcasing significant parameter efficiency and problem-solving capability.
3. The writing is clear, and the mathematical aspects are technically correct, with extensive empirical evaluations supporting the claims.

Weaknesses:
1. The presentation of Theorems 2-4 is somewhat straightforward, lacking depth in demonstrating the performance superiority of GD-Net.
2. The empirical performance is not convincingly demonstrated, as comparisons are limited to GCN without including traditional algorithms or commercial LP solvers.
3. The paper primarily focuses on packing and covering LPs, with limited discussion on the generalizability of the proposed methods to other LP types or optimization problems.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the presentation of Theorems 2-4 to provide deeper insights into the performance of GD-Net. Additionally, to convincingly demonstrate the advantages of GD-Net, it is crucial to include more realistic benchmarks and comparisons with traditional algorithms like ADMM or PDHG, as well as commercial LP solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi. We also suggest that the authors explore the generalizability of GD-Net by discussing potential modifications to handle a broader range of LPs or mixed integer linear programming problems. Finally, augmenting the experimental setup to include training on medium-scale datasets and testing on both small and large-scale datasets would help validate the unique advantages of unrolling methods in achieving exceptional size generalization.
