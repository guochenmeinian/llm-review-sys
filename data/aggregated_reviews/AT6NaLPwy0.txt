Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for sequential decision-making problems with delayed feedback, encompassing various settings such as multi-armed bandits, linear bandits, linear MDPs, and Markov games. The authors propose a reduction from standard algorithms to handle delayed feedback, achieving regret guarantees in multiple contexts. They improve upon existing results for linear bandits and tabular MDPs, and provide the first regret guarantees for linear MDPs and general function approximation MDPs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors improve previous results in the delayed feedback setting across several domains, including multi-armed bandits and tabular games.
- They provide a simple strategy for adapting multi-batched algorithms to delayed feedback, which is both elegant and effective.
- The framework is versatile, yielding significant results across many important settings with minimal additional requirements.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation lacks clarity, particularly in how the transformations are structured and connected, making it difficult to follow.
- The writing can feel rushed, potentially alienating readers who are not experts in reinforcement learning theory.
- The contribution may appear incremental, as the concept of using multi-batched algorithms for delayed feedback is not entirely novel.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation by explicitly connecting the transformations and providing a comprehensive algorithm for the general setting that adjusts updates based on the context. Additionally, addressing minor issues in algorithm presentation, such as clearly defining input parameters and outputs, would enhance usability. We suggest including more detailed discussions on the challenges faced in adapting existing results to the delayed feedback context and considering the addition of simple experimental validations to support the theoretical claims. Finally, acknowledging prior works that have explored similar concepts would strengthen the paper's contribution.
