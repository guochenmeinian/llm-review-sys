Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical bounds on the forgetting quantity in the continual learning setting for linear tasks, specifically addressing cyclic task ordering. The authors prove an upper bound of \(O(T^3/m)\) on forgetting, utilizing a bound on the numerical range of a product of \(T\) projections. The work builds on prior research, particularly improving the dimension dependence of the bounds established by Evron et al. (2022).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors prove near-optimal bounds for cyclic task ordering, improving upon previous bounds, with an upper bound of \(O(T^2/m)\) compared to a \(\Omega(T/m)\) lower bound and earlier upper bounds of \(O(T^2/\sqrt{mT})\).
- The paper provides a bound on the numerical range of a product of \(T\) projections, which is mathematically interesting and relevant.

Weaknesses:  
- Notations could be defined earlier, or references to the notation section could be included when first used in the introduction.
- The significance of the contribution is questioned, as the results primarily build on previous work without extending to other settings or incorporating experimental evaluations.
- The proofs are overly technical for the main body and should be moved to the appendices. The manuscript lacks discussion on task dependencies, which is crucial for understanding catastrophic forgetting.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of notation by defining terms earlier or referencing the notation section when first introduced. Additionally, we suggest extending the results to other settings and incorporating experimental evaluations to enhance the contribution's significance. The authors should also consider moving the lengthy proofs to the appendices and providing a brief overview of the proof of Theorem 5 to aid reader comprehension. Lastly, addressing the relationship between forgetting and regret, as well as clarifying the bounds expressed in terms of iterations versus cycles, would strengthen the paper.
