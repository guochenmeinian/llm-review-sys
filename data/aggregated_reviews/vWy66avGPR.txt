### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the alignment between language models' color space and the visual properties of color, specifically examining complex ad-hoc color names from an online database. The authors propose two experiments: the first assesses the alignment of color names in language models with their corresponding colors in RGB space, while the second evaluates the models' ability to determine comparative relationships between color descriptions. The findings indicate poor alignment for complex names but reasonable performance in comparative estimations, suggesting that language models can learn structure through language but struggle with knowledge-related concepts like color.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper contributes a useful derived dataset and presents interesting findings regarding the challenges of aligning complex color names with their visual counterparts.
- It is well-written, with clear explanations of metrics and methodologies.

Weaknesses:
- The premise of the first experiment raises concerns about the semantic complexity of the color names used, which may not align closely in embedding space.
- There is a lack of verification regarding the accuracy of human-generated color descriptions in relation to their paired hex codes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the first experiment by considering how to prompt the model to focus on the colors denoted by complex phrases. Additionally, it would be beneficial to include an analysis of human performance on these tasks, particularly in similarity judgments and darkness ratings. Furthermore, we suggest acknowledging the limitations regarding the verification of color descriptions and their accuracy in representing paired hex codes in the final version of the paper.
