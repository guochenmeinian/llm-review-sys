Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an efficient and interpretable context-based dynamic pruning method for transformer models, utilizing additional query/key layers to generate dynamic attention masks and sparsify self-attention maps. The authors introduce a sparse sigmoid and regularization term to manage sparsity. Experimental results indicate minimal performance degradation compared to static attention pruning methods, achieving improved inference efficiency. The authors also analyze context distribution concerning part of speech and layer depth, demonstrating dynamic pruning based on contexts through context switch experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is well-motivated, easy to follow, and enhances interpretability and sparsity with minimal performance loss.
- Extensive analysis of context length, throughput, and speed across various parameter sizes is provided.
- The introduction of a unique data structure enables efficient batched operations involving masked tokens.

Weaknesses:
- A quantitative comparison of throughput and speed with local/sparse attention is lacking, which would enhance understanding.
- Further qualitative studies on interpretability at varying sparsity levels (gamma) would yield additional insights.
- The choice of downstream tasks raises questions, as evaluated tasks primarily involve small context sizes, and results suggest performance degradation for larger base models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative comparison of throughput and speed with local/sparse attention to provide a more comprehensive understanding. Additionally, conducting further qualitative studies on interpretability at varying sparsity levels (gamma) would offer more intuitive observations. It would also strengthen the paper to include results using larger and stronger base models (>1.5B parameters), such as LLaMA, Pythia, or OPT, to demonstrate the robustness of the proposed method across different contexts.
