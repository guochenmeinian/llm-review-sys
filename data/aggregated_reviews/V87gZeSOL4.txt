Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on identifying causal variables from high-dimensional observations using non-parametric mixing functions and causal mechanisms. The authors propose a framework that assumes single-node, perfect interventions for all causal variables, and distinct paired perfect interventions for cases with more than two causal variables. The paper demonstrates that causal variables are identifiable under these conditions, with weaker assumptions for two variables compared to more. Additionally, it outlines potential learning algorithm implementations for this framework.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and employs consistent notation, clearly stating all assumptions prior to theorems.  
- It includes proof sketches in the main text, enhancing its standalone quality.  
- The theoretical contribution extends the domain of identifiable causal representation by considering a new setup that does not require counterfactual observations.  
- The literature review is comprehensive, situating the work within the current research landscape.

Weaknesses:  
- The reliance on single-node, perfect interventions is restrictive and may not be feasible in real-world scenarios.  
- The paper lacks real-world examples to motivate its assumptions, limiting its applicability.  
- Empirical validation of the theoretical results is minimal, with only sketches of potential ideas for learning unknown parts.  
- The claim regarding unknown intervention targets is questionable, as the assumptions imply they are known under certain conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by providing practical demonstrations of the proposed method in real-world scenarios, possibly utilizing datasets from virtual environments like the causal world. Additionally, a more thorough discussion of the assumptions is necessary; specifically, the authors should clarify the necessity and implications of each assumption, particularly regarding the identifiability of intervention targets. Finally, we suggest including empirical results or experiments to validate the theoretical claims, as this would significantly strengthen the paper's contribution to the field.
