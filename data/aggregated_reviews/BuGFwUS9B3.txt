Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents IMDer, a diffusion model-based method for addressing missing modalities in multimodal emotion recognition (MER). The authors utilize available modalities as prior conditions to guide the recovery process, achieving state-of-the-art results on the CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI datasets. The framework is well-defined, and both quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate its effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of using a score-based diffusion model to tackle modal missingness in MER is commendable.  
- IMDer shows strong performance across datasets, with a clear and effective framework.  
- The evaluation is thorough, including ablation studies and qualitative visualizations that indicate closer distributions to ground truth compared to other methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity on the specific modalities involved and their necessity for reconstruction.  
- There is insufficient quantitative evaluation, particularly regarding effect sizes and significance testing.  
- The ablation experiments are not comprehensive, and the effectiveness of the semantic disambiguation component is not adequately assessed.  
- The choice of datasets is limited, with a need for more diverse data to validate the method's generalizability.  
- Some conceptual errors and typos are present, which detract from the overall quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the modalities involved in the study, ensuring that the purpose of reconstruction is well-articulated. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a proper quantitative evaluation of results, including effect sizes and significance testing with Bonferroni adjustment. The authors should conduct more comprehensive ablation studies to evaluate the contributions of various components, particularly the semantic disambiguation module. Expanding the dataset diversity would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Lastly, we advise correcting any conceptual errors and typos to improve the paper's overall presentation.
