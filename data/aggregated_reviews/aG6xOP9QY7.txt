### Key Points
This paper investigates the bias in the state-of-the-art label-differential privacy (label-DP) mechanism proposed by Ghazi et al. (2023) and introduces bias-corrected randomizers through a constrained linear programming approach. The authors demonstrate that their proposed label-DP mechanisms achieve lower mean squared errors by carefully tuning hyperparameters in deep learning. The paper also explores a differentially private algorithm for regression problems, focusing on label privacy and operating under the "feature-oblivious" model. The proposed mechanism shows significant improvements over previous works, particularly in empirical performance across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The main result is original, providing a compelling example of bias in existing label-DP mechanisms and proposing a new solution that empirically outperforms state-of-the-art methods.
2. The paper is well-written and clearly communicates its contributions and findings, with a well-structured organization.
3. Extensive experiments demonstrate a noticeable reduction in mean squared error when using the proposed mechanism compared to prior works.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed algorithm incurs extra computational costs due to the necessity of solving a constrained linear programming problem, and the authors should clarify the computational complexity involved.
2. The focus on optimal mechanisms for epsilon-DP overlooks discussions on extensions to (epsilon, delta)-DP, which would enhance the paper's relevance.
3. The mechanism is limited to discrete labels, restricting its applicability to ordinal regression, and the lack of code may hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm and explicitly state the implications of the extra computational cost. Additionally, the authors should consider discussing potential extensions to (epsilon, delta)-DP to broaden the applicability of their work. It would also be beneficial to provide a comparison of the proposed mechanism with other label-DP algorithms, particularly in terms of performance trade-offs. Lastly, including the code for the experiments would facilitate reproducibility and allow for further validation of the results.
