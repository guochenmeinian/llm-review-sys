### Key Points
This paper presents a security study on the access control of persistent storage mechanisms (cookies, localStorage, and IndexedDB) by third-party scripts in web browsers. The authors analyze the top 10,000 Tranco websites to investigate the prevalence of third-party script access to these storage objects. They propose a fine-grained access control mechanism based on the principle of least privilege, utilizing a labeling system to specify which domains can read or write to specific storage objects. The authors implement their solution in the Firefox browser and evaluate it on 100 websites to assess functionality breakage. The study reveals that a significant portion of storage object accesses (89.84% for cookies, 90.98% for localStorage, and 72.49% for IndexedDB) are performed by third-party scripts, underscoring the need for improved access control mechanisms.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Addresses a critical security issue in web browsers that existing mechanisms have not adequately solved.
- Analyzes a large dataset of 10,000 popular websites, providing a comprehensive view of the problem's prevalence.
- Proposes a practical solution that can be implemented in real browsers.
- Implements and evaluates the proposed solution in a real browser (Firefox).
- Promises to open-source part of the dataset and framework code.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of performance analysis: The paper does not provide quantitative data on the performance impact of the proposed solution.
- Limited discussion on adoption challenges: The paper could benefit from a more in-depth analysis of potential obstacles in getting browser vendors and web developers to adopt the proposed system.
- The experimental methodology and evaluation raise significant concerns, particularly regarding dataset preparation and the classification of third-party scripts.
- The proposed access-control mechanism appears ineffective in achieving its designed goal, with flaws in the measurement study and lack of verification for declared domain sources.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by:
- Providing a quantitative analysis of the performance impact of their solution.
- Offering a more in-depth discussion on adoption challenges, including potential obstacles for browser vendors and web developers.
- Clarifying the dataset preparation and cleaning process, particularly regarding how CDN and DNS URLs are handled.
- Differentiating between scripts necessary for page functionality and tracking scripts, and addressing how obfuscated scripts are managed.
- Including basic descriptive statistics about the analyzed websites, such as the average number of third-party scripts per website.
- Elaborating on the threat model, specifically for malicious or compromised third-party scripts, and detailing how the proposed mechanism addresses these threats.
- Providing specific examples of scenarios where the method is applied and quantifying the number of violations measured during experiments.
- Including a list of the 100 websites tested, along with screenshots, to enhance clarity and context.
