Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a large-scale Multi-view Multi-modal Word-Level Australian Sign Language recognition dataset, comprising over 280K videos, more than 3000 glosses, and recordings from multiple cameras with depth sensors. The authors provide extensive baseline results, making the dataset a significant resource for sign language research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive, featuring a large number of videos and a diverse set of signers.
- It supports new tasks such as multi-view/cross-view isolated sign language recognition (ISLR), which is under-explored in previous works.
- High-quality videos and comprehensive baseline results enhance its utility for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset primarily supports ISLR, which may limit its applicability to more realistic tasks like continuous recognition or translation.
- The controlled recording environment may not reflect real-world conditions, raising concerns about the dataset's generalizability.
- Some claims regarding the dataset's uniqueness compared to existing datasets like Auslan-Daily require clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the limitations of using high-quality videos in controlled settings, particularly regarding their transferability to lower-quality recordings. Additionally, we suggest including illustrations of the dataset that encompass RGB, depth images, and pose information. It would also be beneficial to incorporate more recent RGB-based or pose-based methods in the experiments for comparison. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to consider adjusting the dataset's licensing to be more conducive to research collaboration. Lastly, providing implementations for the baseline models would greatly benefit the research community.
