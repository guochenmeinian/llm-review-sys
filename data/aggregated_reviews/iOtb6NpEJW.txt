### Key Points
This paper presents a study on advertising in content feeds, formalized as the StrmAds problem, where ads are strategically placed between content items to maximize expected rewards while considering user attention decay. The authors propose a backwards greedy algorithm that achieves a 2-approximation for the general StrmAds problem, improving upon the previous 4-approximation. They also introduce a non-oblivious backwards-greedy algorithm and explore various practical algorithms, including flow- and matching-based methods. The experiments assess algorithm performance across different structures, parameters, and real-world datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper introduces several new algorithms that enhance the state-of-the-art for the StrmAds problem, providing a novel reward decomposition that contributes to the community's understanding. The algorithms are computationally efficient, and the experiments are comprehensive, demonstrating significant performance improvements.

Weaknesses:  
The algorithms are designed for an offline setting, assuming predetermined content and ads, which may not reflect the dynamic nature of user behavior. Additionally, the model simplifies the complexity of dynamic reward values, and the experimental datasets lack diversity, primarily focusing on synthetic and small-scale real data. There is also insufficient baseline comparison, particularly with machine learning methods like reinforcement learning.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the applicability of their algorithms by considering an online strategy for ad placement that accommodates dynamic user behavior and reward values. Additionally, we suggest testing the algorithms on larger-scale and more diverse datasets, including proprietary industrial data. To enhance the experimental rigor, we encourage the authors to include comparisons with reinforcement learning-based advertising allocation algorithms. Finally, we advise addressing the time complexity of the proposed algorithms to ensure practical applicability.
