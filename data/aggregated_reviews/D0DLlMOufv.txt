Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents MSA-Generator, a self-supervised generative protein language model aimed at overcoming limitations in protein structure prediction caused by shallow multiple sequence alignments (MSAs). The model is pre-trained on a sequences-to-sequences task using an automatically constructed dataset and employs protein-specific attention mechanisms. MSA-Generator generates enriched MSAs from large-scale protein databases, enhancing MSA quality, particularly for proteins lacking extensive homologous families.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Results on CASP14 and CASP15 demonstrate promising improvements in MSA quality across multiple pretrained models.
- The work addresses a significant bottleneck in protein predictions related to low-quality MSAs.
- The analysis provides interesting insights, showing that generated MSAs enhance diversity and conservation.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the technology is limited, primarily following the MSA transformer architecture and Seq2Seq training framework.
- The ablation studies are weak, lacking verification of more design choices.
- The use of JackHMMER, a less common MSA tool, raises concerns; more advanced tools like hhblits and mmseqs2 should be considered.
- The paper does not explore the potential of generating MSAs from scratch, which could alleviate computation bottlenecks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by clearly differentiating their approach from existing works, particularly MSAGPT, and addressing the advantages of MSA-Generator. Additionally, conducting more robust ablation studies to verify design choices would strengthen the findings. We suggest considering the use of advanced MSA tools like hhblits and mmseqs2 and exploring the feasibility of generating MSAs from scratch to address computation bottlenecks. Lastly, providing clarity on the criteria for determining the quality of homologous sequences and the relationship between source and target MSA depths would enhance the paper's rigor.
