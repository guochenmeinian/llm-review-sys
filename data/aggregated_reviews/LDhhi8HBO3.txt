Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new bound for margin maximization and a tighter estimation of the Lipschitz constant to enhance the adversarial robustness of neural networks. The authors propose an efficient proxy for regularizing margins in the input space using Lipschitz constants of the logit difference function between classes. They introduce a novel approximation for these constants, which is computationally efficient, and demonstrate improvements in certified radius through experiments on benchmark datasets like MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Tiny-Imagenet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured.
- It introduces a new bound for input margin as a regularization term and a scalable Lipschitz bounding algorithm that is tighter than naive bounds.
- Experiments indicate that the proposed method performs comparably or better than state-of-the-art adversarial robustness methods.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the improved bound for input margin is limited, as similar strategies have been frequently used in recent works.
- The experimental results do not sufficiently verify the scalability of the Lipschitz constant estimation for multi-layer networks.
- The motivation and connections between the proposed methods could be clearer, and the sensitivity to hyper-parameter choices needs further exploration.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for each proposed method and the connections between them. An ablation study on CIFAR-10 with various hyper-parameters would help elucidate the sensitivity of the proposed method. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer evaluation of the computational cost of the proposed method in terms of Flops or running time. It would also be beneficial to independently assess how the accuracy of the improved Lipschitz estimate affects final outcomes, possibly through experiments comparing the evolution of estimated Lipschitz constants during training. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding the applicability of their method to more complex architectures would strengthen the paper.
