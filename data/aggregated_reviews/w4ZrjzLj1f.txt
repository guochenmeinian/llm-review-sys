### Key Points
This paper discusses the potential for peer-to-peer (P2P) systems to facilitate closed dissemination of content generated by peers. The authors propose an economic model involving two user types: content providers and contributors, arguing that P2P systems are more economically viable than cloud-based alternatives. The paper introduces a replication primitive intended for eventually-consistent databases, with a focus on microtransactions as a means for producers to receive donations directly from fans.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The paper presents an original idea that challenges conventional models and is well-structured, aligning with the workshop's theme.  
* The economic model is robust and addresses a long-standing issue in content creator economics, proposing a solution that allows artists to retain 100% of donations.  
* The scientific merit is notable, particularly with the replication primitive linked to existing work in eventually-consistent databases.

Weaknesses:  
* The arguments in favor of the proposed solutions lack depth and sufficient evidence, particularly in Sections 2.4 and 4.  
* There is a discrepancy between the problem framing in the Introduction and the proposed solution, particularly regarding data replication and access control.  
* Terminology is inconsistent, complicating the reader's understanding of user roles.  
* Significant space is devoted to the economic model, leaving little for original contributions, and the necessity of certain technical aspects, such as 2P-BFT-Log complexity, is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their arguments by providing more evidence to support their claims, particularly in Sections 2.4 and 4. It would be beneficial to clarify the relationship between the problem framing in the Introduction and the proposed solution throughout the paper. We suggest standardizing terminology related to user roles to enhance clarity. Additionally, we encourage the authors to allocate more space to original contributions and clarify the necessity of complex technical elements like 2P-BFT-Log complexity. Finally, we recommend that the conclusion explicitly address the relevance of comparing the proposed model to cloud-based systems.
