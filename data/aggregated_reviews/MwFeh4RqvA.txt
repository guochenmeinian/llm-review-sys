Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating complex images from textual descriptions using a diffusion model that incorporates RGBA transparency. The authors propose a new training paradigm that adapts the diffusion model for isolated object generation and introduces a multi-layer scene compositing strategy based on noise blending. The approach aims to enhance control over object attributes and scene composition, achieving impressive generation capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The framework allows for fine-grained control over instance appearance and location, demonstrating superior controllability.
2. The method is well-engineered, utilizing state-of-the-art components, and is easy to follow.
3. Extensive experiments show convincing visual results, indicating the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the approach is limited, as it does not sufficiently differentiate itself from existing layered-based image generation methods, particularly LayerDiffusion.
2. There is a lack of quantitative evaluations against relevant contemporary methods, making it difficult to assess the technical contributions and innovations.
3. The multi-layer scene composition process is inefficient, requiring multiple images for composition, which could be optimized.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their contributions by providing a more thorough comparison with existing methods, particularly LayerDiffusion and other relevant techniques. Additionally, we suggest including a detailed discussion on the composition of foreground and background to address concerns about unnatural image generation. Clarifying the efficiency of the multi-layer scene composition process and exploring alternative methods for fusing RGBA objects in fewer steps would also enhance the paper. Finally, a more comprehensive literature review and empirical benchmarking against recent advancements in instance-based layering methods are necessary to strengthen the paper's claims.
