Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the predictive capabilities of 28 large language models (LLMs) regarding fMRI activity in human subjects listening to an audiobook. The authors observe a scaling law where neural predictivity increases linearly with the logarithm of model parameters. They find that larger models predict left-hemisphere activity more effectively than right-hemisphere activity, with this left-right asymmetry growing with model size. The study aims to reconcile findings on language processing lateralization in the brain.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The primary finding that larger language models better predict left hemisphere brain responses is novel.
- The paper is well-written, well-cited, and structured intuitively, making it easy to follow.
- It includes a substantial number of control experiments and replicates prior work effectively.
- The incorporation of a new fMRI dataset and a diverse range of LLMs is commendable.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient experimental and theoretical analyses regarding the reasons for the growing left-right asymmetry in neural predictivity.
- The observed left-right asymmetry may not be qualitatively interesting, as it could simply reflect inherent differences in signal-to-noise ratios (SNR) between hemispheres.
- The use of group averages in fMRI data may obscure individual variability, raising questions about the validity of the primary findings.
- The paper does not adequately address the significance of the language network regions showing no significant effects, nor does it justify the choice of anatomical over functional localization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework surrounding the growing left-right asymmetry by providing more experimental analyses and interpretations. Additionally, consider addressing the potential influence of SNR differences on the observed asymmetry. It would be beneficial to include individual participant-level analyses to validate findings beyond group averages. Furthermore, clarify the rationale for using anatomical localization instead of functional localization, and discuss the implications of regions in the language network that do not show significant effects. Lastly, we suggest incorporating a baseline comparison with randomly initialized models to better characterize architectural bias.
