Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of degree bias in node classification using graph neural networks (GNNs), revealing that high-degree nodes exhibit lower misclassification probabilities. The authors survey 38 papers on degree bias, identifying often contradictory hypotheses that lack rigorous validation. They provide theoretical analyses of message-passing GNNs with random walk (RW) and symmetric (SYM) filters, supported by empirical results across multiple datasets. The study concludes with a proposed roadmap for mitigating degree bias in GNN applications.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper offers a thorough theoretical analysis of misclassification probabilities in GNNs using RW and SYM filters.
- Empirical results validate theoretical predictions, enhancing the paper's credibility.
- The authors effectively survey existing literature, clarifying and validating hypotheses regarding degree bias.
- Insights into mitigation strategies for degree bias are well-supported by both theoretical and empirical findings.
- The use of hyperlinks improves navigation within the paper, enhancing reader experience.

Weaknesses:
- Theoretical results lack a comprehensive link between misclassification probability and node degree beyond a single layer, with only empirical results provided.
- The analysis is limited to linearized GNNs rather than the GNNs themselves.
- Findings may be restricted to homophilous graphs, with limited applicability to heterogeneous graphs.
- Some experimental results do not support claims made in the paper, and certain theoretical analyses lack intuitive justification from a graph topology perspective.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical framework by establishing a relationship between inverse collision probability and node degree to create a more "end to end" analysis. Additionally, consider expanding the analysis to heterogeneous graphs to enhance the applicability of findings. We suggest including a brief summary of main limitations in the conclusion to strengthen the paper. Furthermore, clarifying the connection between degree bias and homophily in the context of node classification would provide valuable insights. Lastly, addressing minor presentation issues, such as adding explanations for error bars in figures and ensuring all mentioned plots are included, would enhance clarity.
