Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents TabEBM, a novel data augmentation method for low-sample-size tabular classification tasks, which generates synthetic data using class-specific Energy-Based Models (EBMs). The authors leverage a pre-trained Prior-Data Fitted Network (PFN) to derive these EBMs from the logits of a binary classifier. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that TabEBM consistently improves classification performance across various small real-world datasets, outperforming competing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively communicating key concepts.
- The novel approach of using class-specific EBMs for tabular data generation is a significant contribution.
- The experimental results are thorough, comparing TabEBM against a wide range of relevant methods.
- The open-source implementation enhances accessibility and potential impact.

Weaknesses:
- The interpretation of classifier logits as energy functions may not yield effective density models, as arbitrary functions can alter the energy function without affecting the classifier's performance.
- The experimental setup relies on default hyperparameters for competing methods, which may not be optimal and could misrepresent their effectiveness.
- The paper lacks clarity on the generation of negative examples and the distribution of classes used for synthetic data, raising concerns about data leakage and evaluation fairness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for why logits from discriminative classifiers should be useful when reinterpreted as class-conditional energy functions. Additionally, clarify the rationale for marginalizing over class labels when generating energy functions and provide more details on how negative examples are constructed. It would be beneficial to evaluate TabEBM on datasets with higher dimensionality and to tune hyperparameters for competing methods to ensure fair comparisons. Lastly, addressing the statistical fidelity metrics in greater detail would enhance the robustness of the evaluation.
