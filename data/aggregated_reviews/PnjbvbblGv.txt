### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmark dataset for evaluating spoken dialogue understanding and generation, focusing on four attributes: emotion, accent, age, and background sound. The authors compare various LLMs for this task, highlighting the limitations of current evaluation methods that overlook the integration of paralinguistic and environmental information into responses. The SD-Eval benchmark is constructed from eight existing public datasets, utilizing both real and synthesized speech, and includes four tasks corresponding to the identified attributes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of the benchmark is notable, addressing a significant gap in evaluating multimodal LLMs and their response quality.  
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a comprehensive exposition of its implementation.  
- The findings indicate the need for further benchmarking in the domain of spoken dialogue understanding.

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset construction may overfit the GPT-4o model, lacking real-world data and potentially introducing bias.  
- The correlation between LLM-generated evaluation metrics and human-generated metrics is moderate, which weakens claims of strong validation.  
- Certain methodological choices, such as the use of contested Ekman emotion categories and TTS-generated adult speech from child transcriptions, raise concerns about the benchmark's validity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset by incorporating real-world data to mitigate bias and enhance applicability. Additionally, consider expanding the emotional categories beyond the Ekman model and including a broader range of accents, including foreign accents, to better reflect the diversity of speech inputs. The authors should also differentiate age categories more finely to account for varying language capabilities across different age groups. Finally, exploring multilingual benchmarking could further enhance the dataset's relevance and utility.
