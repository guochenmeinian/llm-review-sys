Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Exogenous Matching (EXOM), an importance sampling method for efficient estimation of counterfactual expressions in Structural Causal Models (SCMs). The authors transform the variance minimization problem into a conditional distribution learning problem, allowing integration with existing modeling approaches. They validate their theoretical findings through extensive experiments, demonstrating EXOM's competitive performance and practical applicability, particularly when incorporating structural prior knowledge via Markov boundaries.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, with a solid theoretical foundation and extensive empirical validation.
- EXOM provides a tractable and efficient approach for counterfactual estimation across various settings, including discrete and continuous variables.
- The incorporation of structural prior knowledge enhances the method's performance, as evidenced by experimental results.

Weaknesses:
- The manuscript lacks clarity in certain areas, likely due to material being relegated to the appendix, resulting in a disjointed presentation.
- Some assumptions, particularly regarding the density ratio and the distribution of exogenous variables, may be overly stringent or inadequately justified.
- The contributions are not clearly disentangled, and some experimental results appear inconsistent or abnormal.
- Figures lack sufficient explanation, making it difficult for readers to interpret the results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by integrating key material from the appendix into the main text to enhance coherence. Additionally, please provide a detailed explanation of the assumptions related to the density ratio and the distribution of exogenous variables, including potential methods for estimating these distributions. We also suggest including performance results of EXOM without Markov boundaries in the ablation study to illustrate their impact more clearly. Finally, ensure that all figures are adequately labeled and explained to facilitate reader understanding.
