Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents FlowDPO, a framework that predicts 3D structures of atomic systems using diffusion flow matching models. The authors propose a method for automatic creation of a preference pair dataset to finetune a pre-trained model with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The approach is evaluated through antibody and crystal structure predictions, demonstrating consistent performance improvements over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method consistently outperforms previous approaches in the tasks of antibody and crystal structure prediction.
- The structured presentation of the framework, including the training procedure and preference dataset construction, is clear and well-motivated.
- The exploration of different Gaussian paths offers valuable insights for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for using a generative approach and the theoretical justification for symmetry preservation are unclear.
- The term "hallucination" is used without a precise definition, leading to confusion regarding its implications.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on distances to a single ground truth, which does not account for multiple valid solutions, raising questions about the method's robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical contributions, particularly regarding symmetry preservation and the definition of "hallucinated samples." Additionally, the authors should discuss the implications of using a single ground truth in evaluations and consider incorporating alternative metrics that account for structural symmetries. Providing more visualizations and quantitative comparisons would enhance the reader's understanding of DPO's impact on atomic structure prediction. Lastly, addressing the limitations and potential failure modes of the method in more detail would strengthen the paper.
