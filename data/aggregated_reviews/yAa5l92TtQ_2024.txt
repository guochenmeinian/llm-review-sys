Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents POETRY, a novel hierarchical search algorithm designed for generating formal proofs with large language models in a step-by-step manner. POETRY first identifies proof steps at proof level 0, checking their correctness before recursively searching for proofs of proposed subgoals. The authors demonstrate that POETRY significantly enhances the pass@1 success rate compared to baseline best-first search methods on various test sets. The method employs a recursive proof generation process, utilizing feedback from the formal environment at each step.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The POETRY algorithm is innovative, mimicking human-like hierarchical proof writing.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, making it easy to follow.
- POETRY shows potential for further enhancement through the integration of premise-selection techniques like sledgehammer or Magnushammer.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement over beam search appears less significant, and the paper only presents pass@1 results, leaving unclear how POETRY scales with increased computational resources.
- The choice of baselines, particularly using Thor without sledgehammer, is convoluted and may not provide a fair comparison.
- The paper lacks detailed context on how to compare results from different formal systems, such as Lean and Isabelle/HOL.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's novelty by elaborating on the recursive best-first search strategy and its relationship to standard search methods. Additionally, providing a before-and-after comparison of the dataset construction process would illustrate the impact of the "sorry" tactic more effectively. It would also be beneficial to include more context on the types of problems POETRY excels at, particularly in relation to algebraic versus geometric problems. Finally, we suggest exploring alternative metrics for comparison, such as the number of tokens generated or calls to Isabelle, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of POETRY's performance.
