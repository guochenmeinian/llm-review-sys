Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a dataset aimed at monitoring and predicting surface roughness during the polishing of high-density carbon (HDC) spheres used in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments. The dataset includes raw vibration signals and sparse surface roughness measurements, which the authors propose to use for training machine learning models to predict surface roughness changes in real-time. The authors perform baseline machine learning experiments and apply domain adaptation techniques to enhance prediction accuracy across varying polishing conditions. However, the technical contributions are considered limited and preliminary.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of a new dataset in a specialized domain is a significant contribution, enabling further exploration of machine learning approaches in ICF target fabrication.
- The study addresses a critical topic with relevance to energy technology, potentially impacting the field positively.
- The authors provide a clear construction of the dataset and thorough background information.

Weaknesses:
- The machine learning experiments lack depth and rigorous evaluation, with only basic neural network architectures explored.
- The data interpolation method for generating training samples is questionable and not well validated, potentially introducing significant errors.
- Sample sizes for some experiments are small, raising concerns about statistical significance and generalizability.
- The results section lacks in-depth analysis, particularly regarding the domain adaptation approach, which shows modest improvements without sufficient exploration of its effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth and rigor of the machine learning experiments by exploring more advanced neural network architectures and justifying hyperparameter choices. The data interpolation approach should be validated more thoroughly to avoid significant errors. Additionally, the authors should address the small sample sizes to enhance the statistical significance of their results. Clarifying the acceptable level of error for the regression problem and providing a more detailed explanation of the MLP model, particularly regarding the training data for the target domain, would strengthen the paper. Lastly, ensuring that the scales in figures align with textual descriptions and providing clear labeling of dataset features would enhance clarity and usability for other researchers.
