Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Augmentation-Adaptive Self-Supervised Ranking (AdaptSSR), a novel user model pre-training method that addresses semantic inconsistency issues in user modeling by replacing contrastive learning with a multiple pairwise ranking loss. The authors propose an augmentation-adaptive fusion mechanism to combine learned ranking orders based on the similarity between augmented views. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of AdaptSSR across various tasks and datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed approach is technically sound, and empirical results validate its effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written, with clear figures and available code for reproducibility.
- The motivation for the method is reasonable, addressing consistency problems in recommendations.

Weaknesses:
- The core contribution, the Multiple Pairwise Ranking loss, is adapted from existing work (Yu et al [49]), raising questions about the novelty of the paper.
- The necessity of the added constraint in the loss function is unclear, as it may not significantly differ from traditional contrastive learning.
- An important hyperparameter sensitivity analysis regarding the fusion coefficient $\lambda$ is missing, and the computational cost of AdaptSSR is not analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors elaborate on the differences between their approach and the work of Yu et al [49], clearly highlighting their contributions. Additionally, the authors should discuss the limitations and broader societal impacts of their work. A sensitivity analysis of the hyperparameter $\lambda$ should be included to demonstrate its effect on model performance. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors analyze the computational cost introduced by AdaptSSR and compare their method against traditional augmentation techniques to provide a clearer context for its effectiveness.
