Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the PTADisc dataset, the largest educational dataset with over 680 million student response logs from more than 1.5 million students, designed for personalized learning diagnostics. A significant contribution of PTADisc is its unique cross-course characteristics, which facilitate the analysis of student behaviors and proficiency across multiple subjects, including computer science, mathematics, and social sciences. The authors propose a model-agnostic Cross-Course Learner Modeling Framework (CCLMF) to enhance diagnostic tasks, particularly addressing cold-start scenarios by leveraging correlations in student performance across courses. Supplementary experiments are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods and clarify the methodology used to calculate correlation coefficients among courses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is extensive and valuable for educational data mining and pedagogy, supporting various applications such as prerequisite discovery, computerized adaptive testing, and educational recommendations.
- PTADisc is the first dataset to incorporate cross-course information, contributing to personalized learning and enabling cross-course analysis, which is a novel contribution in educational research.
- The authors have made efforts to clarify the dataset's unique features and provide a clear rationale for their choice of courses based on correlation coefficients, enhancing the credibility of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset's utility for machine learning researchers is not clearly articulated, with vague descriptions of the data type and format.
- The analysis of student behavior patterns across different courses is limited, focusing mainly on similar domain courses, leading to questions about the dataset's potential applications.
- Some figures and tables lack clarity and organization, with certain figures not aligned with their references in the text, causing confusion regarding the dataset's features and applications.
- There is skepticism regarding the relevance of cognitive diagnosis (CD) and knowledge tracing (KT) tasks to the core contributions of the paper.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset's utility by providing a more detailed description of the data type and format in the introduction. Additionally, we suggest including a subsection that outlines potential applications of the dataset across various tasks to enhance its appeal to researchers. We encourage the authors to provide more examples of student behavior patterns across different disciplines to enrich the analysis and explore more diverse tasks that could enhance the dataset's utility in real-world applications. Furthermore, we recommend refining Figure 4(a) by enlarging the text font size and ensuring that the organization of figures and tables aligns with their references in the text. Lastly, we urge the authors to elaborate on the motivation for using the meta-learning strategy within the CCLMF section and clarify the relationship between the CD and KT tasks and the main contributions of their work.
