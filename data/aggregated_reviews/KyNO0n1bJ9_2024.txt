### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the statistical properties of the Hilbert Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC), proving that the minimax optimal rate of HSIC estimation for Borel measures is \( \mathcal{O}(n^{-0.5}) \) with \( M \geq 2 \) components. The authors establish the minimax lower bound \( \Omega(n^{-1/2}) \) for HSIC estimation using continuous bounded translation-invariant characteristic kernels on \( \mathbb{R}^d \). Their results demonstrate that many empirical estimators in the literature are minimax optimal, and they derive a closed-form formula for HSIC under the Gaussian setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses an important open problem, generalizing existing results from \( M=2 \) to \( M \geq 2 \), which is significant for the community.  
- The structure of the paper is clear and well-organized, with detailed proofs provided.  
- The authors' establishment of the minimax lower bound is a noteworthy contribution, matching known upper bounds of classical estimators.

Weaknesses:  
- The explanation of how the lower bound is obtained via Le Cam's method lacks detail regarding the main technical challenges involved.  
- There is a need for more discussion on the differences between their findings and those of Zhou et al. (2019), particularly concerning the centered covariance operator \( C_{XX} \).  
- The paper is not easy to follow, as the main contribution lies in the proof, which may be challenging for readers.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their explanation regarding the main technical challenges in proving the lower bound using Le Cam's method. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more thorough discussion on how their results differ from those of Zhou et al. (2019) concerning the centered covariance operator. Finally, while experiments are not necessary for a theoretical paper, we encourage the authors to consider designing toy experiments to validate their conclusions.
