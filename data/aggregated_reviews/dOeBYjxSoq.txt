Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel multimodal dataset and benchmark for linking visual plant phenotypic characteristics to genetic information in sorghum, featuring over 1 million images, including RGB photographs and 3D laser scans, alongside associated single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data. The dataset comprises 15 SNPs with known phenotypic expressions and 2,717 with unknown expressions, structured as 2,732 binary classification tasks. The authors aim for the dataset to enhance understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships and facilitate model performance tracking through a dedicated website that includes a leaderboard and discussion forum. The authors clarify that each SNP corresponds to a specific variation and have updated their methodology to treat multimodal training and testing datasets separately, ensuring that repeated RGB images are excluded from the test sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**  
- The dataset is unique and rich, providing extensive imagery and genetic data beneficial for machine learning applications in plant science.  
- The combination of RGB images, 3D scans, and DNA information offers a substantial amount of annotated data, with over half a million images in each modality.  
- The permissive licensing (CC0) enhances accessibility for both commercial and academic use.  
- The inclusion of a leaderboard and discussion forum fosters community engagement and collaboration among researchers.  
- The authors have made significant revisions to improve clarity, such as replacing Table 2 with a more informative figure depicting sample distributions and responding to reviewer concerns.

**Weaknesses:**  
- The dataset lacks complete genomic-level data, being limited to SNPs, which may restrict in-depth analysis of phenotype-genotype relationships.  
- Accessing the dataset is cumbersome, with unclear links to essential image files and a lack of documentation regarding data structure and contents.  
- The binary classification approach may not adequately represent SNPs with multiple viable mutations, necessitating clarification on whether multi-class classification would be more appropriate.  
- The multimodal test set suffers from systematic bias due to the over-representation of certain RGB images, which may affect model performance evaluation.  
- The rationale for using two output logits in binary classification is unclear and may be overparameterized.  
- There are concerns about the potential for spurious conclusions due to correlations between SNPs and the lack of acknowledgment of this limitation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the manuscript formatting, ensuring line and page numbers are included. A more detailed explanation of the SNP selection and the rationale for using SNPs over whole-genome sequencing should be provided, particularly for a diverse audience at NeurIPS. Clarifying the metric reported for model performance in Table 3 and addressing the broken links to the pre-trained model and the paper itself are necessary. Additionally, enhancing the GitHub repository with a README and documentation on data structure will facilitate reproducibility. 

We suggest including histograms in Table 2 to better illustrate the distribution of samples for the SNPs and encourage the authors to quantify class imbalance across SNPs in §3.2. We recommend that the authors clarify whether all SNPs have only one viable alternative form or if some have multiple mutants, and consider a multi-class classification approach if applicable. Furthermore, we advise the authors to justify the use of two output logits in §4, as a single logit may suffice for binary classification.

To improve the multimodal test set, we recommend ensuring that the test images for one variant do not overlap with the training set for another variant at the same SNP location and revising the methodology to avoid excessive repetition of RGB images. We encourage the authors to clarify in the paper whether models can condition on plant age and to provide a clear disclaimer regarding the comparison of multimodal and single-modal test performances. Lastly, we suggest enhancing Figure 3 by increasing the font size of axes and labels for better legibility and exploring hosting the full dataset on Zenodo for easier access and versioning.
