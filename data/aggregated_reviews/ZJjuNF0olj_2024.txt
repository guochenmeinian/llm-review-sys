Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to visual object tracking by introducing bounding box denoising as a latent denoising problem. The authors propose an in-model denoising pipeline that reformulates the repetitive sampling process into multiple ViT blocks executed in a single forward pass. Additionally, a compound memory strategy is introduced to enhance long-term tracking using visual features and trajectory cues. The proposed method, named DeTrack, utilizes the DeTrack Encoder, which employs ViT-B with 12 blocks and an additional 3 Transformer blocks for simultaneous feature extraction and interaction. The authors address concerns regarding the denoising process, particularly the randomness observed in bounding boxes after the first block, clarifying that this was due to sampling from Gaussian noise. They plan to incorporate discussions on the differences between DDPM, DeTrack, and DAE earlier in the manuscript and include supplementary materials from the rebuttal to enhance reader understanding. The proposed method demonstrates competitive performance across various datasets, supported by extensive results and ablation studies.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of denoising learning for tracking is novel and well-motivated, potentially leading to a new tracking paradigm.
- The paper provides convincing ablations and intuitive visualizations that clarify the mechanism and effectiveness of the proposed method.
- DeTrack achieves satisfactory performance gains on several benchmarks while maintaining real-time processing speed.
- Implementation details are clearly specified, ensuring reproducibility.
- The authors provide a detailed rebuttal that addresses most reviewer concerns, leading to increased ratings.
- The proposed method is recognized as novel and beneficial, with reviewers expressing a willingness to recommend the paper.

Weaknesses:
- The claim regarding the inefficiency of the DiffusionDet pipeline is misleading and requires a more detailed explanation of its advantages.
- The absence of state-of-the-art comparisons on TrackingNet, a key benchmark, is a significant oversight.
- Minor writing issues, such as inaccuracies in Table 2 and unclear claims about diffusion robustness, need to be addressed.
- The claim of requiring a "single forward pass" may confuse readers, as standard diffusion models can also be interpreted similarly.
- The initial visualization of bounding boxes may mislead due to the randomness introduced in the denoising process.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the inefficiency claim against DiffusionDet by elaborating on its architecture and computational efficiency. Additionally, the authors should include performance comparisons on TrackingNet to strengthen their evaluation. We also suggest correcting minor writing issues, such as verifying the records in Table 2 and providing appropriate citations for claims regarding diffusion robustness. Furthermore, clarifying the supervision of intermediate denoising outputs and the training process for visual and trajectory memory blocks would enhance the paper's clarity. We also recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the denoising process by incorporating additional details from the rebuttal into the manuscript and motivate their method from the perspective of denoising autoencoders rather than DDPM. Lastly, it would be beneficial to tone down the claims regarding the "single forward pass" to avoid potential confusion among readers.
