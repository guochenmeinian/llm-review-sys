### Key Points
This paper presents the Filtering-WoRA paradigm aimed at enhancing the efficiency of text-based person search during training. The authors propose a two-stage method that includes a filtering algorithm for selecting high-quality training data and the WoRA adaptation method for lightweight fine-tuning. The approach leverages cross-modality relevance and low-rank weight adaptations to reduce computational overhead and training time while achieving competitive performance. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The Filtering-WoRA paradigm effectively combines data curation with a lightweight adaptation strategy, addressing both data quality and computational efficiency.
2. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 19.82% reduction in training time while maintaining or improving retrieval performance, highlighting its practical value.
3. The methods are applicable across multiple datasets and tasks, showcasing robustness and transferability.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a direct comparison between the proposed Data Filtering method and existing data selection techniques, limiting understanding of its strengths and limitations.
2. WoRA's validation is primarily confined to text-based person search, with insufficient exploration of its effectiveness across broader tasks or larger models.
3. Concerns about potential overfitting to the filtered subset could lead to a loss of critical diversity, particularly in edge cases.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a direct comparison of the Data Filtering method with existing techniques to clarify its advantages and limitations. Additionally, providing experimental results on the impact of the filtering ratio on data quality would enhance understanding of the filtering pattern. It would be beneficial to validate WoRA's effectiveness on larger models and across a broader range of tasks. Furthermore, addressing potential overfitting by analyzing edge cases and evaluating the quality of the core dataset generated by the filtering algorithm could strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, including significance tests for the experimental results would provide a more robust evaluation of the proposed methods.
