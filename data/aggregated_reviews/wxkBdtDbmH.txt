Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on robust reinforcement learning (RL) using a Double-Sampling Uncertainty Set and an Integral Probability Metric Uncertainty Set to address challenges in large-scale problems. The authors propose a robust natural Actor-Critic (RNAC) algorithm with convergence guarantees and validate their approach through extensive experiments, including applications in MuJoCo environments and real-world robotics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and clear, with novel uncertainty set designs that demonstrate advantages in large-scale contexts.  
- The proposed uncertainty sets are computationally feasible for large state spaces, contributing significantly to the field.  
- The real-world application enhances the credibility of the robustness claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation behind the design of the uncertainty sets is unclear, particularly regarding the perturbation from the uniform distribution.  
- The convergence guarantees are limited to $(s,a)$-rectangular uncertainty sets, which restricts the generalizability of the results.  
- The experimental comparisons are insufficient, focusing only on PPO without addressing other relevant sim-to-real methods.  
- The relegation of related works to the appendix disrupts the reading flow and organization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for the uncertainty sets, particularly the rationale behind the perturbation from the uniform distribution. Additionally, we suggest expanding the experimental analysis to include comparisons with other sim-to-real methods, such as dynamics randomization and action noise envelope. Furthermore, we advise reorganizing the paper to integrate related works into the main text for better coherence and flow.
