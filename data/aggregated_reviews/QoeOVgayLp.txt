Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on selective sampling and imitation learning, proposing algorithms that leverage an online regression oracle for a function class \(\mathcal{F}\). The authors derive regret bounds that depend on the performance of the regression oracle and the eluder dimension, demonstrating that these bounds are necessary. The work also introduces a margin concept for expert confidence in imitation learning, arguing for the need for online learning to manage the exponential growth of expert trajectory requirements in offline settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulates the limitations of prior work, providing sound algorithms that address these issues.
2. The proposed sampling rule is simple and effectively captures the problem's complexity, with general regret bounds applicable to both adversarial and stochastic contexts.

Weaknesses:
1. The lack of direct theoretical comparisons with existing algorithms like Dagger limits the interpretation of the proposed algorithm's efficiency.
2. The experimental evaluation is limited, particularly the reliance on the Cartpole environment, which may not adequately reflect the algorithm's performance in more complex scenarios.
3. The algorithms depend on solving optimization problems that may not be tractable for many function classes, raising concerns about their practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental evaluation by including comparisons with existing baselines such as Dagger to better illustrate the proposed algorithms' performance. Additionally, we suggest providing more detailed explanations of how the online regression oracle can be utilized to solve the optimization problems in Equations (5) and (6). Clarifying the implications of using approximations for \(\Delta_t(x_t)\) and addressing the computational demands of querying multiple experts would enhance the paper's robustness. Finally, including empirical observations to support Proposition 1 and extending the discussion on the generalizability of the results to stochastic settings would strengthen the overall contribution.
