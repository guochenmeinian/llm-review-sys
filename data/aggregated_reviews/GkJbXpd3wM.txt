Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Mean Prediction (MP) method for the active set ordering problem, selecting k inputs with the highest Gaussian Process posterior mean values through a unique sampling strategy. The authors provide a detailed theoretical analysis of the method's regret, prediction, and sampling strategy, and demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments on synthetic functions and real-life applications. The paper also includes GP-UCB Bayesian optimization as a specific case of the active set ordering problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers adequate theoretical justification for the proposed method, clearly stating the motivation for the active set ordering problem, with valid proofs on regret bounds, prediction, and sampling strategy.
2. The formulation of black-box function optimization as a set ordering problem introduces novelty, providing an alternative sampling strategy that can be more informative than traditional metrics.

Weaknesses:
1. The dimensionality of the problem is a concern; while the theoretical justification holds for any dimension, experiments are limited to 2-dimensional problems, which may not adequately demonstrate the method's practical applicability.
2. The sampling-based method appears to be restricted to discrete space problems, as the classic GP model is used on continuous space but samples on a discretized space during inference, potentially missing significant probabilistic information.
3. The experimental design raises questions regarding efficiency compared to brute force sampling, particularly in the Goldstein-Price function experiment, where the input domain is discretized into only 100 points.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including higher-dimensional problems to better demonstrate the practical applicability of the MP method. Additionally, clarifying the efficiency of the sampling strategy compared to brute force methods would strengthen the justification for the proposed approach. We also suggest providing explicit quantification of problem-dependent quantities in the regret bound and including a lower bound analysis to assess the tightness of the upper bound. Lastly, we encourage the authors to acknowledge the similarities between their algorithm and those used in top-k arm identification more explicitly.
