Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for generating counterfactual explanations for search results by creating alternative queries that could reorder documents. The authors propose an algorithm to generate these queries and evaluate their effectiveness through both automatic metrics and human judgments. The work is motivated by the need for better explanations in search contexts, particularly in cases where explanations are crucial.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation and underlying ideas are compelling and well-articulated.
- The problem definition is clear and the proposed method is easy to follow.
- The paper includes a broad evaluation, encompassing both automatic metrics and human studies.

Weaknesses:
- The contribution of the paper is not immediately clear, particularly regarding the practical utility of the proposed explanations.
- There is low inter-annotator agreement in human evaluations, raising concerns about the reliability of the results.
- The evaluation metrics, such as the MaxFlip metric, may unfairly favor the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the use cases for their explanations, specifying the intended audience and context. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the low agreement among human judges by providing more details on the evaluation process. It would also be beneficial to include more examples to illustrate how the counterfactual queries function as explanations in practice. Finally, we encourage the authors to acknowledge the limitations of their evaluation metrics and consider incorporating user feedback on the perceived usefulness of the explanations.
