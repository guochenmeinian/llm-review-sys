Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a skeleton-free pipeline for implicit 3D pose representation and transfer, introducing the prediction of Jacobian fields for shape-preserving representation. A per-identity refinement step is included, utilizing intrinsic-preserving loss, and a cascaded diffusion model is employed on the compact pose representation to generate novel poses. The authors propose a keypoint-based hybrid pose representation with a sparse mesh, allowing the implicit deformation network to utilize mesh face coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the method's superiority over baseline networks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The use of Jacobian fields for shape representation is innovative.  
2. The incorporation of an intermediate step for intrinsic preservation is justified.  
3. Extensive experimental results establish the method's superiority, with clear qualitative improvements.  
4. The writing is clear, effectively illustrating the methodology and evaluation.

Weaknesses:  
1. FPS sampling may lead to uneven distribution of keypoints on complex poses, potentially affecting pose representation.  
2. The shape information is entangled in keypoints' coordinates, which could lead to encoding issues in latent features.  
3. No video or animated results are provided, making it difficult to evaluate 3D consistency.  
4. The limitations of Jacobian fields and failure cases related to FPS sampling are not fully addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by providing pose transfer results for both source and target meshes from the Mixamo dataset and comparing these with results from the ECCV 2022 paper "Skeleton-free Pose Transfer for Stylized 3D Characters." Additionally, comparing training and inference times with baseline methods would provide insights into computational efficiency. It would also be beneficial to include qualitative results for the ablation study and analyze the keypoints, including the number and sampling method. Finally, addressing the potential drawbacks of using Jacobian fields and discussing failure cases related to FPS sampling would enhance the paper's robustness.
