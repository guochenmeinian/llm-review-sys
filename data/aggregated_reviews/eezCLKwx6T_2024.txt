Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a diffusion model with a differentiable regret estimate for unsupervised environment design (UED). The authors propose a diffusion process to model environment parameters, utilizing a scoring function pre-trained on random environments. The method incorporates regret guidance to enhance curriculum learning for agents, demonstrating competitive performance across various control domains.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The contributions are well-motivated and appear novel, addressing significant shortcomings in prior UED approaches.
* The writing is generally clear and concise, effectively contextualizing the work within existing literature.
* The implementation of a differentiable regret approximation is a compelling advancement for environment modeling.

Weaknesses:
* The x-axis in plots shows total steps rather than student gradient updates, disadvantaging replay methods. This should align with literature standards.
* Baselines are relatively weak; comparisons against stronger baselines like CLUTR and improved PAIRED should be included.
* The requirement for a pre-training phase with access to the environment is a notable limitation, which should be explicitly discussed.
* The paper lacks clarity on the critical components of the diffusion process and the necessity of the entropy term.
* Minor grammatical issues and unclear metrics for complexity, such as the use of shortest path length, need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the x-axis of the plots to reflect student gradient updates for a fair comparison. Additionally, please include stronger baselines like CLUTR and the improved PAIRED in the comparisons to strengthen the evaluation. It is crucial to discuss the limitation of requiring a pre-training phase more explicitly. Clarifying the importance of the diffusion process and the entropy term through ablation studies would enhance the paper's rigor. Lastly, addressing minor grammatical issues and refining the complexity metrics will improve overall clarity.
