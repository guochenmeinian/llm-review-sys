### Key Points
This paper presents UnDiff, an uncertainty-inspired anomaly detection method aimed at improving detection performance in network security, particularly for handling anomaly-drift issues. UnDiff quantifies anomaly degrees through uncertainty deviations between samples, demonstrating superior detection accuracy in extensive experiments, especially in scenarios involving anomaly drift. The methodology innovatively integrates evidential learning for uncertainty quantification, shifting focus from traditional intra-sample analysis to inter-sample differences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of Evidential Deep Learning concepts into network security is insightful.
2. The paper features clear and concise illustrations and visualizations.
3. The experimental design is comprehensive, effectively showcasing the proposed method's performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity in articulating the paper's motivation and insights, particularly in the introduction. Specific issues include:
   - The need for quantitative results in Figure 1 to demonstrate representation distances.
   - A lack of emphasis on the significance of anomaly drift in real networks.
   - An abrupt introduction of model uncertainty that may confuse readers.
   - Potential disruption of flow by adding subtitles like "Limitations" and "Contributions."
2. The novelty of focusing on anomaly drift is questioned, as the true challenge may lie in the similarity between anomaly and normal samples.
3. Technical details, such as data preprocessing and the handling of variable channels in flow images, are insufficiently explained.
4. The experimental analysis may not adequately address the challenges of drifted anomalies due to dataset differences.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly in the introduction, by clearly articulating the motivation and significance of the anomaly drift problem. Additionally, we suggest providing quantitative results in Figure 1 and emphasizing the implications of anomaly drift in real networks. A brief introduction to model uncertainty should be included earlier in the text. 

We also encourage the authors to clarify the novelty of their approach by addressing the true challenges of anomaly drift and considering the implications of their findings. The data preprocessing section should be expanded to include details about flow image dimensions and the conversion process, ideally accompanied by a flowchart. 

Furthermore, we recommend including more real-world scenarios in the experiments to enhance generalizability and conducting a detailed analysis of hyperparameter impacts on performance. Lastly, the authors should explore the algorithm's complexity and time efficiency, particularly in relation to large-scale datasets, to ensure practical applicability.
