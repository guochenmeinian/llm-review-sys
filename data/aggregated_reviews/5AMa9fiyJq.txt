Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a general theory of cooperative communication, addressing the core challenge of establishing common ground, defined as the shared knowledge necessary for effective communication. The authors critique prior models for assuming perfect knowledge sharing and propose a mathematically principled framework that defines a spectrum of common ground possibilities. They introduce concepts such as conditional teaching and learning plans, parametric common ground, and communication cost, framing the communication process as an encoder-decoder problem linked to variational autoencoders. Empirical simulations support their theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively generalizes previous models of cooperative communication, accommodating various levels of shared knowledge.
2. The theoretical framework is mathematically rigorous, enhancing its credibility.
3. The connection between common ground and variational autoencoders is a novel contribution.
4. Empirical results provide robust support for the theoretical assertions.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, with excessive technical jargon and insufficient explanations of notations, making it challenging for readers.
2. The paper does not adequately analyze the relationship between the proposed theory and cognitive science concepts of common ground.
3. There is a lack of discussion on the practical implications and real-world applications of the theory.
4. The experimental results are presented without thorough interpretation, leaving questions about their significance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing clearer definitions and explanations of technical terms and notations. Additionally, we suggest including an illustrative figure to aid in understanding the proposed theory. The authors should also elaborate on the differences between their theory and existing works, and discuss potential applications and limitations of their framework in real-world scenarios. Finally, a more thorough analysis of the experimental results and their implications would enhance the paper's impact.
