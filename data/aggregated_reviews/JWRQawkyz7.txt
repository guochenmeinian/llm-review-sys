### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to assessing connectivity fairness within network communities by adapting the concept of group modularity. The authors propose fairness-aware community detection algorithms and investigate whether groups are equally well-connected within their communities. The study emphasizes the importance of equitable connections and diversity in mitigating biases within network structures. The authors pose three research questions to explore the characteristics contributing to unfairness, the conditions for improving fairness through algorithm modifications, and the effectiveness of their definitions of unfairness and diversity.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1) The concepts of connectivity fairness and group modularity are innovative and relevant.
2) The proposed algorithms are grounded in solid mathematical foundations.
3) The experimental evaluation includes a variety of network structures and parameters, providing comprehensive insights.
4) The paper is well-organized and clearly articulates its objectives.

Weaknesses:
1) Certain proposed concepts, such as modularity unfairness, lack clarity and formalization.
2) The manuscript does not adequately compare the proposed methods with state-of-the-art baseline approaches.
3) Some experimental results are difficult to follow due to unclear references to figures and lines.
4) The paper lacks necessary theoretical analyses, including computational complexity and statistical significance of results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the definitions, particularly regarding "equally well-connected" and the range of modularity unfairness. Formalizing these concepts will enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest providing a theoretical computational complexity analysis of the Fairness-Aware Louvain method and addressing the limitations of the original modularity metric and the randomness problem in the Louvain algorithm. The authors should also clarify the statistical significance of their results and ensure comparisons with contemporary baseline methods. Finally, discussing the trade-offs between community tightness and fairness/diversity, as well as introducing practical applications of their method, would strengthen the paper's impact.
