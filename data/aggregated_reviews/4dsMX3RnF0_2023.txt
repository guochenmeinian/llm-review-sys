Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset of synthetically generated mammograms, M-SYNTH, which simulates various breast and mass characteristics, including size, density, and radiation dose. The authors claim that this dataset can be utilized to evaluate the performance of AI algorithms in mammography, demonstrating that model performance decreases with increased breast density and improves with larger tumor mass. The methodology is based on established physics-based models and offers a comprehensive range of clinical scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is significantly larger than existing simulated mammography datasets, providing a valuable resource for the medical imaging community.
- The paper is well-structured and clearly written, effectively communicating its contributions.
- The use of simulations mitigates ethical concerns associated with patient data, and the authors acknowledge the limitations of simulated datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The dataset generation relies solely on the VICTRE pipeline, limiting variability.
- The "Limitations" section lacks clarity regarding the dataset's representativeness of real-world data and the expectations for users to generate their own data.
- The paper could benefit from more detailed documentation on the pipeline and the inclusion of scripts for reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the "Limitations" section to clarify the dataset's intended use primarily for comparative analysis, rather than as a comprehensive framework for testing medical AI devices. Additionally, providing a summary of the VICTRE pipeline and including scripts or a Docker image for users to replicate the data generation process would enhance the dataset's usability. The authors should also consider exploring additional simulation pipelines to increase dataset variability and discuss the results and dataset generation in greater detail. Lastly, revising the title to remove the term "regulatory" and using a license that requests attribution would be beneficial.
