### Key Points
This paper presents a BIO frame tagging method for sequences and single signs, arguing its benefits for segmentation tasks in sign language. The authors propose a 3D normalization method for handshapes using MediaPipe's hand model. The experimental results indicate that the proposed method does not show improvement over the baseline E1, challenging the contribution of the Hand Norm. The analysis of results lacks depth, particularly regarding the performance drop when incorporating facial expression data and the lack of benefits from the proposed hand norm. The paper includes an extensive appendix that could be condensed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- The introduction of 3D hand normalization is seen as a potentially original and valuable contribution.
- The proposed model may have applications in real-world data collection for sign language.

Weaknesses:
- Experimental results do not demonstrate clear superiority over the baseline, raising concerns about the validity of the contributions.
- The novelty of using BIO tagging is questioned, as it has been previously proposed for similar tasks.
- The analysis of results is insufficient, particularly regarding the drop in performance with certain features.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comprehensiveness of the results analysis, specifically addressing why adding facial expression data lowers performance and the lack of benefits from the proposed hand norm. Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider using additional publicly available corpora to enhance training data and generalization. The authors should also clarify the performance of other experiments to demonstrate generalization and consider reducing the appendix content to focus on essential information.
