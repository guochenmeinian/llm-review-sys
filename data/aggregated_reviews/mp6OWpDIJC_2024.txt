Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the cooperation of LLM-based agents under information asymmetry, a practical issue in real-world applications. The authors propose the method of InfoNav and Mixed Memory to enhance agent capabilities and introduce a new benchmark, InformativeBench, for evaluating agent collaboration in these scenarios. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, with comprehensive analyses and discussions provided.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The information asymmetry scenario is both interesting and practical, with a clear preliminary definition provided by the authors.
2. The proposed methods, particularly InfoNav and Mixed Memory, offer intuitive solutions for the task at hand.
3. The benchmark contributes significantly to the field, extending the tree structure into a graph structure, which opens avenues for further research.

Weaknesses:
1. The evaluation lacks comparisons of iAgent with other methods beyond different LLM cores; naive methods, such as shared memory for all agents, should be included as baselines.
2. The figures' font size should be enlarged for better readability.
3. The ablation studies are incomplete, missing some baselines, and the dataset collection process is unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons of iAgent with naive baseline methods, such as agents maintaining their own memory with recursive communication. Additionally, we suggest enlarging the font size in figures for enhanced clarity. The authors should also provide more insights into the memory capacity of each agent, including average and variance calculations, as this can significantly impact retrieval results. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore using all memory context as part of the prompt for memory retrieval, potentially leveraging long-context LLMs like GPT-4. Lastly, a more detailed theoretical analysis of the iAgents mechanism would strengthen the paper's contributions.
