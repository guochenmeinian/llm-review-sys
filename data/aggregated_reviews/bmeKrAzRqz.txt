Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an architecture that integrates synthetic gaze data into a pre-trained language model, enhancing performance on various NLP tasks, particularly in low-resource scenarios. The authors propose a unified model that combines a scanpath generation model with a language model augmented by human scanpaths, effectively addressing data scarcity issues. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms the BERT baseline, especially in sentiment classification and on the GLUE benchmark.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of synthetic gaze data is a novel approach that alleviates data scarcity in NLP tasks.
- The paper is well-written, structured, and motivated, demonstrating significant performance improvements over BERT in low-resource settings.

Weaknesses:
- The model's performance declines when the number of scanpaths is fewer than five, suggesting a reliance on aggregating predicted scanpaths, which requires further analysis.
- The advantages of synthetic gaze data diminish with larger datasets, raising questions about its necessity when sufficient language data is available.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the model's performance with fewer scanpaths to clarify its reliance on aggregation. Additionally, further experiments should be conducted to explore the diminishing returns of synthetic gaze data with larger datasets, particularly to confirm its value in low-resource situations. We also suggest addressing the discrepancy in performance metrics mentioned in the questions and providing insights into the observed performance peaks related to scanpath numbers. Lastly, consider repositioning the paper within the context of "human-centered NLP," as the focus is on removing human input rather than centering it.
