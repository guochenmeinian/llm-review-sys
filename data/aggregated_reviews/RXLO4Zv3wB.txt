Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a low-level visual descriptor utilizing text embeddings, exploring its application across various low-level vision tasks. The authors introduce Deep Degradation Response (DDR), a method for quantifying changes in image deep features under different degradation conditions, reporting its effectiveness in blind image quality assessment and image restoration tasks. The paper compares DDR with existing techniques and plans to release the code for public use.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The experiments are detailed and sufficient, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methods across multiple applications.
2. The paper is well-written, with a clear presentation of the methods and results.

Weaknesses:
1. The use of a text-based model for low-level visual information appears similar to Q-Bench, necessitating a comparison to highlight differences.
2. The network settings for single-image super-resolution (SISR) are deemed unreasonable, with suggestions to use RCAN, SwinIR, and HAT instead of NAFNet and Restormer.
3. The performance of DDR on blind image quality assessment is not competitive, lacking comparisons with recent IQA metrics like LIQE, UNIQUE, and TreS.
4. The calculation of DDR raises questions regarding its superiority over LPIPS, as the paper does not clarify why DDR outperforms it.
5. Clarity issues exist regarding the distribution of DDR and the definitions of degradation types, which hinder understanding.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with Q-Bench to emphasize the differences between the proposed method and existing approaches. Additionally, the authors should reconsider the network settings for SISR, opting for more suitable models like RCAN, SwinIR, and HAT. It is crucial to include comparisons with the latest IQA metrics and clarify the rationale behind DDR's performance relative to LPIPS. Furthermore, we suggest enhancing the clarity of technical details, particularly regarding the distribution of DDR and the definitions of degradation types. Lastly, the authors should justify their choice of specific words for degradation prompts and discuss the robustness of the method against variations in wording.
