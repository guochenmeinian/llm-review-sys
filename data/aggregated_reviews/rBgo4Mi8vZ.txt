### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance the performance of shallow transformer models by interleaving initial outputs back into the model as inputs, thereby avoiding exponential growth in sequence length. The authors investigate whether this method can enable transformers to achieve performance levels closer to deeper models. The results indicate improvements in accuracy over standard transformers, supported by clear visualizations and a sufficient number of architectural comparisons.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The goals, methods, and results are clear and well-articulated.
- The approach effectively trades off model depth with sequence length, demonstrating significant improvements in accuracy.
- The paper includes readable visualizations and a comprehensive evaluation across multiple architectures and datasets.

Weaknesses:
- The frameworks used in the study are not specified.
- There is insufficient detail regarding training processes, including baseline comparisons and training durations.
- The increase in sequence length leads to a significant rise in FLOPs, which has not been quantified or analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
- We recommend that the authors improve Table 1 by adding annotations to clarify the reported metrics and correcting the typo in row 5.
- We suggest including more detailed training information, such as baseline performance and training durations, to better contextualize the results.
- We encourage the authors to quantify the FLOP costs associated with the proposed method to provide a clearer understanding of its computational implications.
