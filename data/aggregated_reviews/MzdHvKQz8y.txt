Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the first investigation of the impact of the Strengthened Code of Practice (CoP) on Disinformation regarding the demonetization of misinformation websites. The authors find that the CoP has a limited effect on the misinformation ecosystem, particularly impacting less popular misinformation websites, while popular ad networks continue to facilitate the monetization of misinformation. The study employs a novel methodology and provides insights that could be beneficial for policymakers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study addresses a highly relevant issue regarding the effectiveness of self-regulatory mechanisms against misinformation.
- It presents five interesting findings that are not commonly known.
- The methodology is technically solid, and the analysis is comprehensive, with conclusions well-supported by evidence.
- The paper is well-organized and accessible, although the Related Work section requires improvement.
- The authors have curated and publicly shared a list of misinformation websites.

Weaknesses:
- The study design relies on observational data, leading to correlation rather than causation, raising concerns about hidden confounding biases.
- The paper does not clearly differentiate between disinformation and misinformation.
- Limitations of the study are not explicitly stated, particularly regarding financial incentives and the absence of data from 2018.
- The Related Work section lacks a cohesive narrative and does not adequately highlight how this work differs from previous studies.
- The methodology for defining misinformation websites may be too broad, including biased but popular news outlets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the study design and explicitly state its limitations, particularly regarding financial incentives and the lack of historical data. The authors should differentiate between disinformation and misinformation clearly and provide insights on how to address the identified issues. We suggest enhancing the Related Work section by creating a narrative that highlights research gaps and how this study builds upon previous work. Additionally, the authors should clarify the methodology for defining misinformation websites and consider using a more rigorous dataset for verification. Lastly, we recommend including illustrative figures to aid in explaining the methods and findings more effectively.
