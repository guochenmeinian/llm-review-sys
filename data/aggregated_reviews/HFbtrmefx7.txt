Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents "FedTherapist," a privacy-preserving mobile system for mental health monitoring utilizing user-generated text data from speech and keyboard inputs on smartphones. The authors employ Federated Learning to decentralize model training, ensuring user privacy, and introduce the Context-Aware Language Learning (CALL) methodology, which incorporates various temporal contexts to enhance the model's ability to detect mental health signals. The evaluation indicates that FedTherapist with CALL achieves higher accuracy in predicting mental health statuses compared to models trained with non-text data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant issue in mental health monitoring, leveraging user-generated text data, which represents a notable advancement in applying NLP techniques to health monitoring.
- The use of Federated Learning effectively addresses privacy concerns associated with personal data.
- The empirical evaluation using real-world user data adds credibility and sets a benchmark for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is based on a relatively small sample size of 46 participants, limiting the generalizability of the results.
- The paper lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis with existing methods, which would clarify the proposed system's strengths and weaknesses.
- There is insufficient discussion regarding potential privacy risks and their mitigation beyond Federated Learning.
- The absence of software or pre-trained model releases may hinder reproducibility.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the main body by including important methodological details currently relegated to the appendices, such as the data splits used in Table 1 and the results of Table 2, which stem from a leave-one-user-out cross-validation. Additionally, we suggest providing more details on the hyperparameter tuning process for the end-to-end BERT model and elaborating on the privacy-preserving measures implemented in FedTherapist beyond Federated Learning. A larger-scale validation of the system's effectiveness should also be planned, along with a more extensive comparative analysis with existing mental health monitoring systems. Finally, we encourage the authors to consider releasing software or pre-trained models to enhance reproducibility and community engagement.
