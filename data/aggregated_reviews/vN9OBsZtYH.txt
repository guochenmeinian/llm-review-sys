Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative framework aimed at enhancing fairness guarantees in classifiers amidst noise in sensitive attributes and labels, treating the problem as a distribution shift. The authors propose a fair representation learning method that minimizes the divergence between noisy and clean distributions without requiring noise rate estimation. The theoretical analysis supports the method's efficacy, and empirical results demonstrate improved fairness and accuracy across various datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively addresses a significant research problem regarding fairness under noisy training data, framing it as a distribution shift issue.
- The theoretical analysis establishes a solid connection between group fairness and noisy data, providing valuable insights.
- Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms baseline approaches in terms of fairness and accuracy.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with existing methods that specifically address distribution shifts in fairness contexts, limiting the understanding of the proposed method's relative performance.
- The theoretical bounds presented are not empirically evaluated, leaving questions about practical applicability.
- The discussion of fairness metrics and interventions lacks clarity and structure, particularly in differentiating between individual and group fairness.
- The paper does not adequately address the limitations of the proposed method, including its applicability to multi-class scenarios and the assumptions made regarding distribution shifts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental section by including comparisons with methods that explicitly address distribution shifts in fairness. Additionally, we suggest providing empirical evaluations of the theoretical bounds to enhance practical understanding. The authors should clarify the discussion of fairness metrics by distinguishing between individual and group fairness and acknowledging emerging mini-max fairness notions. Furthermore, we advise that the authors elaborate on the general framework of fairness-enhancing interventions before detailing specific techniques. Lastly, a thorough discussion of the limitations and potential negative societal impacts of the proposed method should be included to provide a more comprehensive view of its applicability.
