Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset comprising three essential experimental characterization techniques for molecular structures: mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance, and infrared spectroscopy. The dataset is constructed from the USPTO reaction database, and the authors propose two realistic tasks: structure elucidation and spectra prediction. While the paper addresses a significant challenge in the field, concerns arise regarding the simulated data, particularly the use of CFM-ID 4.0, which is deemed outdated in the literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper tackles an important problem and offers a large multimodal spectral dataset (790k molecules) that can expedite automated synthesis.  
- The workflow is realistic, and the documentation is well-organized, making the dataset accessible to the community.  

Weaknesses:  
- The dataset construction raises concerns, particularly regarding the quality of simulated mass spectra.  
- The evaluation metrics lack detail, and the paper does not adequately discuss the performance of current models, with low accuracy scores reported without exploration of underlying reasons.  
- There is insufficient discussion on the limitations of each spectral type and the potential for combining them in future work.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the dataset construction by either employing stronger simulation methods or integrating experimental data, such as from the GNPS database. Additionally, the authors should provide error bars or standard deviations for the ML model results, clarify the validation split and hyperparameter tuning process, and address the checklist points regarding theoretical results and crowdsourcing. A more thorough investigation of the real-simulated gap is also suggested, particularly by benchmarking against experimental spectra. Finally, a discussion on the limitations of each spectral type and the complexities of structure elucidation should be included.
