Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) perspective for Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) applied to non-linear partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors find that previous NTK considerations for linear PDEs do not hold for non-linear cases due to the non-vanishing Hessian term, leading to a lack of guaranteed global convergence for gradient descent. They propose the use of second-order methods, demonstrating through experiments that these methods can achieve faster convergence and alleviate spectral bias.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and flows nicely, providing both theoretical and empirical analyses.
- The investigation into the NTK's behavior in non-linear regimes is elegant, and the experiments support the findings.

Weaknesses:
- The differing behavior of the NTK for non-linear PDEs is not particularly surprising, nor is the observation that second-order methods can perform better, despite their practical shortcomings.
- The applicability of Theorem 4.2 is only briefly sketched, and the conditions for its application may be difficult to verify in practice.
- There is a lack of guidance for practitioners on when to use second-order methods, given their computational expense.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of the second-order method, particularly by providing a more detailed explanation beyond the brief mention in lines 218-222. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include practical guidance for practitioners regarding the conditions under which second-order methods may be advantageous. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore extending their findings to inexact Newton methods, as well as to clarify the runtime of the LM algorithm for completeness.
