### Key Points
This paper presents a computational model of auditory word processing based on a Bayesian decision model that estimates EEG data, specifically Event-Related Potentials, during speech input. The authors propose a set of model comparisons linking linguistic input to neural EEG responses, emphasizing the temporal and process-level dynamics of spoken-word recognition. The results suggest that word recognition and contextual integration may begin before the completion of word-recognition processes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured and written, contributing significantly to understanding the neural and temporal dynamics of spoken word recognition.  
- The integration of psycholinguistic theories with computational modeling is commendable, and the model comparisons provide clear theoretical insights.  
- The methods are sound, and the analysis sheds light on important research questions.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper exceeds the 8-page limit for the conference, with the limitations section extending onto the 9th page.  
- The EEG data are highly band-limited to 0.5-8 Hz, differing from standard ERP analysis, raising concerns about potential phase and amplitude distortions.  
- There is ambiguity regarding the theoretical contributions of the proposed cognitive model, particularly in terms of its testable predictions and its comparison with existing frameworks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper's contributions, particularly regarding the proposed cognitive model and its relationship to prior work on single-word and word-in-context recognition. A more explicit discussion comparing the model with existing frameworks, such as the one by Smith and Levy (2010), would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting a robustness analysis to assess the sensitivity of model fitting results to the choice of filter used in EEG data analysis. Finally, addressing the concerns about the model's parameter-dependence and providing more details on the motivation behind the *variable model* would strengthen the paper.
