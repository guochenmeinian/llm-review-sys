Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel ensemble sampling (ES) approach for the linear bandit problem, achieving a frequentist regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, which is a significant advancement over previous studies that struggled to reach such performance levels. The authors argue that this result matches the regret bound of Linear Thompson Sampling (LinTS) and is a substantial contribution to the bandit research community. They introduce a comprehensive analytical framework that encompasses various algorithms, including a novel technique to ensure the optimism of ES, and establish that linear perturbed-history exploration (LinPHE) is a special case of ES. The authors clarify that the condition on ensemble size, $K\log T$, is sufficient but not necessary, countering claims that their analysis contradicts empirical evidence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed algorithm achieves a regret bound of $\tilde{O}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$, improving the dependency on $d$ and matching the regret bound of Thompson sampling.
- The paper introduces innovative proof techniques and a robust theoretical framework that enhances clarity and understanding, addressing a long-standing theoretical problem in the field.
- The introduction of a novel theoretical analysis ensures the optimism of ES and provides a detailed comparison with existing work, highlighting its contributions.
- The authors clarify the distinction between sufficient and necessary conditions, addressing common misunderstandings.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical analysis does not derive the regret upper bound for ensemble sampling in linear contextual bandits, and this limitation is not discussed in detail.
- The analysis does not sufficiently address the computational aspects of ensemble size selection, which is crucial for practical implementations.
- The scaling of the ensemble size with $K$ raises concerns, as it may lead to impractical scenarios in continuous domains.
- The comparison between Bayesian and frequentist regret is flawed, as these metrics are distinct and should not be directly compared.
- The abstract lacks clarity due to the introduction of terms like 'K' and 'LinPHE' without prior explanation, and some claims regarding practical implications may not align with empirical evidence.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract by defining terms such as 'K' and 'LinPHE' beforehand. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide a more detailed discussion on the limitations of their theoretical analysis, particularly regarding the regret upper bound for ensemble sampling in linear contextual bandits. It would also be beneficial to address the implications of the ensemble size scaling with $K$ and provide empirical evidence to support their theoretical claims about practical applications. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve their analysis by incorporating a comprehensive evaluation of both computational aspects and regret bounds, particularly how the ensemble size is chosen. Clarifying the practical implications of their theoretical results and addressing the differences between Bayesian and frequentist regret in their discussions would enhance the clarity and rigor of their arguments. Lastly, we suggest revising the presentation of their theoretical results to ensure that distinctions made are easily understood by reviewers and readers alike.
