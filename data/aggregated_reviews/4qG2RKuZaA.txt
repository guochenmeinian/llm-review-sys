Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method for censoring unwanted image generation in diffusion models by employing a reward model trained on human feedback. The authors propose using lightweight reward model ensembles for benign-dominant scenarios and imitation learning for malign-dominant scenarios, demonstrating effectiveness across various datasets with minimal human input.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors identify an important problem of misalignment in diffusion models, contributing to the utility of generative models and potential positive social impact.
- The proposed method is efficient, requiring only a few minutes of human feedback and no fine-tuning, making it practical for implementation.
- Empirical results indicate that the approach can effectively reduce malign image generation.

Weaknesses:
- The techniques utilized are well-known, leading to perceptions of incremental contributions.
- The paper lacks large-scale comparisons with existing methods, making it difficult to ascertain the superiority of the proposed approach.
- The structure and clarity of the paper could be improved, particularly regarding the introduction of key concepts and the rationale behind certain methodological choices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the paper's structure, particularly by introducing key concepts and notations earlier. Additionally, providing more extensive comparisons with existing methods would strengthen the argument for the proposed approach. It would also be beneficial to clarify the rationale behind using product-based reward models and to address the complexity of tasks when discussing human feedback efficiency. Finally, including a discussion on the limitations of the proposed method and its potential scalability to more complex diffusion models would enhance the paper's depth.
