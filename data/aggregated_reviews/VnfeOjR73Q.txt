Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a model for understanding how humans estimate probability distributions based on sequentially observed data points. The authors propose a framework that includes a "Rational component," which generalizes the Chinese restaurant process (CRP), and an "Aleatoric component," which introduces structured noise to account for human error. The model is fitted to experimental data, demonstrating improved performance over baseline models. Additionally, the authors provide a revised analysis of the model's ability to capture subject behavior using the economical ICP framework, with enhanced figure legends that clarify data representation and analysis, including details on cluster properties and model recovery. The revisions address previous concerns about the model's efficacy in reflecting subject behavior.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of real human experimental data is novel and engaging.
- The structured online density estimation task is clearly defined and effectively executed.
- The model's ability to explain the tendency of participants to report a consistent number of clusters, regardless of the ground truth, is a significant contribution.
- The authors effectively clarified their methodology and results through improved figure legends and additional analyses.
- The revisions significantly addressed concerns regarding the model's ability to capture subject behavior.

Weaknesses:
- Certain aspects of the model, particularly the aleatoric component, lack clarity and motivation.
- The model's fit to the data is not robust, raising questions about its ability to accurately capture human behavior.
- The complexity of the proposed model may not align with the cognitive processes of participants, leading to potential overfitting.
- Some reviewers expressed skepticism about the necessity of memorizing all previous data for boundary-based estimates, suggesting that only extremal points might be needed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the aleatoric component by providing more intuition behind the choices made in the model. Specifically, elucidating the necessity of the "slack" probability and the structured noise in equation 6 would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors validate their model's performance by comparing it against simpler psychological heuristics that might explain the observed behaviors, particularly regarding the relationship between sample size and cluster estimation. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their model's relationship to visually driven spatial priors, as this remains an interesting yet unresolved question. Finally, consider addressing the concerns regarding the memorization of data points in the context of boundary-based estimates.
