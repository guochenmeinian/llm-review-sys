### Key Points
This paper presents a study on visual program induction (VPI), proposing an Edit Network that predicts local edits to improve visual programs toward a target, trained alongside a one-shot generation model. The joint training aims to enhance self-supervised learning through better-bootstrapped data. Results across three VPI domains indicate that the edit network can enhance model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is technically sound, with quantitative and qualitative results demonstrating performance improvements.
- The problem is well-motivated and clearly defined, with comprehensive ablation studies showing the method's effectiveness.
- The paper is well-written, featuring clear illustrations of the method's novelty.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of diverse baselines makes it challenging to evaluate the proposed method's effectiveness compared to prior approaches.
- The improvement from the Edit Network appears marginal, particularly in certain domains.
- Designing editing operations necessitates manual efforts, which may limit generalizability to other domains.
- The findEdits algorithm lacks sufficient detail for reproducibility, raising concerns about implementation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with established baselines, such as supervised results or fine-tuning of large multimodal models. Additionally, providing a more thorough analysis of the marginal gains observed in the ablation studies would clarify the importance of each component. To enhance generalizability, consider exploring automated methods for designing editing operations. Finally, we urge the authors to include more detailed explanations of the findEdits algorithm to facilitate reproducibility.
