Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhance text-to-SQL tasks through prompt design strategies that incorporate demonstration-selection and schema augmentation. The authors propose a method that first generates a preliminary SQL query to retrieve demonstrations, considering both diversity and similarity to the test instance. Additionally, the paper explores how to represent schema-related knowledge in prompts and employs ensemble techniques to address sensitivity issues. The proposed method outperforms previous state-of-the-art in-context learning and fine-tuned methods, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple text-to-SQL datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper provides a comprehensive comparison of demonstration retrieval strategies, emphasizing the importance of both similarity and diversity.
2. It effectively studies schema-related knowledge representation in zero-shot prompt designs.
3. The experiments conducted on various text-to-SQL datasets validate the generalization of the findings.
4. The writing is clear and accessible.

Weaknesses:
1. The authors should clarify their use of "we propose," as some claims may overlap with existing literature.
2. The comparison against a customized baseline complicates direct alignment with previous work, limiting the validation of the proposed methods.
3. The presentation of key ideas, particularly in sample selection, lacks clarity and coherence.
4. The technical contributions are perceived as limited, with some findings not being particularly novel or surprising.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding originality and ensure proper attribution to prior work, particularly in instances where similar ideas have been previously proposed. Additionally, we suggest refining the organization of the paper to enhance the flow and understanding of the proposed methods. Including concrete examples, especially in Section 2.1, would significantly aid comprehension. Furthermore, providing more details on experimental setups, such as the number of testing samples and parameter settings, would enhance reproducibility. Lastly, addressing the rationale behind certain methodological choices and clarifying terminology used throughout the paper would strengthen the overall presentation.
