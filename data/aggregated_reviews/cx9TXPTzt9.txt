### Key Points
This paper presents a new technique for approximating the predictive distribution in Bayesian Deep Learning (BDL) using an approximate posterior. The authors propose a faster method compared to standard Monte Carlo sampling by making a Gaussian approximation for the neural network's linear layer and applying local linearizations to the activation function. The overall presentation is good, and the experiments are broad, contributing valuable insights to an underexplored topic.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed technique is faster than traditional Monte Carlo methods.  
- The paper provides a valuable contribution to the field of Bayesian Deep Learning.  
- The experiments conducted are reasonably thorough.

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of the approach is questioned, as it is not fully new and lacks a clear performance advantage over existing methods like GLM.  
- The report of error bars and the marking of "winning" methods is unclear.  
- Certain technical aspects, such as the clarity of notation and phrasing, require improvement.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by addressing the following points:  
- Explain why only the last two transformer blocks and the classification head are considered, discussing trade-offs regarding speed and performance.  
- Explore the generalizability of the proposed method by considering other neural network architectures.  
- Ensure that all terms, such as IVON, are properly referenced in the main text.  
- Clarify the advantages of the proposed method over existing linearization techniques, particularly in terms of performance.  
- Revise unclear phrasing and grammatical errors throughout the paper, such as in the sections discussing predictions and assumptions about Gaussian distributions.  
- Improve the visual clarity of figures and tables, ensuring legends do not obscure data and that error bars are clearly defined.
