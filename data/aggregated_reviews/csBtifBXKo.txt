Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adaptive end-to-end metric learning scheme for zero-shot slot filling, addressing the challenges posed by novel domains. The authors propose context-aware soft label representations and explore slot-level contrastive learning to enhance generalization capacity. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, demonstrating competitive performance on benchmark datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is innovative and well-motivated, showcasing significant advancements over conventional approaches.
- The writing is clear and stylish, contributing to the paper's overall quality.
- Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of the approach, yielding competitive empirical results.

Weaknesses:
- The background and motivation for the study require more detailed explanation, particularly regarding existing deep learning methods and their shortcomings.
- Some figures, such as Figure 2, lack clarity and need further explanation regarding their impact on output production.
- The paper does not provide a comprehensive comparison with other soft label embedding methods, and the baseline comparisons are against relatively outdated methods.
- The justification for the weighting of terms in the loss function is insufficiently explained.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background section by detailing the motivation for their work and analyzing the shortcomings of existing methods more clearly. Additionally, we suggest clarifying Figure 2 and its implications for output production. Including a pseudo code of the proposed method would enhance understanding. Furthermore, providing results on additional datasets, such as ATIS and SGD, would strengthen the experimental evaluation. Lastly, we encourage the authors to offer a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art methods and to justify the choice of the 1:1:1 weighting in the loss function more explicitly.
