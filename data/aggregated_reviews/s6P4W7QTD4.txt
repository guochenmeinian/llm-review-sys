### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for the theoretical explainability of generative models using probes, addressing a critical gap in AI safety and security research. The authors propose the need for interpretability checks in both linear and MLP-based probes, emphasizing that high-performing probes often lack sufficient interpretability assessments. The paper discusses multi-level concept attribution but could benefit from a more cohesive narrative that unifies its central themes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Clearly defined problem statement and proposed framework.
- Solid theoretical foundation that is straightforward to follow, with a clear description of results.
- Useful mapping of LLMs and Diffusion models.

Weaknesses:
- Lack of concrete real-world or synthetic examples demonstrating theoretical results.
- Insufficient motivation for the model-agnostic framework as the best choice for studying generative models, which may oversimplify the diversity of generative models.
- Limited discussion on the implications of high dimensionality and when the size of *d* becomes problematic.
- The discussion of related works is not extensive enough, lacking emphasis on how the proposed framework differentiates itself from prior studies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "fine-grained concepts" and consider including inverse probing to identify the absence of concepts. The authors should expand on the statement regarding linear probes and their performance in detecting complex encodings. Additionally, we suggest evaluating the assumptions made in Theorem 1 regarding hidden representations and providing empirical evidence to support claims about sample complexity and overfitting. Clarifying Proposition 2's limitations concerning concept overlap and superposition would enhance the theoretical insights. The authors should also include a case study with popular models to demonstrate the framework's applicability. Finally, addressing minor typographical errors and expanding the discussion of related works would improve the manuscript's overall quality.
