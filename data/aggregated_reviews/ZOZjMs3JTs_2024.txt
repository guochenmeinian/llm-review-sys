### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the trade-off between user fairness and item fairness in recommendation systems. The authors propose a constrained optimization problem that prioritizes user fairness while imposing item fairness as constraints. Key findings include: (1) diverse user preferences facilitate item fairness; (2) mis-estimation of user preferences can worsen the fairness trade-off; and (3) strong item fairness constraints can significantly reduce user fairness. The authors illustrate their findings using arXiv data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper systematically analyzes the trade-off between user and item fairness, which is a significant contribution to the field.
- A clear and useful theoretical framework is developed, providing rigorous mathematical proofs for the main results.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of maximizing normalized user preference as the objective is counterintuitive and lacks sufficient justification. The authors should consider a dual-objective problem or maximizing platform recommendation quality.
- The assumption of symmetric utility between users and items is overly simplistic and may not hold in practice. 
- The empirical analysis on arXiv data is limited and lacks depth, raising questions about the generalizability of the results.
- The theoretical results are derived from restrictive examples, which may not extend to more general scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for their choice of optimization problem and consider alternative formulations, such as a dual-objective approach. Additionally, the authors should address the assumption of symmetric user and item utilities, potentially incorporating different utility models. Enhancing the empirical analysis with more comprehensive data and scenarios would strengthen the paper's contributions. Finally, we suggest including a discussion on platform-level utility to provide a more holistic view of the recommendation process.
