Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Factorized Causal Representation (FCR), a causal VAE-based model designed to decompose and cluster covariates, treatments, and their interactions in the latent space. The authors prove the identifiability of these disentangled variables based on previous work in non-linear ICA and validate the model's performance against existing methods for perturb-seq prediction. The effectiveness of FCR is demonstrated across four single-cell datasets, achieving competitive results in cellular response prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper has a solid mathematical foundation, with validated assumptions post-training.
- It introduces novel regularizers that enforce conditional independence and effectively models non-linear interactions between covariates and treatments.
- The model shows good performance in clustering and conditional cellular response prediction.

Weaknesses:
- The readability is hindered by word redundancy, complicating the communication of ideas.
- The implementation is complex, involving multiple loss functions and min-max training, with insufficient discussion on hyperparameter selection and its impact on performance.
- The choice of the $R^2$ metric for evaluation is questionable, as it may not accurately reflect predictive accuracy.
- The model's generalizability is limited, as it has not been tested on unseen treatments or diverse datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's readability by reducing redundancy and clarifying complex sections. A more detailed discussion on the ease of training, including hyperparameter selection and its dependence on datasets, would enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting an ablation study to assess the importance of various loss terms and reconsidering the evaluation metric, possibly incorporating rank correlation instead of solely relying on $R^2$. Finally, addressing the limitations regarding generalizability and interpretability directly in the paper would strengthen the overall contribution.
