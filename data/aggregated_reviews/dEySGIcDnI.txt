Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to using separable neural networks, termed Separable PINN (SPINN), for representing solutions of partial differential equations (PDEs). The authors propose a specialized neural network architecture that utilizes forward-mode auto-differentiation, resulting in significantly faster training times compared to conventional physics-informed neural network (PINN) methods. The paper includes a mathematical demonstration of the proposed architecture's approximation capabilities and empirical results on various PDEs, showing that SPINN achieves comparable accuracy while reducing computational and memory costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method demonstrates a promising speed-up in training, addressing a significant limitation of traditional PINN methods.
2. The use of fixed collocation points enhances computational efficiency by reusing calculations, further accelerating training times.
3. The theoretical foundation and extensive experiments validate the scalability and effectiveness of SPINN.

Weaknesses:
1. The choice of manufactured solutions for evaluating SPINN raises concerns about fairness in comparison with original PINN methods.
2. The variable separation form may limit SPINN's flexibility in fitting boundary conditions for complex geometries.
3. The reliance on the $L_2$ evaluation metric may not adequately capture performance for non-linear PDEs; additional metrics such as the Sobolev norm or PINN loss would provide a more comprehensive assessment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by conducting experiments on more complex solutions that do not align with the variable separation form, such as using a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) as the manufactured solution. Additionally, exploring SPINN's performance on PDEs with sophisticated boundary conditions, like a sphere boundary, would be valuable. Including the Sobolev norm or PINN loss as additional evaluation metrics would enhance the assessment of SPINN's performance. Furthermore, we suggest investigating the potential for optimizing low-dimensional functions directly within a low-dimensional manifold to reduce computational costs associated with high-dimensional PDEs.
