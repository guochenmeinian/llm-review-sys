Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SUPA, a Python-based simulator designed to generate data for particle propagation and shower events in particle physics. The authors propose that SUPA can produce particle showers several orders of magnitude faster than the widely-used Geant4 simulator, while maintaining qualitatively similar trends in model performance. The simulator is tunable through a manageable number of parameters and aims to facilitate the generation of benchmark datasets for machine learning models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The paper is clearly written and well-organized, making it accessible to readers.
- SUPA offers a significant speed advantage over Geant4, enabling the rapid generation of large datasets.
- The lightweight framework allows for convenient testing of generative models across different detector configurations.

**Weaknesses:**
- The paper lacks novelty, presenting SUPA as an incremental improvement over Geant4 rather than a groundbreaking advancement.
- The dataset generated by SUPA is relatively small, raising questions about its adequacy for benchmarking against more complex simulations.
- The absence of appendices limits the ability to assess certain aspects of the manuscript in detail, particularly the statistical comparison between GEANT4 and SUPA outputs.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how the outputs of GEANT4 and SUPA compare, particularly regarding the correlation of varying configuration parameters. Additionally, it would be beneficial to expand the explanation of the results in Table 3, clarifying the significance of these numbers in terms of accuracy. The authors should also address the limitations of the dataset generated by SUPA compared to Geant4, including a discussion on the potential loss of physics due to simplifications in the model. Furthermore, enhancing the documentation of the SUPA code and providing more extensive benchmark model evaluations would strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, we suggest including a section discussing the negative social impacts of the work, as well as a clearer articulation of how SUPA can be utilized as a benchmark dataset generator.
