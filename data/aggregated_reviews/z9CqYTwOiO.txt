### Key Points
This paper presents a methodology for the UMLS vocabulary insertion (UVI) task, focusing on the integration of new terminological vocabularies. The authors propose a model that assesses new terms in relation to the entire UMLS, determining whether they are synonymous with existing terms or represent novel concepts. They contribute five datasets of UMLS updates and demonstrate the effectiveness of their model through comparisons with baselines and qualitative error analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The authors effectively motivate their work by addressing a clear research gap and providing a well-defined problem formulation.  
- The experimental setup is thorough, with extensive comparisons across datasets and qualitative analyses conducted by experts.  
- The paper is well-written and presents the subject matter clearly, combining academic and real-world evaluation metrics.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed approach lacks statistical significance for its accuracy and F1 scores.  
- The evaluation metrics, particularly "ranking accuracy" and "New Concept Precision," are not sufficiently defined, leading to potential ambiguities.  
- Important findings regarding performance variability across subdomains are relegated to the appendix, limiting their visibility and impact.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the statistical analysis to provide significance for the reported accuracy and F1 scores. Additionally, please clarify the evaluation metrics in section 4.2, particularly "ranking accuracy," and consider providing formulas to enhance understanding. It would also be beneficial to include the findings from the appendix in the main text to emphasize the performance variations across semantic categories. Lastly, we suggest adding citations to strengthen claims, such as the number of related UMLS terms mentioned and the rationale for dataset selection.
