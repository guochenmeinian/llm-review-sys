### Key Points
This paper presents a well-structured analysis of the Thompson Sampling algorithm for logistic bandits, focusing on a refined information-theoretical approach that improves regret bounds compared to previous works. The authors derive a new bound on the information ratio and a regret bound that scales better and is valid for a continuous action space. However, the paper currently lacks convincing numerical results to support its theoretical claims.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The analysis is well-structured and builds upon previous works, enhancing the theoretical understanding of Thompson Sampling for logistic bandits.  
- The new regret bounds provide significant improvements over earlier results.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks numerical demonstrations, which limits its practical applicability and broader readership.  
- There are several clarity issues, including notation inconsistencies and mathematical inaccuracies that need addressing.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including numerical simulation examples to validate their claims and providing simulation scripts with clear step-by-step comments. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the notation, particularly the switch from $\theta$ to $\Theta$, and correcting the mathematical inaccuracies noted in the reviews. Addressing typos and citation updates is also essential for enhancing the paper's quality.
