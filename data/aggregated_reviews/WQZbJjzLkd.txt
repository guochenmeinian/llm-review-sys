### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of security and privacy issues arising from the use of Web APIs that allow websites to connect directly to external devices. The authors demonstrate that these APIs can be exploited by attackers to gain control over devices and bypass browser protections. The study includes various attack scenarios and proposes mitigation strategies, highlighting the need for improved security measures as these APIs evolve.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper employs multi-device testing and attack chain construction to validate the feasibility of attacks on Web APIs.
- It proposes several mitigation measures that have garnered positive feedback from device vendors.
- The writing is generally clear, and the paper effectively raises awareness about the dangers associated with browser APIs.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks necessary illustrations or diagrams, relying heavily on lengthy text.
- The organization of chapters could be improved for better clarity and flow.
- There is a significant reliance on known device-specific attacks, which diminishes the novelty and relevance of the work to web security.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the writing and presentation for better clarity and flow. The introduction should explicitly address the significance of the research and the shift in threat models due to browser APIs. We suggest adding references to support claims throughout the paper, particularly in the background section. The authors should provide a systematic methodology for evaluating the security issues discussed and clarify the novelty of their work compared to existing literature. Additionally, we advise restructuring the chapters to enhance coherence and including illustrations or tables to summarize experimental data and mitigation strategies. Lastly, the authors should ensure that all abbreviations are defined upon first use and consider adding a related studies section to contextualize their contributions within existing research.
