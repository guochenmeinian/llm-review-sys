Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper investigates the role of synthetic image soft labels in dataset distillation (DD) methods, demonstrating that the effectiveness of DD approaches is significantly influenced by the structured information contained in soft labels. The authors conduct extensive ablation studies to analyze the impact of these labels under various conditions and establish empirical scaling laws that characterize the relationship between soft labels and images-per-class in distilled datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the novel and significant role of soft labels in DD, an aspect previously overlooked in the literature.
2. Comprehensive experiments are conducted, yielding meaningful insights into the characteristics of effective soft labels and their importance in learning.
3. The analysis provides valuable contributions to the DD community, highlighting new directions for data-efficient learning.

Weaknesses:
1. The motivation for preferring label-level methods over image-level methods is not clearly articulated.
2. The choice of expert model epoch for generating soft labels raises questions about potential biases in the results and fairness in comparisons with other methods.
3. The paper lacks a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of soft labels and could benefit from clearer expression of structured information.
4. Some figures and tables require reorganization for improved clarity, and there are minor writing errors that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using label-level methods over image-level methods. Additionally, please clarify the implications of the chosen expert model epoch on the results and ensure that comparisons with other methods are fair. We suggest incorporating a theoretical analysis to explain the effectiveness of soft labels and reorganizing figures and tables for enhanced clarity. Lastly, addressing minor writing errors will improve the overall presentation of the paper.
