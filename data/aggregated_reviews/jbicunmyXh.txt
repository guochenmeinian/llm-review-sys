### Key Points
This paper presents a novel knowledge graph completion method, LATENTLOGIC, which utilizes a pre-trained VAE to map relational paths into latent space and employs a sampler based on ODE for efficient logic rule generation. The authors demonstrate that their approach outperforms several embedding-based and rule-mining methods through experiments on two datasets. The paper aims to address challenges in learning interpretable and generalizable logic rules from knowledge graphs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method is novel, integrating energy-based models and ODEs for enhanced efficiency.
2. The training time is significantly reduced compared to other rule-based methods.
3. Qualitative analyses support the effectiveness of the rule-mining process.
4. The presentation is clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
1. The performance is not state-of-the-art, with limited comparisons in Table 1.
2. Only two datasets are utilized; additional datasets like Kinship or YAGO3 could strengthen the findings.
3. Implementation details are lacking, which may hinder reproducibility.
4. The complexity of the latent space mapping may obscure model behavior.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison by including additional recent methods to better situate their contributions. Expanding the dataset used for evaluation would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the model's performance. Additionally, clarifying the implementation details, including hyperparameter tuning and the training time of embedding-based methods, would enhance reproducibility. Providing visualizations or analyses to elucidate the model's behavior in the latent space could also be beneficial.
