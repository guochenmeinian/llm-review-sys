Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the improved Quotient Variational Auto-Encoder (IQVAE), which aims to learn representations that respect both symmetry and distance structure in data manifolds. The authors propose a modified VAE framework that incorporates a Riemannian isometry loss to optimize the decoder, allowing for enhanced flexibility in tasks like classification and clustering. The effectiveness of IQVAE is demonstrated through experiments on various datasets, although the originality of the approach is questioned due to its reliance on established components from previous models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The intuition behind the proposed method is well justified, emphasizing the preservation of structure between latent and image spaces.
- The mathematical concepts of Riemannian geometry are clearly explained.
- Experiments across multiple datasets show some promising initial improvements against various baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the QVAE loss function is limited, being a straightforward combination of existing approaches.
- Evidence supporting the claim that IQVAE learns isometric embeddings is weak, primarily relying on downstream task performance rather than direct metrics.
- Comparisons with outdated baseline models raise concerns about the robustness of the results, and the need for more recent benchmarks is noted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical details, particularly regarding the downstream classification tasks and the parameters used for reproducibility. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough analysis of experimental results, especially in Tables 4 and 5. To enhance the originality of the work, we suggest incorporating comparisons with recent baselines on Riemannian VAEs and conducting an ablation study to clarify the roles of symmetry, isometry, and probabilistic components in their approach. Furthermore, addressing the limitations related to the choice of symmetry groups and the implications of 3D rotations would strengthen the paper. Lastly, we encourage the authors to standardize the reference format and clarify the notation used in equations.
