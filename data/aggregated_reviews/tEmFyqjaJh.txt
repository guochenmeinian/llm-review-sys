Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative model called PPi (Pretraining-based model for Patient-independent seizure detection) for patient-independent seizure detection utilizing SEEG data. The authors propose two self-supervised tasks during the pretraining phase to extract comprehensive information from SEEG data while preserving unique brain signal characteristics. They also introduce channel background subtraction and brain region enhancement techniques to address the domain shift problem between patients. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and a clinical dataset demonstrate that the PPi model outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Additionally, the authors acknowledge the omission of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods in their initial comparison and plan to include a discussion of prior SSL approaches in the "Related Work" section. They conduct experiments on a clinical dataset to evaluate the performance of existing methods, noting that many prior works do not align distribution gaps between domains, which is critical for patient-independent settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The visualizations in Figures 1, 3, and 4 are clear and self-explanatory, aiding reader comprehension of the framework architecture and workflow.
2. The extensive experimentation across three datasets provides a robust evaluation of the model's performance, enhancing the manuscript's credibility.
3. The PPi model shows promising performance, particularly in clinical scenarios, highlighting its practical significance.
4. The ablation study effectively illustrates the contributions of different components to the overall performance.
5. The authors effectively address the reviewers' comments and enhance the literature review with recent studies relevant to SEEG-based seizure detection.
6. The inclusion of a clinical dataset for experiments strengthens the evaluation of their method in practical applications.

Weaknesses:
1. The assertion regarding the SSL task's capability to extract time-domain features lacks clarity and supporting references. The rationale for applying SSL tasks solely to the time domain is also unexplained.
2. The clinical dataset is highly imbalanced, and the paper does not adequately assess how the model addresses class imbalance.
3. The method does not sufficiently account for individual differences beyond seizure locations, and qualitative analysis of brain area characteristics is lacking.
4. Some references in the revised literature review are outdated and not sufficiently relevant to the current state of research.
5. The performance of existing methods on the clinical dataset is relatively low, indicating potential limitations in their applicability.
6. Figure 5 is not intuitive and could benefit from clearer representation and additional comparisons of different brain regions.
7. The ablation study should evaluate the reconstruction loss term and the significance of self-attention layers more explicitly.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the SSL task's capabilities by including supporting references and discussing the choice of focusing on the time domain. A detailed analysis of how the model handles class imbalance in the clinical dataset should be included. Additionally, the authors should provide a qualitative analysis of how well the model preserves unique brain area characteristics. We suggest enhancing Figure 5 for better clarity and including comparisons of different brain regions. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the literature review by incorporating more recent and relevant studies to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the current landscape in SEEG-based seizure detection. Finally, we suggest that the authors strive to reproduce the results of the omitted works [1] and [2] and include these findings in the final version of the paper to provide a more complete comparison.
