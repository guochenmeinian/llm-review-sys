Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents two novel machine learning algorithms aimed at predicting ground state properties of quantum systems with constant sample complexity, independent of system size. The first algorithm modifies an existing model, while the second introduces a deep neural network approach. Both algorithms demonstrate improved scaling through numerical experiments. The authors make significant theoretical contributions by achieving constant sample complexity and exploring new possibilities in predicting ground state properties.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The introduction of a deep learning model with rigorous sample complexity bounds is a notable contribution, addressing a critical challenge in quantum many-body physics.  
2. The paper provides high-quality theoretical findings and comprehensive numerical results, validating the proposed algorithms' effectiveness.  
3. The work achieves optimal sample complexity and is well-organized, clearly presenting the theoretical guarantees and experimental evaluations.

Weaknesses:  
1. The training objective for the neural network is non-convex, complicating the search for a global optimum, and the paper does not address convergence guarantees.  
2. The improvement over previous works is limited, relying on assumptions about prior knowledge of the observable and the training distribution.  
3. The implementation details and computational resources for the deep learning model are insufficiently discussed, and the assumptions on the training distribution are not clearly stated, raising concerns about their applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the generalization of the deep learning model's performance to Hamiltonians beyond the specific cases examined. Additionally, the authors should provide more insights into the practical implementation of their algorithms, particularly regarding initialization and regularization procedures used during training. Clarifying the assumptions on the training distribution and their necessity, as well as addressing the non-convexity of the neural network training objective, would enhance the paper's robustness. Lastly, a clearer connection between the numerical experiments and the theoretical results would strengthen the overall presentation.
