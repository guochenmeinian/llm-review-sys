Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a few-shot domain-driven image generation method called DomainGallery, which finetunes pretrained Stable Diffusion in an attribute-centric manner. The method incorporates prior attribute erasure, attribute disentanglement, attribute regularization, and attribute enhancement to address the challenges of generating images that maintain specific styles and attributes across different subject matters.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The research topic is of general interest in generative models, bridging subject-driven and domain-driven generation using few-shot training data.
- DomainGallery demonstrates effectiveness across various generation scenarios with visually appealing results, both quantitatively (FID, KID, i-LPIPS) and qualitatively.
- The paper is well-structured, well-motivated, and addresses limitations in existing approaches, effectively demonstrating the method's performance through diverse experiments and ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
- The base models are limited, with a need for inclusion of more advanced T2I models to showcase the generalizability of DomainGallery.
- There is a lack of discussion or visualization of possible failure cases, which would clarify the boundaries of the proposed method.
- The novelty of the similarity consistency loss and the concept of multi-attribute transfer is questioned, as they resemble existing methods without sufficient differentiation.
- Technical challenges are not summarized concisely, leading to unclear contributions, and there is insufficient error analysis to demonstrate the specific improvements attributed to the proposed method.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the coverage of base models by including 1-2 more advanced T2I models to validate the general applicability of DomainGallery. Additionally, we suggest including discussions and visualizations of failure cases to better illustrate the method's limitations. To enhance clarity, we encourage the authors to summarize the technical challenges more concisely and provide a clearer differentiation of their contributions compared to existing methods. Finally, we recommend conducting a more thorough error analysis to demonstrate the specific causes of improvements in results across different datasets.
