Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
The paper presents BLASTNet 2.0, a dataset comprising 744 full-domain samples from 34 direct numerical simulations for 3D compressible turbulent reacting and non-reacting flows. The authors demonstrate that the super-resolution (SR) models in BLASTNet 2.0 perform well according to structural similarity image measure (SSIM) metrics, effectively capturing complex turbulent structures at 8Ã— SR. The dataset is positioned as a valuable resource for evaluating models in scientific and engineering turbulent flows. The authors have benchmarked Conv-FNO models and included a discussion on scientific ML approaches, enhancing the manuscript's depth. New metrics evaluating global physical properties and alternatives to SSIM have been added, addressing previous concerns about the validity of SSIM. The authors justify their use of downsampled Favre-filtered DNS data for super-resolution (SR), emphasizing its theoretical backing and practical relevance in turbulent flow simulations. They acknowledge that errors in chaotic numerical systems stem from single-step errors that accumulate over time, which can be mitigated by their SR models. Figure 17 illustrates the SR model's capability to recover the spectral distribution of turbulent kinetic energy from coarse and filtered inputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The dataset utilizes a three-dimensional model, overcoming limitations of previous two-dimensional simulations in capturing turbulence.
- The paper benchmarks three deep learning models for SR, showcasing the scalability of model performance with size and cost.
- The inclusion of a well-established website and tutorial enhances accessibility for researchers.
- The dataset's scope and utility are well-recognized, and the manuscript is noted for its clarity and documentation.
- The SR model effectively recovers turbulent spectral distributions, which is crucial for practical engineering applications.
- The paper has improved in quality with the incorporation of reviewer suggestions, including the addition of the FNO-variant and experimental justification for the downsampling method.

**Weaknesses:**
- The benchmarking approach relies on ResNet-based models, which may not be optimal for scientific applications; recent advancements like Neural Operators are not considered.
- The use of SSIM as the sole evaluation metric may not adequately reflect the physical fidelity required in scientific machine learning applications.
- Downsampling methods employed may not accurately represent real-world scenarios, as they rely on higher-resolution data rather than simulating low-resolution inputs directly.
- The justification for using filtered DNS data instead of direct coarse-grained simulations raises questions about the practical applicability of the model.
- The definitions and distinctions between "physics-informed" and "physics-based" methods could be clearer, as the terminology varies in the literature.
- There is a lack of visual comparisons between SR outputs and ground truth for low-resolution simulation inputs, which could strengthen the evaluation of the model's performance.
- The authors' rationale for using L2 loss over L1 loss may not be fully convincing, as the concept of "outliers" in the context of turbulence needs further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
The authors are advised to clarify the exact number and nature of the PDEs in BLASTNet 2.0 to enhance understanding. They should also provide further clarification on how the range of accuracy schemes in the DNS affects turbulence resolution. Including the contour of absolute errors in Figure 3 would offer a more comprehensive visual representation. Additionally, the authors should specify the numerical solvers used in the study to improve reproducibility. 

To strengthen the benchmarking, the authors should consider incorporating recent scientific ML approaches, such as Neural Operators, and adopt domain-specific evaluation metrics that account for physical properties. They should also explore using low-resolution simulations as inputs for SR models to better align with practical applications. The authors should improve the clarity regarding the use of filtered DNS data by providing a more detailed rationale for not employing direct coarse-grained simulations, addressing potential practical implications. Furthermore, the authors are encouraged to refine their definitions of "physics-informed" and "physics-based" methods to better align with existing literature and clarify their approach. 

Lastly, the authors should provide visual comparisons of the SR output against the ground truth for low-resolution simulation inputs to enhance the evaluation process. They are also encouraged to clarify their reasoning for choosing L2 loss over L1 loss, particularly in relation to capturing extreme values in turbulence, which are critical for accurate super-resolution modeling.
