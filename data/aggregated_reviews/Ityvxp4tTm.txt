### Key Points
This paper presents TATKC, a novel framework designed to predict TKC rankings for graphs by effectively integrating neighbor node features and enhancing computational efficiency through a degree-based neighbor sampling method. The framework consists of two main components: node representation learning, which employs continuous time encoding and a time-injected self-attention mechanism, and TKC ranking prediction, which utilizes learned node representations for ranking based on TKC values via an MLP. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TATKC.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research problem of temporal Katz centrality computation is significant.
2. The paper introduces TATKC as the first learnable method for approximating temporal Katz centrality, showcasing novelty and practical utility.
3. The proposed method is scalable and achieves good generalization.

Weaknesses:
1. Some design choices lack sufficient rationale, such as the selection of a two-layer MLP in the time-injected self-attention mechanism.
2. The paper is poorly written and at times confusing, necessitating clearer explanations of its contributions and the limitations of existing methods.
3. There is no error analysis for the approximation of temporal Katz centrality, raising concerns about the technical soundness of TATKC.
4. The experimental results do not clarify the sampling strategy or provide comparisons with traditional methods, limiting the understanding of TATKC's performance.
5. The paper does not address the sensitivity of TATKC to hyperparameters or the specifics of the training, validation, and test set ratios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance understanding of the contributions and rationale behind design choices. Additionally, we suggest providing a thorough error analysis of the approximation to bolster the technical soundness of TATKC. It would be beneficial to include a comparison with traditional methods and clarify the sampling strategy used in experiments. Furthermore, addressing the sensitivity of TATKC to hyperparameters and detailing the dataset splits would strengthen the paper's reproducibility. Lastly, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of temporal distances in walks and consider incorporating causal or time-respecting paths in their model.
