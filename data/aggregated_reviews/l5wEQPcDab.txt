Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the transferability of reward functions learned from expert demonstrations in regularized MDPs. The authors formalize the problem and introduce assumptions that connect the distance between equivalence classes of reward functions to the expert's suboptimality. They utilize principal angles to relate the distance between transition models to the information provided by demonstrations. An algorithm with theoretical guarantees is proposed and validated empirically. The paper also establishes bounds on reward transferability for inverse reinforcement learning in discrete MDPs with known transition matrices, extending prior work by allowing for errors in reward recovery.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is clearly written and aims to connect theoretical results to practical applications in IRL.
- The use of principal angles for bounding reward transferability is a novel and useful concept.
- The theoretical results could enhance understanding of reward transferability in more realistic settings.
- The authors provide a logical framework for rewards identification and transferability, which is meaningful in the context of expert demonstrations.

Weaknesses:
- The framework of regularized MDPs simplifies the analysis compared to common MDPs, which may not reflect realistic expert behavior.
- Several strong assumptions are made, such as those regarding transition models and the nature of expert demonstrations.
- The paper primarily focuses on theoretical contributions, with limited experimental validation in real-world contexts.
- The bounds presented may be loose, particularly in cases involving Shannon- and Tsallis-entropy regularization.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more intuition about key concepts, such as the subspaces of potential shaping transformations and the implications of principal angles. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed discussion of the theoretical innovations and how they differ from existing work when the expert policy can be achieved. To enhance the practical relevance, we encourage the authors to validate their theoretical findings with experiments in real-world applications. Finally, we advise aligning the references for consistency and placing the checklist at the end of the appendix.
