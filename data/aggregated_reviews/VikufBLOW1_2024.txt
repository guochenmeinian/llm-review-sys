Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a data-centric approach to visual entity recognition (VER) by leveraging a multimodal large language model (LLM) to refine the Entity-WebLI dataset. The authors propose a technique to correct errors in entity labeling, generate rationales, and create query-oriented question-answer pairs, resulting in the new dataset REW. Experiments on OVEN and OOD datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of REW, supported by extensive ablation studies that highlight key design decisions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors propose an innovative LLM-driven method to enhance the quality of a visual entity recognition training dataset, addressing issues in the existing dataset creation pipeline.
- Thorough experiments and ablation studies validate the design choices, showing significant performance improvements in entity recognition tasks.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on a proprietary model (Gemini Pro) raises concerns about the reproducibility of the dataset creation process, as it may not remain stable over time.
- The paper lacks references to prior works that introduced techniques like constrained decoding, which are crucial for grounding entity rationale generation.
- The authors do not release the curated dataset REW, which limits the broader impact of their findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the reproducibility of their work by releasing the curated dataset REW alongside the paper. Additionally, addressing the limitations related to the proprietary model by discussing potential alternatives or providing insights into computational complexity would enhance the transparency of the methodology. Furthermore, including references to foundational works on constrained decoding would strengthen the theoretical framework of the paper.
