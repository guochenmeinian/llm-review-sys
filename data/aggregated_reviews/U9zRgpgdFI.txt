### Key Points
This paper presents a hierarchical spatial transformer model designed for a large number of irregular point samples in continuous space. The authors propose a quad-tree hierarchy to efficiently model implicit spatial dependencies across irregular samples at multiple scales. The model incorporates an uncertainty quantification module to capture varying prediction confidence based on input sample density. Evaluations on various datasets demonstrate that the method outperforms multiple baselines in terms of accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a significant problem in spatial representation learning for irregular samples, with applications in environmental sustainability and surrogate modeling for numerical simulations.  
- The technical novelty of the hierarchical attention architecture is strong, utilizing a quad-tree for multi-scale latent representation and efficient attention operations.  
- The method shows promising results across real-world and synthetic datasets, supported by solid evaluations, including sensitivity analysis and computational experiments.  

Weaknesses:  
- The experimental evaluation, while extensive, lacks clarity on how thresholds for uncertain/certain predictions are determined in the uncertainty quantification metric.  
- The quadtree technique may only be effective in sparse cases, raising questions about its general applicability to all types of large point sample distributions.  
- There are insufficient details regarding model parameters and experimental settings, which complicates the assessment of the experiments' quality and replicability.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how thresholds for uncertain/certain predictions are determined in the uncertainty quantification metric. Additionally, please clarify how the quadtree technique can address uniformly distributed cases and justify the necessity of feeding all point samples in a single pass. It would also be beneficial to compare the proposed method with the all-pair transformer in terms of pros and cons, and to provide the number of parameters for the all-pair transformer and other baselines in Table 2. Lastly, we suggest including guidance on hyper-parameter selection for designing the quadtree if needed.
