Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel and highly general Equivariant Neural Network (ENN) architecture that respects the symmetries of finite-dimensional representations of any reductive Lie Group G. The authors propose a generalization of the ACE and MACE architectures for atomistic point clouds to any data equivariant to a reductive Lie group action. They demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach through applications to top quark decay tagging and shape recognition, yielding convincing results. Additionally, a software library (Lie-NN) has been developed for implementing the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, providing a comprehensive overview of the problem and solution.
- The proposed ENN architecture addresses a significant challenge in the field of equivariant neural networks, showcasing its generality and performance.
- The experimental results validate the claimed advantages of the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- A more comprehensive discussion comparing methods based on Lie Groups, such as LieConv, is needed.
- The novelty of the method is not clearly delineated from ACE and MACE; a brief review of these methods would enhance understanding.
- The paper lacks intuitive explanations and justifications for key concepts, and some variable definitions are missing.
- Computational aspects, including the time and errors associated with calculating Clebsch-Gordan coefficients, are inadequately discussed.
- The formulation for the product group is not sufficiently addressed, and the paper should clarify the implications of numerical errors on equivariance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including a more comprehensive comparison with existing methods like LieConv and MACE, utilizing datasets such as QM9 to reinforce their claims. Additionally, the authors should provide clearer delineation of the novel aspects of their method compared to ACE and MACE, and include intuitive explanations and illustrative figures to enhance understanding. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the computational aspects, specifically addressing calculation times and the impact of numerical errors on equivariance. Finally, the authors should clarify the formulation for the product group and ensure that all relevant variable definitions are included.
