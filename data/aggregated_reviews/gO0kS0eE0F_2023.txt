Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents OpenProteinSet, a large-scale dataset of multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) aimed at enhancing protein structure prediction and related bioinformatics tasks. The authors demonstrate that retraining OpenFold with these MSAs allows it to nearly match AlphaFold 2's performance in benchmark experiments. While the utility of MSAs is well-established across various applications, including protein folding and design, the current evaluation is primarily limited to monomeric structure prediction. The manuscript has been revised to emphasize broader applications of OpenProteinSet, including large-scale protein language modeling and multimodal deep learning, although the authors argue that the computational expense of additional benchmarks is prohibitive.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
1. The dataset is extensive and well-constructed, providing a valuable resource for the protein folding and bioinformatics communities.
2. The integration of MSAs with OpenFold is seamless, enhancing usability for future research.
3. The manuscript has improved significantly, particularly in the related works section and the MSA primer for non-bioinformatic readers.
4. The expanded discussion on diverse applications for OpenProteinSet enhances its relevance to the research community.
5. The data figures have been refactored for better clarity and interpretation.

**Weaknesses:**
1. The manuscript primarily serves as a manual for data collection and training, lacking novel insights beyond confirming the importance of MSAs for structure prediction.
2. There is insufficient exploration of potential applications outside monomeric structure prediction, such as protein design or multimeric structure prediction.
3. The clarity of certain bioinformatics terms may hinder understanding for a broader machine learning audience.
4. There remains a concern regarding the accessibility of the dataset for the broader ML community, as it is not immediately clear how those unfamiliar with bioinformatics can utilize it effectively.
5. Some technical aspects, such as the representation of MSAs and tools for integration into deep learning frameworks, need further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
1. We recommend that the authors introduce benchmarks outside of monomeric structure prediction to demonstrate the utility of their MSAs in other contexts, such as protein design or multimeric structure prediction.
2. The authors should clarify the primary insights their work offers, addressing the question of what new scientific tasks their MSA collection enables.
3. We suggest expanding the discussion of data analysis results to highlight interesting takeaways, rather than merely presenting figures without context.
4. The authors should consider providing clearer definitions for bioinformatics terminology and include illustrative figures to aid understanding for readers less familiar with the field.
5. We recommend that the authors improve the accessibility of OpenProteinSet by briefly discussing the technical means for ML practitioners to utilize the dataset, including methods for representing MSAs and tools for loading them into deep learning frameworks.
6. Additionally, we suggest fine-tuning the MSA visualization in Figure 1 by addressing the alignment issues and including an axis for sequence positions, as well as highlighting conserved positions with colors.
