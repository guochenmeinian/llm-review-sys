### Key Points
This paper presents CAFA (Coding as Auto-Formulation), a streamlined approach for solving Linear Programming (LP) problems using Large Language Models (LLMs). CAFA enables LLMs to formalize problem text into executable code through a single prompt, followed by code post-processing and execution. The study demonstrates that CAFA achieves competitive or superior performance compared to complex multi-agent methods across various LLMs, including smaller open-source models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The research questions are well-framed, particularly the second question regarding leveraging less-capable LLMs for LP problems, which is relevant given the rise of open-source models.
2. Problem formulation and mitigation are effectively illustrated through diagrams and equations, showcasing the potential of a one-step approach to enhance LLM performance in Operations Research.
3. The theoretical analysis provides valuable insights into the limitations of multi-step pipelines, supporting the efficacy of CAFA's simpler prompting strategy.

Weaknesses:
1. The reported accuracies are based solely on the NL4Opt dataset; testing on multiple diverse datasets is necessary to demonstrate generalizability.
2. The paper's sentence construction and grammatical correctness require improvement to enhance clarity and reader engagement.
3. While CAFA shows promise, its performance on GPT-4 does not surpass the state-of-the-art OptiMUS method, and the theoretical analysis relies on simplifying assumptions that may not reflect real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by testing CAFA on multiple diverse datasets. Additionally, enhancing sentence construction and grammatical correctness will help convey precise meanings and engage readers more effectively. A more detailed comparison with state-of-the-art methods like OptiMUS, including a nuanced discussion of trade-offs, would strengthen the paper. Finally, we suggest exploring alternative intermediate representations beyond code to further enrich the analysis.
