Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel poisoning attack method named PoisonFRS for federated recommender systems, which promotes an attacker-chosen item using only item embeddings obtained from the server, without requiring knowledge of user-item ratings or user attributes. The authors conduct extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets, demonstrating that PoisonFRS effectively promotes targeted items and outperforms existing benchmarks that rely on additional user information. The methodology is robust, and the authors validate their approach through various settings and hyperparameter evaluations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The attack model's reliance solely on user-side updates is realistic and innovative.
- The paper includes a comprehensive evaluation against a wide selection of baselines across representative datasets, supporting the claims effectively.
- Extensive experiments show that PoisonFRS can promote targeted items to a significant portion of genuine users with minimal fake users.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation of chosen baselines is problematic, as many perform poorly, providing little comparative insight.
- The paper lacks discussion on adaptive defenses against PoisonFRS and does not adequately justify the assumptions underlying the method.
- Key concepts and terminologies, such as item features and the parameter $\lambda$, require clearer explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by selecting baselines that provide meaningful comparisons and exploring additional metrics beyond HR@5. Further, the authors should clarify the assumptions made regarding item features and the parameter $\lambda$, potentially including proofs or visualizations to support their claims. Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand on the discussion of adaptive defenses against PoisonFRS and provide more detailed explanations of new user interactions within the system. Finally, enhancing figure captions to allow for independent understanding and reworking sections that lack clarity would benefit the reader.
