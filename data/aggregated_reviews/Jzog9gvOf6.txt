### Key Points
This paper presents a Progressive Exploration-Conformal Learning (PECL) framework aimed at addressing the challenge of sparsely annotated object detection (SAOD) in aerial images. The authors propose a decision-making paradigm that includes a conformal pseudo-label explorer and a multi-clue selection evaluator to adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels, enhancing detection performance. The paper demonstrates that the PECL framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on the DOTA and HRSC2016 datasets, contributing significantly to semi-supervised aerial object detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically sound and well-structured, detailing the iterative process between pseudo-label exploration and detector updating.
- The integration of a conformal pseudo-label explorer with a multi-clue selection evaluator offers a novel perspective on handling sparse annotations.
- Comprehensive experiments, including ablation studies and case studies, provide valuable insights into the proposed method.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the PECL framework may hinder practical implementation, particularly due to the computational intensity of the multi-layer perceptron and iterative training process.
- The paper lacks detailed discussions on the computational efficiency of the PECL framework, including the impact of the iterative process on training time and potential optimizations.
- There is insufficient focus on how the PECL framework addresses the detection of small and occluded objects in aerial images.
- The writing quality, particularly in the first section, is lacking, making it difficult for readers to engage with the rationale behind the proposed method.
- The experimental performance contributions are not convincingly presented, and there are minor errors in the text that need correction.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the rationale for the proposed method in the introduction to engage readers more effectively. Additionally, please provide more details on the computational efficiency of the PECL framework, specifically regarding the iterative process's impact on training time and possible optimizations. It would also be beneficial to elaborate on how the PECL framework specifically addresses the detection of small and occluded objects, potentially incorporating additional strategies. Furthermore, we suggest including comparative experiments with SOTA methods from January to May 2024 and updating the related work section with recent publications from 2024. Lastly, please correct the writing errors identified and ensure that the formatting of tables is consistent.
