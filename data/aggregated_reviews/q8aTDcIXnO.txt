### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset for temporal question answering over Wikipedia's InfoBox, created through crowd-sourced questions about infoboxes. The dataset comprises 11,454 question-answer pairs from 1,208 tables across 90 domains. The authors conduct a thorough statistical analysis and baseline experiments with large language models, revealing that these models lag behind human performance. The paper also discusses future research directions to guide the community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The dataset is a valuable resource, created with a sound annotation process and extensive statistical analysis.
- The paper is well-structured, clear, and easy to read, providing detailed insights into model performance.
- The motivation for the dataset is well-articulated, addressing gaps in existing literature.

Weaknesses:
- The comparison with previous work is limited, lacking depth in statistical evaluation against other datasets.
- The experimental section relies on existing language models without proposing novel modeling techniques or improvements.
- The evaluation of dataset quality is not explicitly conducted, and some analyses lack statistical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with existing datasets by providing more detailed statistical evaluations and addressing how their dataset differs in terms of question diversity and quantity. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly evaluate the dataset's quality using the criteria outlined in section 3.3, and clarify the sources of errors in human accuracy. More detail on the baseline models, including input formatting and potential adaptations of state-of-the-art architectures for temporal question answering, would enhance the paper. We also encourage the authors to include visual representations of data, such as figures or bar graphs, to improve readability. Lastly, we advise relocating the future directions section to the end of the paper to maintain focus on the main contributions.
