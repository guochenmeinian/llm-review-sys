### Key Points
This paper presents SPO: Sequential Monte Carlo Policy Optimization, a reinforcement learning algorithm utilizing the Expectation Maximization (EM) framework for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). The authors propose a method that combines Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) sampling with EM to optimize policies, demonstrating significant performance improvements in sample efficiency and scalability across discrete and continuous environments. The approach involves maximizing expected rewards by rewriting it as a log marginal likelihood, optimizing the marginal likelihood via EM, and deriving an analytic expression for the variational distribution in the E-step.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel combination of established algorithms, addressing a significant problem in sequential decision-making.
- The experimental results show strong empirical gains, demonstrating that SPO outperforms baselines and is easily parallelizable.
- The motivation and theoretical derivation of the approach are sound, with a clear presentation of the background and methodology.

Weaknesses:
- The originality of the proposed method is limited, as it primarily combines existing techniques without substantial novelty.
- The paper lacks clarity in certain sections, making it difficult to follow, particularly regarding the theoretical insights and the problem it aims to tackle.
- There are missing ablation studies and experimental results that would better illustrate the effectiveness of SMC in estimating target distributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing a more detailed explanation of the method, particularly in relation to the sequence of distributions targeted by SMC and the derivation of the target policy distribution. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of SMC in estimating target distributions and addressing the theoretical concerns raised in the reviews. Finally, we encourage the authors to discuss the implications of using an imperfect model in their evaluations, as this would strengthen the practical relevance of their work.
