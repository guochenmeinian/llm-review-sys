### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called text fact transfer, which aims to replace factual content in a source text while maintaining its original style. The authors propose a multi-stage approach involving question generation, entity replacement, and answer generation to achieve this. They provide a comprehensive evaluation of their model, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to existing baselines and introducing relevant datasets for future research.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The introduction of the text fact transfer task has promising applications in repurposing texts and data augmentation.
- The proposed model is intuitive and shows competitive results against baseline models.
- The evaluation is exhaustive, covering both zero-shot and supervised settings with well-chosen baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the task could be strengthened, particularly in distinguishing it from style transfer.
- The sensitivity of the zero-shot GPT-3.5 model to input prompts is not adequately addressed.
- Evaluation metrics like BLUE and ROUGE may favor the model due to localized replacements, and the factuality metric raises questions regarding its reliability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clarify the distinctions between text fact transfer and style transfer. Additionally, addressing the sensitivity of the zero-shot GPT-3.5 model to prompt design would enhance the robustness of the comparisons. We suggest revisiting the evaluation metrics to ensure they accurately reflect the model's performance, particularly concerning factuality. Finally, incorporating more in-depth case studies would provide clearer insights into the practical applications and effectiveness of the proposed methods.
