### Key Points
This paper presents ChemGymRL, a Gymnasium-like interactive environment designed for training reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms on various chemistry tasks. The framework is modular, allowing for the integration of different RL algorithms, chemicals, and processes such as distillation and extraction. The authors propose that ChemGymRL could replace real-life chemistry experiments, making it a valuable tool for researchers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written, providing a clear description of the framework and solid simulation results that validate its effectiveness.
2. The flexibility of the framework allows for easy integration with various RL-related benchmarks, including those for molecular dynamics.
3. ChemGymRL has the potential to reduce costs and time associated with wet-lab experiments by serving as a realistic benchmark for chemical reactions.

Weaknesses:
1. The manuscript lacks sufficient code documentation and demos, which are crucial for assessing the usability of ChemGymRL. A wiki or Git page with step-by-step instructions for running the framework with customized components would be beneficial.
2. The specific experiments that would substantially benefit from ChemGymRL remain unclear, particularly for simple reactions where optimal policies are already known. There is a need for clarity on how ChemGymRL can facilitate RL applications in chemistry, such as in de novo drug design.
3. The paper does not adequately address the dynamics of the environment design, including assumptions and approximations for different chemical reactions, nor does it discuss safety measures for risky exploratory actions taken by the RL agent.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the documentation of ChemGymRL by including a comprehensive wiki or Git page with detailed instructions on running the framework with customized components. Additionally, the authors should clarify which specific chemistry problems ChemGymRL can address, particularly in relation to RL applications like drug design. It is essential to provide more details about the dynamics of the environment, including assumptions for chemical reactions and safety measures to prevent risky actions by the RL agent. Finally, the authors should explain how ChemGymRL will incorporate feedback from low-performance synthetic pathways for policy improvement.
