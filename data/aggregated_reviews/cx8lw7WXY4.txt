Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ITEM3D, a model designed for automatic 3D texture editing based on text prompts. ITEM3D addresses challenges in 3D modeling, such as complex geometries and ambiguous text descriptions, by leveraging a diffusion model to optimize disentangled texture and environment maps. The authors propose a relative editing direction to improve appearance consistency and gradually adjust this direction to mitigate deviations caused by texture projection. The authors clarify that ITEM3D distinguishes itself from NeRF-based methods like ARF and SINE, which primarily utilize image guidance, by focusing on explicit texture and mesh representation. Experimental results indicate that ITEM3D outperforms existing methods and allows for explicit control over lighting. The authors acknowledge the need for a comprehensive comparison with CLIP-NeRF and SINE, contingent on the availability of SINE's code, and highlight their comparative experiment with Instruct-NeRF2NeRF to support ITEM3D's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel optimization pipeline for 3D texture editing that effectively utilizes text prompts.
- The relative direction diffusion-based approach mitigates issues of noise and semantic ambiguity, enhancing texture optimization.
- The authors provide a clear differentiation between ITEM3D and existing methods, enhancing the understanding of their contribution.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear insights into the challenges of texture editing and a sound rationale for the proposed method.
- The acknowledgment of limitations and the intention to incorporate additional relevant works into the related work section demonstrates a commitment to thoroughness.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation relies primarily on synthetic datasets, raising questions about the method's applicability to real-world objects. Additional experiments with real 3D objects, such as those in the DTU dataset, are necessary.
- The introduction lacks clarity and context, failing to discuss related works that address similar challenges, which obscures the novelty of ITEM3D.
- The proposed relative direction loss bears resemblance to NeRF-Art, necessitating a clearer distinction between the two methods in the introduction.
- The efficiency comparison with Instruct-NeRF2NeRF lacks equity due to differing 3D representations.
- The quality of results in Figure 5 is perceived as subpar, raising concerns about the reconstruction method's effectiveness.
- The examples in Figure 4 are not sufficiently representative; including results with diverse materials would enhance performance evaluation.
- The quantitative evaluation is relatively weak, lacking comprehensive comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods, such as Instruct-NeRF2NeRF, ARF, and SINE.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and context in the introduction by discussing related works that address similar challenges. Conducting additional experiments with real 3D objects would strengthen the claims regarding realism and efficiency. The authors should also clarify the distinctions between their method and NeRF-Art, and enhance the representation of diverse materials in their examples. Furthermore, we suggest conducting a more equitable efficiency comparison between ITEM3D and Instruct-NeRF2NeRF under the same 3D representation conditions, providing a thorough analysis of the observed differences. To address the quality concerns regarding the coarse results in Figure 5, we recommend exploring advancements such as ENVIDR to enhance the reconstruction quality in future work. Lastly, a more thorough quantitative evaluation, including comparisons with other relevant methods, would provide a clearer understanding of ITEM3D's advantages and limitations.
