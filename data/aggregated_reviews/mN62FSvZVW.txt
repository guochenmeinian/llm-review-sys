### Key Points
This paper presents a human-AI collaboration framework for cross-cultural descriptive norm discovery and introduces a novel dataset aimed at understanding cross-cultural norms through explainable textual entailment. The authors explore social norm relations between English and Chinese, utilizing a bilingual corpus to investigate similarities and differences in social acceptability. The study demonstrates the challenges faced by existing language models in this domain and provides a comprehensive analysis of the dataset's quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
- It addresses a significant research problem, potentially being the first to tackle cross-cultural social norm identification.
- The dataset is high-quality, covering over 3,000 social situations and providing valuable insights into cultural differences.
- The analysis of why social norms differ across cultures is well-grounded in socio-cultural studies.

Weaknesses:
- The contributions are somewhat limited, primarily testing well-known language models without deeper insights into modeling strategies.
- There is a lack of exploration regarding the performance of other powerful language models, such as ChatGPT or GPT-4.
- The paper does not adequately address the complexity of contradictory social norms, which may not solely stem from cross-cultural differences but also from inherent value pluralism.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the exploration of modeling strategies by investigating the reasons behind poor performance in certain tasks. Additionally, consider testing a wider range of language models, including more powerful options like ChatGPT and GPT-4. It would also be beneficial to clarify how many contradictions in the dataset arise from cross-cultural differences versus those stemming from competing social norms. Finally, we suggest providing more details about the annotations and verifications in the main body of the paper rather than relegating them to the appendix.
