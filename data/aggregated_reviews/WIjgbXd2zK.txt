### Key Points
This paper presents a critique and an alternative formulation for the common interpretation and estimation of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The authors argue that standard formulations are often incorrect or contradictory and propose a new framework for properly decomposing uncertainty into reducible and irreducible elements, drawing on concepts from Fong's work on martingale posteriors and Rainforth's work on Bayesian experimental design. The paper is primarily theoretical, focusing on the formulation rather than empirical results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well written, with clear notation and strong arguments. It addresses an important open problem in the field, highlighting the discrepancies in estimating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. The proposed formulation offers a more accurate perspective and includes a proof regarding the estimation of irreducible (aleatoric) uncertainty. The topic is engaging and is likely to stimulate significant discussion at the workshop.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks empirical results; it presents only the theoretical formulation. Validation of the proposed framework, especially in varying training set sizes, would enhance the paper's contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including empirical validation of their proposed framework, particularly in scenarios with varying training set sizes, to strengthen their theoretical claims.
