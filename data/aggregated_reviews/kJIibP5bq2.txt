Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents new identifiability conditions for Independent Component Analysis (ICA) based on sparsity constraints, allowing for the identification of Gaussian sources without the typical non-Gaussian requirement. The authors propose a framework that relaxes previous assumptions by Zheng et al. (2022), demonstrating that identifiability can be achieved under less restrictive sparsity patterns. The work connects ICA to causal discovery and introduces new estimation methods based on second-order statistics. Additionally, the authors provide preliminary results on real-world audio datasets, specifically testing ten independent speech audios in multiple languages, each with a sample size of 160,000 and a duration of 10 seconds. Their method, SparseICA, achieved an average MCC of 0.8788 with a standard deviation of 0.12489, outperforming FastICA, which recorded an average MCC of 0.74211 with a standard deviation of 0.09991.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and presents clear theoretical contributions that extend previous work.
- The assumptions on sparsity are more reasonable, facilitating future research.
- The connection to causal discovery is well-articulated and adds depth to the analysis.
- The authors provide a clear summary of their preliminary results, demonstrating the effectiveness of SparseICA on real data.
- The reported metrics (MCC values) indicate a strong performance compared to FastICA.

Weaknesses:
- There is insufficient empirical evaluation, as the experiments are limited to simulated data, raising questions about generalizability to real-world datasets.
- Some reviewers noted the absence of real data experiment results prior to the authors' response, which initially affected their ratings.
- The identifiability framework relies on the assumption of a known covariance matrix, which complicates practical applications.
- The writing lacks clarity in some areas, particularly regarding the practical implications of the theoretical results.
- The manuscript contains numerous typographical errors and lacks a statistical test for result comparison.
- The inability to share the result plot publicly may limit the transparency of the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including additional experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed theory. We also suggest clarifying the practical motivations for the work and providing a more explicit discussion on the implications of the assumptions made. The authors should ensure that the manuscript is thoroughly proofread to eliminate typographical errors and enhance clarity. Furthermore, including runtime guarantees and discussing computational complexity would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to improve the visibility of their results by ensuring that the link to the result plot is shared publicly, pending AC approval, and to include real data results in the revised manuscript to further substantiate their findings and enhance the paper's impact.
