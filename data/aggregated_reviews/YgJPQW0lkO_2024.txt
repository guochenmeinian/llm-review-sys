### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for estimating granular, claim-level uncertainty in long-form outputs of large language models (LLMs) using semantic entailment graphs and graph centrality metrics. The authors propose a method that builds a bipartite graph from sampled responses and claims, utilizing closeness centrality as the primary metric for uncertainty estimation. Additionally, they introduce uncertainty-aware decoding (UAG) to enhance the factuality of generated outputs. Experimental results demonstrate improvements in both claim-level uncertainty estimation and the factuality of responses.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The introduction of graph-based uncertainty metrics for claim-level analysis is innovative and addresses a significant gap in LLM uncertainty estimation.
- The proposed method is clearly illustrated and systematically explores various graph centrality metrics to assess claim importance and uncertainty.
- Integrating uncertainty estimates into the decoding process shows practical applications, enhancing the reliability of LLM outputs.

Weaknesses:  
- The method relies heavily on LLMs for critical steps, raising concerns about performance degradation if the LLM is unreliable, and it incurs significant computational costs.
- The evaluation is limited, with only 50 randomly sampled entities, which may not convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness.
- The framework assumes claims are largely independent, which may not hold true in all real-world scenarios, and it lacks consideration of inter-claim dependencies within long-form generations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on computational efficiency, specifically by reporting the additional costs compared to the vanilla LLM and the API costs before and after applying their methods. Additionally, providing more detailed explanations and examples for calculating the closeness metric in the proposed framework would enhance clarity. The authors should also consider evaluating their method on a broader range of datasets to strengthen the generalizability of their results. Finally, addressing the inter-claim dependencies more explicitly in their analysis would improve the robustness of their framework.
