Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called Multimodal Fine-Grained Entity Typing (MFGET) and constructs a new dataset, MFIGER, for this task, which includes 95 fine-grained categories. The authors propose MOVCNet, a model that leverages an object-level attention mechanism to fuse visual and textual context, achieving significant performance gains over text-only baselines. The reported improvements are 11.27%, 1.91%, and 10.46% in strict accuracy at the total, coarse, and fine-grained levels, respectively. The attention visualization enhances model interpretability.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The creation of the MFIGER dataset provides a valuable benchmark for future research.
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, with clear motivation and substantial performance improvements demonstrated.
- The attention visualization aids in understanding the model's functionality.

Weaknesses:
- The use of cross-modal attention layers is common in multimodal information extraction, and relevant literature should be referenced.
- The experiments are limited to a single dataset, and additional multimodal baselines are needed for a comprehensive performance comparison.
- An ablation study on the latent type classifier is missing, raising questions about its contribution to classification accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review by referencing relevant works in the missing references section. Additionally, we suggest conducting experiments on more than one dataset and implementing additional multimodal baselines for a fairer comparison. It would also be beneficial to include an ablation study on the latent type classifier to evaluate its impact on classification accuracy.
