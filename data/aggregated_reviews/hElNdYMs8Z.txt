### Key Points
This paper presents a study of doubly smoothed best-response dynamics in two-player zero-sum Markov games, including a finite-sample analysis that demonstrates convergence to Nash equilibrium with smoothing bias. The authors propose a novel approach that combines smoothed value function updates with softmax best-response dynamics, aiming for independent learning without communication between players.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The finite-sample analysis of payoff-based learning dynamics is a significant contribution, addressing a practical question in stochastic games.  
- The paper is well-written, providing clear discussions and high-level insights into the algorithm and proof sketches.

Weaknesses:  
- The claim of convergence and rationality is questionable due to the persistent smoothing bias $\tau$, which may hinder exact convergence to Nash equilibrium.  
- The independence of learning dynamics for both players is undermined by their tied learning rates.  
- The bounds for the Nash gap and regularized Nash gap are perceived as weak and standard, respectively, requiring further elaboration and stronger mathematical justification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the rigor of their claims regarding convergence and rationality by potentially introducing a decreasing parameter $\tau_t$ to facilitate exact convergence. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the definition of "independence" in the context of player learning rates. Strengthening the bounds for the Nash gap with a corollary that provides the best choice of $\tau$ would enhance the evaluation of the bound's strength. Finally, a deeper mathematical illustration of the challenges faced by softmax policy algorithms could significantly bolster the paper's arguments.
