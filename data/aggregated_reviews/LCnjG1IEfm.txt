Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents normalization-equivariant CNNs, where convolutional kernels are constrained to sum to 1 and neuron activations sort pairs of neurons. The authors demonstrate that this architecture performs comparably to existing models on image denoising with the same noise levels but shows superior generalization to unseen noise levels. The proposed method emphasizes the importance of normalization equivariance in enhancing robustness against varying noise scales.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a straightforward and effective approach to improve generalization in image denoising CNNs.
- Results, particularly those in Fig 4, are compelling and support the proposed architecture's efficacy.
- Section 5.2 provides valuable insights into the performance of bias-free and scale-invariant models in denoising, suggesting the superiority of the proposed normalization-equivariance.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity on whether the results in Fig 4 and 5 are from blind or non-blind experiments, which could affect the significance of the findings.
- The kernel constraint for convolutional kernels is ambiguously described; it should specify that it applies along both channel and spatial dimensions to maintain shift-equivariance.
- Recent denoising methods are not adequately addressed, and the evaluation is limited to small datasets, which could be expanded for stronger validation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify whether the results in Fig 4 and 5 are blind or non-blind experiments, as this impacts the interpretation of the findings. Additionally, please specify that the kernel constraint applies along both channel and spatial dimensions in the convolutional kernel definition. We also suggest including an ablation study to better understand the impact of the sorting nonlinearity and to motivate the benefits of shift-equivariance over scale-equivariance more thoroughly. Finally, expanding the evaluation to include more recent denoising methods and datasets would strengthen the submission.
