Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DarkSAM, a prompt-free universal attack framework against the Segment Anything Model (SAM) in a quasi-black-box setting. The framework employs a semantic decoupling-based spatial attack and a texture distortion-based frequency attack. DarkSAM disrupts SAM's segmentation by decoupling object features in both spatial and frequency domains using a universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). The authors conduct experiments on four public segmentation datasets (ADE20K, MS-COCO, CITYSCAPES, and SA-1B) with various SAM variants, demonstrating impressive results in undermining segmentation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-written and easy to follow.
2. The unique design of the shadow target strategy is specifically tailored to SAM, distinguishing it from traditional segmentation adversarial attacks.
3. The attacking results show significant degradation in segmentation performance across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks an up-to-date review of recent studies related to SAM and does not provide sufficient comparisons, which diminishes its significance.
2. The experimental section could benefit from further analyses, particularly regarding the importance of the spatial domain attack over the frequency domain attack.
3. The use of mIoU and ASR appears redundant, and clarification on the rationale for using both metrics is needed.
4. The visualization of segmentation masks in Figure 7 is too dark, hindering readability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review in Section 2.1 to include recent studies on SAM-based adversarial attacks and models. Additionally, please provide a detailed explanation of why the spatial domain attack is prioritized over the frequency domain attack. Clarifying the justification for using both mIoU and ASR metrics concurrently would enhance the paper's rigor. Furthermore, consider increasing the brightness of the segmentation masks in Figure 7 for better visibility. Lastly, repeating experiments to include error bars would strengthen the findings' credibility.
