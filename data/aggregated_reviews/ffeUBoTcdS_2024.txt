Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method called Persistent Test-time Adaptation (PeTTA) to tackle the gradual performance degradation of models during long-term test-time adaptation (TTA). The authors simulate a recurring TTA scenario, demonstrating how traditional TTA methods can fail in environments that reoccur over time. PeTTA balances adaptation and model stability by adjusting the adaptation strategy based on the model's performance, significantly enhancing stability and performance in long-term testing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The study introduces a realistic test scenario—recurring TTA—that effectively simulates real-world conditions, revealing potential long-term issues with TTA methods.
2. The use of Gaussian Mixture Model classifiers allows for a thorough analysis of performance degradation in TTA methods, with PeTTA showing stable performance across multiple benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The recurring test scenario may not fully capture the complexities of real-world applications, as environmental changes involve factors beyond lighting conditions, such as shooting angles and weather.
2. While the theoretical foundation is appreciated, the practical applicability of PeTTA requires further validation with real images, as current experiments may not reflect diverse real-world conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the practical validation of PeTTA by conducting experiments with real images to better assess its applicability in complex scenarios. Additionally, we suggest providing experimental comparisons with existing TTA methods, particularly those addressing self-training pitfalls, to enhance the novelty and robustness of the proposed approach. Further exploration of the sensitivity of hyperparameters, especially $\alpha_0$ and $\lambda_0$, is also advised to clarify their impact on PeTTA's performance.
