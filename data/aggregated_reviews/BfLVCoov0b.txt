### Key Points
This paper presents a Hessian regularization approach to enhance grokking in arithmetic tasks by smoothing oscillations and accelerating the grokking stage. The authors propose a novel measurement based on the Hessian to estimate generalization errors. The experimental results convincingly demonstrate the effectiveness of noise injection in stabilizing training, with hyperparameters clearly outlined in the appendix. However, the focus is primarily on modulo arithmetic tasks, raising questions about the generalizability of the findings to broader mathematical reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper aligns well with the workshop theme and effectively addresses the grokking phenomenon, suggesting potential applicability in other settings.
- The writing is clear, and the experimental results are straightforward, linking theoretical insights with empirical observations.

Weaknesses:
- The analysis is limited to three arithmetic equations, leaving the generalizability of the approach uncertain.
- The computational efficiency is not addressed, as the method requires two forward and backward passes due to noise injection.
- The novelty of the noise injection technique is questioned, as it is well-known in deep learning, and the contribution to model performance appears minimal.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis by testing the proposed approach on a broader range of arithmetic equations to establish generalizability. Additionally, addressing the computational efficiency concerns and clarifying the use of weight decay in Equation 1 would enhance the clarity of the results. Finally, we suggest exploring methods that could improve the arithmetic capabilities of large language models, as this would significantly increase the significance of the work.
