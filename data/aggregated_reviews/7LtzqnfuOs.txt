Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Dual self-Awareness Value dEcomposition (DAVE) framework, which avoids the Individual Global Max (IGM) constraints prevalent in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). DAVE is inspired by dual self-awareness from psychology and incorporates an ego policy for action selection and an alter ego value function for credit assignment. It introduces an anti-ego exploration method to mitigate premature convergence to local optima. The authors evaluate DAVE across various domains, demonstrating its performance against state-of-the-art MARL approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes an innovative approach inspired by psychological concepts, enhancing the understanding of MARL.
- The evaluation is well-structured, starting with simpler problems and scaling up, using numerous state-of-the-art algorithms for comparison.
- DAVE's design allows for effective exploration and addresses local optima issues.

Weaknesses:
- DAVE introduces significant complexity, at least doubling computational effort compared to baselines, raising questions about the fairness of comparisons.
- The purpose of individual Q-functions is unclear, as they do not contribute to maximizing the joint Q function.
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the symmetric relationship implied between the ego and alter ego models.
- Experimental results, particularly on SMAC, do not align with previous work, and the paper relies heavily on the appendix, indicating a lack of self-containment.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the relationship between the ego and alter ego models, ensuring consistent terminology. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough justification for the complexity introduced by DAVE, particularly regarding the necessity of individual Q-functions. We suggest including pseudocode in the main text for better accessibility and enhancing the discussion of related works to contextualize DAVE's contributions. Furthermore, the authors should analyze the discrepancies in experimental results compared to previous studies and consider providing a more comprehensive exploration of the performance/computational cost trade-off associated with varying sample sizes. Lastly, addressing the potential societal impacts of the proposed method would strengthen the paper.
