Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for enhancing tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) by leveraging insights from errors in inference trees. The authors propose the ToolPreference dataset, which collects successful and failed paths from ToolBench, and utilize a preference-based fine-tuning method based on this dataset. Experimental results indicate that the finetuned model, TP-LLaMA, significantly outperforms baselines in pass rate and win rate, demonstrating improved generalization capabilities with unseen APIs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method effectively utilizes failed attempts to construct a preference dataset, enhancing data utilization.
2. The ablation experiments validate the proposed method's superiority across multiple open-source LLMs, indicating its generalizability.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks case studies comparing reasoning trajectories between TP-LLaMA and LLaMA with SFT across different task scenarios, which are necessary to substantiate the effectiveness of DPO.
2. The contribution is limited, primarily building on existing methods without sufficient novelty.
3. The preference dataset construction may be overly simplistic, as it only considers successful and failed paths without addressing the complexities of tool usage errors.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including case studies that compare reasoning trajectories of TP-LLaMA and LLaMA with SFT across various task scenarios. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed explanation of the design choices for training hyperparameters, specifically how the optimal number of expert trajectories (11,142) and preference pairs (8,202) were determined. To strengthen the analysis, it would be valuable to include ablation studies investigating the impact of these hyperparameters on model performance. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore other benchmarks, such as APIBench, to assess the model's performance comprehensively. Lastly, incorporating human evaluation in the assessment of model outputs would enhance the robustness of the findings.
