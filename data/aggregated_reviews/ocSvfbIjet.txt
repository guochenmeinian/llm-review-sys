### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to enhancing neural architectures' generalization capabilities beyond training distributions by utilizing logic puzzles as a controlled testbed. The authors propose a graph-based method integrated with reinforcement learning (RL) to model scalable logical structures. Key contributions include a multi-agent RL framework that employs Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for reasoning, insights into architectural inductive biases, reward system designs, and recurrent modeling for extrapolative reasoning.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper identifies generalization beyond interpolation as a critical challenge in machine learning, using logic puzzles as a well-defined, scalable, and interpretable framework.
2. The introduction of the PUZZLES benchmark and a graph-based interface for logic puzzles enhances resources for studying generalization in controlled environments.
3. Representing puzzles as graphs allows for flexible and scalable handling of tasks with varying complexity, effectively capturing local and global constraints through the dual use of decision and meta-nodes in GNNs.
4. The experiments are comprehensive, covering multiple puzzle types, sizes, and architectural choices (GNNs vs. transformers), with robust evaluation metrics aligned with the paper's goals.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a comprehensive explanation of how puzzles are transformed into a GNN network and does not provide a runnable program.
2. At larger puzzle sizes, the GNN+RL method only matches the performance of the RL-only method, showing significant improvement only on smaller puzzles (2x2 to 6x6) and lacking sufficient cross-comparison with the RL-only method.
3. The observed performance improvement at smaller scales is attributed to richer NN-node representations capturing more state relationships, which do not scale effectively with increasing PUZZLES size.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the explanation of the transformation process of puzzles into a GNN network and provide a runnable program to facilitate reproducibility. Additionally, the authors should include more comprehensive cross-comparisons with the RL-only method, particularly at larger puzzle sizes, to clarify the limitations of their approach. Finally, addressing the scalability of the NN-node representation in relation to larger PUZZLES would enhance the paper's contributions.
