### Key Points
This paper presents a Multi-grained Multi-curriculum Denoising Framework (M2DF) aimed at addressing the Multimodal Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis (MABSA) task by reducing the negative impact of noisy images without filtering data. The authors propose a novel approach that reorders training data to enhance learning from clean samples. Key contributions include a new perspective on noise reduction in MABSA, the introduction of M2DF, and extensive experimental evaluations demonstrating the framework's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel idea for denoising image data through training sample reordering.
- Extensive experiments validate the proposed framework's effectiveness, showing improvements over state-of-the-art methods.
- The organization of the paper is generally clear, making it easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The improvement from adding the M2DF framework is minimal for the JMASA task, with some models performing worse than the original.
- The motivation for using curriculum learning is unclear, and comparisons with pure textual ABSA models are lacking.
- The paper is not well-organized, with implementation details needing relocation to the appendix and a clearer presentation of case studies and error analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for using curriculum learning and explore other machine learning algorithms. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with threshold-based data filtering methods and other training schedules, such as self-paced learning, to ensure fair evaluations. Addressing the organization of the paper by moving implementation details to the appendix and enhancing the analysis section would also strengthen the manuscript. Lastly, we suggest revising the terminology in section 3.1, paragraph 1, from "the degree of noisy images" to "the degree of image noise," and removing vertical lines from tables for better presentation.
