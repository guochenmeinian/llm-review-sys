Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Stepwise Alignment for Constrained Policy Optimization (SACPO), a method designed to optimize language model (LM) policies by sequentially aligning them to enhance both helpfulness and harmlessness. The authors propose a two-step alignment process: first optimizing for reward and then for safety, or vice versa. The method is theoretically grounded and demonstrated to outperform existing approaches, such as Safe RLHF, in empirical tests. The authors also introduce a practical variant, P-SACPO, which utilizes model merging techniques. The evaluation of the SACPO framework focuses on its ability to balance helpfulness and safety in language models, with extensive experiments using ELO scores to mitigate the impact of comparison order. The results reveal that SACPO and P-SACPO consistently outperform other models like alpaca-sft and beaver-v1. However, the authors acknowledge the limitations of relying solely on GPT-4 for evaluation, particularly regarding its potential verbosity bias in assessing helpfulness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The theoretical foundations of SACPO are robust, ensuring effective policy optimization (Theorem 1) and providing statistical bounds on estimation errors through the $\delta$-uncertainty quantifier.
- The method allows for flexibility in balancing helpfulness and harmlessness through the selection of hyperparameters, such as the Lagrangian multiplier $\lambda$ and KL penalty $\beta$.
- The empirical results indicate that SACPO surpasses baseline models in both helpfulness and harmlessness, demonstrating its practical effectiveness.
- The authors implemented a robust evaluation protocol, conducting multiple trials to ensure consistency in ELO scores.
- The paper includes theoretical frameworks for extending SACPO to multiple safety constraints, indicating its potential for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation lacks clarity regarding the number and variety of prompts, making it difficult to assess the generalizability of SACPO.
- The separation of helpfulness and harmfulness evaluations across different prompts may lead to suboptimal learning, as models might learn to detect harmful prompts without generating helpful responses.
- The training protocol's details, including the use of the PKU-SafeRLHF dataset and the duration of training, are insufficiently described, hindering reproducibility.
- The reliance on LLMs for evaluating helpfulness and harmfulness raises concerns about objectivity and reliability, as this method has not been thoroughly validated.
- The interpretation of verbosity as a safety signal is questioned, suggesting a need for clearer definitions of constraints.
- The presentation of results lacks coherence, particularly in maintaining consistent evaluation strategies across different metrics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the evaluation process by detailing the number and variety of prompts used in testing. Additionally, consider evaluating helpfulness and harmfulness in parallel on the same prompts to ensure that the model learns to generate responses that are both helpful and harmless. We suggest providing a more rigorous overview of the training protocol, including specifics on convergence criteria and training duration, to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to explore the reliability of LLM evaluations by conducting additional analyses to establish their competency in assessing safety alignment. We also recommend improving the clarity of definitions regarding safety signals and consider reclassifying verbosity as a multi-constraint alignment problem. Lastly, we urge the authors to enhance the coherence of result presentations to maintain consistent evaluation strategies across all metrics.
