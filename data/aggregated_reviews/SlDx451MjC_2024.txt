Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an encoder-based approach to GAN inversion for full 3D head reconstruction from a single image, utilizing a dual-encoder system. One encoder focuses on high-fidelity reconstruction of the input image, while the other generates realistic representations of occluded parts. The authors propose a stitching technique in the triplane feature space to combine the strengths of both encoders, aiming for superior performance in generating 360° views of human heads.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the problem and the proposed method are reasonable.
- The occlusion-aware discriminator and training the discriminator directly on the triplane domain are novel and relevant for full 360° reconstruction.
- The paper includes qualitative comparisons, ablation studies, and quantitative assessments, demonstrating the impact of design choices.

Weaknesses:
- The head geometry after editing appears flat compared to other results.
- The writing and language need substantial improvement, and some details lack clarity.
- The evaluation primarily focuses on front-view images, with limited exploration of generalization to diverse head shapes or ethnicities.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing and provide visualizations of the geometry of the generated results alongside the final RGB images. Additionally, including images from extreme viewpoints and discussing the model's generalization to more complex inputs would enhance the evaluation. We also suggest a more in-depth analysis of the method's limitations and failure cases, as well as clearer differentiation of symbols in the paper.
