Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of the trade-offs between core stability and egalitarian fairness in Federated Learning (FL) systems, particularly when agents exhibit altruistic behaviors. The authors model FL systems as altruism coalition formation games (ACFGs) and propose theoretical bounds for egalitarian fairness that maintain core stability across various altruistic behaviors. They challenge the assumption that achieving egalitarian fairness leads to instability and provide experimental validation of their theoretical findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of game theory and social choice theory to analyze FL systems is innovative and well-motivated.
- The theoretical contributions are robust, supported by rigorous mathematical proofs, and provide valuable insights into maintaining stability in FL systems.
- The paper is well-organized, with clear definitions and logical progression of ideas, enhancing understanding of complex concepts.

Weaknesses:
- The authors do not adequately address whether egalitarian fairness leads to instability, focusing instead on how high levels of fairness are expected under core stability.
- The significance of findings in Section 5.2 is unclear, and the long expressions for the bounds of lambda may lack intuitiveness.
- The experiments are limited to a small number of agents (4), which diminishes their impact; a larger sample size is recommended for more compelling results.
- The analysis of the sensitivity of fairness bounds to variations in client behavior and network topology is insufficiently explored.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their results by explicitly addressing the question of whether egalitarian fairness leads to instability. Additionally, we suggest that the authors expand their experimental validation to include more complex FL scenarios and a larger number of agents to enhance the robustness of their findings. A more detailed analysis of the sensitivity of the proposed fairness bounds to variations in client behavior and network topology would also add depth to the study. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the color coding in subsections 4.2 and 5.1, and provide clearer references to the proofs in the appendix for each proposition.
