Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuRodin, a Signed Distance Function (SDF)-to-density-based neural surface reconstruction method that aims to enhance SDF-based volume rendering. The authors propose a new pipeline addressing SDF-to-density conversion and geometric regularization issues. Key innovations include a locally adaptive scale parameter for density conversion, a novel bias correction loss to ensure the SDF becomes negative after the maximum weight point, and a two-stage training process to balance flexibility and smoothness in topological changes. The authors claim their method outperforms several baseline techniques based on experimental results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed improvements are well-motivated, technically sound, and the paper is clearly written with detailed methodology.
2. The paper provides strong experimental results demonstrating high-quality surface reconstruction and includes relevant comparisons with baseline methods.
3. The authors effectively address shortcomings of existing SDF-based approaches and offer insightful solutions.

Weaknesses:
1. The ablation study lacks quantitative results and more qualitative examples, currently relying on a single scene for verification.
2. The adaptive scale concept is not novel; a discussion on its differences from existing works would strengthen the paper.
3. The two-stage training's motivation is not experimentally verified, and an ablation variant without the eikonal loss is strongly recommended.
4. The experimental section lacks comprehensive comparisons, particularly with TUVR, and does not include results on the commonly used DTU dataset.
5. The evaluation metrics are limited to F-score, with a need for additional metrics like PSNR and SSIM.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the ablation study by including quantitative results and additional qualitative examples to verify the effectiveness of the proposed components. It would be beneficial to discuss the differences between the adaptive scale used in this work and existing methods, providing motivating examples for its importance. We strongly suggest adding an ablation variant that excludes the eikonal loss in the coarse stage to validate the proposed training process. Additionally, a thorough comparison with TUVR and results on the DTU dataset should be included. Finally, we encourage the authors to expand the evaluation metrics beyond F-score to include PSNR and SSIM for a more comprehensive assessment of performance.
