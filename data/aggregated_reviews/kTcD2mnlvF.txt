### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative approach, Decentralized Collaborative Learning with Adaptive Reference Data (DARD), aimed at enhancing collaborative learning in on-device Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendation systems. DARD challenges the traditional use of uniform reference data by introducing a decentralized framework that customizes reference data for specific user pairs, thereby improving efficiency and accuracy in location-based social networks. The authors propose a method for adaptive reference data selection based on loss tracking and influence functions, demonstrating its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DARD introduces a novel framework for adaptive reference data, addressing the limitations of one-size-fits-all approaches.
2. The experimental setup is robust, encompassing five distinct experiments that validate the proposed method's performance and resilience.
3. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, enhancing its accessibility and contribution to the field.
4. The proposed paradigm has broader applications beyond POI recommendations, potentially benefiting various fields utilizing collaborative learning.

Weaknesses:
1. Ambiguity in the experimental procedure, particularly in Section 5.3 regarding candidate selection when reducing the reference pool, requires clarification.
2. Section 4.1 lacks detail on transformation generation, leaving unclear whether it involves the last POI or all subsequent POIs after a shared reference point.
3. Terminology inconsistencies, such as the interchangeable use of "harmful" and "noisy" instances, may confuse readers.
4. The rationale for incorporating loss tracking during training needs further emphasis, particularly in relation to its value compared to the influence function used post-training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the candidate selection process in Section 5.3, specifying whether it is random or rule-based. Additionally, we suggest providing more detail in Section 4.1 regarding the transformation process, clarifying whether it pertains to the last POI or all subsequent POIs. To enhance terminology clarity, we advise defining "harmful" and "noisy" instances distinctly. Finally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the necessity of loss tracking during training, particularly its added value in conjunction with the influence function.
