Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ArkVale, a page-based key-value (KV) cache manager aimed at enhancing long-context processing in large language models (LLMs). ArkVale identifies and recalls important tokens previously evicted, optimizing memory usage while improving throughput and latency without significant accuracy loss. The method employs asynchronous backup of filled pages in external memory and bounding-volume techniques for efficient recall and eviction. Experimental results indicate that ArkVale achieves up to 2.2x faster latency and 4.6x higher throughput across various long-context tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized, with clear writing and effective use of diagrams to illustrate the KV cache management process.
- Comprehensive evaluation results demonstrate minimal accuracy loss while significantly improving efficiency in decoding latency and throughput.
- ArkVale empirically identifies the dynamics of token importance, ensuring good memory efficiency.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation is limited to the LongChat model, lacking assessments on other models like Mistral and LLaMA-3.
- There is insufficient discussion on the impact of page size on memory consumption and potential fragmentation issues.
- The paper does not include comparisons with concurrent works or other efficiency-focused methods, nor does it discuss hyper-parameter influences such as top-k and page size.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including additional models, such as Mistral and LLaMA-3, to demonstrate the generality of ArkVale. Additionally, we suggest incorporating a discussion on the relationship between ArkVale and concurrent works, particularly those mentioned in the reviews. It would also be beneficial to address the impact of page size on memory consumption and potential fragmentation, as well as to include ablation studies on hyper-parameters like top-k and page size. Finally, consider discussing the limitations and societal impacts of ArkVale in the paper.
