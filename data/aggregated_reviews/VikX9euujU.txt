### Key Points
This paper presents an extension to batchBALD for batch active learning, addressing two main criticisms: (1) computational cost and (2) the tendency to select similar points in the batch. The authors propose a new acquisition function based on the entropy of predicted probabilities, claiming it overcomes these issues. Additionally, the paper differentiates between epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, aiming to optimize batch active learning processes.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed acquisition function is simple, elegant, and intuitive.
- Simulation results demonstrate a clear advantage over batchBALD.
- The manuscript is well-written, with clear objectives and methodology.
- The theoretical contribution of separating epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty is appealing and may reduce computational overhead.

Weaknesses:
- The acquisition function, while intuitive, appears arbitrary; the rationale for using entropy of predicted probabilities rather than other functions is unclear.
- The justification for the Gaussian assumption regarding class probabilities lacks rigor and may require a more robust explanation based on asymptotic normality.
- The choice of Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage for stabilizing covariance in high dimensions seems arbitrary, with unclear implications for the results.
- The simulation analysis is perceived as thin, lacking in scenario variety and the number of experiments conducted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the choice of the acquisition function, particularly addressing why entropy of predicted probabilities is preferred. Additionally, we suggest providing a more rigorous explanation for the Gaussian assumption regarding class probabilities and clarifying the implications of using Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage. Finally, we encourage the authors to enhance the simulation analysis by considering a broader range of scenarios and increasing the number of experiments performed.
