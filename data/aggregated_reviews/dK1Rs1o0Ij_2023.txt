Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper explores the integration of data-centric AI techniques to enhance the quality of synthetic data for training machine learning models in scenarios with limited real-world data. The authors propose a novel framework for evaluating data profiles and provide practical recommendations for improving synthetic data generation. They conduct an evaluation of various tabular datasets, revealing insights into the strengths and limitations of existing synthetic data generation techniques. The research highlights that statistical fidelity measures, such as inverse KL-divergence, may not fully capture the utility of synthetic data, particularly under varying levels of label noise. Additionally, the authors emphasize the importance of post-processing real data to enhance performance metrics and focus on tabular data due to its prevalence across various domains, scalability for benchmarking, and the generalizability of data-centric methods. The paper includes sections detailing statistical fidelity measures and the effects of pre- and post-processing strategies on model performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation of the paper addresses a crucial challenge in synthetic data generation by integrating data-centric AI techniques.
- The availability of code and data is beneficial for the synthetic data generation community.
- The inclusion of relative model ranking and feature importance offers deeper insights beyond mere accuracy.
- The paper provides valuable insights into the performance metrics of generative models through post-processing real data.
- A diverse range of tabular datasets is utilized, enhancing the generalizability of findings.
- The authors have effectively expanded the limitations section and included additional statistical analyses to strengthen their results.

Weaknesses:
- The paper overclaims by generalizing findings from experiments solely on tabular datasets without proper validation across other data types.
- The lack of extensive evaluation across diverse datasets limits the generalizability of the proposed framework.
- The experimental analysis is superficial, lacking in-depth examination and rigorous statistical testing, raising concerns about the validity of the findings.
- The paper does not adequately discuss techniques for partitioning data instances into easy, hard, and ambiguous categories.
- The results may not be robust enough, as noted by some reviewers, indicating potential variability in model performance.
- The clarity of certain figures and documentation issues were initially lacking, although improvements have been made.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their findings by conducting experiments across a broader range of data types and domains, particularly in computer vision and natural language processing areas. The authors should provide a more thorough statistical analysis of their results, including confidence intervals in relevant figures, to substantiate their claims. It would be beneficial to apply the proposed post-processing strategies to real data for comparative analysis. Additionally, the authors should clarify the rationale for focusing on tabular data and provide concrete examples of the generated synthetic data alongside real data. We suggest that the limitations be included in the main paper rather than relegated to the appendix for better visibility. Furthermore, the authors should further clarify the significance of their findings in relation to the robustness of the results, particularly in the context of label noise, and provide more in-depth analyses of the variability observed across different datasets and generative models to enhance the understanding of their results. Lastly, it would be beneficial for the authors to explore the implications of their findings for other data modalities beyond tabular data, as this could broaden the applicability of their framework.
