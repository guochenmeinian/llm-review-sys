### Key Points
This paper presents a study on the dynamics of unfollowing misinformation spreaders on Twitter, analyzing three user samples: the initial sample, the modeling sample, and the rate sample. The authors find that misinformation spreaders are infrequently unfollowed, with factors influencing unfollowing behaviors identified as redundancy and ideology. The research questions are clearly defined, and the methodology is well-articulated.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors address a significant and novel issue concerning unfollowing misinformation spreaders, adding value to existing research.
- The large-scale data collection for modeling user unfollowing behavior is commendable and contributes to a predictive model.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's presentation is unclear, with issues such as broken logic, grammar errors, and improper data visualization.
- The motivation for studying unfollowing dynamics is insufficiently articulated, lacking concrete examples and implications.
- The introduction does not provide critical findings, leaving readers with limited context.
- The data curation process raises questions, particularly regarding the analysis timeframe and classification of misinformation spreaders.
- The use of GPT-3 for identifying debunking words lacks justification and clarity on its effectiveness.
- The sample size of 2,500 for the Rate Sample is small, necessitating more data for robust analysis.
- The definition of the unfollowing rate is missing, which is crucial for understanding the study's key concept.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the paper's presentation by addressing grammatical errors and ensuring logical flow between sentences. Enhancing the motivation section with concrete examples and real-world implications would strengthen the introduction. We suggest including critical findings in the introduction to provide context for the research questions. Clarifying the data curation process and the classification criteria for misinformation spreaders is essential. Additionally, we advise the authors to justify the use of GPT-3 and provide more details on its capabilities. Increasing the sample size for the Rate Sample would improve the reliability of the analysis. Finally, we recommend defining the unfollowing rate to clarify its significance in the study.
