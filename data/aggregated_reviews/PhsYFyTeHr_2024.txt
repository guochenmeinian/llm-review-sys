Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of information flow in Non-autoregressive Transformers (NAT) for image generation, aiming to enhance efficiency. The authors propose an architecture change that eliminates unnecessary token interactions during forward passes and avoids recomputing unchanged token features across iterative steps. Their proposed ENAT design significantly reduces the required TFLOPs while improving image generation quality on benchmarks like MS-COCO and ImageNet.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant topic in Non-autoregressive Transformers for image generation and proposes two well-motivated efficiency improvements, supported by empirical analysis.
- It includes a comprehensive set of empirical studies, demonstrating performance improvements over baselines.
- The structure is clear, and the motivation for the proposed approach is well-founded.

Weaknesses:
- The efficiency of masked image transformers has been extensively studied in related literature, such as self-supervised masked auto-encoders (MAE), which should be discussed more prominently.
- The SelfCrossAttention module is a minor variation of existing attention mechanisms found in prior work.
- The choice of baseline models lacks motivation, with notable omissions like StyleGAN-XL and others, raising questions about the reported scores for DiT-XL.
- The paper provides limited qualitative samples, which are essential for evaluating the model's performance across different aspects of image generation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of related work, particularly regarding the efficiency of masked image transformers in the context of MAE and similar architectures. Clarifying the rationale behind the choice of baseline models and including additional qualitative samples would enhance the transparency of comparisons. Furthermore, elaborating on the training modifications related to reusing previous features and the implications of spatial disentanglement would strengthen the manuscript.
