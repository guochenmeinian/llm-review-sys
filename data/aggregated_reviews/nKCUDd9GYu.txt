### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for multiparameter persistent homology (MPH) that addresses critical challenges in topological data analysis (TDA). The authors propose T-CDR, which generalizes previous studies and provides stability and convergence guarantees for S-CDR, a special case of T-CDR. The framework is validated through empirical convergence studies and classification tasks on immunohistochemistry datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed T-CDR framework generalizes prior work and opens new research avenues by varying parameters/operators.  
- Stability and convergence guarantees for S-CDR enhance its utility in multi-parameter persistent homology.  
- Empirical studies demonstrate a clear trend in convergence rates, supporting theoretical claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The experiments lack detail, particularly in performance comparisons with state-of-the-art (SOTA) models across various domains.  
- The runtime improvements of MPL with sparse implementation suggest that efficiency gains may stem from implementation rather than algorithmic advancements.  
- Clarity issues arise regarding the "ground truth" representation in empirical convergence experiments and the bifiltration parameters used.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experiments section by providing a more detailed analysis of the performance of vectorizations against SOTA models from different domains. Additionally, clarifying the "ground truth" representation for immunohistochemistry data and providing insights into the time complexity of the proposed algorithms would strengthen the claims. We also suggest that the authors clarify the bifiltration parameters used in their experiments and consider revising the notation for the multi-parameter filtration function to avoid confusion.
