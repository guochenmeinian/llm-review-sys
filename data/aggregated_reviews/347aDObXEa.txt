Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for graph knowledge distillation that integrates knowledge from both Euclidean and hyperbolic teacher models to a student model, utilizing a Structure-Wise Knowledge Transfer (SWKT) module for embedding selection based on local subgraph geometry and a Geometric Embedding Optimization (GEO) module to refine knowledge transfer. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing knowledge distillation techniques on various graph data tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors propose a method that leverages the strengths of both Euclidean and hyperbolic representations.
2. Experimental results demonstrate superior performance compared to various graph data distillation baselines.
3. The proposed method maintains a similar running time to other baselines while achieving significantly higher compression performance.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the method's time and space complexity.
2. While the use of two geometries is innovative, the paper could be enhanced by discussing potential extensions to include additional non-Euclidean geometries.
3. The preliminaries section contains definitions that may not be essential for understanding the core method, such as the Poincar√© Disk Model and Tangent Space, which could be moved to an appendix or omitted for clarity.
4. The focus on Euclidean and hyperbolic teacher models limits exploration; further analysis with teacher models in different geometries, such as spherical space, would provide valuable insights.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by conducting a detailed analysis of the method's time and space complexity. Additionally, we suggest discussing the potential for incorporating other non-Euclidean geometries and exploring the necessary modifications for handling multiple geometries. The authors should also ensure that all definitions in the preliminaries section are essential, potentially moving less critical definitions to an appendix. Finally, we encourage the authors to analyze the performance of their method with teacher models in various geometries, such as spherical space, to strengthen the paper's contribution.
