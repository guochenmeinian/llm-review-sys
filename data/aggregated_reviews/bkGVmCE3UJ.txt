### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the morphological capabilities of ChatGPT by prompting it to generate inflected or derived forms of nonce words across English, German, Tamil, and Turkish. The study reveals that ChatGPT has not achieved human-level performance on the Wug Test and highlights the presence of 'real word biases' in its outputs. The authors propose that their findings contribute valuable datasets for further research in this area.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study provides a unique analysis of the morphological capabilities of ChatGPT, which is a relevant and rare topic.
- The datasets created for the study are potentially valuable for future research.
- The paper includes a broad examination of different morphological phenomena across multiple languages.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of the findings is unclear, particularly concerning the specific version of GPT-3.5 used and the nonce word datasets.
- The inter-annotator agreement on the Tamil dataset is low, raising concerns about the dataset's construction.
- The narrative and explanation suffer from a lack of specificity, particularly regarding the claim of "typological diversity" among the languages studied.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding typological diversity by specifying the morphological properties that make the selected languages of interest. Additionally, we suggest a more thorough discussion of the low inter-annotator agreement in the Tamil dataset to address potential issues in its construction. The authors should also consider refining their narrative to avoid leaps in logic, particularly regarding the factors influencing ChatGPT's ability to generalize morphological patterns. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide a clearer explanation of the nonce word generation process for Turkish and to ensure all figures and tables are referenced appropriately in the text.
