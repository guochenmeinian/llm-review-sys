Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an improved convolutional deep kernel machine (CDKM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 image classification task. The authors introduce a novel regularization technique, stochastic kernel regularization (SKR), which adds noise to the learned Gram matrix during training to reduce overfitting and improve generalization. The method also leverages single-precision floating-point arithmetic to accelerate training, allowing for more training cycles within a fixed computational budget.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The proposed modifications significantly enhance the test accuracy of DKMs on CIFAR-10, increasing it from 92.7% to 94.5%.  
- The introduction of stochastic kernel regularization is a novel approach to mitigate overfitting in DKMs.  
- The experiments are thorough, demonstrating improved performance over previous methods and providing compelling numerical stability, enabling the use of TF32 arithmetic for faster training.  

Weaknesses:  
- The main scientific insight of the work is unclear, raising questions about its distinction from traditional neural networks.  
- The complexity of the modifications may pose implementation challenges for developers unfamiliar with these methods.  
- The paper only presents results for the CIFAR-10 dataset, limiting the exploration of the method's applicability to more complex image classification tasks.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the training procedure by providing a precise description of the training algorithm, including definitions for key terms and equations. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments on more complex datasets, such as Imagenet, to validate the generalizability of their method. Furthermore, addressing the questions regarding the relationship between kernel methods and neural networks would enhance the paper's contribution.
