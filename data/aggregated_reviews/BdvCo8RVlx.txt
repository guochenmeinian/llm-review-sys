Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the contextual lasso, an estimator that fits a sparse linear model on explanatory features while allowing coefficients to vary based on contextual features. The authors utilize a projection layer for efficient training and develop a group version of the contextual lasso. Extensive experimental analysis demonstrates that the contextual lasso outperforms traditional models, achieving better interpretability and predictive accuracy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The contextual lasso introduces a novel approach by integrating explanatory and contextual features within the classical lasso framework.
2. The paper is well-written, organized, and technically sound, with clear notation and a compelling presentation of results.
3. Empirical results indicate that the proposed model can select sparse models while maintaining superior prediction performance compared to traditional methods.

Weaknesses:
1. The definitions of explanatory and contextual features remain unclear, necessitating further clarification and evidence.
2. The experimental comparisons are limited, particularly lacking comparisons with contextual explanation networks.
3. There is no time complexity analysis provided for the contextual lasso.
4. The theoretical analysis, including generalization and optimization aspects, appears weak.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions regarding explanatory and contextual features and include methods for extracting contextual features from real-world data. Additionally, the authors should expand the comparison methods to include contextual explanation networks and provide a time complexity analysis of the contextual lasso. Finally, a more robust theoretical discussion on the properties of the contextual lasso, particularly its generalization ability compared to traditional lasso methods, would enhance the paper's contribution.
