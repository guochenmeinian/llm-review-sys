Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive framework for active learning in the $\ell_2$ norm, accommodating various modalities of data observation. The authors propose the computation of a "Generalized Christoffel Function" to guide sampling strategies, allowing for a broad interpretation of sampling that includes classical numerical linear algebra techniques and broader function observations. The framework is flexible enough to provide guarantees in nonlinear spaces, particularly in union-of-subspaces scenarios. Theoretical guarantees on sample complexity are established, aligning with known rates in leverage score sampling. The paper includes numerous experiments demonstrating the framework's applicability across diverse tasks, such as polynomial approximation, MRI reconstruction, and PDE solutions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is extensive and presents original results in a highly general context, significantly extending existing research on leverage score sampling.
- It provides high-quality sample complexity guarantees and is well-organized, with a detailed appendix containing various case studies and theoretical insights.
- The proposed framework is applicable to a wide range of problems, showcasing its potential impact on the machine learning community.

Weaknesses:
- Clarity issues arise from the dense mathematical presentation, making it challenging to grasp the general framework and its practical implications.
- The experimental section lacks comparisons with existing active learning methods, focusing solely on random sampling, which diminishes the perceived effectiveness of the proposed approach.
- Some technical details, particularly in the appendix, are difficult to follow due to complex notation and insufficient explanations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by incorporating a running example alongside mathematical definitions to enhance intuitiveness. Additionally, we suggest providing a high-level overview of the algorithm and its advantages over existing methods to better connect theoretical results with practical applications. The authors should also consider expanding the experimental comparisons to include established active learning strategies, thereby strengthening the paper's contributions. Finally, a thorough review of the notation for consistency and simplicity would benefit the overall readability and accessibility of the work.
