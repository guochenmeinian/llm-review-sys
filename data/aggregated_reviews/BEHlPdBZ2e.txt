### Key Points
This paper presents TensorNet, a novel O(3)-equivariant message-passing neural network for efficient representation of molecular systems. The model employs Cartesian tensor atomic embeddings to facilitate feature mixing through matrix product operations. By decomposing tensors into rotation group irreducible representations, TensorNet allows for independent processing of scalars, vectors, and tensors as needed. It demonstrates superior performance compared to higher-rank spherical tensor models while utilizing fewer parameters, even with a single interaction layer for small molecule potential energies. Additionally, TensorNet accurately predicts vector and tensor molecular quantities, significantly reducing computational costs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. TensorNet establishes state-of-the-art performance with a notable reduction in parameter count, marking a significant advancement in model efficiency without compromising quality.
2. Empirical results consistently show improvements over existing methods, with robust experimental evidence supporting the model's efficacy in real-world applications.
3. The method is novel, particularly in its construction based on the decomposition of a 3x3 matrix into scalar, vector, and matrix components.

Weaknesses:
1. The model architecture's exposition is complex and may be challenging for readers to comprehend. The lack of intuitive diagrams or visual aids in the main text hinders accessibility.
2. The paper does not explicitly discuss the limitations of TensorNet, particularly its inability to capture higher degree (l>2) information of O(3).
3. The presentation lacks clarity in certain areas, such as the definition of vector r_ij and the meaning of the cutoff radius, which are not well-known in the machine learning community.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the model architecture by including intuitive diagrams or visual aids within the main body of the text. Simplified illustrations or a step-by-step visual guide could enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explicitly address the limitations of TensorNet, particularly regarding its inability to capture higher degree information. Furthermore, a theoretical evaluation of the computational complexity, such as using big-O notation, would strengthen the discussion on computational costs compared to existing methods.
