### Key Points
This paper investigates political bias in summarization models through entity replacement of Donald Trump and Joe Biden, revealing consistent differences in summaries that suggest bias is encoded in the language model (LM). The authors propose a methodology that maintains all variables except the entity name, demonstrating significant implications for understanding how associations change in LMs. The study emphasizes the importance of responsible deployment of summarization models and provides a framework for assessing biases.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology is simple yet robust, allowing for clear comparisons of bias.
- The study provides empirical evidence of substantial differences across four summarization models.
- The authors show good awareness of limitations and acknowledge the need for further exploration of biases.

Weaknesses:
- The generalizability of findings is limited due to the focus on prominent political figures, which may not represent broader biases.
- Important information is relegated to appendices, making it harder for readers to assess results independently.
- The paper lacks a definitive conclusion to guide future research on improving summarization models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the specific type of bias being explored to avoid misunderstandings. Including a comparative analysis with human-generated summaries would strengthen the findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors provide details on the summarization datasets used for each model, as this influences model behavior. Analyzing control variables, such as the impact of document source on summary generation, would also enhance the claims regarding the origin of biases. Finally, we encourage the authors to generalize their analysis to include more entities to better understand the systematic causes of bias in summarization models.
