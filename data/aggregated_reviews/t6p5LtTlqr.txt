### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to enhance neural machine translation (NMT) by utilizing phrase-level information through Word Pair Encoding (WPE) and Attentive Semantic Fusion (ASF). Phrases are extracted using WPE, and their representations are integrated into the transformer encoder input via attention mechanisms. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method across various language pairs, showing improvements in translation performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is simple and reasonably effective, with experimental results validating the proposed methods.
- The clarity of the integration of subword semantics into a unified vector is commendable.
- The authors provide experimental proof of the model's superiority over existing baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The encoder input length can double in the worst case, increasing computational costs significantly, which is not adequately discussed.
- The term "semantic" is misleading, lacking evidence to support the claim that the representations are truly semantic.
- There is a perceived lack of detailed comparative analysis with other state-of-the-art techniques, raising concerns about generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the computational costs associated with the increased encoder input length and provide a clearer analysis of the impact on performance. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the use of the term "semantic" and providing evidence to support this claim. It would be beneficial to include results from COMET and BLEURT metrics to better align with human preferences. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to enhance the comparative analysis with other techniques to illustrate the advantages of their approach more clearly. Lastly, addressing the clarity of implementation details would aid in reproducibility.
