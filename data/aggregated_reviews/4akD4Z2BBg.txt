### Key Points
This paper presents a novel dictionary-based approach to biomedical entity recognition that does not require manual annotation or a task-specific corpus. The authors formulate the task as a synonym generalization problem, utilizing a BERT-based model to encode text spans and an MLP classifier trained on synonyms from a medical dictionary (UMLS) as positive examples and text spans from PubMed as negative examples. They introduce two regularization methods to enhance synonym recognition generalizability and evaluate their method across six BioNER tasks, demonstrating significant performance improvements over existing dictionary-based approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The approach is innovative and eliminates the need for manual annotation or task-specific corpora.
- The method shows strong performance, significantly outperforming other dictionary-based frameworks.
- The paper is well-written, with clear descriptions of experiments and thorough theoretical analysis.

Weaknesses:
- There are concerns regarding the accuracy of the few-shot experiment results, particularly discrepancies in performance metrics.
- Some sections, such as "Greedy Extraction" and the AutoNER approach, lack clarity and require further explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "Greedy Extraction" section to better explain how nested entities are handled. Additionally, the authors should clarify what dictionary tailoring in the AutoNER approach entails, specifically whether it requires manual effort. A case study illustrating the effectiveness of SynGen would also enhance the paper's impact.
