Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents novel algorithms for learning the structure of discrete Bayesian networks from potentially corrupted data, utilizing distributionally robust optimization (DRO) and regression techniques. The authors propose methods that optimize the worst-case risk over a family of distributions characterized by bounded Wasserstein distance and KL divergence. The paper claims to provide non-asymptotic guarantees for successful structure learning and validates the methods through numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality of addressing missing data in distributionally robust skeleton learning is a valuable contribution.  
- The quality of writing is commendable, with clear organization and effective presentation of ideas.  
- The significance of the research is notable, as it has wide-ranging applications in various fields.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper contains vague statements and assumptions that appear ad-hoc and overly restrictive, impacting the clarity and soundness of the results.  
- The mathematical derivations are dense, which may hinder understanding for a significant portion of the audience.  
- Empirical results are limited and inconclusive, with some benchmarks performing better than the proposed methods.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their assumptions and provide a more detailed discussion of their relevance to the results. Additionally, addressing the vague statements throughout the paper will enhance its readability. We suggest simplifying the mathematical presentation to make it more accessible to a broader audience. Furthermore, conducting rigorous statistical tests, such as the corrected Student's t-test using 15 hold-out folds, will strengthen the credibility of the experimental results. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the methods proposed in the paper and their relation to existing benchmarks to facilitate reader comprehension.
