Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NMM-GNN, a non-Euclidean mixture model designed to capture both homophily and hierarchies in social networks for embedding. The authors utilize spherical space to model homophily and hyperbolic space for social influence, proposing a projection to unify these two representations. The experiments demonstrate that NMM-GNN consistently outperforms various baseline methods across multiple tasks, including classification and link prediction.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, clearly written, and easy to follow.  
- The experiments adequately demonstrate the model's effectiveness against a wide range of baseline methods.  
- The proposed framework effectively integrates both homophily and social influence factors for social network generation.

Weaknesses:  
- The related work section lacks coverage of existing social embedding methods, missing many relevant studies.  
- The novelty of the proposed approach is questionable, as the concepts of hyperbolic and spherical spaces are commonly used in social network analysis.  
- There is insufficient empirical evidence to justify the preference for embedding in spherical space over Euclidean space.  
- The motivation for unifying the two spaces remains unclear, and the model does not adequately explain link generation in complex networks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the related work section by including a broader range of existing social embedding methods. Additionally, we suggest providing clearer empirical evidence or theoretical justification for the choice of spherical space over Euclidean space. The authors should also elaborate on the necessity of space unification and clarify how the model accounts for potential contradictions between homophily and social influence. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore additional datasets for experiments to enhance the robustness of their findings and consider extending the model's applicability to whole-graph level tasks.
