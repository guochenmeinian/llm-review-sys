Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a structured finite-difference algorithm for non-smooth black box optimization, demonstrating that the finite-difference surrogate serves as an unbiased estimator of the gradient for the smoothing approximation of the target function. The authors establish convergence rates for both non-smooth convex and non-convex optimization settings. The analysis includes a detailed examination of the convergence rate of structured zeroth-order optimization, with iterations' descent direction chosen by a random orthogonal group.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-structured and provides valuable insights into the structured finite-difference method.
- It includes a comprehensive mathematical analysis and theoretical claims supported by numerical experiments.
- The use of the Goldstein stationary condition is novel and presents an interesting direction for future exploration.

Weaknesses:
- The theoretical complexity improvement compared to state-of-the-art methods is unclear.
- The numerical experiments utilize relatively simple objective functions, and the choice of parameters appears arbitrary.
- The design of the zeroth-order estimator may incur higher computational costs due to the requirement of sampling orthogonal matrices.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the theoretical complexity comparison by providing the exact formula of C in Corollary 1 and discussing the complexity in terms of function evaluations rather than iterations. Additionally, including a table that explicitly lists the complexity of function evaluations for this work and related works would enhance understanding. The authors should also address the questions regarding the motivation for fixing \( l \) while varying \( G \), the structure of the chosen directions in Algorithm 1, and the implications of varying \( l \) during iterations. Finally, expanding the numerical experiments to include more complex functions and providing insights on the choice of \( l \) would strengthen the paper.
