Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel strategy for evaluating time series imputation methods by focusing on their impact on downstream forecasting tasks rather than solely on the accuracy of imputed values. The authors propose a similarity-based method to efficiently estimate the effects of imputed values on task performance and develop a framework that integrates various imputation strategies. Additionally, the authors discuss the mathematical foundations of their approach, including a modification of Lemma 1, which illustrates the intuition behind their work. They analyze the performance of MSE loss functions with SGD and ADAM optimizers, emphasizing the impact of monotonic intervals on approximation accuracy. The paper also addresses concerns regarding the use of future data for evaluation and the approximation of the pseudo-inverse.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper shifts the evaluation criterion to the performance of imputed data in subsequent forecasting tasks, addressing a significant gap in the field.
2. The proposed similarity-based method balances performance and computational cost, effectively estimating the impact of imputed values.
3. The authors provide documented code for reproducibility and thorough theoretical analysis supported by extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets.
4. The authors clearly define Lemma 1 and its implications, and they include experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of their method, even with limited future data.
5. The computational complexity of the proposed method is reported to be manageable.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed method's motivation is unclear, particularly regarding the value of evaluating missing labels in downstream tasks and the optimality of combining existing methods.
2. The experimental section lacks clarity, making it difficult to follow, especially regarding the setup and results.
3. Reviewers express concerns about the mathematical rigor of Lemma 1, suggesting it may be trivial or incorrect under certain conditions.
4. The evaluation criteria based on binary comparisons may not reflect real-world applications, where differences in prediction errors can be marginal.
5. The current Appendix B may mislead readers by resembling a proof, which could be clarified.
6. The approximation of $A^\dagger A$ to the identity matrix lacks a theoretical guarantee, raising concerns about its validity.
7. The method appears to be more suitable for high-frequency data, potentially limiting its applicability to low-frequency datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental section, ensuring that setups and results are well-justified and easy to follow. Additionally, the authors should discuss the computational efficiency of their approach compared to traditional methods, especially for large-scale datasets. We suggest that the authors provide a more comprehensive evaluation by including recent imputation methods and discussing the limitations of their model, particularly in relation to multivariate time series and low-frequency datasets. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors enhance the mathematical rigor of Lemma 1 by addressing the concerns raised regarding its assumptions and implications, specifically clarifying the definitions of $\epsilon$, $\delta$, and $\epsilon_2$. To address the lack of theoretical guarantees regarding the approximation in Section 2.3, we recommend adding an ablation study comparing the error of this approximation between non-smooth and smooth time series. Lastly, please clarify whether the reported errors are absolute or relative, and consider including relative error results for completeness.
