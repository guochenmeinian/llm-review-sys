### Key Points
This paper presents advancements in dense subgraph discovery (DSD), focusing on the densest subhypergraph problem (ADSH) and the densest supermodular subset (DSS) problem. The authors propose a strongly-local exact algorithm for ADSH and a strongly-polynomial exact algorithm for DSS, which is a significant contribution given the complexity of hypergraphs. The paper also discusses the utility of these algorithms through computational experiments on synthetic and real-world hypergraphs, demonstrating their effectiveness in various applications, including web graph mining.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces novel algorithms that advance the state-of-the-art in hypergraph analysis.
- The theoretical contributions are substantial, particularly the development of a strongly-local exact algorithm for ADSH and a strongly-polynomial exact algorithm for DSS.
- The experimental evaluation is convincing, showcasing the applicability of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The presentation of contributions could be clearer; a concise summary or table of theoretical advancements would enhance clarity.
- The experimental section lacks comprehensive comparisons, particularly with existing algorithms for dense sub(hyper)graph discovery and scenarios involving arbitrary node weights.
- Some theoretical descriptions are ambiguous or inaccurate, particularly regarding the definitions and constraints of the problems discussed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by elaborating on the unique challenges posed by hypergraphs compared to standard graphs. Additionally, incorporating visual aids and concrete examples throughout the paper would enhance comprehension, especially for novice readers. The experimental section should be expanded to include comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms and address the performance of the proposed methods on standard graphs. Clarifying the relationship between empirical findings and theoretical claims, particularly regarding Theorem 2, would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, we suggest refining the writing for clarity and addressing minor comments regarding references and definitions to improve overall presentation.
