Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents CycleNet, a method for unpaired image-to-image translation that integrates cycle consistency into diffusion models. The authors aim to enhance image manipulation and provide a consistent interface for this task. They also introduce a multi-domain I2I translation dataset that includes object state changes. The paper claims to produce high-quality translation results and demonstrates the method's ability to generalize to out-of-domain tasks through text prompts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of cycle consistency into diffusion models is a reasonable and interesting approach for training unpaired I2I translation models.
2. The paper includes a comprehensive evaluation of CycleNet's performance using various quantitative metrics, supporting its claims.
3. The authors present a new multi-domain I2I translation dataset for object state changes, which is a valuable contribution.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the work is limited, as the concept of combining cycle consistency with diffusion models has been widely explored in existing literature.
2. The experimental results are often low-quality, with no significant improvement over existing methods like CycleGAN, particularly in classic tasks such as winter-to-summer and horse-to-zebra translations.
3. The paper lacks a comprehensive comparative analysis with other cycle-consistency-based diffusion models, and the results presented raise questions about their validity.
4. There are issues with variable notation that could hinder reader understanding, and the authors do not sufficiently explain certain aspects of their methodology, such as the negative prompt.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by clearly distinguishing CycleNet from existing methods and providing a more thorough comparative analysis with other diffusion models. Additionally, we suggest conducting user studies to evaluate the subjective quality and usability of CycleNet, which would enhance the understanding of its practical effectiveness. Furthermore, the authors should address the hue-shifting issue observed in the results and provide clearer definitions for variable notations to aid reader comprehension. Lastly, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the computational efficiency of CycleNet, including training and inference times, to better assess its applicability in real-world scenarios.
