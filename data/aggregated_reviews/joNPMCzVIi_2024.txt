Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-task learning problem and proposes a hierarchical Bayesian (HB) bandit approach, where the agent maintains a meta-posterior distribution over hyperparameters of within-task bandit problems. It examines both sequential and concurrent settings for Gaussian Linear bandits and Semi Bandits. The authors improve the existing gap-independent Bayes regret bound of HierTS from \(O(m \sqrt{n \log n \log (mn)})\) to \(O(mn\log n)\) for infinite action sets and introduce a new algorithm, HierBayesUCB, for finite action sets with a gap-dependent \(O(m \log n \log (mn))\) regret bound. Additionally, they extend these algorithms to multi-task Gaussian combinatorial semi-bandit settings, deriving regret bounds of \(O(m \sqrt{n} \log n)\) and \(O(m \log (mn \log n))\). The authors propose a novel strategy that transforms the multi-task Bayes regret into an intermediate regret upper bound involving the posterior variance, leading to a smaller multiplicative factor compared to previous work. They leverage a new Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and a positive semi-definite matrix diagonalization technique to achieve tighter bounds. The authors also acknowledge the need to clarify in the introduction and abstract that they consider coherent cases of semi-bandit problems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper's contribution is significant and novel, improving the regret bound for HierTS in infinite action settings.  
2. It proposes a new algorithm for finite action cases.  
3. The extension of these algorithms to semi-bandit settings with state-of-the-art regret bounds is a notable advancement.  
4. The authors provide a clear and detailed explanation of their novel approach to improving regret bounds.  
5. The use of new techniques, such as the Cauchy-Schwartz inequality and matrix diagonalization, demonstrates a strong mathematical foundation.  
6. The authors are receptive to feedback and committed to enhancing the paper's clarity and quality.

Weaknesses:  
1. The introduction lacks a concise description of the technical novelties that improve the HierTS regret bound.  
2. The assumption of at least \(n\)-round interaction requires clarification.  
3. The algorithms' selection process for the task set \(\mathcal{S}_t\) is unclear.  
4. Definitions for \(\hat{\mu}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}\) in Algorithm 1 are not provided until later.  
5. The implications of the order of \(V_{m,n}\) on the regret bound need further discussion.  
6. The Gaussian assumption for noise is restrictive and should be addressed, as it limits broader applicability.  
7. There is a lack of real-world dataset experiments to assess the robustness of the algorithms.  
8. The paper lacks explicit mention of coherent cases of semi-bandit problems in the introduction and abstract, which may lead to misunderstandings about the scope of their work.  
9. Some reviewers feel there are unexplored directions within the current setup that could enhance the paper further.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by clearly articulating the technical novelties that enhance the HierTS regret bound and addressing why previous analyses were insufficient. Clarifying the necessity of the \(n\)-round interaction assumption and how it is ensured in the algorithm is essential. Additionally, the authors should specify how the algorithms select the task set \(\mathcal{S}_t\) at each time \(t\). Definitions for \(\hat{\mu}\) and \(\hat{\sigma}\) should be included earlier in the text. The authors must discuss the implications of the order of \(V_{m,n}\) on the regret bound in the main body of the paper. We also suggest including real-world dataset experiments to evaluate the algorithms' robustness against model misspecification and to validate the theoretical results. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors improve the introduction and abstract by explicitly stating that they consider coherent cases of semi-bandit problems. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the interesting directions mentioned by reviewers to enrich the current setup and enhance the overall impact of the paper.
