### Key Points
This paper presents PEAR (Position-Embedding-Agnostic attention Re-weighting), a novel method aimed at enhancing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in large language models (LLMs) through a two-stage process. The approach first identifies "RAG-suppression heads" via a proxy task, followed by learning re-weighting coefficients to mitigate their negative impact. The authors propose that PEAR offers zero inference overhead, broad applicability across various positional encoding schemes (RoPE, Alibi, learned PEs), and improved RAG performance without sacrificing model efficiency or knowledge capabilities. However, the work would benefit from a deeper theoretical analysis and broader evaluation across different model scales and tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The two-stage approach for discovering RAG-suppression heads and learning coefficients is clearly articulated.
- PEAR's position-embedding-agnostic nature enhances its applicability across different models.
- The method demonstrates improved RAG performance in QA settings across multiple models, outperforming recent baselines in terms of accuracy and efficiency.
- The optimization phase for re-weighting coefficients is effective for low-resource scenarios due to mostly frozen LLM parameters.

Weaknesses:
- The paper does not address whether the copy-suppression head phenomenon persists at larger model scales, such as 70B, which warrants testing.
- There is a lack of discussion regarding potential negative impacts on model capabilities beyond MMLU, with no evaluation on additional benchmarks like mathematical reasoning or coding.
- The implications of re-weighting heads on downstream interpretability and debuggability are not explored.
- The theoretical analysis of why certain heads become RAG-suppression heads is limited, complicating predictions for generalization to new architectures.
- The evaluation is restricted to QA tasks, lacking diversity in task types.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of RAG-suppression heads to derive patterns beyond their existence. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the method on larger models to confirm the persistence of the suppression phenomenon. Expanding the evaluation to include diverse tasks beyond QA, such as web-based datasets or open-domain question answering, would enhance the applicability of the proposed method. Furthermore, we suggest investigating the potential side effects of weight adjustments on other model performance aspects and conducting an ablation study on the proxy task sample sizes to strengthen the experimental design. Lastly, clarifying the rationale behind the selection of contextual positions in experiments would benefit the overall understanding of the method's robustness.
