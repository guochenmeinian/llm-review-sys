### Key Points
This paper introduces a tool called Interactive Semantic Intervention (ISI), designed to assist researchers in understanding and enhancing the performance of Visual Language Models (VLMs) in multimodal tasks, particularly addressing issues like "hallucination" in Visual Question Answering (VQA). The ISI tool allows users to perform semantic interventions on image and text inputs, enabling the detection of model responses to input changes and quantifying output uncertainty. This approach offers new insights into multimodal information integration and lays a foundation for improving model robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The ISI tool provides a novel method for observing VLM behavior through adjustments to image and text inputs.  
- It incorporates metrics like Semantic Entropy to quantify uncertainty in VLM outputs, enhancing the assessment of the model's decision-making process.

Weaknesses:  
- The tool's focus on closed-ended VQA tasks may limit its applicability to more complex, open-ended question-answering scenarios, potentially restricting comprehensive performance testing across diverse tasks.  
- The interference methods are relatively limited, primarily addressing static image and text disturbances; dynamic disturbances could enrich the understanding of VLM performance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the tool's efficiency by enhancing automation, potentially integrating components like LLM-as-a-Judge for expedited problem detection. Additionally, we suggest demonstrating the practical application of the ISI tool by conducting a simple experiment that illustrates how the analysis results can lead to tangible improvements in VLM behavior. This could help readers better envision the tool's potential impact.
