### Key Points
This paper presents a method to study the correlation between supernovae and star formation dynamics, leveraging machine learning to enhance and expedite galaxy formation research. The authors propose a three-step approach: preprocessing physical quantities from supernovae, model formulation using a 3D U-Net, and post-processing via Gibbs sampling. While the paper addresses a significant scientific issue, the motivation for certain methodological choices is insufficiently detailed, and a comparison with existing literature is notably absent.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper tackles a critical issue in star formation simulation.
- The adoption of a surrogate model approach could significantly accelerate research in galaxy formation.

Weaknesses:
- The results are not comprehensively discussed, particularly regarding the model's generalization to unseen physical quantities.
- There is a lack of quantitative and qualitative comparison with state-of-the-art methods.
- The rationale for employing the U-Net and Gibbs sampling is not well articulated.
- Figure 4 is incomplete, lacking results for analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation for their methodological choices, particularly regarding the U-Net and Gibbs sampling. Additionally, the authors should include a "Related Works" section to contextualize their contributions within existing literature. The evaluation section needs to be more organized, providing details on the dataset, training-validation splitting, U-Net hyperparameters, and sensitivity analysis. Furthermore, we suggest discussing the results in greater detail to address questions about model generalization and training duration. Lastly, improvements to figure captions and corrections to metrics and figures are necessary for clarity.
