Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an algorithm for $(\varepsilon, \delta)$-differentially private linear regression that is robust to label corruption. The authors propose a variant of Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) that incorporates a new adaptive clipping technique, achieving improved sample complexity compared to previous methods. The algorithm operates efficiently under Gaussian and heavy-tailed noise conditions, with a focus on sub-Gaussian data distributions. The authors validate their approach through empirical results on synthetic datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically solid and addresses an important topic in machine learning.
- The analysis methods are original, and the contributions are clearly articulated.
- The proposed algorithm demonstrates improved sample complexity and robustness to label corruption.

Weaknesses:
- There remains a polynomial dependence on the condition number, raising concerns about the significance of the improvement.
- The focus on specific distribution requirements and label corruption limits generalizability.
- The experimental results are presented in a simplistic manner, hindering interpretation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the generalizability of their results by exploring cases beyond the specific distribution and label corruption scenarios. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the presentation of experimental results to provide a more comprehensive representation of the data, rather than relying solely on a single figure. Clarifying the novelty of their proof of the lower bound in Proposition 3.9 compared to existing literature would also strengthen the paper. Finally, addressing the potential to suppress the dependence on the condition number would be beneficial.
