Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical and empirical analysis of different DP-SGD minibatch sampling schemes, specifically focusing on Poisson subsampling and its implementation via a truncation-based approach. The authors propose a variant of Poisson sub-sampling with an effective constant batch size and derive new lower bounds for the privacy accounting of both shuffled and truncated Poisson-sampling-based DP-SGD. The empirical results indicate that while shuffling performs better in terms of AUC for the same noise multiplier, Poisson sampling offers superior performance for the same privacy budget.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant gap in DP-SGD literature with a principled approach.
- It clearly demonstrates the advantages of Poisson sampling over shuffling with accurate privacy accounting.
- The implementation of Poisson sampling within typical ML pipeline constraints is well-articulated, enhancing privacy-utility trade-offs.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the work is limited as it builds heavily on previous findings by Lynn et al. and the extension to multi-epoch settings is relatively straightforward.
- There is insufficient discussion on configuring Truncated Poisson parameters and the analysis of privacy loss is not rigorous enough.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of the various privacy analyses to the upper bounds provided by existing literature, such as those by Feldman et al. Additionally, the authors should quantify the gap between Poisson sampling and Truncated Poisson sampling regarding the noise multiplier. A simple procedure for configuring Truncated Poisson parameters should be included, detailing how to optimize sampling probabilities based on expected signal-to-noise ratios. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to explore whether the findings hold beyond the 1- and 5-epoch regimes and to clarify the notations distinguishing upper and lower bounds in the analysis.
