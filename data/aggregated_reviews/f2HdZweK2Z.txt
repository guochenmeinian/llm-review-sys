### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for semantic annotation of numeric data in tabular formats, specifically addressing mixed-unit data scenarios. The authors propose the MixedSAND method, which builds on the SAND approach, incorporating clustering of column values based on Bray-Curtis distance to separate different measurement units. The paper also introduces a benchmark dataset with varying difficulty levels for mixed-unit numeric column annotation, demonstrating promising experimental results compared to existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in semantic integration of numeric data.
- It provides a well-structured discussion of design choices and context.
- The evaluation shows that MixedSAND outperforms baseline methods on mixed-unit datasets.
- The introduction of a benchmark dataset is a valuable contribution to the field.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a thorough discussion of limitations and error analysis.
- There is insufficient clarity on the concept of "semantic types" and the metric of reflectivity.
- The reproducibility of results is hindered by the absence of available resources for code and data.
- MixedSAND's performance appears to drop on single-unit columns compared to SAND, raising questions about its generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the introduction by providing clearer intuition on "semantic types." Additionally, consider explaining the adaptability of the methods and the rationale behind using reflectivity as a metric. It would be beneficial to include a discussion on the limitations of the current approach and conduct an error analysis of the results. We suggest providing resources for reproducing the results and clarifying the performance discrepancies between MixedSAND and SAND on single-unit columns. Finally, addressing the potential impact of clustering errors on final annotations would enhance the paper's robustness.
