Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an explanatory model for transfer-based attacks (TBAs), formalizing two popular intuitions and specifying a hypothesis class \( F_M \). The authors propose that both source and target models originate from \( F_M \), elucidating the properties of TBAs. Additionally, the paper introduces a manifold attack model that categorizes adversarial examples into on-manifold and off-manifold examples, explaining their transferability, particularly when the source model is inaccurate. The authors have also engaged constructively with reviewer feedback, addressing concerns and questions in their rebuttal.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is technically solid, featuring rigorous mathematical proofs and a novel approach to formalizing semantic and geometric information, which simplifies analysis and may benefit related fields like transfer learning.
- It provides a theoretical framework that clarifies the properties of TBAs, based on milder assumptions than previous works, and discusses the expressive power of the proposed model.
- The authors demonstrate responsiveness to reviewer feedback, which is reflected in the increased score from one reviewer, and the rebuttal effectively addresses some of the reviewers' concerns.

Weaknesses:
- The main results in Section 4 are poorly organized, potentially confusing readers unfamiliar with the topic.
- The paper lacks quantitative analyses and does not sufficiently clarify how \( f_b \) and \( \phi \) control semantic and geometrical information, leaving their intuitions unclear.
- The applicability of the model is limited due to strong assumptions about specific forms of classifiers, which may not accurately represent neural networks.
- Not all concerns may have been fully resolved, as indicated by the partial resolution of issues for one reviewer.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the organization of Section 4 to enhance clarity for readers. Additionally, the authors should quantitatively discuss the roles of \( f_b \) and \( \phi \) in controlling semantic and geometrical information. To strengthen the applicability of the model, we suggest justifying the specific choices of semantic classifiers and concentration multipliers used in the propositions. Furthermore, conducting empirical experiments on synthetic datasets could provide valuable evidence for the model's effectiveness and applicability in practical scenarios. Lastly, addressing the assumptions regarding the classifier forms and their implications would enhance the paper's robustness. We also recommend that the authors ensure that all reviewer concerns are thoroughly addressed in future revisions and solicit specific feedback on any remaining issues to enhance the clarity and completeness of their rebuttal.
