### Key Points
This paper presents a framework named BOOST aimed at addressing the generative commonsense impotence problem in Pre-Trained Language Models (PLTMs). The authors propose a reference-free scorer to evaluate sentence commonsensicality and extend the controllable generation method NADO for commonsense generation. The contributions include: 1) a novel reference-free scorer, 2) the application of NADO to controllable commonsense generation, and 3) extensive experiments validating the proposed method's effectiveness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-structured and easy to follow, with clear illustrations of the proposed framework.  
2. The experiments are comprehensive and convincingly demonstrate the method's performance across various models and metrics.  
3. The introduction of the O-score as a reference-free evaluator is a significant contribution.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The method lacks novelty, as BOOST primarily applies NADO to commonsense generation without substantial innovation.  
2. There is insufficient comparison with instruction-tuned baselines, such as text-davinci-003 and flan-t5.  
3. Some experimental results are not convincing, and details in certain sections, particularly Section 2.3, are unclear.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their approach by providing more innovative elements beyond the application of NADO. Additionally, include comparisons with instruction-tuned models like text-davinci-003 and flan-t5 to strengthen the evaluation. Clarifying the utility of generated commonsense outputs for downstream tasks would enhance the significance of the work. Lastly, we suggest addressing the unclear details in Section 2.3 and providing more narrative in the rebuttal to explain results and comparisons comprehensively.
