### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach called MHP-DDP for modeling complex temporal dynamics among event sequences across multiple dimensions using Multivariate Hawkes Processes (MHPs). The authors propose a dependent Dirichlet process (DDP) that allows for flexible estimation of the excitation function through a mixture of scaled Beta distributions. Two algorithms, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI), are introduced for implementing the MHP-DDP model, with simulations demonstrating that MHP-DDP outperforms benchmark methods in terms of lower estimation error, particularly highlighting the computational efficiency of the SVI algorithm.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a flexible and adaptable model for MHPs, enhancing information sharing across dimensions and improving excitation function estimation.  
- The SVI algorithm is noted for its computational efficiency and scalability to large datasets.  
- A comprehensive evaluation of the model is conducted through simulations, showing superior performance in estimation accuracy.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks a deeper analysis of the MHP-DDP model's limitations and potential drawbacks, including assumptions that may affect performance.  
- The theoretical properties of the MHP-DDP model are not sufficiently elaborated, particularly in comparison to existing models.  
- Validation of the model's performance is limited to synthetic datasets; real-world applications or case studies are not considered.  
- Details regarding the simulations, including the number of data points, evaluation metrics, and underlying assumptions, are insufficient.  
- The motivation behind the proposed approach and its divergence from existing methodologies require further clarification.  
- Scalability tests of the SVI algorithm on larger datasets are not discussed.  
- There is a typo in “RMISE,” which should be clarified as "Root Mean Integrated Squared Error (RMISE)."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the limitations and potential drawbacks of the MHP-DDP model, addressing assumptions that may impair its performance. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the theoretical properties of the MHP-DDP model and comparing it with existing literature. To enhance validation, please consider utilizing real-world applications or case studies and outline plans for future research. We request more comprehensive details regarding the simulations, including the number of data points analyzed and the specific metrics applied for evaluation. Furthermore, please clarify the motivation behind the proposed approach and how it diverges from existing methodologies. Discussing the scalability of the SVI algorithm concerning data size and dimensional complexity, along with tests on larger datasets, would also be beneficial. Lastly, we ask for correction of the typo regarding “RMISE.”
