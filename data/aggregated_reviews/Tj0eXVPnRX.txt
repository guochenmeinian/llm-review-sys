Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical model for understanding the learning dynamics of temporal difference (TD) learning, particularly focusing on batch TD(0) for policy evaluation. The authors propose the Gaussian Equivalence Conjecture, suggesting that TD learning curves can be modeled using Gaussian features. They explore how various factors, such as learning rate annealing and reward shaping, influence learning dynamics, providing insights into the complexity of policy evaluation tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study advances the understanding of TD learning dynamics, offering a novel perspective.
- It introduces a creative analytical tool for examining TD methods.
- The exposition of related works is commendable, and the paper is well-motivated and clearly articulated.
- Claims are carefully supported without overstatements, and the experiments are interesting and well-designed.

Weaknesses:
- The experiments do not clarify whether the features adequately represent the remaining time in finite horizon tasks.
- The rationale for comparing fixed and annealing learning rates is unclear.
- The Gaussian equivalence assumption is not sufficiently validated across diverse feature constructions and environments, raising concerns about its general applicability.
- The connection to least-squares TD methods is inadequately addressed, and the theoretical results lack clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the representation of remaining time in features for finite horizon tasks. Additionally, we suggest providing a more robust justification for the comparison between fixed and annealing learning rates. To strengthen the Gaussian equivalence conjecture, the authors should include results from various feature constructions and environments. Furthermore, we advise a clearer explanation of the theoretical results and a more explicit connection to least-squares TD methods to enhance the paper's contribution to the literature.
