Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Deep Equilibrium Algorithmic Reasoner (DEAR), which utilizes deep equilibrium models (DEQs) to address algorithmic tasks in CLRS30. The authors propose a method that directly solves for equilibrium solutions, diverging from traditional recurrent structures in neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR). The paper demonstrates that DEAR achieves improved out-of-distribution generalization and inference speed compared to previous state-of-the-art methods, although accuracy results are mixed.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation for the proposed method is clear, and the paper is well-written and polished.
- The experiments are thorough, showing encouraging results on benchmark datasets.
- DEAR improves performance on several algorithms and enhances inference speed.

Weaknesses:
- The results are mixed, with some algorithms experiencing significant performance drops.
- The connection between denotational semantics and the proposed architecture lacks clarity.
- Section 4 is notation-heavy and difficult to understand, which may hinder comprehension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Section 4 to better connect denotational semantics with the proposed algorithm. Additionally, consider providing more background on domain theory to enhance readability. It may also be beneficial to include real-world experiments to demonstrate the practical applicability of DEAR. Furthermore, we suggest re-evaluating the performance of DEAR on larger graph sizes and addressing the potential conflict with domain theory regarding equilibrium points. Lastly, consider employing Jacobian-free backpropagation for training DEQ models to enhance stability.
