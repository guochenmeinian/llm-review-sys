Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of the strategic facility location problem, focusing on the design of strategyproof mechanisms that utilize machine-learned predictions of agents' preferred locations. The authors aim to minimize the egalitarian social cost, measured by the maximum distance between agent locations and the facility. They establish lower bounds on consistency and robustness in both one-dimensional and two-dimensional settings, demonstrating that even with strong predictions, certain trade-offs exist. The paper also explores a new setup where mechanisms have access to the identities of extreme agents, achieving specific consistency and robustness metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a relevant and natural problem, providing accessible mechanisms that are easy to follow.
- The writing is clear and well-structured, making the theoretical results valuable for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The focus is primarily on lower bounds, with limited positive results, mainly derived from the centroid mechanism applied to extreme agents.
- Some proofs are terse and challenging to follow; for instance, a diagram could enhance the clarity of the proof for Theorem 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the proofs, possibly by including diagrams to illustrate complex concepts, such as the Pythagorean inequality in the proof of Theorem 2. Additionally, we suggest adding a discussion or reference to explain why the one-dimensional lower bound does not extend to two dimensions. Furthermore, considering results related to total social cost alongside the egalitarian cost could strengthen the paper's contributions.
