### Key Points
This paper investigates the impact of scaling and instruction tuning on the attention distributions of large language models (LLMs) and their alignment with human attention, quantified through Jensen-Shannon divergence. The authors find that scaling improves the similarity of model attention to human attention, while instruction tuning reduces this similarity. The study employs a unique dataset derived from human eye-tracking data, comparing attention patterns between first language (L1) and second language (L2) English speakers.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper presents an intriguing finding that challenges the assumption that instruction tuning enhances self-attention distributions in LLMs.
2. It reveals that LLM attention distributions are closer to those of non-native speakers than native speakers, suggesting new research avenues.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks engagement with relevant literature on the relationship between human attention and model attention, particularly regarding cognitive processes in reading comprehension.
2. It does not provide a detailed analysis of the differences between L1 and L2 speakers, focusing only on trivial pattern reliance without exploring underlying causes.
3. The term "human attention" is used ambiguously without proper definition or situating within existing psychophysical literature.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their engagement with the literature on human attention, particularly studies that relate model attention to cognitive processes in reading. Additionally, clarify the definition of "human attention" used in the analysis to enhance reader understanding. We suggest providing a more detailed analysis of the differences between L1 and L2 speakers, moving beyond trivial pattern reliance to explore deeper implications. Lastly, we advise against using the term "prove" in the context of their findings, as it does not align with scientific inquiry.
