Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the expressive power and trainability of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) using mean-field theory. The authors adapt this theory to analyze the behavior of randomly initialized FNOs, focusing on the transition between ordered and chaotic phases, which reveals unique characteristics influenced by mode truncation. They establish a correlation between expressive power and trainability, indicating that the ordered and chaotic phases correspond to regions of vanishing and exploding gradients, respectively. The authors emphasize the importance of initializing FNOs near the edge of chaos for stable training, supported by comprehensive experiments across various PDE-solving tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. **Theoretical Novelty:** The adaptation of mean-field theory for FNOs extends existing theories from other neural network architectures.
2. **Practical Implications:** The findings provide concrete recommendations for initializing FNOs to ensure stable training, particularly for deep networks.
3. **Comprehensive Experiments:** The validation of theoretical results through multiple PDE-solving tasks demonstrates practical relevance.

Weaknesses:
1. The adaptation of mean-field theory to FNOs may not significantly advance the field.
2. The significance of similarities between FNOs and CNNs requires further discussion.
3. The main text lacks sufficient experimental results and practical application discussions.
4. The paper's focus on expressivity at initialization is limited, and a broader stability analysis could enhance its contribution.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by reorganizing sections for better readability, particularly in the technical parts. For instance, introduce the covariance matrix $\Sigma_{\alpha,\alpha'}^{(l)}$ where it is first examined and include Lemma A.1 in the main text. Additionally, provide further motivation for key concepts and reference previous works appropriately. We suggest conducting an ablation study to explore the impact of the optimizer and learning rate on results. Furthermore, a more detailed analysis of the effects of different Fourier modes and error propagation in time-dependent PDEs would strengthen the work. Lastly, addressing the practical implications of their findings for shallower FNOs would enhance the paper's relevance.
