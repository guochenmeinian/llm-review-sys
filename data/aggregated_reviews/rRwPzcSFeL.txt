### Key Points
This paper presents TrueTeacher, a method designed to enhance factual consistency evaluation in summarization by generating extensive training data. TrueTeacher employs various summarization models to create large-scale machine-generated summaries, which are then annotated for factual consistency using a 540B large language model (LLM). The method is characterized as a distillation approach, where the 540B LLM serves as a teacher model for a smaller 11B T5 model. Empirical findings indicate that models trained with TrueTeacher and ANLI data achieve state-of-the-art results on the TRUE benchmark and demonstrate effectiveness in out-of-domain and multilingual settings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- TrueTeacher is a simple, effective method that significantly improves factual consistency evaluation in summarization.
- The paper includes detailed comparisons and ablation studies, showcasing TrueTeacher's superiority over other methods and its generalizability across different scenarios.
- The promise of releasing 1.4M generated data could be beneficial for the research community.

Weaknesses:
- The technical contribution is limited, as the method resembles existing distillation approaches in NLP, which have been previously explored.
- The labeling prompt mechanism is relatively simplistic and may inherit limitations from traditional NLI methods without adequately addressing them.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the abstract to provide better context for first-time readers. Additionally, we suggest elaborating on the claim regarding TrueTeacher+ANLI outperforming the 540B LLM, particularly considering the zero-shot nature of the latter. It would be beneficial to include details about the filtering mechanisms applied to LLM-labeled synthetic data and to clarify the choice of closely-related NLI tasks for teacher model instruction fine-tuning. Finally, addressing the differences in summary distribution and label correctness in a controlled manner would enhance the analysis presented in Section 4.3.
