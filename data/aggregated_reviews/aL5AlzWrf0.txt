### Key Points
This paper presents a review of hardware-friendly learning methods for implicit models, emphasizing their relevance in addressing challenges associated with hardware implementations, such as the weight-transport problem. The authors propose a unified optimization framework that formalizes critical constraints faced by novel hardware accelerators compared to general-purpose computers like GPUs. The discussion is contextualized within a substantial body of relevant literature.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is conceptually and mathematically clear and concise, providing a unified presentation of important methods. Its relevance to the workshop topic is significant, and it may serve as a foundation for future discussions on theoretical and empirical evidence in the field.

Weaknesses:  
While the paper addresses scaling issues, it may require further exploration of how alternative learning methods can compete with backpropagation at realistic problem sizes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on how alternative learning methods can effectively compete with backpropagation, particularly in terms of addressing scaling issues. Additionally, expanding on the implications of the unified optimization framework could enhance the paper's impact.
