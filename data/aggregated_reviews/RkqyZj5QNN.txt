### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to document-level sentiment classification using LLMs and in-context learning, specifically through prompting with examples that enable reasoning for accurate labeling. The prompt generates clue keywords related to sentiments and includes reasoning processes alongside final answers. The authors report state-of-the-art (SotA) scores in 4 out of 5 tasks, outperforming supervised fine-tuned results, and provide extensive discussions, including ablation studies and considerations for low-resource scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The design of the prompt, including examples, is well-executed and distinct from the Chain-of-Thought method.
- The experimental results demonstrate SotA scores in 4 out of 5 tasks, surpassing supervised fine-tuned results.
- The method effectively addresses low-resource settings and domain adaptability.
- The discussion of alternative labels is insightful.

Weaknesses:
- The concept of in-context learning has been previously proposed.
- The document-level classification task is perceived as overly simplistic and its application limited.
- The claim of being "annotation-free" is questionable due to reliance on kNN trained on a supervised dataset.
- There is insufficient analysis supporting the reasons for poor model performance in text classification tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the necessity of strong reasoning capabilities in the selected datasets. Additionally, we suggest providing stronger experimental support for the motivations outlined in the paper. It would also be beneficial to evaluate the method on open-source LLMs, such as Llama, and to clarify the essential differences between their method and CoT. Finally, addressing the concerns about the incremental nature of the improvements and the limitations of the document-level classification task would strengthen the paper.
