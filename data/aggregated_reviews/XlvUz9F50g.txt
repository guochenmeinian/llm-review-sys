Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel adaptive learning rate framework, termed Stability-Penalty-Bias (SPB) matching, for the Follow-the-Regularized-Leader (FTRL) algorithm, targeting online learning problems characterized by a minimax regret of Î˜(T^{2/3}). The authors propose a Best-of-Both-Worlds (BOBW) algorithm framework that achieves optimality in both stochastic and adversarial regimes, demonstrating its utility through applications to partial monitoring and graph bandits. The proposed framework improves upon existing regret bounds, achieving O(log T) in the stochastic setting and O(T^{2/3}) in the adversarial setting.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- **Clear structure**: The paper is well-organized, detailing the learning rate framework, algorithmic framework, and applications.
- **Innovative Approach**: The SPB-matching learning rate simplifies adaptive learning rate design for complex online learning problems and unifies BOBW guarantees.
- **Comprehensive study**: The paper addresses both stochastic and adversarial regimes, providing algorithms and theoretical guarantees.

Weaknesses:
- **Need for more background**: The authors should include an optimization problem aligned with (1) and clarify terms $z_t, h_t, u_t$ in the introduction.
- **Strong assumptions**: The assumptions in Theorem 7 are strong and may not hold for many hard problems; more discussion on these assumptions is needed.
- **Practical considerations**: The effectiveness of the SPB-matching framework relies on proper parameter tuning, and the lack of experimental validation raises questions about practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the background introduction by including an optimization problem aligned with (1) and providing explanations for the terms $z_t, h_t, u_t$. Additionally, the authors should discuss the strong assumptions in Theorem 7, clarifying their implications and identifying scenarios where they hold. To enhance practical applicability, we suggest including experimental validation to demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPB-matching framework. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to clarify the necessity of the condition $\gamma_t \ge u_t/\beta_t$ and provide a detailed comparison between the proposed algorithm and existing algorithms in works [26, 54].
