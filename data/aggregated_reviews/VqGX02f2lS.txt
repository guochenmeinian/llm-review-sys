### Key Points
This paper investigates the transferability of visually grounded PCFG (vc-PCFG) models by employing pretrained GloVe embeddings to address vocabulary mismatches across domains. The authors propose a modified model, tvc-PCFG, which utilizes frozen GloVe embeddings and domain-specific vocabulary during testing. Experiments reveal that while the method performs well in similar text domains, it struggles with remote domains. The paper includes extensive ablation studies, demonstrating that domain similarity and lexicon coverage significantly influence transfer performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses an interesting problem regarding cross-domain transfer of vc-PCFG models.
- Comprehensive experiments across various datasets and detailed error analysis are provided.
- The introduction of pretrained embeddings to alleviate vocabulary transfer issues is a novel contribution.

Weaknesses:
- The focus on a specific model's transferability may limit broader interest in the findings.
- The paper can be challenging to follow for readers unfamiliar with the original vc-PCFG work.
- The contributions are perceived as somewhat incremental, as similar conclusions have been observed in previous research.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper, particularly for readers not well-versed in the original vc-PCFG framework. Consider providing clearer definitions and explanations for terms such as "c-PCFG" and "PERM baseline." Additionally, we suggest addressing the questions raised regarding the performance discrepancies observed in the experiments, particularly concerning the use of GloVe embeddings and the implications of vocabulary size limitations. Finally, enhancing the presentation of figures and tables for better readability would be beneficial.
