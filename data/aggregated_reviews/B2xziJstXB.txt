### Key Points
This paper presents a study on "Global News Synchrony During the Start of the COVID-19 Pandemic," addressing the systematic analysis of global news coverage through a novel NLP methodology. The authors utilize a dataset of 60 million news articles across 10 languages to measure synchrony and diversity in news coverage, revealing insights into media agenda-setting and international relations. However, the paper lacks a mathematical formulation, leading to vague technical details and an uninspiring study with foreseeable results.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The analysis of 60 million news articles in 10 languages is impressive and addresses significant challenges in the global news ecosystem.
- The proposed methods are solid and rigorously evaluated, facilitating long-term analyses and providing valuable data for academics and media monitoring agencies.
- Findings regarding the correlation between cultural diversity and news coverage are noteworthy.
- The paper is exceptionally well-written and clear.

Weaknesses:
- The lack of mathematical formulation results in vague technical details, diminishing overall understanding.
- The study's results are somewhat predictable, lacking a genuine scientific contribution.
- The relationship between news synchrony and diversity is unclear, and the implications of the findings are not well articulated.
- Technical details, such as the transformer model and the complexity of the proposed method, require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the mathematical formulation to enhance understanding of the presented approach. Additionally, we suggest focusing on either news synchrony or diversity to streamline the manuscript, modifying the title and sections accordingly if diversity is retained. The authors should elaborate on the implications of their findings beyond understanding global news coverage and clarify the technical details of the transformer model and the complexity of their method. Finally, we encourage the authors to provide more justification for their choices regarding data filtering and the thresholds used to reduce the number of articles.
