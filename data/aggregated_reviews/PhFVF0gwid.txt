Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a theoretical framework for non-Markovian imitation learning using a hierarchical approach that employs Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM) to predict sequences of linear control gains based on state-action history. The method incorporates data augmentation through noise addition during both training and inference to mitigate covariate shift. The authors provide a rigorous theoretical analysis, leading to Theorem 1, which bounds the imitation performance. The applicability of the method is demonstrated through simulated robot tasks, although comparisons with prior work are lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel theoretical framework for imitation learning in nonlinear dynamical systems, ensuring accurate imitation through low-level controllers and a stochastic continuity property.
- The proposed data augmentation strategy is empirically validated, enhancing performance in simulated robotic manipulation tasks.
- The analysis is thorough, with clear definitions and derivations, contributing valuable insights to the field of imitation learning.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on synthesized or low-level stabilizing controllers limits the generalizability of the proposed framework to real-world scenarios.
- The paper lacks a detailed analysis of computational complexity and does not compare the proposed method to state-of-the-art techniques on benchmark datasets.
- The clarity of the presentation suffers due to complex notation and definitions, making it challenging to follow certain sections.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying the notation and ensuring that all symbols are consistently defined. Additionally, providing a comprehensive experimental evaluation with competitive baselines would strengthen the validity of the proposed algorithm. Including an analysis of the computational complexity of the algorithmic trick for ensuring total variation continuity is also essential. Finally, addressing the influence of hyperparameters and conducting an ablation study would enhance the understanding of the method's performance.
