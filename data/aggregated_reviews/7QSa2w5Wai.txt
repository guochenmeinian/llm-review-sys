### Key Points
This paper presents a model for cross-lingual event detection, utilizing a pre-trained multilingual language model to generate representations for source and target languages, and employs Langevin Dynamics to transition these representations. The authors claim that their method, RepTran, outperforms existing approaches on the ACE05 dataset. The paper also introduces a semantic preservation framework to retain event features during representation transition.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper leverages Langevin Dynamics for cross-lingual representation transition, marking a novel exploration of energy functions in information extraction and event detection.
- It achieves state-of-the-art performance across three languages and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model through experiments.
- The writing is clear, and the representation of ideas is well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The motivation for the proposed method is not convincingly articulated, particularly regarding how it addresses issues in previous works without losing discriminative features.
- There is a lack of comprehensive analysis and comparison with existing methods, leaving the validity of the proposed approach in question.
- The experimental evaluation is limited, focusing solely on the ACE05 dataset and neglecting other relevant datasets, which undermines the generalizability of the findings.
- The ablation study is insufficient, as it does not adequately explore critical components like the energy model and Langevin Dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their motivation by explicitly addressing how their method overcomes limitations of previous approaches. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods is necessary to validate the proposed approach. We suggest expanding the experimental evaluation to include other cross-lingual event detection datasets, such as ERE and MINION, to enhance generalizability. Furthermore, the authors should conduct a more comprehensive ablation study that examines the impact of both the energy model and Langevin Dynamics on performance. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the computational efficiency of their method, particularly regarding the additional costs associated with representation transition.
