### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive study that integrates various cross-lingual transfer techniques aimed at improving performance for low-resource languages. The authors propose a framework that includes few-shot learning, parameter-efficient finetuning (e.g., adaptor networks), and translate-train methods to generate synthetic training data. The empirical results demonstrate that these methods yield complementary performance benefits in downstream NLI tasks, emphasizing the value of combining multiple strategies to enhance model efficacy.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides empirical evidence supporting the viability and complementarity of low-resource strategies for cross-lingual transfer learning.
- It offers a valuable toolbox for integrating different transfer learning strategies, enhancing understanding of resourcefulness across various dimensions.
- The findings have significant implications for multilingual processing in resource-constrained environments.

Weaknesses:
- Many techniques explored are off-the-shelf, and the incremental nature of the study may limit its novelty.
- The focus on parameter-efficient models overlooks potential biases that could impact transfer outcomes.
- The presentation of experimental results lacks clarity, making it difficult to grasp the full scope of the experiments conducted.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the experimental setup by outlining the different experiments more explicitly. Additionally, consider analyzing biases in the resourcefulness of language models, as this could provide deeper insights into transfer outcomes. It would be beneficial to include diagrams in Section 3 to illustrate the evaluation strategies and to provide a clearer comparison of prior work in the abstract, possibly summarizing differences in a table or figure. Furthermore, we suggest revising Table 2 to focus on correlation analysis across techniques while controlling for resourcefulness, and enhancing visual presentation, such as using bar plots for better readability.
