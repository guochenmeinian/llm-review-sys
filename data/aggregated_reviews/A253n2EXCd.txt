Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a multi-mode token-level alignment framework for multi-modal prompt tuning, aimed at enhancing few-shot classification using CLIP-ViT-B/16. The authors propose a method that formulates prompt tuning as a hierarchical optimal transportation problem, demonstrating its effectiveness through extensive experiments on various image datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The method achieves superior results compared to baselines like CoOp and MaPLe across multiple datasets, showcasing its practical applicability.
- The paper is well-motivated and written, with clear experimental evaluations that demonstrate non-trivial improvements.
- The inclusion of code enhances reproducibility.

Weaknesses:
- The writing quality is inconsistent, with some sections difficult to follow and containing grammatical errors.
- The novelty of the approach is limited, as the concept of token-level alignment and optimal transportation has been previously explored.
- There is a lack of analysis regarding the computational costs associated with the proposed method, and the scalability on larger models remains unverified.
- The paper does not include ablation studies or detailed discussions on prompt length and quantity, which are crucial for understanding the method's effectiveness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and coherence of the writing, particularly in the introduction and background sections, to better convey the core ideas. Additionally, we suggest including a comprehensive analysis of the computational costs associated with the ALIGN method compared to baselines. The authors should also provide empirical results on fine-grained tasks, such as semantic segmentation, and conduct ablation studies to clarify the contributions of individual components. Finally, addressing the scalability of the method on larger models would strengthen the paper's contributions.
