Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on adaptive online convex optimization, focusing on adapting to unbounded domains and arbitrary time-varying comparator sequences. The authors propose a novel sparse coding framework that extends the scope of comparator adaptivity beyond traditional path-length to other priors. They demonstrate that an $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{E \cdot \text{Sparsity}_H})$ regret bound can be achieved, which not only recovers previous results but also enhances flexibility. The paper improves upon JC22 by replacing comparator-dependent terms in the regret bound with smaller ones. 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper makes significant contributions to adaptive online convex optimization, extending comparator adaptivity and achieving refined regret bounds. 
- The introduction of a sparse coding framework is innovative and enriches optimization theory, particularly with the Haar wavelet dictionary improving state-of-the-art results.

Weaknesses:  
- The presentation of technical results is unclear, making it difficult to verify correctness. Specific assumptions, such as the restriction of comparators to a single vector span, seem overly strong and trivialize key lemmas. 
- The paper relies heavily on existing works, and the proposed algorithm's improvement in dynamic regret needs clearer comparative results rather than just asymptotic bounds.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the technical results to facilitate understanding and verification. Specifically, provide an intuitive example of a dictionary that recovers the traditional path-length case and another that corresponds to a different prior. Additionally, clarify the implications of using the Fourier dictionary for periodic environments and ensure that Algorithms 3-5 are included in the main text to enhance flow. Lastly, address the potential performance issues related to user-defined subspaces and provide concrete examples to illustrate the advantages of the proposed bound with specific loss functions.
