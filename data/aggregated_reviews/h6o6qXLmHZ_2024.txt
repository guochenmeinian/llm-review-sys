Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for interpreting anomaly detection models, introducing the Segmentation Clustering Decision Tree (SCD-Tree) and Gaussian Boundary Delineation (GBD) algorithm. The authors propose a framework that segments high-dimensional data, integrates model predictions into decision criteria, and defines flexible boundaries to differentiate normal from anomalous data points. Evaluations across diverse datasets indicate that the method achieves superior explanation accuracy, fidelity, and robustness compared to existing approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The Gaussian boundary delineation algorithm effectively manages high-dimensional data and demonstrates robustness against data drift and perturbations.
2. The empirical study clearly showcases the proposed method's robustness and versatility across multiple datasets.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, with some technical concepts remaining unclear; for instance, a running example could elucidate the SCD tree and GBD algorithms.
2. The paper's structure, particularly the related work section, is disorganized, hindering the logical flow of discussion.
3. The method relies heavily on existing techniques without introducing substantial originality, and the evaluation could benefit from incorporating more advanced anomaly detection models and higher-dimensional datasets.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing by providing a running example to explain the SCD tree and GBD algorithms. Additionally, the authors should reorganize the related work section for better coherence. To enhance the evaluation, we suggest including comparisons with state-of-the-art deep anomaly detection models and testing the proposed method on datasets with significantly higher dimensions. Furthermore, a justification for using Gaussian Processes over other models, such as KDE, should be presented, along with an ablation study to demonstrate the benefits of boundary estimation. Lastly, we advise the authors to clarify the use of labeled data during calibration, potentially describing the method as 'weakly supervised' rather than 'unsupervised.'
