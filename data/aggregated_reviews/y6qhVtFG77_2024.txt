Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents NeuroBOLT, a transformer-based model that translates raw EEG data into comprehensive fMRI activity signals by utilizing multi-dimensional representation learning across temporal, spatial, and spectral domains. The authors demonstrate NeuroBOLT's effectiveness in reconstructing resting-state fMRI signals across various brain regions, including primary sensory and cognitive areas, using a dataset from 22 participants. The study evaluates the performance of the model in predicting fMRI signals from EEG data, claiming to use recommended parameter settings from prior studies and maintaining the same evaluation metrics, specifically the correlation coefficient (R values). The authors assert that their model outperforms previous studies and acknowledge the need for clearer terminology in their manuscript.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses a challenging topic in neuroscience with clear motivation and a logically sound experimental section.
2. The model and rationale are well-articulated, and the reported results are promising, with empirical evidence showing superior performance compared to previous studies.
3. The figures and tables are clear and well-organized, enhancing readability.
4. The authors plan to enhance the manuscript by including detailed mathematical descriptions of their model's components, which will clarify their methodology.

Weaknesses:
1. The title and method abbreviation are unclear, particularly regarding the 'BOLT' component.
2. The related work section lacks significant recent literature on fMRI-EEG, particularly from 2023 and 2024.
3. Inconsistencies in method descriptions and terminology hinder readability.
4. The writing style requires standardization, particularly in the notation of 'fMRI' and 'FMRI'.
5. The font size in tables is too small, making them difficult to read.
6. The paper lacks code or data for reproducibility.
7. Insufficient details on parameter selection for baseline methods are provided.
8. The equations and symbols lack standardization, necessitating clearer notation.
9. Statistical tests to validate method significance are absent.
10. The theoretical contribution appears weak for the NeurIPS community.
11. The significance of using 26 electrodes for fMRI reconstruction is unclear.
12. Equation 2 is incomplete.
13. The use of the term "robustness" may have caused confusion, which the authors intend to address in their revisions.
14. The evaluation of noise influence is acknowledged as an interesting future direction but is currently outside the paper's scope.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the title and method abbreviation to better reflect the content. The authors should enhance the related work section by incorporating relevant literature from recent years. We suggest standardizing the writing style and terminology throughout the manuscript. Additionally, increasing the font size in tables would improve readability. The authors must provide code and data to support reproducibility and include detailed explanations of parameter selection for baseline methods. We encourage the authors to standardize equations and symbols, and to conduct statistical tests to validate their findings. Clarifying the significance of using 26 electrodes and completing Equation 2 are also necessary. Furthermore, we recommend that the authors omit the term "robustness" in the revised manuscript and include formal mathematical notations for the Short-Time-Fourier-Transform (STFT) application, discuss the relationship between frequency feature dimensions and time-window length, and introduce the trade-off between temporal and frequency resolution in their model. Providing detailed demographic information, data sources, and IRB details in the updated manuscript is also encouraged.
