Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a new algorithm, CoBRA, aimed at assigning papers to peer reviewers while ensuring that assignments are within the core, thereby promoting interdisciplinary cooperation and preventing the formation of smaller, siloed conferences. The authors theoretically prove that CoBRA can generate valid assignments under certain conditions related to author preferences and empirically compare its performance against established algorithms, TPMS and PR4A, highlighting that the latter often violate core constraints. The paper concludes that a balance between these approaches may be beneficial.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of the core concept to peer review is a novel and interesting approach that addresses group fairness.
- The writing is generally clear, and the paper includes useful high-level descriptions and examples to aid understanding.
- The empirical evaluation, despite not outperforming other algorithms, provides valuable insights into the performance of CoBRA.

Weaknesses:
- The paper's assumptions, such as single authorship and the absence of conflicts of interest, limit its practical relevance.
- The claim of polynomial-time complexity for CoBRA lacks a formal proof, and the time complexity analysis is incomplete.
- The necessity and implications of achieving fairness in peer review are not well-motivated, and the optimality of CoBRA's assignments remains unproven.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of specific technical details and address grammatical issues throughout the paper. Additionally, we suggest providing a more comprehensive discussion on the practical implications of using CoBRA, particularly regarding the handling of imbalances in submissions across different research areas. Clarifying the time complexity of the algorithm and the rationale behind the core's significance in peer review assignments would enhance the paper's impact. Furthermore, consider expanding the model to include multiple authors and conflicts of interest to increase practical applicability.
