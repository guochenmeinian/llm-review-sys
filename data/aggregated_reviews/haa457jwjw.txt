Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study of Bandits with Knapsacks (BwK) in a piecewise stationary environment, proposing an algorithm that achieves a near-optimal competitive ratio against a dynamic benchmark, which is stronger than the stationary benchmarks typically used in adversarial BwK settings. The authors argue that their algorithm offers a unique perspective on online matching and inventory reservation, emphasizing the importance of knowing the reward-consumption ratio for optimal performance. They provide theoretical guarantees for both online matching and online learning problems, with results dependent on the ratio of rewards and costs. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their current experimental results and the need for further theoretical exploration.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing is clear and mostly easy to follow.
- The problem setup is relevant and well-motivated, bridging fully stochastic and fully adversarial environments.
- The theoretical results are solid and built on mild assumptions, providing insights into the algorithm's performance.
- The authors introduce a novel perspective on inventory reservation that enhances the understanding of the problem.
- They achieve a near-optimal competitive ratio in a non-stationary setting, which is a significant contribution.
- The response to reviewer comments demonstrates a willingness to clarify and improve the manuscript.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks sufficient technical novelty and strong theoretical results, with some reviewers questioning the significance of the competitive ratio derived.
- The algorithm design is not entirely novel, resembling existing methods in the literature, and may waste resources due to its fixed reservation policy.
- The algorithm's lack of adaptability may lead to resource wastage.
- Limited numerical experiments are presented, particularly for the learning problem, and comparisons are primarily made against a single baseline, specifically Immorlica et al. (2019), which may not be sufficiently convincing.
- The complexity of the analysis, particularly in Theorem 3.2, makes it challenging to follow.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the technical novelty of the algorithm design, possibly by refining the definition of $\eta$ to focus solely on the ratio of rewards to costs, as suggested in Zhou et al. (2008). Additionally, we encourage the authors to elaborate on the dynamic benchmark in relation to existing literature, particularly addressing how their approach differs from other online matching papers. We suggest improving the adaptability of their algorithm to reduce resource wastage by exploring more dynamic reservation policies. The authors should also consider expanding their numerical experiments to include comparisons with other relevant algorithms, such as those in Zhou et al. (2008), to strengthen their empirical validation. Clarifying the analysis in Theorem 3.2 and providing a more accessible overview of the methodology would enhance the paper's readability. Finally, incorporating more theoretical results and discussions in the next iteration would significantly improve the manuscript's depth.
