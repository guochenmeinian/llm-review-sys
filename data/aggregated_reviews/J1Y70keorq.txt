Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Strongly Adaptive Multimodal Online Conformal Prediction (SAMOCP) methodology, which constructs adaptive conformal prediction sets by integrating information from multiple learning models in dynamic environments. The authors propose an online multimodal conformal prediction method to address data distribution shifts, selecting the best model from multiple candidates to create prediction sets via strongly adaptive online learning. The performance is justified through comprehensive simulations and comparisons with baseline approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem studied is well-defined and of significant interest in the literature.
2. The proposed method is novel, with a clear presentation and comprehensive literature review.
3. The theoretical guarantee and numerical performance of the proposed approach are well presented, demonstrating advantages through extensive experiments compared to existing benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
1. The method appears to be a variant of SAOCP, with insufficient evidence to validate the superiority of SAMOCP compared to SAOCP, both theoretically and empirically.
2. The intuition behind the proposed algorithm in the dynamic environment is not sufficiently developed.
3. There are concerns regarding the theoretical analyses, particularly the meaning and implications of Theorems 1 and 3.
4. The method is reported to be slower compared to other benchmarks, necessitating a comprehensive computational complexity analysis.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the algorithm's intuition in dynamic environments, particularly regarding the retention of multiple experts as \(t\) increases. Additionally, we suggest exploring alternative choices for the weights defined in (6) and comparing them through numerical simulations. It would also be beneficial to provide a Complexity Analysis of the overall model and to clarify the theoretical implications of Theorems 1 and 3. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to address the distinction between "multimodal" and "multimodel" to avoid confusion, as well as to provide insights into how the method performs compared to retraining the non-conformal score after each update.
