### Key Points
This paper investigates the incorporation of cultural differences to enhance language transfer, particularly in the offensive language detection task. The authors propose using country information as a proxy for cultural features and employ an existing lexicon to compute offensive distance. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of these cultural features through experimental results, marking a novel approach compared to previous studies that primarily focused on linguistic differences.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and presents an interesting motivation for the research.
- It introduces new features related to cultural differences and offensive word distance, supported by experimental evidence.
- The logical structure effectively addresses the three research questions posed in the introduction.

Weaknesses:
- The interpretation of results, particularly in Table 3, is limited; cultural features show variable predictive power across different datasets, especially for Asian languages.
- The zero-shot transfer (ZST) process lacks detail regarding model fine-tuning, including training objectives and loss functions.
- Some arguments are insufficiently justified, such as the source of cultural dimension values and the assumptions behind the ZST's accuracy.
- Clarity issues exist in the terminology used, particularly regarding "predict language transfer."

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the interpretation of results in Table 3 by providing a more nuanced discussion of cultural feature effectiveness across various datasets. Additionally, please include more details on the ZST process, specifically how the model is fine-tuned and the assumptions made regarding its accuracy. Clarifying the terminology around "predict language transfer" would enhance understanding, and specifying the source of cultural dimension values is essential to address potential biases. Lastly, consider comparing your findings to newer state-of-the-art methods to demonstrate the generality of your proposed features.
