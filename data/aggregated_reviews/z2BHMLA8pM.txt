Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to deep Gaussian processes (DGPs) called thin and deep Gaussian processes (TDGP), which aims to address the diminishing signal issue associated with increasing layers in DGPs. The authors propose a hierarchical model that incorporates locally linear deformations of stationary kernels, allowing for improved modeling of non-stationary data. The paper includes synthetic examples and analyses on real-world datasets, demonstrating the advantages of TDGP over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and clearly structured, effectively connecting to related models and highlighting key contributions.
- Sections 4.1 and 4.2 articulate how TDGP enhances predictive performance, uncertainty quantification, and interpretability.
- The problem statement is well-motivated, with clear identification of limitations in existing techniques.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on the increase in variational parameters slowing down optimization lacks computational complexity details and empirical analysis of wall clock time.
- There is insufficient exploration of model stability and convergence with increased parameterization.
- The focus on the squared exponential (SE) kernel raises questions about the applicability of other kernels and their potential value.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the implications of not inducing a manifold and the significance of the triangle inequality in relation to interpretability. Additionally, we suggest providing a clearer explanation of the value of latent space plots and their interpretation for non-expert readers. It would be beneficial to include a deeper analysis of the model's behavior with varying depths and widths, as well as comparisons with state-of-the-art methods like the doubly stochastic variational inference scheme. Lastly, we encourage the authors to clarify which DGP model is referred to as "CDGP" and to ensure that all experimental results, including MRAE statistics, are reported consistently across datasets.
