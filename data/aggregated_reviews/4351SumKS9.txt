Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework and benchmark called CUBE to evaluate the cultural competence of text-to-image (T2I) models, focusing on cultural awareness and cultural diversity. The authors identify significant gaps in the cultural awareness of existing models and provide insights into the diversity of image outputs for under-specified prompts. The justification for the work is well-grounded in interdisciplinary research, and the benchmark is deemed original and useful.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a critical gap in T2I model evaluation concerning cultural competence.
- It combines structured knowledge bases and large language models, creating a robust evaluation framework.
- The methodology is extendable to other cultural regions and concepts, and the use of the Vendi score is noted as fair for this task.

Weaknesses:
- The choice of only eight countries for evaluation lacks clarity, and the selection process should be better justified.
- The dataset relies heavily on Google search results, raising concerns about the transparency and quality of the images collected.
- The paper lacks a dedicated "Limitations" section, which would enhance understanding of its constraints.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity around the selection criteria for the eight countries and provide a more detailed explanation of the term "landmark" in the context of their work. Additionally, please specify the rationale for choosing H=4 in line 178 and consider whether evaluating 1000 images per user may lead to fatigue, potentially affecting the accuracy of evaluations. It would also be beneficial to include more countries and diverse cultural artifacts to enhance the benchmark's comprehensiveness. We suggest providing detailed descriptions of the methodology for data collection and annotation to support reproducibility and understanding. Lastly, please ensure that the definition and purpose of 'negative prompts' are clearly articulated in the main text.
