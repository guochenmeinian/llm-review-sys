### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to video paragraph captioning without event annotations, introducing the Sparse Frame Grouping (SFG) module and Intra- and Inter-Contrastive Learning methods to enhance model precision and reduce repetition. The authors demonstrate that their method achieves state-of-the-art performance on two datasets, providing insights into the effectiveness of their approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The proposed method addresses a challenging problem and shows significant improvements in accuracy and diversity of video paragraph captions.
2. The paper is well-written and presents the contributions clearly.
3. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Weaknesses:
1. The introduction and method descriptions lack clarity, particularly regarding the SFG module and its outputs.
2. The experimental evaluation is insufficient, with marginal performance improvements and a lack of comparisons to more recent works.
3. There are several unresolved questions regarding the model's reliance on ground truth triplets and the evaluation process without this information.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the introduction and method descriptions, particularly in defining terms like "triplets" and explaining the SFG module's functionality. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive ablation studies to assess the impact of various components, such as the initialization of video anchors and the number of frames used for decoding. It is also crucial to compare the proposed method against more recent works to strengthen the evaluation. Lastly, addressing the concerns regarding the use of ground truth information during training and its implications for model evaluation would enhance the paper's rigor.
