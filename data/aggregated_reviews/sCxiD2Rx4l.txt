### Key Points
This paper presents a study that broadens the concept of model editing from knowledge triplets to encompass natural language forms, including debiasing and rectifying reasoning errors. The authors introduce DUNE, a novel benchmark defined by natural language expressions that request changes in model outputs. Extensive experiments reveal the strengths and weaknesses of various editing methods, showing that retrieval-augmented language modeling outperforms specialized techniques, though neither fully addresses the generalized editing problem encapsulated by DUNE.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative expansion of "model editing" to include diverse changes enhances the field's understanding.
- The introduction of DUNE as the first editing benchmark based on natural language expressions is a significant contribution.
- Comprehensive experiments provide valuable insights into different editing techniques, aiding future research.

Weaknesses:
- Insufficient detail regarding the validation of DUNE may limit its impact and reliability.
- The lack of suggestions for improving model editing techniques diminishes the paper's practical value.
- The dataset's quality assessment is lacking, as it is automatically generated without evaluation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the term "Unified Editing" by providing a specific definition. Additionally, the authors should elaborate on the design of the 'Prompt' and consider adopting different prompts. More detail on the structure and validation of the DUNE benchmark is necessary. The authors should also discuss effective strategies for enhancing the performance of existing model editing techniques. Finally, addressing the data quality of the Debiasing I task and providing evaluation results for recent instruction-tuned models like Vicuna and Llama-2-chat would strengthen the paper.
