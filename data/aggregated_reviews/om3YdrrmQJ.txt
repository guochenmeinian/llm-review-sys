### Key Points
This paper presents an improvement over multi-modal retrieval models to better handle out-of-distribution (OOD) images and text through evidential learning. The authors introduce the Evidential Language-Image Posterior (ELIP) framework, which is evaluated against pre-trained models CLIP and BLIP on two benchmark datasets. The authors claim that ELIP demonstrates greater robustness in handling OOD samples, as evidenced by a lower drop in recall.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper proposes a clear architectural improvement to state-of-the-art models for cross-model retrieval.
- The framework is well-organized and easy to follow, with effective mathematical expressions.
- Strong results on multiple OOD retrieval benchmarks indicate improved robustness over competitive baselines.

Weaknesses:
- The computation of MMI scores appears incorrect, and the metric may not effectively quantify improvements in OOD scenarios.
- The novelty of the evidential learning approach is marginal, lacking sufficient comparison with other methods.
- The paper does not explore a wider range of real-world perturbations, and several writing issues detract from clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of MMI score computations and explicitly state how these scores are derived in the text. Additionally, consider using ensemble methods or adversarial training to enhance robustness and generalization. We suggest expanding the experimental comparisons to include more datasets and methods to better contextualize ELIP's performance. Furthermore, addressing the writing issues, such as grammar and clarity in figures and tables, will enhance the overall quality of the paper. Lastly, provide a detailed explanation of the ELIP+ improvement and clarify the dataset used for the ablation study.
