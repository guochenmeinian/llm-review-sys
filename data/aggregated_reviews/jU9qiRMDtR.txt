Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents SPRING, a novel framework designed to enable reinforcement learning (RL) agents to play the open-world survival game Crafter by leveraging large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. SPRING consists of two phases: Phase 1 involves extracting and summarizing key information from the game's LaTeX source code, while Phase 2 utilizes this summarized information to formulate gameplay-relevant questions organized in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The authors demonstrate through a comprehensive ablation study that the use of the DAG, the extracted information, and GPT-4 significantly enhance performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written and features a carefully designed ablation study that effectively demonstrates the contributions of both phases of SPRING to achieving higher rewards.
- The approach of using LLMs in open-world survival games is innovative and presents a promising direction for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The reliance on proprietary models like GPT-4 raises concerns about the reproducibility of the work in the future.
- The choice to use academic paper latex code as prompts instead of more abundant online resources is questionable, necessitating further ablation experiments.
- The experiments are limited to the simplified 2D Crafter environment, lacking evaluation in more complex open-world settings such as Minecraft.
- The efficiency of real-time action output at 20fps using LLMs is uncertain, and the paper does not provide average inference time consumption.
- Some questions in the QA-DAG may inadvertently leak game rules, affecting the validity of the approach.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including gameplay and output examples in the appendix to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, disclosing the computational cost associated with GPT-4 API calls would provide valuable context. It is essential to conduct experiments in more complex environments like Minedojo or Minerl to validate SPRING's performance. We also suggest clarifying the efficiency of action outputs and providing average inference times in Table 2. Finally, addressing the concerns regarding the use of academic papers as prompts and the potential for LLMs to be replaced with heuristic rules would strengthen the paper's contributions.
