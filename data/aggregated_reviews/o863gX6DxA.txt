### Key Points
This paper studies the code refinement problem by utilizing a large language model (LLM) to generate improved programs based on user specifications. The authors frame this as an arm-acquiring bandit problem, employing Thompson sampling to optimize the refinement process. Evaluations are conducted across three code generation tasks: competitive programming, visual program reasoning, and loop invariant generation, demonstrating that while the proposed method achieves moderate improvements over baseline methods, it is significantly faster in reaching certain performance levels.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written and easy to follow, providing detailed evaluations and prompts.  
- It emphasizes the importance of developing better base models over merely constructing better refinement strategies, which is beneficial for the community.  
- The method is conceptually simple and easy to implement, with a sound connection to bandit problems that could suggest a range of approaches from existing literature.  
- Comprehensive experiments show empirical effectiveness across various tasks.

Weaknesses:  
- The application of Thompson sampling appears straightforward, yielding only moderate improvements over baseline methods in a large-compute setting.  
- The exploration-exploitation tradeoff is only preliminarily analyzed, necessitating a more thorough investigation.  
- The study is limited to GPT-4, raising questions about performance with weaker models and cost tradeoffs.  
- The assumption of single-sample refinement may be overly restrictive, lacking justification for its effectiveness compared to alternative prompting strategies.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the exploration-exploitation tradeoff by providing a more thorough examination beyond the preliminary study. Additionally, exploring the performance of REx with various LLMs, including weaker models, would enhance the understanding of cost tradeoffs. The authors should also justify the choice of single-sample refinement and consider discussing alternative prompting techniques that could yield better results. Lastly, clarifying the invariant task grading and addressing the potential for trivial invariants would strengthen the paper.
