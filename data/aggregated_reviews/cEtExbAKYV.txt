Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel perspective on quantization in diffusion models, interpreting quantization error as a "stepback" in the denoising process. The authors propose StepbaQ, which adjusts sampling steps to correct the sampling path and mitigate quantization errors. The method is shown to improve performance in quantized diffusion models, supported by experimental evidence.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-organized and logically understandable, facilitating reader comprehension.
- The perspective of quantization error as a stepback is both novel and elegant, leading to effective correction techniques.
- Empirical evaluations, including ablation studies, convincingly demonstrate the method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks solid theoretical guarantees and in-depth analysis regarding the impact of temporal shifts on sampling trajectories.
- There is insufficient comparison of computational efficiency with other quantization approaches.
- The assumption that quantization errors follow a Gaussian distribution requires further justification, particularly regarding its applicability across different models.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of how the temporal shift impacts the scheduled sampling trajectory. Additionally, providing a comparison of computational costs with existing quantization methods would enhance the paper's contribution. Clarifying the calibration process for estimating the stepback and addressing the sudden jump in stepback magnitude for t=1 would also strengthen the analysis. Finally, we suggest including more detailed comparisons with other methods and exploring the method's applicability in consistency models that utilize fewer sampling steps.
