Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach for predicting the satisfiability of Algebraic Normal Form (ANF) Boolean SAT instances using graph neural networks (GNN). The authors propose a new graph structure to handle quadratic terms in ANF, achieving better accuracy and faster prediction times compared to NeuroSAT on CNF. Additionally, the paper introduces CryptoANFNet, an advanced model for solving high-order ANF formulas, demonstrating superior performance over NeuroSAT across various datasets. The authors detail a key-solving algorithm that efficiently determines individual key bits in cryptographic problems, specifically using the Simon encryption algorithm. The results indicate that CryptoANFNet outperforms NeuroSAT in both second-order and higher-order ANF formulas, showcasing its effectiveness in producing satisfying assignments from learned embeddings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper addresses the utility of non-CNF constraints like ANF, which can improve SAT solver performance.
2. CryptoANFNet shows significant performance improvements over NeuroSAT on high-order ANF formulas, particularly in datasets SR(25), SR(5)-high, and SR(10)-high.
3. The proposed key-solving algorithm is well-structured and effectively reduces the complexity of determining key bits in cryptographic contexts.
4. The model's ability to handle a variety of literals without exponential growth in parameters is a notable advantage.
5. The writing is clear, with appropriate technical detail, and the experiments are novel and well-designed.

Weaknesses:
1. The claims regarding the proposed GNN approach are not well substantiated, as it primarily serves as a predictor rather than a solver, making comparisons with SAT solvers misleading.
2. The focus on ANF formats is limited to order 2, raising questions about the generalizability of the proposed graph structure.
3. The novelty of the graph neural network design is questioned due to its similarities with NeuroSAT, and the paper lacks comparisons with other state-of-the-art methods.
4. The paper lacks a detailed description of the specific steps involved in the key-solving algorithm, which may hinder reproducibility.
5. The choice of baselines for comparison, while justified, could be expanded to include more recent and relevant works in the field.
6. The focus on lightweight block ciphers like SIMON and SPECK may limit the applicability of the findings to more widely used ciphers such as AES.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the GNN's predictive capabilities, explicitly stating the limitations of comparing prediction times with SAT solvers. Additionally, the authors should explore extending their approach to accommodate AND terms with more than 2 variables and discuss how to manage the resulting exponential growth in graph nodes. We also suggest providing a more detailed step-by-step description of the key-solving algorithm to enhance reproducibility. Furthermore, we recommend expanding the baseline comparisons to include state-of-the-art works, such as "Learning To Solve Circuit-SAT: An Unsupervised Differentiable Approach," to strengthen the evaluation of CryptoANFNet. Finally, while acknowledging the practical challenges, we encourage the authors to explore the extension of their methods to more complex ciphers like AES, as this could broaden the impact and applicability of their research.
