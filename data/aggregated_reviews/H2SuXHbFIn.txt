Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for approximating Wasserstein barycenters using a Tree-based Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge (TreeDSB) framework, which generalizes the diffusion Schrödinger bridge to multi-marginal optimal transport problems with tree-structured costs. The authors propose an iterative algorithm that leverages the dynamic formulation of the problem, demonstrating convergence results that do not rely on compactness or bounded costs. The method is evaluated through various experiments, particularly focusing on the Wasserstein barycenter.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The originality and significance of the work are notable, extending the diffusion Schrödinger bridge framework to multi-marginal problems and providing strong convergence results.  
- The theoretical foundation is solid, and the results section is compelling, showcasing the method's effectiveness through experiments.  
- The integration of different optimal transport concepts and the practical implementation of the approach are commendable.

Weaknesses:  
- The clarity of presentation is lacking in several areas, making it difficult to follow the arguments and results.  
- The motivation for focusing solely on the Wasserstein barycenter problem is unclear, and the paper does not sufficiently differentiate its contributions from existing methods, particularly those by Haessler et al.  
- The numerical experiments are limited in scope and do not convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages over state-of-the-art approaches, lacking detailed comparisons and commentary on results.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the presentation, particularly in Section 2, by ensuring that background material is concise and clearly linked to the main contributions. It would be beneficial to elaborate on the differences between their method and those of Haessler et al. in the main manuscript, emphasizing the unique contributions of their approach. Additionally, we suggest including a broader range of experiments beyond the Wasserstein barycenter problem to showcase the method's applicability to other multi-marginal optimal transport scenarios. Finally, addressing the computational complexity and providing detailed comparisons with state-of-the-art methods, such as the Iterative Bregman Projection, would strengthen the paper's impact.
