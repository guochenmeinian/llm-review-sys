Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an exploration of the properties of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between multivariate Gaussian distributions, addressing its lack of symmetry and failure to satisfy the triangle inequality. The authors propose relaxed versions of these properties, proving upper and lower bounds for reverse KL divergence based on forward KL divergence. The results are applied to anomaly detection and reinforcement learning, demonstrating their relevance in practical contexts.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper provides novel theoretical contributions regarding KL divergence, including bounds that enhance understanding of its properties.  
2. The proofs are technically sound and well-structured, making the paper accessible and easy to read.  
3. The findings have potential applications in deep learning and reinforcement learning, indicating broad relevance.

Weaknesses:  
1. Certain conditions for the theorems, such as requiring $\mu_1 = \mu_2$, may be too restrictive for practical applications.  
2. The applications discussed are somewhat limited, raising questions about the broader applicability of the theoretical results.  
3. The structure of the paper deviates from conventional formats, which may hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper's structure by placing the Related Work section after the Introduction and before the Conclusions. Additionally, we suggest that the authors clarify Lemma G.5 to enhance its digestibility and consider introducing relevant notations earlier to tighten the equations. Furthermore, elaborating on the proposed unified OOD detection algorithm KLODS would provide valuable context for readers.
