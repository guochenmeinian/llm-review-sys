Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach for generative object pose estimation using diffusion models to address the multi-hypothesis problem in category-level 6D pose estimation. The authors propose a framework that employs a score-based diffusion model to generate pose candidates and an energy-based diffusion model to rank these candidates. The method achieves state-of-the-art results on the REAL275 dataset and demonstrates good generalization capabilities across unseen categories. Additionally, the authors introduce a diffusion-based approach for conditional generation tasks, asserting its scalability similar to established models like StableDiffusion. They address concerns regarding the ambiguity of partial observations and the performance of their method with reduced supervision, highlighting the effectiveness of their generative formulation. The paper also clarifies the differences between ScoreNet and EnergyNet's parameterizations and discusses the implications of their findings through t-SNE analysis and feature similarity assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The formulation of pose estimation as a diffusion process is innovative and effectively addresses multi-hypothesis challenges due to symmetry and partial observations.
- The framework is efficient, utilizing two diffusion models for candidate generation and ranking, which shows promising results compared to existing methods.
- The authors provide a clear rationale for the scalability of their diffusion-based approach, supported by references to established models.
- The paper is well-written, featuring clear figures and thorough experimental validation across multiple benchmarks.
- The inclusion of quantitative assessments, such as chamfer distance, enhances the rigor of their feature similarity analysis.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed method does not account for the 3D size parameter in its pose representation, which may lead to unfair comparisons with other methods.
- Inference speed is a limitation, as the generative model's complexity may hinder real-time applications.
- The reliance on mean pooling for final pose estimation could be improved by exploring alternative aggregation methods, such as weighted averaging or clustering.
- The significant training time required for diffusion models may pose a bottleneck for scalability.
- The authors acknowledge that the ambiguity from partial observations remains a challenge, which could limit the effectiveness of their approach in certain scenarios.
- The initial explanations regarding ScoreNet and EnergyNet may have led to misunderstandings that require further clarification.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison in Table 1 by including methods that consider the scale parameter. Additionally, addressing the inference speed issue would enhance the practical applicability of the method. We suggest exploring alternative aggregation techniques for pose estimation, such as designing a weighted version of Eq-9 or incorporating weighted mean pooling, to potentially increase accuracy. Clarifying the implementation details of pose tracking and providing visualizations of multiple pose hypotheses would also strengthen the paper. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a comparison between EnergyNet and the Flow-based method to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their approach. Lastly, we advise that the authors incorporate both the mean and standard deviation in their analyses to enhance the robustness of their findings and improve the clarity of the differences between ScoreNet and EnergyNet in future revisions to prevent misunderstandings.
