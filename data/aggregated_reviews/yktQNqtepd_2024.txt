Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel task called object-centric occupancy, aimed at enhancing 3D object detection by providing a fine-grained representation of object shapes. The authors create a new dataset that annotates instance-level high-resolution occupancy and introduce an implicit shape decoder to integrate multi-frame information, predict instance occupancy, and refine 3D bounding boxes. Experimental results on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate the method's effectiveness in both occupancy prediction and 3D detection.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The paper is well-written and organized, with clear motivation for the proposed task.  
2. The introduction of a new instance-level occupancy dataset and the implicit shape decoder shows significant improvements in occupancy and 3D detection.  
3. Extensive ablation studies validate the contributions, and the method achieves state-of-the-art performance in shape completion.

Weaknesses:  
1. The motivation for the task is questioned, as it seems unnecessary to create detailed occupancy when bounding boxes may suffice for many applications.  
2. The computational cost of the proposed shape decoder is not provided, leaving a gap in understanding the trade-offs involved.  
3. Some relevant methods are missing from comparisons, and the related work section lacks references to existing fields in 3D CAD model retrieval and shape regression.  
4. Visualizations of shape codes are insufficient, making it difficult to assess the model's ability to complete shapes effectively.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section to clarify the necessity of detailed occupancy over bounding boxes. Additionally, please provide the computational cost associated with the proposed shape decoder to better inform readers of the trade-offs. It would also be beneficial to include comparisons with missing methods in the related work and to enhance visualizations of shape codes for clearer understanding.
