Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Amadeus, a natural language interface for interactive animal behavior analysis, leveraging GPT-3.5 and a Dual Memory Mechanism to enhance long-term memory retrieval beyond the 4096 token limit. The authors demonstrate the system's effectiveness on three standard mouse behavior datasets, showcasing its ability to generate Python code for behavior analysis based on user queries. Additionally, the system utilizes GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 through API calls, integrating computer vision models for analyzing mouse behavior. The authors clarify that none of the 242 errors were from manually typed prompts and provide a detailed breakdown of error rates, indicating an 11% effective overall error rate after testing with GPT-4. The manuscript aims to illustrate the system's architecture and training details, which are currently lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The motivation is novel, providing an unprecedented experience in animal behavior analysis through natural language.
- The paper is well-written and presents clear system schematics and examples.
- Quantitative results on the MABE dataset demonstrate the system's effectiveness and high performance compared to existing baselines.
- The authors provide a clear explanation of error rates and improvements made with GPT-4.
- The system architecture is designed to allow for customized APIs without the need for fine-tuning, which is a notable feature.

Weaknesses:
- The applicability of the system to other animals beyond mice is unclear, and the authors should discuss this limitation.
- The evaluation of the number of behaviors tested is insufficient; a list in supplementary materials would enhance clarity.
- The performance heavily relies on hand-crafted data analysis modules, raising concerns about generalizability to different animal behaviors.
- The robustness of the system is questionable, as it relies on GPT-3.5 for stress testing, which may not reflect independent performance.
- The manuscript lacks detailed descriptions of the training procedure and system architecture, making it difficult to fully understand the methodology.
- Figure 4 a.1 is confusingly oriented, obscuring potential differences in performance between humans and the system.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the applicability of their approach to other animal species and clarify the number of behaviors tested by providing a supplementary list. Additionally, we suggest including a more detailed analysis of failure cases and the robustness of the system, particularly regarding how it handles unseen behavioral codes and the distribution of atomic APIs. It would also be beneficial to provide a clearer explanation of the long-term memory module's implementation and its generalizability to other domains. Furthermore, we recommend including comprehensive descriptions of the training procedure and the networks used. Lastly, we suggest modifying Figure 4 a.1 to connect the data points across humans and Amadeus, enhancing clarity in the comparison of results and addressing the potential for hallucinations in LLM outputs while providing metrics on the reliability of generated code.
