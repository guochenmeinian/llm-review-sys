Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for training diffusion models using partial observations of underlying signals, integrating a differentiable forward model to synthesize signals conditioned on these observations. The authors apply their method to inverse graphics, GAN inversion, and motion prediction, demonstrating superior performance compared to baseline methods across various metrics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Results are strong, both visually and quantitatively.
- The paper addresses a significant problem and is well-motivated.
- The evaluation metrics are sound and relevant.

Weaknesses:
- Proposition 1 lacks rigorous definitions; assumptions and results need clearer mathematical formulation.
- The method section is overly simplified; more mathematical detail is required, particularly regarding the proposed loss function's relation to maximum likelihood and the conditions for Proposition 1.
- The dataset requirement for multiple views of the same scene is a significant assumption, limiting applicability to other stochastic inverse problems.
- The evaluation is limited, with few tasks and baselines, and the experiments section is convoluted and unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Proposition 1 by providing a complete set of assumptions and results. Additionally, the method section should include more mathematical rigor, particularly in proving the relationship between the proposed loss function and maximum likelihood. We suggest addressing the limitations of requiring multiple views in the limitations section and expanding the evaluation to include more tasks and baselines. Furthermore, a discussion comparing the proposed method with concurrent works like RenderDiffusion and recent papers addressing similar problems would enhance the paper's context and relevance.
