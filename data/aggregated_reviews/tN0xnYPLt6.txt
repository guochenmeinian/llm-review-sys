Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called TinyLUT, which addresses the storage explosion challenge of LUT-based image restoration methods by employing a separable mapping strategy (SMS) and a dynamic discretization mechanism (DDM). The SMS decomposes convolution into independent sub-operations, reducing input entries and LUT dimensions, while the DDM compresses quantization scales using learnable clipping parameters. Experimental results indicate the method's potential for image restoration tasks on edge devices.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper effectively analyzes the storage challenges of LUT and proposes a viable solution through convolution kernel decomposition and quantization scale compression.
2. The proposed method demonstrates significant efficiency and effectiveness for image restoration, particularly on edge devices.
3. The organization and clarity of the writing are commendable.

Weaknesses:
1. The SMS may lead to information loss and performance degradation, as it neglects relationships between local indexes crucial for convolutions.
2. The motivations for activation decomposition in the DDM are unclear, and the differences from previous methods are insufficiently discussed.
3. There is a lack of comparison with state-of-the-art methods, particularly those that also address LUT storage issues.
4. The performance on the image denoising task is notably inferior compared to existing methods, raising concerns about the method's overall effectiveness across various restoration tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivations and benefits of activation decomposition in the DDM and provide a more thorough discussion of its differences from previous methods. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with more recent state-of-the-art methods to validate their approach. Expanding the experimental validation to include a broader range of image restoration tasks would strengthen the claims made. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the performance issues observed in the denoising task and consider exploring the generalization of the SMS and DDM for other models beyond TinyLUT.
