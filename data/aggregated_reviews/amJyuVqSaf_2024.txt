Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a method called Markovian flow matching (MFM) for training continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) framework. The authors propose a hybrid approach that combines MCMC steps with flow steps, utilizing a continuous velocity field for sampling from unnormalized density functions. The method is evaluated on various tasks, including low-dimensional toy problems and high-dimensional data-derived densities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The integration of MCMC in the latent space of a CNF is an original contribution.
- The paper is well-structured, with clear writing and thorough experiments against appropriate baselines, including recent methods like DDS.
- The authors effectively articulate the limitations of their approach.

Weaknesses:
- The novelty of the method appears limited, as it primarily extends existing MCMC-Normalizing Flow frameworks to CNFs without sufficiently justifying the preference for CNFs over discrete normalizing flows.
- The experiments lack comprehensiveness, particularly in high-dimensional settings, and the benchmarks used may not convincingly demonstrate the method's advantages.
- There are mathematical inaccuracies and imprecise expositions that need addressing, such as the conditions for the existence of diffeomorphic flow maps.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty discussion by explicitly comparing the benefits of their approach with neutra-MCMC methods using discrete normalizing flows. Additionally, we suggest conducting more comprehensive experiments on a wider range of benchmarks, particularly those common in the literature on samplers of Boltzmann densities. It would also be beneficial to include ablation studies to analyze the contributions of each component of the proposed method. Finally, clarifying the mathematical exposition and addressing the identified inaccuracies will enhance the paper's rigor.
