### Key Points
This paper presents Gaussian Process Conjoint Analysis (GPCA), a novel method for estimating marginal effects in choice-based conjoint experiments. The authors propose deriving marginal effects as first-order derivatives from observed choices using Gaussian processes and introduce a Gaussian mixture approximation for predictive distributions. Experimental results on synthetic data indicate that GPCA provides more precise and efficient marginal effect estimations. The paper also explores the application of GPCA in understanding consumer preferences through choice-based conjoint analysis.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The approach of combining Gaussian processes with adaptive experimentation is original, with limited existing literature on the topic.  
- The findings are supported by experimental results on synthetic data, demonstrating the method's effectiveness.  
- The paper is well-organized and clearly written, with detailed documentation of results through tables and visuals.  
- The significance of GPCA in industrial applications, particularly its ability to handle continuous responses, is noteworthy.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper could benefit from a more extensive review of recent literature and developments.  
- There are concerns regarding the marginal improvements of GP-GMM over GP-MAP in certain datasets, which require further discussion.  
- The experimental setup for different acquisition functions appears inconsistent, necessitating clarification.  
- Some sections lack clarity, particularly in differentiating this work from other GP-related studies, and the text contains typos and grammatical errors.  
- The left-hand plot in Figure 1 is not informative, and the determination of weights in mixture models is inadequately addressed. Additionally, the function alpha is not defined prior to its use.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the literature review to include recent developments in the field. Additionally, please discuss the hypotheses regarding the marginal performance differences observed in the datasets. Clarifying the experimental setup for acquisition functions is essential, and we suggest enhancing the clarity of sections that differentiate this work from other studies. We also advise revising the text for typos and grammatical errors, improving Figure 1 for better informativeness, and addressing the challenges of determining weights in mixture models. Finally, please define the function alpha earlier in the paper to aid comprehension.
