Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents DARNet, a dual attention refinement network with spatiotemporal construction for auditory attention detection (AAD). The authors effectively address limitations in existing AAD algorithms by capturing spatiotemporal features and long-range latent dependencies from EEG signals, leading to improved classification accuracy and reduced parameter count compared to state-of-the-art models. The methodology and empirical results indicate that DARNet represents a significant advancement in decoding brain activity related to auditory attention tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. DARNet shows significant improvements in classification accuracy across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in AAD tasks.
2. The model reduces the number of parameters by 14% compared to state-of-the-art models, beneficial for practical applications requiring efficient computation.
3. The integration of spatial and temporal convolutions enhances the model's ability to decode brain activity accurately.
4. The dual attention refinement module effectively captures long-range dependencies in EEG signals, addressing a common limitation in previous models.

Weaknesses:
1. The experiments are subject-dependent, limiting the generalizability of the results; cross-subject conditions could be more relevant for practical applications.
2. The writing contains grammatical errors and unclear sentences that require further polishing.
3. The manuscript lacks novelty, as similar concepts have been previously employed in classic EEG+DL+BCI papers.
4. There is insufficient clarity regarding the dataset used for accuracy improvements and the computational cost of methods in Table 2.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing, particularly addressing grammatical errors and unclear expressions, such as those noted in lines 100-102 and 188. Additionally, we suggest providing a more in-depth discussion on the novelty of the spatial module compared to existing methods and explicitly stating that this is a subject-dependent study in the methods section. To enhance reproducibility, please provide the full code and clarify the sliding window procedure used in the KUL dataset to avoid repeated signal segments. Lastly, we encourage the authors to analyze the computational cost and time consumption of the methods presented in Table 2.
