Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an approach to open-world object detection that enhances model performance by generating detailed object descriptions using GPT. The authors propose that removing the entity name from descriptions compels the network to learn contextual information, leading to improved performance on zero-shot tasks. The methodology includes augmenting standard datasets with detailed descriptions and training open-vocabulary detectors like GLIP and FIBER on this enriched data, demonstrating effectiveness on the LVIS and OmniLabel benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper effectively demonstrates that providing additional contextual information to the network can significantly enhance performance.
- The results surpass those of FIBER and CLIP, indicating a strong contribution to the field.
- The analysis of how detection performance is influenced by the language model used for data generation is significant, providing useful guidance for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The writing lacks clarity, making it challenging to understand the training and testing approaches. The conversion of diverse datasets into description-rich data is not sufficiently detailed.
- The novelty of the approach, primarily the removal of entity names, may not be compelling enough for NeurIPS.
- The paper does not explore alternative prompts for generating object descriptions, which could enrich the findings.
- There is insufficient detail on the training processes of CLIP and FIBER, and the claims made regarding performance comparisons are misleading.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the writing to enhance understanding of the training and testing methodologies. Specifically, provide concrete details on how diverse datasets were converted into description-rich data. Additionally, include more background on the training of CLIP and FIBER to better highlight the contributions of this work. We suggest exploring other prompts for generating object descriptions to add depth to the analysis. Finally, ensure that claims regarding performance comparisons are accurately represented to avoid misleading interpretations.
