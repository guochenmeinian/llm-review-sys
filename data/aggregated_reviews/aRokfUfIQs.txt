Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Sequential Signal Mixing Aggregation (SSMA) for Message Passing Graph Neural Networks (MPGNNs), addressing the limitations of traditional sum-based aggregators that struggle to effectively mix features from distinct neighbors. SSMA treats neighbor features as 2D discrete signals and applies sequential convolution, significantly enhancing feature mixing. The authors provide empirical evidence demonstrating that SSMA improves performance across various MPGNN architectures.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The work is well-motivated and grounded in a solid mathematical foundation.  
2. The paper is well-written and presents a compelling explanation of the limitations of sum-based aggregators.  
3. Empirical results support the effectiveness of SSMA, achieving state-of-the-art performance.  
4. The theoretical analysis is rigorous, with well-detailed mathematical formulations.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks empirical run-time comparisons between MPGNN and MPGNN+SSMA.  
2. Limited comparisons with other aggregation methods, such as LSTM and DIFFPOOL, are provided.  
3. The paper is difficult to follow in parts, particularly in Section 4, which could benefit from clearer explanations and intuition.  
4. The inductive setting mentioned in the experimental setup is not reflected in the experiments section.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by adding more intuitive explanations, particularly regarding the limitations of sum-based aggregators. Additionally, including empirical run-time comparisons between MPGNN and MPGNN+SSMA would strengthen the evaluation. We suggest expanding the experimental comparisons to include a wider range of state-of-the-art aggregation methods, such as Generalized f-Mean Aggregation and Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation. Furthermore, addressing the inductive setting in the experiments section would enhance the completeness of the study.
