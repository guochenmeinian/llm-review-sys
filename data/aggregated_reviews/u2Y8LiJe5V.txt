### Key Points
This paper presents Anyprefer, a novel automatic framework aimed at synthesizing high-quality preference data to align foundation models with human values. It addresses the limitations of manual annotation and existing self-rewarding methods by modeling the data synthesis as a cooperative two-player Markov Game involving a target model and a judge model. The judge model utilizes external tools to reward and rank responses from the target model, thereby reducing biases. A feedback mechanism is also introduced to optimize prompts for both models, enhancing collaboration and data quality.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
* The Anyprefer framework is both novel and effective.  
* The paper is well-written and easy to follow.  
* The experiments are well-designed, yielding convincing results.  
* The framework has broad applicability across various downstream applications.  
* The authors have created a new preference dataset, Anyprefer-V1, which serves as a valuable resource for the research community.  

Weaknesses:  
* The evaluation would benefit from comparisons with other state-of-the-art preference learning approaches, in addition to the self-rewarding methods used as baselines.  
* The paper lacks a detailed analysis of the computational cost associated with the framework.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including comparisons with other state-of-the-art preference learning approaches. Additionally, we suggest providing a detailed analysis of the computational cost of the framework to enhance the paper's comprehensiveness.
