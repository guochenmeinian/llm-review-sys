Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a task decomposition method for robust 3D scene editing, introducing the concept of decomposing the desired task represented by a prompt and employing an adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting training process. The authors propose a progressive editing framework that recursively modifies the scene, ensuring multi-view consistency and generating superior editing results compared to previous methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea of decomposing the task into subtasks is both interesting and useful.
- The results convincingly support the claims made in the paper.
- The proposed adaptive 3D Gaussian Splatting enhances the efficiency of the editing process and yields high-quality results.

Weaknesses:
- The linear decomposition scheme lacks semantic meaning, making it difficult to evaluate the results of each subtask, with insufficient experimental validation.
- There is a lack of quantitative assessments and ablation studies on technical designs, particularly regarding the necessity of additional subtasks and the Gaussian creation strategy.
- The illustrations and results primarily focus on human faces, with limited examples of more complex object manipulations or outdoor scenes.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the illustrations in Fig. 3 by specifying which rows and columns correspond to which methods. Additionally, the authors should provide more visualizations of outdoor scenes and include a quantitative evaluation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method against alternatives. It is crucial to conduct an ablation study to assess the necessity of the additional subtasks and provide detailed technical insights into the Gaussian creation strategy. Finally, we suggest that the authors demonstrate the method's capability for more complex object manipulations beyond mere appearance edits.
