Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a study on embedding multiple continuous attractor manifolds within a recurrent neural network (RNN), focusing on the interference between attractors and its impact on activity bump drift. The authors propose modifications to synaptic weights to flatten the energy landscape, thereby stabilizing activity patterns. They utilize both a perturbative approach and gradient descent to achieve this. The study highlights the importance of continuous attractors in neuroscience, particularly in the context of hippocampal place cells. Additionally, the authors explore the flatness of the energy landscape in neural networks, particularly in the context of ring attractors, and discuss the practical significance of a "small" number of neurons through the granularity of the energy landscape. They differentiate between frozen noise from multiple map embeddings and dynamic noise from stochastic neural activity, and clarify the relationship between stability measures and the Lyapunov exponent, emphasizing that their system exhibits stable attractors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The methodology and problem formulation are clearly articulated.
- Simulations demonstrate that weight modifications significantly enhance the stability of activity patterns.
- The authors provide code in the appendix, facilitating reproducibility.
- The authors provide a detailed analysis of the energy landscape's granularity and its implications for neural representations.
- The differentiation between types of noise adds depth to the understanding of neural dynamics.
- The clarification regarding the Lyapunov exponent and its relevance to stability strengthens the theoretical framework.

Weaknesses:
- Some areas of the manuscript could be improved, such as including a diagrammatic illustration of discretized states within the energy landscape.
- Further details on simulation parameters, including duration and specific inputs, are needed.
- The paper could benefit from additional simulations and discussions regarding the biological plausibility of the approach and its implications for weight modification.
- There are minor typographical errors, such as "emfbedded map" instead of "embedded map."
- The paper lacks explicit analysis of the Lyapunov exponent, which could enhance the claims about stability.
- Some concepts, such as the relationship between stability measures and neuron resolution, may not be sufficiently clear to all readers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the manuscript by adding a diagrammatic illustration to elucidate the issue of discretized states in the energy landscape. Additionally, providing more detailed information about the simulations, including duration and specific inputs, would enhance the paper's rigor. We suggest that the authors refer to the appendix more frequently in the Results section to clarify their methodology. Addressing the biological plausibility of their approach and discussing the implications of weight modifications in relation to Daleâ€™s law would strengthen the contribution to neuroscience. Furthermore, we recommend including an explicit analysis of the Lyapunov exponent in the final version to bolster the claims regarding stability. Finally, correcting typographical errors and ensuring clarity in terminology, such as defining "quenched noise," would improve the overall presentation.
