### Key Points
This paper presents a benchmarking effort for chemical reaction condition prediction, termed ORDerly. The authors propose a methodology for data extraction and cleaning from the Open Reaction Database (ORD). By experimenting with various labeling strategies for molecules' roles in reactions and addressing rare agents, they generated four distinct datasets. The authors tested Gao et al.â€™s model on these datasets, revealing that enhancements to the original labeling in ORD and the removal of infrequent agents can significantly improve model performance. The task addressed is both useful and important, and the proposed data and benchmark appear reasonable.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The manuscript introduces a valuable benchmarking tool for chemical reaction condition prediction.  
- The methodology for data extraction and cleaning is well-defined and systematic.  
- The results indicate potential improvements in model performance through better labeling and data management.

Weaknesses:  
- The review does not specify any significant weaknesses or areas of concern.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the labeling strategies employed and provide more detailed explanations of the data cleaning process. Additionally, further exploration of the impact of rare agents on model performance could enhance the robustness of the findings.
