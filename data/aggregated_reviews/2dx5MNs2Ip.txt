Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a probabilistic integrator for solving stiff semi-linear ODEs, decoupling linear and nonlinear components to enhance accuracy. The approach employs an integrated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process (IOUP) prior, with posterior inference extending classical exponential integrators to solve linear components precisely. Nonlinearities are approximated through local linearization akin to the extended Kalman filter (EKF). The authors provide L-stability results and propose Jacobian approximations that focus on linear dynamics.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The paper is well-written, well-motivated, and executed effectively. While the results are not groundbreaking compared to the baseline, the proposed method shows clear benefits, especially when nonlinearities are minimal. Limitations are transparently identified.

Weaknesses:  
The paper does not emphasize the advantages of treating the initial value problem (IVP) as a Bayesian inference task, missing the opportunity to quantify uncertainty in the solution. The method's sensitivity to nonlinearity is notable, with accuracy degrading as the quadratic term's significance increases. Additionally, the proposed methods are limited to semi-linear ODEs, while other approaches can handle more general cases. The IOUP prior is computationally more expensive than the IWP prior, and the Kalman filter/smoother exhibits cubic scaling in the ODE dimension.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the benefits of framing the IVP as a Bayesian inference task, particularly in quantifying uncertainty over the solution. A more detailed investigation of the stability behaviors of solvers under large step sizes would enhance understanding. Additionally, addressing the potential advantages of combining the IOUP prior with the EKF could provide further insights. Clarifying the computational overhead of matrix exponentials and their impact on runtime would also be beneficial.
