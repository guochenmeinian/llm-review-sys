### Key Points
This paper presents a new dataset, AIG-ASAP, designed for evaluating AI-generated content (AIGC) detectors in the student essay writing domain. The authors employ various text perturbation methods to create adversarial examples and assess the performance of existing AIGC detectors through empirical experiments. The findings reveal vulnerabilities in current detection methods and highlight the impact of perturbation depth on detector capabilities.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel application of adversarial attacks in the educational domain, opening new research directions.
- It provides a well-structured and comprehensive analysis, demonstrating significant findings regarding detection vulnerabilities.
- The methodology is reasonable, and the results are reproducible.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of discussion on improving the robustness of detectors against the dataset.
- The quality of AI-generated essays was assessed using automated scoring without qualitative validation.
- The dataset lacks basic distribution information, and the selection process for topical words is unclear.
- The paper could benefit from additional baselines from existing literature and a human evaluation of essay quality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on enhancing detector robustness to the dataset. Additionally, including qualitative results to confirm the comparability of original and generated essays would strengthen the claims. The authors should clarify the process for selecting and replacing topical words and consider adopting multiple metrics for essay evaluation to address potential biases. Providing basic distribution details of the dataset and enhancing the organization of the paper for clarity would also be beneficial.
