Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Bayesian optimization (BO) method for optimizing black-box functions over subsets of nodes in a graph. The authors propose a framework that constructs a "combo-graph" to maintain structural information while optimizing costly evaluations. The approach is evaluated against classical techniques and demonstrates competitive performance across various benchmarks, showing significant improvements over standard baselines.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The innovative framework is function-agnostic and applicable to diverse optimization problems, with clear and comprehensible presentation. Empirical results consistently outperform baselines, indicating practical utility.

Weaknesses:  
The paper lacks clarity on the graph structure, which raises questions about its relevance. The technical novelty is limited, primarily combining existing methods. Additionally, the performance diminishes as the size of the node subsets increases, and the choice of hyperparameters appears ad-hoc. The empirical evaluation could benefit from including other BO baselines, such as LADDER.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity regarding the graph structure and its significance in the optimization context. It would be beneficial to define key concepts, such as the ego-subgraph, and to address the limitations of the approach in larger, real-world applications. We suggest including comparisons with additional BO methods to strengthen the empirical evaluation. Furthermore, consider providing insights into how the proposed algorithm handles noise in function evaluations and its expected performance in noisy settings.
