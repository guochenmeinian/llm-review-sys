Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel model for understanding the evolution of weights in neural networks by framing the problem as a directed graph and deriving a Hamiltonian to apply Hamilton's principle. The authors propose that their solution yields differential equations that describe weight dynamics, which can reduce to standard gradient descent under certain conditions. Additionally, the paper introduces a spatially and temporally local alternative to backpropagation for training recurrent neural networks (RNNs), viewing learning as minimizing a functional of a variational problem using Hamiltonian equations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper rigorously approaches network dynamics with minimal assumptions, and the mathematics is well-derived, leading to consistent conclusions.  
- It provides a new perspective on backpropagation as a special case of solving a variational problem with infinite velocity, and proposes an alternative that allows online processing without backward computation.  
- The computational model is generally defined, making theoretical achievements independent of network architecture, and the authors attempt to clarify technical terms throughout the paper.

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks clarity and could benefit from a more intuitive presentation to reach a broader audience. The connection between the proposed methods and practical machine learning applications is not sufficiently articulated, leaving readers uncertain about implementation.  
- There is a notable absence of experimental validation, with insufficient details on the experimental setup and results, making it difficult to assess the proposed learning rule's effectiveness compared to conventional methods.  
- The paper does not adequately address related work on biologically plausible learning rules, which could enhance understanding of its contributions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by simplifying technical language and providing intuitive explanations of complex concepts. Specifically, include a pseudo-code of the final algorithm to enhance reproducibility. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct standard experiments, such as evaluations on MNIST, to demonstrate the proposed learning rule's performance and its differences from backpropagation. A dedicated section on related work would also help contextualize the contributions of this paper. Finally, we encourage the authors to clarify the implications of their findings regarding data requirements and the potential for addressing forgetting in learning processes.
