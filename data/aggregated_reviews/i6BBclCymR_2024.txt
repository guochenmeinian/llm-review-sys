Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the behavior of Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) in sparse-view 3D reconstruction, highlighting that SDS can negatively impact reconstruction quality. The authors propose a method called Inline Prior Guided Score Matching (IPSM), which utilizes a diffusion inpainting model with warped input images to enhance SDS optimization. Additionally, a 3DGS pipeline is introduced, achieving state-of-the-art performance in novel view synthesis from sparse inputs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper offers an interesting perspective on the mode-seeking behavior of SDS in sparse-view settings.
2. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed method.
3. The paper includes clear and detailed ablation studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The analysis of mode deviation is insufficient; more theoretical analysis is needed to support claims about SDS limitations.
2. The novelty of the diffusion inpainting model is questionable, as it resembles prior work, necessitating a detailed methodological comparison.
3. The paper lacks qualitative comparisons and detailed experimental settings, such as the level of input view sparsity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical analysis of mode deviation to enhance the credibility of their claims. A detailed comparison with prior work, particularly regarding the diffusion inpainting model, should be included to clarify its novelty. Additionally, the authors should provide qualitative results for SDS and specify experimental settings, including input view sparsity levels. It would also be beneficial to explore the performance of the proposed method in extreme scenarios and clarify the necessity of using 3DGS. Finally, addressing the domain gap in comparisons with view-conditioned diffusion models will strengthen the discussion.
