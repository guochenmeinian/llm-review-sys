Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the ECG-QA dataset, the first question answering (QA) dataset specifically designed for electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis, comprising 70 question templates that cover a wide range of clinically relevant topics. The dataset includes questions that necessitate comparative analysis between two ECGs, enhancing its clinical utility. The authors conducted extensive experiments with machine learning and large language models (LLMs), demonstrating the dataset's potential applications in ECG interpretation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The ECG-QA dataset is one of the first of its kind, offering a diverse range of clinically significant questions.
- The inclusion of comparative ECG questions is a major highlight, enhancing the dataset's relevance.
- The dataset repository is well-documented, with clear instructions for reproducing experiments.
- The experimental design is robust, and the writing is generally clear and well-structured.

Weaknesses:
- The clinical criteria for "stage of myocardial infarction" are unclear.
- The origins of extra systole beyond ventricular and supraventricular are not adequately explained.
- Many questions appear to be answerable with simple "Yes" or "No" responses, raising concerns about their qualitative distinction from classification problems.
- The limitations of the dataset and benchmarking methods are not sufficiently addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors clarify the clinical criteria associated with "stage of myocardial infarction" and provide a more comprehensive explanation of the origins of extra systole. Additionally, we suggest that the authors include a dedicated limitations section detailing the dataset's constraints and the accuracy of the regular expression parser used for symptom extraction. It would also be beneficial to evaluate LLMs in a free-text manner for query questions to assess the quality of explanations provided to expert cardiologists. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore future research directions and consider conducting lower bound experiments to identify potential biases in the dataset.
