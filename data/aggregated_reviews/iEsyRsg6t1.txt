Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper addresses the S-ID (Sub-population Identification) problem in causal inference, extending it to scenarios with latent variables. The authors propose new graphical definitions such as S-components and S-Hedges, which build on classical concepts. They present a sufficient graphical condition for determining if a causal effect is S-ID and introduce a sound algorithm for solving the S-ID problem in the presence of latent variables. Additionally, they demonstrate a reduction from the S-Recoverability problem to the S-ID problem.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper presents thorough theoretical analysis, including formal definitions, lemmas, examples, and theorems.
- It is well-written and easy to understand, with helpful examples aiding comprehension.
- The introduction of novel concepts alongside a review of classical notions enhances clarity.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks empirical evaluation, with no experimental results or real-world case studies to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed solution.
- There is insufficient comparison with other latent variable models in causal inference.
- Some examples and definitions could be improved for clarity, and a summary of assumptions made would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the empirical evaluation by including experimental results or real-world case studies to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed solution. Additionally, we suggest providing a more extensive comparison with existing latent variable models in causal inference. Clarifying the definitions, particularly of $Q[]$, and enhancing the intuitiveness of examples would also improve the paper's readability. Finally, including a subsection summarizing any assumptions made would be advantageous.
