### Key Points
This paper presents an innovative application of generative models to the construction of document indices rather than the retriever itself. The authors propose creating multiple parallel synthetic indices through various rewrites of the original document, which are ensembled during inference. This technique maintains low inference costs while leveraging the advantages of generative models. The originality of this approach is compelling, particularly in shifting query rewriting to the indexing stage, thus saving inference costs. However, the exploration of its significance is limited, primarily due to the industry focus, and the paper would benefit from examining its applicability to a wider range of retrieval tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The idea is compelling and may effectively enhance existing dense retrieval systems using generative models.
- The paper describes a system deployed in production, highlighting end-user benefits.
- The method outperforms all other baselines, including generative reranking and query expansion via an LLM, especially beyond k@3.

Weaknesses:
- The findings would be better supported by more ablations, such as quantifying the contributions of each index to overall performance, particularly the metadata index versus synthetic indices.
- A more thorough discussion of limitations is needed, especially regarding the challenges and costs associated with generating synthetic documents using LLMs, which may not scale efficiently.
- The online results lack detail on how factors like time and traffic variance were controlled during experiments.
- While the industry focus may limit applicability, exploring whether this technique can be generalized to other retrieval tasks and assessing potential biases introduced by LLM generations would be beneficial.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the paper by including more ablation studies to clarify the contributions of each index to performance. Additionally, a deeper discussion on the limitations of the technique, particularly regarding the costs associated with LLMs for generating synthetic documents, would enhance the paper's rigor. Providing more detail on the online experiment's control measures would also strengthen the findings. Finally, we encourage the authors to explore the applicability of their technique to a broader range of retrieval tasks and to consider any biases that may arise from LLM generations.
