### Key Points
This paper presents the Continual Generalized Intent Discovery (CGID) task, addressing limitations in existing Generalized Intent Discovery (GID) systems that only operate in a single-stage learning process. The authors propose a method called Prototype-guided Learning with Replay and Distillation (PLRD) to dynamically recognize out-of-domain (OOD) intent data streams without relying on previous data. Key contributions include the introduction of CGID, the PLRD method, and comprehensive experimentation to validate the proposed approach.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Introduction of a novel task paradigm (CGID) that addresses dynamic intent recognition in dialogue systems.
- Proposal of the PLRD method, which effectively combines class prototypes, data replay, and feature distillation.
- Comprehensive experimental design that validates the effectiveness of the PLRD method and analyzes challenges in CGID.

Weaknesses:
- Limited novelty, as the paper mainly incorporates continual learning concepts into GID without substantial innovation.
- Insufficient comparative analysis, relying on self-constructed baselines rather than existing works, which diminishes persuasiveness.
- The CGID paradigm may not adequately handle dynamic OOD intent streams due to inherent limitations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the justification for the necessity of the CGID task and clarify the privacy concerns associated with storing previous data. Additionally, we suggest conducting comparative analyses with existing methods to strengthen the validation of the PLRD method. Addressing the clarity of the main arguments and enhancing the presentation of diagrams for consistency would also benefit the paper.
