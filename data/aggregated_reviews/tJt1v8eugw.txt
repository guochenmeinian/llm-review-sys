### Key Points
This paper presents the task of multi-defendant legal judgment prediction (LJP) to advance LJP systems from single-defendant to multi-defendant scenarios. The authors propose a Hierarchical Reasoning Network (HRN) to analyze criminal relationships, sentencing circumstances, law articles, charges, and penalties for each defendant. Additionally, they introduce MultiLJP, the first real-world dataset for multi-defendant LJP tasks, with experimental results demonstrating the effectiveness of their method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The authors address the multi-defendant LJP tasks and provide a novel real-world dataset.
2. The Hierarchical Reasoning Network (HRN) is a unique approach that employs multi-step reasoning for judgment predictions.

Weaknesses:
1. The writing lacks clarity, particularly in defining criminal relationships and sentencing circumstances, which are not well articulated.
2. The Forward prediction and Backward verification processes appear similar, suggesting a redundancy in the proposed methods.
3. The dataset's consistency with real-world case distributions is questionable, and the applicability of the method in daily counseling scenarios remains unclear.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of definitions for criminal relationships and sentencing circumstances to enhance reader understanding. Additionally, we suggest clarifying the differences between Forward prediction and Backward verification to avoid confusion. It would be beneficial for the authors to demonstrate the method's effectiveness in real-world scenarios and explore the potential integration of LLM's CoT capability with the Hierarchical Reasoning approach. Finally, the authors should consider how the inclusion of criminal relationships and sentencing circumstances as inputs affects final judgment predictions and whether the HRN can be adapted for single-defendant cases.
