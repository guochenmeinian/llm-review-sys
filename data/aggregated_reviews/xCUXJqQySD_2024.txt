### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for creating patient-specific digital twins using non-invasive health data, specifically focusing on cardiac hemodynamics. The authors propose a physics-informed self-supervised learning (SSL) algorithm that pretrains a neural network to learn a differentiable simulator of cardiac processes. Subsequently, another model reconstructs physiological measurements from non-invasive data, constrained by physical equations learned during pretraining. This approach demonstrates potential in unsupervised disease detection and in-silico clinical trials using echocardiogram videos.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
* The method utilizes non-invasive data, enhancing patient safety and comfort while broadening the applicability of digital twin technology.
* The inclusion of a physics-based model during training improves model accuracy.
* The framework allows for detailed simulations of physiological conditions, facilitating personalized medicine applications.

Weaknesses:
* Simplifications in the Windkessel and LVAD models may not fully capture heart dynamics.
* The performance comparison is limited, focusing only on PINN and Neural ODE methods without exploring other variations of PINNs.
* The lack of demographic diversity in the echocardiography dataset raises concerns about the model's generalizability.
* Insufficient validation of inferred physical parameters and the absence of an ablation study weaken the findings.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the validation of their inferred physical parameters by providing more solid comparisons and addressing the lack of ground-truth validation. Additionally, the authors should consider conducting an ablation study to justify the necessity of their two-stage training strategy. It would also be beneficial to explore the use of other non-invasive techniques, such as electrocardiograms, and to assess the model's performance with multiple modalities of non-invasive data. Finally, we suggest that the authors broaden the application examples beyond cardiac hemodynamics to demonstrate the generalizability of their method.
