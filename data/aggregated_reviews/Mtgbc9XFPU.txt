### Key Points
This paper presents a novel Pre-trained Intent-aware Encoder (PIE) method that enhances intent classification (IC) in task-oriented dialogue systems by utilizing contrastive learning with pseudo intent labels. The authors propose an innovative algorithm for generating pseudo intent names from utterances across various dialogue datasets, which aids in creating a pre-training dataset. The PIE model demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in N-way zero- and one-shot settings across multiple intent classification datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper introduces a unique pre-training approach that effectively leverages contrastive learning and intent pseudo-labels, achieving notable improvements in intent classification performance.  
- The motivation for using intent role labeling to generate pseudo intents is well-articulated, and the methodology is clearly presented with detailed results.  
- The paper is well-structured and written, providing sufficient support for its claims.

Weaknesses:  
- The proposed method closely resembles existing approaches, lacking a thorough comparison with state-of-the-art models and other zero-shot intent-classification models.  
- The definitions of intent roles may not capture all nuances across various domains, and the overlap of roles could complicate the tagging process.  
- The treatment of positive and negative pairs in contrastive learning may introduce ambiguity and noise, potentially affecting performance.  
- The dependency on the RoBERTa-base model raises concerns about the generalizability of the results, suggesting the need for an ablation study.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve their comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods and other zero-shot intent-classification models, such as those referenced in the reviews. Additionally, we suggest refining the definitions of intent roles to better capture domain-specific nuances and conducting an ablation study to assess the impact of different models on the IRL tagger's performance. Clarifying the treatment of positive and negative pairs in the contrastive learning framework could also enhance the robustness of the findings.
