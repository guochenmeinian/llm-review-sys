Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel self-supervised method for reconstructing high-quality video from sparse binary quanta image data produced by single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) arrays. The authors adapt a self-supervised denoising algorithm called GAP, extending it to spatiotemporal structures and introducing a masked loss to address correlation issues between input and target images. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, such as Quanta Burst Photography (QBP), in reconstruction quality and throughput. Additionally, the paper introduces a new dataset of real SPAD high-speed videos, showcasing the method's potential for broader applications beyond quanta image sensors.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The method effectively utilizes spatiotemporal information and features a novel masked loss function that addresses input-target correlation, demonstrating superiority over existing methods like QBP.
2. As a self-supervised algorithm, it does not require large-scale synthetic datasets, enhancing flexibility and convenience.
3. The introduction of a new SPAD dataset is valuable for the research community.

Weaknesses:
1. There is confusion in Equation 1 regarding the variables x_{in} and x_{inp}, and the right side appears to overlook x_{tar}.
2. The paper lacks clarity in several sections, making it difficult to understand the proposed method and its implications.
3. The experimental results are not sufficiently rigorous, with limited comparisons to existing methods beyond QBP.
4. Crucial implementation details, such as the composition and size of the training dataset, are absent, and the runtime and memory requirements of the method compared to existing approaches are not analyzed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the presentation of the method, particularly in Equation 1, by correcting the variable confusion. Additionally, providing specific data on the rotation speed of the fan and light intensity in high-speed, low-light scenarios would enhance the application context. The authors should also include a comprehensive comparison with other existing quanta video reconstruction methods beyond QBP, along with quantitative results. More detailed explanations regarding the computational workload, including the number of iterations and runtime analysis, are necessary. Finally, we suggest conducting extensive ablation studies to explore the impact of various components of the method, such as network architecture choices and hyperparameters, to provide deeper insights into its performance.
