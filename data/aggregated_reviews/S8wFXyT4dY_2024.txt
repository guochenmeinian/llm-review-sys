Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Parametric Piecewise Linear Networks (PPLNs), a novel neural network architecture inspired by biological principles for event-based temporal modeling. The authors propose modeling neuron membrane potentials as parametric piecewise linear functions with learnable coefficients, which enhances adaptability. Experimental results indicate that PPLNs achieve state-of-the-art performance in tasks such as steering prediction, human pose estimation, and motion deblurring, demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency over existing methods.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
1. The topic of bio-inspired parametric piecewise linear networks for temporal modeling is novel and attractive.  
2. The authors provide sufficient experiments, including ablation studies, to clarify the contributions of different components of PPLNs.  
3. The writing is straightforward, clear, and easy to understand.  

Weaknesses:  
1. The paper lacks a thorough analysis of the computational complexity of PPLNs, including inference time on the three downstream tasks.  
2. There is insufficient exploration of how closely PPLNs mimic neuronal behavior, and claims about their applicability to conventional frame-based tasks are not well-supported.  
3. The authors did not compare PPLNs with some of the latest event-based deblurring algorithms, such as REFID, nor did they provide a direct comparative experiment using a KAN-based backbone.  
4. A detailed sensitivity analysis of hyperparameters influencing PPLNs is missing, raising concerns about robustness and reproducibility.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the analysis of the computational complexity of PPLNs, including providing inference times for the three downstream tasks. Additionally, the authors should conduct a direct comparison with the latest event-based deblurring algorithms and include a KAN-based backbone in their experiments. A more comprehensive exploration of the biological plausibility of PPLNs is necessary, along with a detailed sensitivity analysis of key hyperparameters. Finally, we suggest enhancing the discussion on the applicability of PPLNs to conventional frame-based tasks to provide stronger evidence of their generalizability.
