Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for learning a time-dependent gradient vector field that describes particle evolution in state space, based on the action-matching framework. The authors propose using high-order quadrature rules for evaluating nested integrals in the objective, demonstrating the framework's forecasting ability across diverse high-dimensional examples. The results indicate that it outperforms other diffusion-based and flow-based models in both inference runtime and accuracy. The authors focus on learning models for population dynamics in parameterized physical systems, leveraging the Benamou-Brenier formula to transport probability density over time, enabling the generation of sample trajectories.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The development of efficient and high-fidelity surrogate models is significant for computational science and engineering.  
- The paper is well-written, with adequate references to related works, and presents compelling numerical experiments that show state-of-the-art performance.  
- The use of higher-order quadrature rules enhances training stability and accuracy, significantly reducing inference runtime compared to standard methods.  

Weaknesses:  
- The primary methodological contribution appears limited to the application of a higher-order quadrature scheme for nested integrals.  
- The paper lacks clarity regarding the complexity of the proposed model and its assumptions, particularly concerning the O(Kτ) complexity and the framework's relation to simulation-free strategies.  
- The requirement for a dense set of time points for Gauss-Legendre quadrature may limit practical applicability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by elaborating on the O(Kτ) complexity and how it relates to the proposed framework. Additionally, please clarify whether this framework serves as a simulation-free strategy for training a Continuous Normalizing Flow adapted for multiple snapshots. We suggest including a discussion on the stability of the learned velocity during inference time. Furthermore, adding a color bar in Figure 5 and labeling the curves in Figure 4 would enhance interpretability. Lastly, we encourage the authors to provide a more detailed explanation of the choice of dynamical systems in the numerical experiments to better contextualize their relevance.
