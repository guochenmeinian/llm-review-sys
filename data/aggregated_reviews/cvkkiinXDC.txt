### Key Points
This paper presents a privacy-preserving tool designed to capture user interactions with news on Facebook, addressing the challenge of limited data access on closed social media platforms. The authors collected data from 472 U.S. participants and examined interactions across four types of news exposure (selective, incidental, algorithmic, and targeted), two types of interaction (visible and hidden), and three types of news sources (factual, fake, and under-the-dog). The findings indicate that users often encounter misinformation due to their active selection of low-quality news sources and show a willingness to engage with opposing political ideologies, particularly in hidden interactions.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The authors have developed a crucial tool for auditing news exposure on Facebook, significantly contributing to the research field.
- The methodology is robust, with a comprehensive classification of news sources and interactions that enhances the study's depth and clarity.
- The paper presents numerous interesting findings regarding user behavior and news consumption.

Weaknesses:
- The inclusion of 404 news domains may introduce bias, leading to a higher fraction of posts from under-the-dog news sources.
- The study's liberal dominance among participants could limit the generalizability of the findings; a more balanced representation across political ideologies is needed.
- Some methodological steps lack clarity, and the small user sample size may affect the robustness of the conclusions.
- There is insufficient detail on the statistical tests performed, and the text lacks formality in certain areas.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their methodological steps and provide more details on the statistical tests conducted. Increasing the sample size would enhance the robustness of the findings. Additionally, we suggest that the authors address the potential bias introduced by the selection of news domains and consider a more balanced participant representation across political ideologies. It would also be beneficial to reference previous works on tracking Facebook users, such as Facebook Tracking Exposed, to contextualize their contributions. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the use of bots to validate their conjectures regarding diversity and biases in news exposure.
