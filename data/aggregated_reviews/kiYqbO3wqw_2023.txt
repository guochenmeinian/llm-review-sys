Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the Mind2Web dataset, designed to train agents to complete tasks based on instructions across various websites. It includes over 2,000 complex tasks from 137 real websites across 31 domains, formulated as high-level goals. The authors propose MindAct, a two-stage training process utilizing both small and large language models (LMs) to filter elements and predict actions. The evaluation of MindAct on Mind2Web reveals challenges in generalization, particularly on held-out domains and websites.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The Mind2Web dataset is larger and more diverse than previous datasets, enhancing its utility for generalization in web tasks.
- The formulation of tasks as high-level goals reflects real user interactions more accurately.
- The paper is well-written, providing clear documentation and a comprehensive review of prior work.

**Weaknesses:**
- MindAct lacks comparisons with existing models, such as DOM-Q-Net, which would clarify its performance relative to prior efforts.
- The performance on held-out websites and domains is notably low, suggesting either the complexity of the tasks or limitations in the dataset's diversity.
- The evaluation metrics focus solely on exact matches, potentially overlooking partial correctness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison of MindAct against existing models to provide context for its performance. Additionally, presenting results for Flan-T5 in a zero-shot setting would facilitate comparisons with ChatGPT. The authors should also consider including results from existing datasets to quantitatively demonstrate Mind2Web's challenges. Furthermore, providing more general background information on LLMs would benefit a wider audience. Lastly, we suggest addressing the ethical implications of the dataset and its usage more thoroughly, including guidelines for responsible web automation practices.
