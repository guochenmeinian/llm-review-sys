### Key Points
This paper presents a method to address the challenges posed by "trolls" who provide malicious feedback to chatbots, leading to inappropriate responses. The authors propose using latent class analysis (LCA) inspired by automated essay scoring (AES) to infer accurate labels from user ratings. This approach aims to overcome the limitations of traditional cross-validation (CV), which is computationally expensive and vulnerable to coordinated troll attacks. Experimental results indicate that the LCA method is effective, particularly when trolls provide consistent feedback, although its performance diminishes with random feedback.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The writing style is excellent, with concise language and clear logic.
- The paper addresses a crucial issue in chatbot safety, making it relevant to both industry and society.
- The LCA method is computationally light and cost-effective compared to GPU-intensive methods.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental comparisons are weak, lacking a comparison with stronger baselines such as Ju et al. 2022.
- The dataset size is small, raising concerns about the scalability of the proposed approach.
- The method's effectiveness relies on strong assumptions about troll behavior, which may not hold in real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the experimental design by including comparisons with baseline models, particularly Ju et al. 2022, to strengthen the empirical claims. Additionally, addressing the dataset size and exploring its scalability would enhance the robustness of the findings. Clarifying the assumptions regarding troll behavior and providing quantitative evidence from real-world scenarios would also improve the paper's validity. Finally, we suggest organizing the experiments section more clearly to enhance readability.
