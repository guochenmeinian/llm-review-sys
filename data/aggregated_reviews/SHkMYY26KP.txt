### Key Points
This paper presents a position on the extent to which language models can be said to ‘understand’ language, analyzing general language understanding through interactivity and familiarity. The authors propose three desiderata for modeling understanding in language models and conclude that while modeling is feasible, language models do not exhibit true ‘understanding’. The paper also contributes theoretical insights regarding the empirical methods for natural language understanding, addressing issues related to General Language Understanding (GLU) and its relation to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). 

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-structured, written, and timely, addressing a highly relevant topic in the field.  
- It surveys extensive literature and proposes an outline that could draw community attention to significant issues in language understanding, such as conversation, language acquisition, and machine reasoning transparency.  
- The study provides sufficient support for its claims, deepening understanding of the subject matter.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper's contributions may be misplaced for a conference focused on empirical methods, lacking convincing argumentation and failing to engage with relevant literature on sub-symbolic AI.  
- The information is often presented in condensed forms, making it difficult for readers unfamiliar with the summarized works to follow.  
- Some definitions and theoretical principles require further expansion for improved readability and self-containment.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Desideratum 2 by rewriting it to be standalone. Additionally, we suggest providing more straightforward explanations and technical examples to illustrate how the discussed understanding can be implemented in real life. It would also be beneficial to engage more thoroughly with relevant literature, particularly concerning sub-symbolic AI, including references to Pearl's work and philosophical discussions on machine agency. Expanding definitions and theoretical principles could enhance the paper's readability and self-containment.
