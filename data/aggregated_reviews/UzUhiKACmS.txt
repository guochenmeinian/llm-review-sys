Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a distance-based privacy notion called rho-dist-DP, which aims to protect individual data points that move within a specified distance (rho) in a metric space. The authors propose a new algorithm for k-means and k-median clustering that leverages rho-dist-DP, demonstrating improved utility compared to traditional differential privacy (DP) approaches. The theoretical foundation includes a generalization of prior work, and empirical evidence supports the algorithm's performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The distance-based DP framework offers a promising alternative to traditional DP, potentially reducing the utility cost associated with privacy.
- The paper is generally well-structured and provides experimental results on real-world datasets.
- The proposed algorithms for k-means and k-median problems effectively protect privacy while achieving good performance.

Weaknesses:
- The primary inquiry regarding the performance improvement from relaxing DP to a distance-based notion is straightforward, as rho can recover regular DP when set to the diameter of the metric space.
- The paper does not adequately address the interpolating nature of the distance parameter (rho), which is crucial for understanding the algorithm's consistency.
- Sections 3-5 lack clarity in explaining the proposed algorithm, with insufficient illustrations or examples.
- The relaxed definition of distance-based privacy is strictly local, leading to potential inconsistencies in privacy protection across different locations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of Sections 3-5 by incorporating illustrations or concrete examples to enhance understanding. Additionally, the authors should provide a more thorough discussion on the choice of the distance parameter (rho) and its implications for privacy protection. It would be beneficial to compare rho-dist-DP against d_X-privacy rather than classical DP, as the latter serves only as a limiting case. Furthermore, the authors should address the limitations of their method more carefully, particularly regarding the interpolation character of rho and its impact on algorithm performance. Lastly, including the performance of the previous algorithm [25] in experiments would strengthen the claims of improvement.
