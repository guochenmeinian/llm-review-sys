### Key Points
This paper presents a system for generating children's stories that adhere to vocabulary constraints based on the age of acquisition of words. The authors investigate whether selected LLMs can produce stories that meet these constraints and find that they often exceed the desired age level. To remedy this, they apply lexical simplification models to the LLM-generated outputs, yielding stories that satisfy the age-of-acquisition requirements. The study includes two main components: evaluating LLMs' performance in generating age-appropriate stories and assessing the effectiveness of lexical simplification systems.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The study is well-motivated and addresses a practical need for generating customized children's stories, potentially enhancing reading abilities.
- The authors utilize the English Lexicon Projectâ€™s Age of Acquisition dataset to define lexical constraints, allowing for clear evaluation of generated stories.
- The paper contributes valuable insights into the limitations of LLMs for young children's literature and explores effective lexical simplification methods.

Weaknesses:
- The two-stage pipelined approach lacks comparative analysis with LLM-only or LS-only methods, weakening claims about its effectiveness.
- The design and purpose of the new dataset, CDS, are inadequately detailed, raising questions about its added value compared to the existing BfP dataset.
- The use of readability measures, particularly the Flesch Readability Ease, is problematic for the targeted age group, leading to potential misinterpretations of the BfP corpus's suitability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparative analysis of their two-stage approach by including evaluations against LLM-only and LS-only methods. Clarifying the design and purpose of the CDS dataset is essential; specifically, the authors should provide details on the source stories and the nature of the simplifications. Additionally, we suggest addressing the limitations of the Flesch Readability Ease measure for the target age group and providing more context on the BfP corpus, including its authorship and the nature of the vocabulary not found in the AoA dataset. Finally, we advise refining the language in the conclusions to accurately reflect the performance metrics of the LLMs.
