### Key Points
This paper presents a set of 13 linguistically-motivated morphological probes designed to assess inflectional morphology in English, Spanish, and Swahili. The authors aim to evaluate how well models generalize morphological patterns, moving beyond language-independent methods to incorporate language-specific features. They explore the impact of ambiguous examples and assess model performance on out-of-vocabulary (OOV) data, concluding that their probes effectively reveal the strengths and weaknesses of morphological inflection models.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, with a clear and structured presentation of methods and ideas.
- It introduces language-specific, linguistically-informed experiments across three languages with distinct morphological features.
- The experimental setup is technically sound, including thorough comparisons and evaluations of different models and data splits.
- Statistical analysis supports the significance of model and language factors on the results.

Weaknesses:
- The term "cognitive" is used somewhat unnecessarily, as its relevance to the paper's claims is questionable.
- Some explanations of the probes are condensed and difficult to follow, potentially hindering reader comprehension.
- Specific details regarding the selection of probes and the performance of certain models, particularly the ENC-DEC model, are not adequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the explanations regarding the selection of specific probes, possibly by providing qualitative examples in a figure. Additionally, we suggest addressing the performance discrepancies of the ENC-DEC model in Spanish and Swahili, including insights into its underperformance and implications for character-level models. Finally, consider revising the use of the term "cognitive" to avoid ambiguity in its application to the study.
