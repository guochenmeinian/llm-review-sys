Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to address the challenges of imbalanced data in federated learning (FL) by optimizing the AUC score through the proposed momentum-based algorithm, LocalSCGDAM. The authors investigate the federated compositional AUC maximization problem, which encompasses both local and global imbalanced distributions, and establish state-of-the-art convergence rates. Various experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-organized and easy to follow, with clear notations and a complete theoretical analysis.  
- It introduces a new algorithm that effectively tackles the federated compositional AUC maximization problem, which is a significant advancement in addressing data heterogeneity in FL.  

Weaknesses:  
- The motivation for the significance of AUC and its relevance in FL is insufficiently articulated.  
- The experimental setup lacks diversity in imbalanced data settings, as all samples are set to 0.1.  
- The paper does not consider several existing state-of-the-art methods that address non-IID challenges in FL, which may limit the comprehensiveness of the comparisons.  
- The theoretical analysis relies on assumptions regarding the outer-level and inner-level functions that may not be realistic.  
- The algorithm's applicability in client sampling settings is questionable, as it may not perform well under such conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the motivation section by clearly explaining why AUC is significant and why it should be considered in the context of FL. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct experiments with varying imbalanced data settings to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their algorithm. It is also advisable to include comparisons with established methods such as FedProx and Scaffold to strengthen the baseline analysis. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the assumptions made in the theoretical analysis and discuss their realism. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the algorithm's performance in client sampling scenarios and provide relevant experimental results.
