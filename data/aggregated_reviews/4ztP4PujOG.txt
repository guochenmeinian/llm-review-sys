Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a motion graph method for predicting video frames by capturing spatio-temporal relationships among frames from limited data. The authors propose a novel motion graph representation that transforms video frame patches into interconnected graph nodes, improving performance and reducing computational costs compared to state-of-the-art methods on datasets like UCF Sports, KITTI, and Cityscapes. The evaluation includes metrics such as LPIPS, SSIM, and PSNR, although detailed explanations of these results are lacking.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The introduction of few-shot prediction techniques for video inputs is significant.
2. Comprehensive evaluations across multiple datasets demonstrate superior performance compared to prior methods.
3. The manuscript is well-organized and presents detailed experimental results.

Weaknesses:
1. The paper lacks detailed information about the dataset setups for KITTI and Cityscapes.
2. There is insufficient evaluation of the method's performance in handling occlusion and out-of-view scenarios.
3. The inference speed is slower compared to optimized methods like DMVFN.
4. The method struggles with abrupt or unpredictable motions and does not adequately address the stochastic nature of human videos.
5. A component-wise ablation study is missing, making it difficult to identify effective parts of the methodology.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the dataset setups for KITTI and Cityscapes. Additionally, the authors should provide a thorough evaluation of the method's performance in complex scenarios involving occlusions and out-of-view objects. To enhance the manuscript, we suggest including a component-wise ablation study to isolate the impact of each module. Furthermore, the authors should consider adding an overview figure to illustrate the overall framework and improve the readability of figures 2-4. Lastly, a more comprehensive discussion on the limitations, particularly regarding long-term video prediction and comparisons with other motion-cues-guided methods, would strengthen the paper.
