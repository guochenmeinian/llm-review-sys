Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a Semi-Supervised Federated Object Detection (SSFOD) framework, addressing the challenges of limited high-quality labels and non-IID client data in federated learning. The authors propose a two-stage strategy, FedSTO, which includes selective training and orthogonal enhancement to improve model performance. The framework achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in scenarios where clients possess only unlabeled data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-motivated, addressing the practical need to leverage unlabeled data in federated learning.
- Clear writing and organization make the paper easy to follow.
- Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate the proposed method's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
- The discussion on communication efficiency and scalability is lacking, particularly regarding the overhead of uploading backbone parameters and the impact of increasing client numbers.
- The novelty is limited, primarily integrating existing methods without sufficient differentiation from related works.
- Key components and algorithms are not adequately explained, such as the rationale for using Yolov5 and the training loss functions during selective training.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the "Personalized Pseudo Labeling for Unlabeled Clients" section to enhance understanding. Additionally, a more thorough comparison with existing semi-supervised and self-supervised federated learning methods is necessary to highlight the advantages of the proposed approach. The authors should also consider including a federated setting with fully labeled data for comparison and assess the performance on a global test set to evaluate generalization capabilities. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to quantify the computational resources employed and clarify the rationale behind the choice of Yolov5, as well as the implications of using augmentations on unlabeled images. Lastly, addressing the completeness of the reference list and discussing limitations explicitly would strengthen the paper.
