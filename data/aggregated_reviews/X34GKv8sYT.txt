### Key Points
This paper presents a Lorentz-equivariant transformer (L-GATr) designed for high-energy physics applications, extending the Geometric Algebra Transformer (GATr) from \(E(3)\) equivariance to the Lorentz group. The authors propose a generative model based on Riemannian flow matching for particle data and evaluate L-GATr on various tasks, including quantum field theory amplitude surrogates and event reconstruction. The main contribution lies in providing a software library and a series of numerical experiments, although it does not introduce a fundamentally new model.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper effectively combines innovative ideas with advanced machine learning models, making it a valuable tool for the AI4science and AI4physics communities.  
- It is well-written, with a strong motivation for the proposed model and clear distinctions from existing research.  
- The L-GATr is shown to be more data-efficient than baseline methods and scalable, with demonstrated benefits of Riemannian flow matching over Euclidean approaches.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper lacks self-containment, requiring more comprehensive explanations of its technical aspects, particularly regarding the Lorentz equivariant model's inputs and outputs, and the flow-matching approach.  
- The performance in some experiments, such as top tagging, is marginally worse than baseline methods, and the effects of symmetry-breaking data are not well studied.  
- The presentation may be challenging for those without a physics background, and the model's computational overhead raises concerns about its practicality.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing detailed explanations of the Lorentz equivariant model, including the nature of inputs, outputs, and how they relate to queries, values, and keys. Additionally, a clearer definition of the flow-matching approach is necessary, along with explicit statements of modifications made for Lorentz equivariance in the transformer framework. Addressing the scientific goals of the experiments in the context of high-energy physics would enhance the paper's clarity and usability. Furthermore, including comparisons with traditional sampling methods could strengthen the evaluation of the proposed model's efficiency.
