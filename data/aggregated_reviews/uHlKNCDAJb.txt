Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents ScenarioNet, an open-source platform designed for the integration and simulation of large-scale driving datasets. The framework proposes a unified scenario description that facilitates the integration of diverse data sources, including procedurally-simulated scenarios and real-world driving logs. It supports various operations such as raw data conversion, merging, and filtering, ultimately producing curated databases for enhanced autonomous driving research. The authors demonstrate the framework's capabilities through experiments involving database construction, visualization, reinforcement learning (RL) policies, multi-agent cooperative learning, and an autonomous driving (AD) stack test using a ROS bridge. Additionally, the paper includes a comprehensive update to ScenarioNet, incorporating a new nuplan+pg w/ curriculum experiment that demonstrates improved policy learning through the aggregation of synthetic scenarios. The authors propose enhancements to visual fidelity in closed-loop simulations by utilizing raw sensor data and exploring connections with platforms like Unreal Engine and Nvidia Omniverse. They also address technical limitations, including the CPU-based operation of ScenarioNet and the absence of differential simulation.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**
- The modular design of ScenarioNet allows users to adapt the platform to specific research needs, enhancing flexibility.
- It serves as a benchmark for evaluating the safety of autonomous driving systems in simulation, utilizing diverse real-world traffic behaviors.
- The introduction of a new experiment effectively balances training datasets and enhances agent performance.
- Plans for improving visual fidelity through advanced sensor simulation techniques, including NeRF and geometry reconstruction.
- The authors' proactive approach to addressing technical limitations and their commitment to enhancing documentation.

**Weaknesses:**
- The role of ScenarioNet and its flexibility in integrating various datasets requires further clarification.
- The advancements in machine learning facilitated by ScenarioNet lack specific metrics or comparative studies to demonstrate effectiveness.
- The visual analysis using t-SNE is limited by its non-deterministic nature, potentially leading to varying results across different runs.
- The current CPU implementation lacks clarity on multi-threading capabilities, potentially limiting performance.
- The existing documentation is minimal and requires further development to meet user needs.
- The potential confusion arising from the combination of success rate and out of road metrics with mean velocity could hinder clarity.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of how the unified scene description format aids in integrating various driving datasets and detail how users can extend the platform for additional features. It would be beneficial to quantify advancements in machine learning with specific metrics and comparative studies to illustrate ScenarioNet's effectiveness. Additionally, we suggest providing a more thorough explanation of the evaluation criteria and testing methodologies, especially for the AD stack. The authors should also clarify the relationship between ScenarioNet and TrafficSim, including licensing details. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of the framework, including potential performance bottlenecks and user-friendly interfaces, would enhance the paper's comprehensiveness. We recommend improving the clarity regarding the CPU implementation's ability to exploit multi-threading and enhancing the documentation to include detailed explanations of the internal scenario description, API reference, system design, and guidelines for third-party contributions, along with illustrative examples for importing new datasets, running simulations, and training models. Lastly, we suggest that the authors improve the clarity of the graph by dividing the combined metrics to enhance readability and provide more detailed information on the simulation process in the documentation, particularly for sections still marked as todo.
