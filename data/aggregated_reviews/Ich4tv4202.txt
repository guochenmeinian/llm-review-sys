Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents WILDGUARD, a novel moderation tool for LLM safety that identifies malicious intents in user prompts, detects safety risks in model responses, and assesses the model's refusal rate. WILDGUARD introduces a comprehensive dataset, WILDGUARDMIX, containing 92k labeled examples across 13 safety risk categories, and demonstrates superior performance compared to existing moderation tools, including Llama-Guard2 and GPT-4.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- WILDGUARD outperforms existing open-source moderation tools, particularly in identifying harm in adversarial prompts and evaluating model refusals.
- The authors curated a high-quality dataset, WILDGUARDMIX, which will serve as a valuable resource for future moderation tool development.
- The paper provides extensive evaluation results against various baselines, showcasing strong performance across key metrics.
- The documentation is thorough, and the dataset is publicly available.

Weaknesses:
- The disaggregated scoring system may overlook the interdependence of prompt and response safety; an overall safety rating would enhance evaluation.
- Limitations and ethical considerations are primarily discussed in the appendix rather than the main text.
- The dataset's reliance on GPT-4 for generation raises concerns about diversity and potential biases.
- The prompt construction process for the dataset lacks clarity, necessitating a more detailed explanation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by incorporating a general overall safety rating to address the interdependence of prompt and response safety. Additionally, we suggest moving the discussion of limitations and ethical considerations from the appendix to the main text for better visibility. Clarifying the prompt construction process in detail is essential, especially given its significance to the dataset's integrity. Lastly, a more comprehensive discussion on the implications of using GPT-4 in dataset generation would be beneficial.
