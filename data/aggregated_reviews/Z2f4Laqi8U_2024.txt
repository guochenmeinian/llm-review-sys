Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a greedy structure learning algorithm for causal structure discovery in ancestral graphs, utilizing a score function based on normalized likelihood and a novel likelihood decomposition through ac-connected subsets. The authors propose a hybrid causal discovery method, although the implementation relies on approximate local scores rather than exact likelihood scores. Limited experimental results are provided, raising concerns about the robustness of the findings.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The multivariate cross-entropy decomposition is well-explained, linking its definition to applications in ancestral graphs, allowing for flexible scoring criteria.
- The use of ac-connecting paths and ac-connected subsets for likelihood decomposition (Theorem 1) is a significant contribution, mapping ancestral graph structures to specific estimands.
- The paper is clearly written, and the likelihood decomposition is novel and potentially useful for future research.

Weaknesses:
- The experimental evidence is limited, with few reference models and sparse hyperparameter exploration, raising questions about the robustness of the findings.
- The performance of the proposed solution is subpar, with metrics overlapping significantly with existing solutions.
- The fixed sample size in experiments, particularly with a sample of 100 for BARLEY (114,005 parameters), is unrealistic and limits the experimental evidence.
- The novelty of Theorem 1 is questionable due to overlaps with prior works, and the paper lacks a clear connection between theoretical results and the proposed algorithm.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the readability of Figure 1 by isolating different edge pattern combinations with horizontal lines. Additionally, the authors should provide more comprehensive experimental results, including efficiency comparisons and a broader range of benchmark models. Clarifying the computational complexity of finding ac-connected subsets and elaborating on the performance differences between approximate local scores and exact scores would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we suggest that the authors address the convergence guarantees of their algorithm more explicitly, detailing the number of steps required for convergence and the sensitivity of the algorithm to noise.
