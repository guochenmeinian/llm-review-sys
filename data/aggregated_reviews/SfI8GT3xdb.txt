### Key Points
This paper presents the Chain-of-Questions framework, which enhances multistep question answering by generating and answering sub-questions. The authors propose a novel approach that treats sub-answers as latent variables, utilizing a dynamic mixture of Hard-EM and MAPO for inference. The framework demonstrates significant performance improvements, outperforming neuro-symbolic methods by 9.0 F1 on the DROP contrast set and exceeding GPT-3.5 by 24.3 F1 on the HotpotQA adversarial set. The paper addresses the challenge of lacking annotated sub-question answers through its innovative technical solution, contributing valuable advancements to the field.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The Chain-of-Questions framework introduces a novel approach to multistep question answering, distinguishing it from existing methods.
- The results indicate substantial performance gains across various evaluation sets, showcasing the framework's robustness.
- The technical solution for handling sub-answers as latent variables enhances the framework's applicability.

Weaknesses:
- The evaluation metrics are limited, and a broader range would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the framework's performance.
- The absence of evaluation on real-world datasets may restrict the practical impact of the proposed framework.
- The complexity of the dynamic mixture of Hard-EM and MAPO may hinder implementation, necessitating clearer guidance for researchers.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a wider range of metrics and testing on real-world datasets to enhance the practical applicability of the framework. Additionally, providing further details or simplifications regarding the implementation of the dynamic mixture of Hard-EM and MAPO would facilitate easier adoption by researchers. Lastly, exploring generalization to other datasets without QDMR decomposition would strengthen the paper's contributions.
