### Key Points
This paper presents a study of convex resource allocation problems with private utilities and constraints, proposing a simple algorithm that applies mirror descent to the dual problem while assuming exact updates of primal variables. The main technical result is an improvement in the utility bound, enhancing the dependency on the number of constraints. Additionally, the paper addresses the allocation problem under Joint Differential Privacy, deriving results using weak duality and improving the optimality gap with strong duality, while establishing a lower bound for feasible allocations.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper is well-written, and the technical results are interesting.
- The class of convex problems considered is well-motivated and relevant in practice.
- The work effectively distinguishes between weak and strong duality, achieving significant improvements in utility bounds.

Weaknesses:
- Algorithm 1 assumes exact maximization, which may not hold for the general class of problems analyzed, making Table 1 potentially misleading. The authors should allow inexact updates or clarify this assumption.
- The near-optimality claim is not justified, as the lower bound assumes feasibility while the utility upper bound pertains to infeasible solutions.
- The dependence on $\underline{b}$ in Theorem 3.10 raises concerns about the trade-off between utility improvement and feasibility, which could be problematic depending on the instance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity in the abstract regarding the derivation of the lower bound using strong duality. Additionally, the authors should address the comparison between upper and lower bounds, particularly the extra $m$ factor in the lower bound. It would be beneficial to provide high-probability results for constraint violation upper bounds and clarify the choice of set $\mathcal{W}$ under quadratic potential. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors keep both suboptimality and constraint violation results in a bi-criteria sense for better interpretability. Lastly, the authors should ensure that all quantities are defined for self-containment and clarify the discussion on public versus private information earlier in the paper.
