Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework of Time-Constrained Robust MDPs (TC-RMDPs) to tackle the conservativeness of traditional robust reinforcement learning (RL) under rectangularity assumptions. The authors propose three algorithms that accommodate time-dependent, correlated disturbances in dynamics. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that these algorithms outperform conventional robust RL methods in balancing performance and robustness.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed framework effectively addresses major drawbacks of existing robust RL approaches, particularly the over-conservativeness stemming from dynamic and rectangular uncertainty sets.
- The authors provide formal theoretical guarantees for the proposed algorithms, which enhances their credibility.
- Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of the algorithms across various continuous control benchmarks.

Weaknesses:
- The complexity of the proposed algorithms, especially Oracle-TC, may hinder their practical applicability in real-world scenarios where complete environmental information is often unavailable.
- The assumption that the transition parameter vector $\psi$ is known during training poses limitations, as this may not be feasible in practice.
- The usefulness of the framework is questionable due to challenges in constructing complex uncertainty sets with time and state-action correlation.
- The evaluation results indicate instability, with the oracle-TC not consistently outperforming other methods, raising concerns about robustness.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their evaluation by providing more detailed analyses of the performance stability of the algorithms, particularly regarding the oracle-TC method. Additionally, we suggest including ablation studies to explore the selection of the Lipschitz constant $L$ in practical scenarios. Visualizations contrasting traditional independent transitions with time-constrained parametric transitions would enhance understanding. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to report the average of the worst 10% of episodes in the experiments to mitigate stochasticity concerns. Lastly, we advise correcting typographical errors and ensuring that all claims, such as the rarity of rectangularity assumptions in real-world scenarios, are well-supported with evidence or references.
