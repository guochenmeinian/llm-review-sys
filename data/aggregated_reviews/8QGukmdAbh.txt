### Key Points
This paper presents an analysis of hyperparameter tuning in linear and logistic regression models, focusing on the sample complexity of tuning regularization parameters under l1 and l2 constraints. The authors propose three novel learning guarantees regarding the pseudo-dimension of the validation loss function class, including improved upper and matching lower bounds for elastic net and logistic regression. The work aims to enhance understanding and provide theoretical guarantees in the context of multiple datasets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides improved upper bounds for the pseudo-dimension of the validation loss function class, contributing to a better understanding of sample complexity in regression models.
- The theoretical results are solid, with a nearly matched lower bound, and the analysis extends to logistic regression, which is a valuable addition to the field.
- The writing is generally clear, and the importance of hyperparameter tuning is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks clarity in explaining the problem setting, making it difficult for readers to grasp the main ideas without consulting external sources.
- There is no experimental validation to support the theoretical findings, which diminishes the practical relevance of the work.
- The excessive repetition of formulas and absence of visual aids hinder comprehension, and minor typographical errors are present.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the problem setting by providing more detailed explanations and examples familiar to machine learners, such as cross-validation scenarios. Additionally, including experimental validation would strengthen the paper's findings and demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed approach. We also suggest incorporating visual aids to enhance understanding and addressing minor typographical errors for consistency.
