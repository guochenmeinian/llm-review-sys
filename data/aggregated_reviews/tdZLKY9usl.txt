Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents InfoScissors, a defense strategy aimed at minimizing mutual information between a model's inner states and the inputs/outputs of resource-constrained IoT devices in collaborative inference settings. The authors evaluate InfoScissors against common datasets like CIFAR10/100 and various attacks, demonstrating its superiority over existing defense strategies. The paper also includes a theoretical analysis to support the proposed method. However, it raises concerns regarding the novelty of the approach, as it closely follows previous studies on Mutual Information (MI) regularization.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The study addresses a significant privacy issue in collaborative inference.  
- The paper is well-written, easy to follow, and relevant to the ML community.  
- The algorithm is supported by both empirical and theoretical evidence, suggesting state-of-the-art performance.  

Weaknesses:  
- The novelty of InfoScissors is limited, relying on MI regularization previously explored in studies like MID.  
- Evaluation of adaptive attacks is insufficient, raising doubts about the robustness of InfoScissors.  
- The paper only evaluates on simple benchmarks (CIFAR10/100) without exploring larger datasets or diverse model architectures.  
- The distinction between training and inference stages is unclear, and the motivation for the problem needs further elaboration.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation of adaptive attacks by clarifying the adversary's capacity and thoroughly assessing potential privacy breaches. Additionally, the authors should expand their evaluation to include larger datasets, such as ImageNet, and assess various model architectures beyond ConvNets. It is crucial to clarify the distinction between training and inference stages early in the paper and to motivate the framework's assumptions regarding the Cloud Server's access to the classifier part. Finally, we suggest including results from real-world applications to demonstrate the generalizability of the methodology.
