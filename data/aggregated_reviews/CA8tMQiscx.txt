Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents theoretical results on uncertainty quantification (UQ) for sparse variational Gaussian processes (SVGP) using Brownian motion priors. The authors conclude that with a well-calibrated prior and a sufficient number of inducing variables, the UQ is reliable, albeit potentially conservative. The results extend to other kernels, including squared exponential and Matérn kernels, and are validated through experiments on simulation data. The paper also discusses the relationship between the smoothness of the prior and the true underlying function, contributing to the understanding of frequentist coverage of credible sets.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper addresses a relevant topic in Gaussian processes, particularly in UQ, which is crucial for applications like Bayesian optimization and active learning.  
- The theoretical results are well-articulated and accessible, providing a solid foundation for future work in the field.  
- The experiments are well-chosen and effectively demonstrate the theoretical claims.  

Weaknesses:  
- The paper inconsistently refers to SVGP models while primarily discussing sparse Gaussian process regression (SGPR), which should be clarified.  
- Notational issues exist, particularly in Section 2.1, where definitions and symbols are unclear or inconsistent.  
- A clear takeaway message is lacking, making it difficult for readers to grasp the main contributions.  
- The choice of Brownian motion priors is not well justified, and the results do not extend easily to more commonly used priors like Matérn or squared exponential kernels.  
- The results require pre-specified prior smoothness, which may not be realistic in practice.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by explicitly distinguishing between SVGP and SGPR throughout the paper. Additionally, addressing the notational inconsistencies in Section 2.1 is crucial for reader comprehension. The authors should clearly articulate the main takeaway message to enhance the paper's impact. We suggest including a discussion on the implications of using Brownian motion priors versus other priors, and how the results relate to Burt et al. (2019). Furthermore, we recommend that the authors provide a plot of the true posterior, approximate posterior, and credible set to visually demonstrate their findings. Finally, including standard deviations in the reported metrics and conducting K-fold cross-validation would strengthen the empirical results.
