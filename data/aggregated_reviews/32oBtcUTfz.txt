### Key Points
This paper presents IDEA-DAC, a novel methodology for enabling Integrity-Driven Editing (IDE) in decentralized anonymous credentials (DACs), addressing limitations of the revoke-and-reissue paradigm. The authors propose a system that utilizes R1CS circuits and ZK-SNARKs to facilitate constraint-adhering edits to JSON credential documents while maintaining security and privacy. The method requires a one-time setup for homogeneous JSON credentials and aims to improve the efficiency of credential management.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- Enables precise, integrity-driven editing in DACs.
- Reduces computational redundancy and verification overhead.
- Clear presentation of the IDEA-DAC mechanism and its functionality.

Weaknesses:
- Evaluation lacks comprehensiveness, particularly in comparing performance with existing DAC systems.
- Absence of source code limits transparency and reproducibility.
- The abstract may be difficult for readers without prior knowledge of the field.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the abstract by minimizing technical jargon and avoiding acronyms to enhance accessibility for a broader audience. Additionally, the authors should provide a detailed comparison of IDEA-DAC's performance against traditional revoke-and-reissue systems and other related DAC systems, such as Candid and Coconut. It would also be beneficial to include the source code to facilitate validation and encourage contributions. Furthermore, the authors should clarify the practical feasibility of IDEA-DAC in real-world scenarios, including minimum hardware specifications and the implications of variable JSON document formats on system performance. Lastly, we suggest merging Sections 6 and 7 for better coherence and enlarging Table 1 for improved readability.
