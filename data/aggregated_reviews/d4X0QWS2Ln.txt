Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents PROTORE, a novel framework for concept negation in text-to-image diffusion models, aiming to eliminate specified negative concepts during inference. The authors propose a method that extracts features from negative prompts and refines attention maps using these features, enhancing the model's ability to generate images while avoiding unwanted content. Evaluations indicate that PROTORE outperforms existing methods in terms of purification effectiveness and image quality across various benchmarks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The proposed method is a plug-and-play solution that can be easily integrated into existing systems without additional training.
- Experimental results demonstrate strong performance compared to other methods, maintaining good fidelity and efficiency.
- The approach effectively addresses the challenge of overlapping positive and negative prompts, which is crucial for practical applications.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to follow, particularly the figures, which do not clearly convey the core ideas.
- There is insufficient discussion on the evaluation of generated outputs, particularly regarding successful and unsuccessful cases.
- The method may be limited by the general language understanding of CLIP, potentially affecting its ability to handle complex negations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the paper by providing more detailed discussions and analyses of the figures, especially Figures 1 and 3, to enhance understanding. Additionally, including a baseline comparison with alternative methods for prompt modification, such as using ChatGPT to rewrite prompts, would strengthen the motivation for the proposed approach. The authors should also address the limitations regarding the method's performance in removing large objects and the potential challenges in capturing all relevant textual prompts for negative concepts. Finally, a more comprehensive explanation of the operational aspects of the "Prototype, Retrieve, and Refine" process would enhance the paper's clarity and theoretical grounding.
