Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel method for finetuning a classifier aimed at achieving both out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization and OOD detection. The authors propose a new objective function based on the Bayesian framework and OOD generalization theory, supported by extensive experimental results that indicate the method's effectiveness. The paper also theoretically characterizes the trade-off dilemma between OOD detection and classification, introducing an uncertainty-based strategy that decouples these tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses the significant problem of simultaneous OOD generalization and detection, crucial for the safety of machine learning systems.
- The exposition is clear, and the theoretical analysis effectively explains the failures of existing OOD detection approaches.
- The proposed uncertainty-decoupled strategy is technically solid and validated through comprehensive experiments.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a direct theoretical justification for the main objective function (Eq. (11)), particularly regarding the constraint on entropy changes.
- There is insufficient clarification on whether existing works have considered decoupling OOD detection and generalization.
- The evaluation of OOD generalization relies on simple Gaussian noise, which may not adequately represent performance across diverse OOD scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the theoretical justification for the main objective function, particularly the entropy constraint in Eq. (11). Additionally, please clarify whether there are existing works that have implicitly addressed the decoupling of OOD detection and generalization. We suggest expanding the discussion on potential strategies that could also address the identified dilemma. Furthermore, consider evaluating the robustness of OOD detectors in more complex domain adaptation settings rather than solely using Gaussian noise. Lastly, providing visualizations of data uncertainty and including additional baselines as suggested would enhance the clarity and robustness of the findings.
