Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Shadowcast, a data poisoning attack targeting vision-language models (VLMs) to manipulate their outputs. It introduces two attack types: Label Attack, which misidentifies images, and Persuasion Attack, which generates misleading narratives. The method is effective with as few as 50 poison samples, highlighting significant risks to VLMs and emphasizing the need for data integrity in their deployment.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The topic is interesting and relevant, addressing vulnerabilities in VLMs.
2. The paper is well-organized and easy to understand.
3. The experiments conducted are comprehensive, demonstrating the attack's effectiveness.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty is limited, as the authors apply existing data poisoning techniques to VLMs without significant innovation.
2. The defense mechanisms discussed are inadequate; more robust purification methods should be considered.
3. The experiments are restricted to a single VLM model and dataset, limiting generalizability.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the novelty of their work by exploring more innovative techniques for crafting poisoned samples. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with baseline methods to assess the robustness of their approach. Expanding the experimental scope to include diverse models, datasets, and attack tasks would enhance the generalizability of the findings. Furthermore, we suggest that the authors clarify the necessity of the paraphrasing step in their attack and provide empirical evidence regarding its impact on performance. Lastly, a more thorough discussion on potential defense strategies against their attack would strengthen the paper.
