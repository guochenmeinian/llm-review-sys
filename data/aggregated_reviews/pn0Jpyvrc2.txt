Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents the "AllClear" dataset, the largest public dataset specifically designed for cloud removal in satellite imagery, featuring nearly 24,000 regions of interest (ROIs) and 4 million images from various sensors, including Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9. The dataset aims to enhance cloud removal techniques by providing a diverse training set with comprehensive metadata, addressing significant gaps in existing literature regarding sensor variety and geographic representation. The authors demonstrate that the dataset's size substantially improves performance in cloud removal tasks.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The "AllClear" dataset is large-scale and diverse, integrating data from multiple sensors and covering various land-use patterns, which is crucial for cloud removal.
- Comprehensive metadata enhances the dataset's utility for advanced analysis and stratified evaluations.
- The authors have defined a well-structured benchmarking task and provided experimental evaluations that demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art models.

Weaknesses:
- The paper lacks a detailed discussion on the real-world impact and practical applications of the dataset, which could enhance its relevance to various industries.
- The complexity of data preprocessing, including cloud and shadow mask computation, may pose challenges for researchers with limited computational resources.
- The dataset is compiled rather than collected, raising questions about its novelty and the potential for algorithmic biases in cloud labeling.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on the dataset's real-world applications and potential benefits to various industries. Additionally, addressing the limitations of the dataset, including the reliance on existing cloud masks and the computational burden for users, would enhance its value. We suggest including a section that contextualizes the dataset's advantages and disadvantages within existing work. Furthermore, providing preprocessed data or simplified access methods could improve accessibility for researchers with limited resources. Lastly, we encourage the authors to explore the potential for algorithmically extending the dataset to include new ROIs or years, as well as to clarify the training protocols and computational resources used in their experiments.
