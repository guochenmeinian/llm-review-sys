Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Satformer, a novel method for traffic data estimation in satellite networks, which addresses unique challenges such as dynamic node shifts, varying transmission delays, and data sparsity. The authors argue that existing literature primarily focuses on terrestrial networks, leaving a gap in research for satellite networks. Satformer utilizes an adaptive sparse spatio-temporal attention mechanism to capture nonlinear relationships and enhance model efficiency. The method incorporates a graph convolutional network for non-Euclidean data processing and a transfer module for global context dissemination. The authors assess Satformer on various satellite network datasets, demonstrating its superior performance compared to existing mathematical and neural baseline methods. The evaluation metrics used, primarily NMAE and NRMSE, are justified as suitable for the context of satellite data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The paper is well-structured, with clear writing and organization, effectively detailing the Satformer architecture and its components.
2. The integration of the adaptive sparse spatio-temporal attention mechanism enhances the model's sensitivity to data patterns and improves prediction accuracy while reducing computational complexity.
3. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate the proposed method's performance against several baseline methods.
4. The authors provide a thorough mathematical foundation and stability proofs for their approach, demonstrating the effectiveness of Satformer.

Weaknesses:
1. The novelty of the proposed method is limited, as the attention mechanism is not new in spatio-temporal forecasting, and adaptive learning of spatiotemporal correlations has been explored in other fields.
2. The motivation for focusing on satellite network traffic data compared to other spatio-temporal data types is unclear and may not be clearly articulated.
3. Important baseline methods, such as GraphWavenet, AGCRN, and GMAN, are missing from the comparisons, potentially limiting the perceived robustness of the findings.
4. The evaluation metrics used (NMAE and NRMSE) are insufficient; metrics like MSE, MAE, and MAPE should also be included.
5. The reliance on simulated datasets raises concerns about the generalizability of the results to real-world scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the motivation for their work by explicitly detailing the unique characteristics of satellite network traffic data compared to other types of spatio-temporal data. Additionally, we suggest enhancing the novelty discussion by providing a more explicit comparison of Satformer with existing methods, emphasizing its unique contributions. We also encourage the inclusion of a broader range of evaluation metrics, such as MSE, MAE, and MAPE, to provide a more comprehensive performance assessment. Furthermore, we advise the authors to include comparisons with more baseline methods, such as GraphWavenet, AGCRN, and GMAN, to strengthen their claims. To address concerns regarding the use of simulated datasets, we encourage the authors to discuss potential future work involving real-world data collection and validation of their method. Finally, we suggest including a figure that describes the transfer module to enhance clarity.
