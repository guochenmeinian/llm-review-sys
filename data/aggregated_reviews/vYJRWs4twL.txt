### Key Points
This paper presents an improved approach to identify latent user knowledge states and predict user responses to knowledge testing questions, enhancing identifiability and explainability compared to existing benchmarks. The authors propose a response-proficiency-response paradigm and introduce the Identifiable Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (ID-CDF), which utilizes inductive diagnostic modules to achieve identifiable and explainable results. The experimental results on four publicly available datasets indicate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The problem of personalized learner modeling is interesting and has significant applications in online learning platforms.
2. The authors conducted extensive experiments, yielding promising results.
3. The paper is well-organized, clearly presented, and features meticulously drawn figures.
4. The proposed method is practical and the code is open-source, facilitating analysis and reproduction.

Weaknesses:
1. The application area is very specific to user knowledge states modeling in education.
2. The paper lacks specific details regarding the investigation mentioned, which weakens the foundation of certain discussions.
3. The summary of the first contribution is misleading, as it does not adequately acknowledge previous work on non-identifiability and explainability overfitting.
4. While the ID-CDM excels in identifiability and explainability, it does not evaluate recommendation performance, raising questions about the direct impact on recommendation accuracy.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the investigation details to strengthen the discussion. Additionally, we suggest revising the summary of the first contribution to accurately reflect the existing literature on non-identifiability and explainability. Furthermore, we encourage the authors to include a comparison of the runtime of each method to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach. Lastly, we recommend providing a table for accuracy comparison results and addressing the impact of additional components on prediction accuracy.
