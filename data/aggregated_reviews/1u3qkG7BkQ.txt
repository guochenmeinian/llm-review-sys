Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel framework for traffic trajectory generation called InteractTraj, which utilizes natural language descriptions to produce interactive traffic trajectories. The framework comprises a language-to-code encoder and a code-to-trajectory decoder, enabling the generation of realistic vehicle interactions based on abstract descriptions. The authors conducted extensive experiments on two datasets, demonstrating that InteractTraj outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating interactive traffic scenarios.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
1. The use of language descriptions as conditional information for trajectory generation is an innovative approach.
2. The paper is well-structured and clearly articulated, making it accessible to researchers.
3. The framework shows promising results through rigorous experimental validation, including ablation and user studies.

Weaknesses:
1. The proposed framework appears computationally expensive, and details on model efficiency are lacking.
2. There is no comparison of the language description encoder with other large language models, such as GPT-4.
3. The system's robustness to ambiguous or complex language descriptions has not been thoroughly evaluated, which is crucial for practical applications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the comparison with baseline methods, specifically CTG and CTG++, to validate the effectiveness of their approach. Additionally, the authors should evaluate the diversity and scalability of the generated trajectories and address the collisions observed in some visualizations. Clarifying how the model handles different lengths of generated trajectories and ambiguous language descriptions would enhance the robustness of the framework. Finally, expanding the model to include a broader range of traffic participants and improving map generation capabilities would significantly enhance its applicability.
