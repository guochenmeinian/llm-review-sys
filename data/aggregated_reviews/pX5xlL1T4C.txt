Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents Renku, an open-source platform designed to enhance reproducibility, collaboration, and sustainability in data science. It addresses barriers to reproducibility and data sharing through systematic metadata management, version control, and workflow documentation. Renku includes a web-based application (RenkuLab) and a command-line tool (Renku Client), promoting interoperability between datasets and code. The platform is utilized by approximately 8000 users and aims to fill gaps in the data science infrastructure landscape. The authors acknowledge limitations in the platform's current focus on the data science community, which may not fully meet the needs of machine-learning researchers, and they plan to enhance the platform with additional features and integrations. The paper also discusses potential negative societal impacts, including centralization, abuse, data leakage, and excessive resource use.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
**Strengths:**  
- The paper is well-structured, articulating the motivation and design of the platform clearly.  
- It effectively connects its vision to the FAIR principles and data stewardship considerations.  
- The authors are responsive to reviewer feedback, actively working on improvements, and have a clear vision for future enhancements and community engagement.  
- Renku's design leverages state-of-the-art technologies, offering a unique approach to dataset tracking and reproducibility in data science.  
- Improvements in clarity and depth, including clearer figures and enhanced comparisons with other systems, are commendable.

**Weaknesses:**  
- The paper lacks explicit discussion on data security and privacy, particularly regarding sensitive data management and project visibility.  
- There are formatting issues, including exceeding the page limit and unclear figures that hinder understanding.  
- Some examples and use cases are not easily accessible, and the paper does not sufficiently address dataset citation and licensing practices.  
- The discussion on sensitive data access and potential negative societal impacts is not fully addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion on data security and privacy by explicitly detailing how users can manage sensitive data and control project visibility. Additionally, we suggest including a table to summarize key features of Renku compared to other platforms, such as OpenML and Kaggle, to enhance clarity in the comparison section. The authors should also consider revising figures for better readability and ensuring that all use cases are accessible. Furthermore, we recommend adding a dedicated section on sensitive data access on the platform website and specifying which sections of the Supplementary Materials are relevant when referenced in the main paper. Finally, addressing the potential negative societal impacts of the platform in greater detail and incorporating more recent references to strengthen the literature review would enhance the paper's completeness.
