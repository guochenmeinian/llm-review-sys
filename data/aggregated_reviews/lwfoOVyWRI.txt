### Key Points
This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the NFT ecosystem, utilizing a large dataset of NFT trades and transfers sourced from the Ethereum ledger and five major NFT marketplaces. The authors investigate two types of selfish behavior: wash trading, which artificially inflates desirability through repeated trades, and arbitrage, exploiting pricing inconsistencies for profit. The study finds that these behaviors constitute 23% of market activity, with wash trading patterns extending beyond previous research. However, the paper raises questions about the fundamental differences between NFT trading and cryptocurrency trading, and the relevance of its findings is sometimes unclear.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper provides a longitudinal overview of the NFT ecosystem and empirical measurements that yield valuable insights.
- The dataset is robust, directly sourced from the blockchain, enhancing its completeness.
- The findings are generally sound and the paper is easy to follow.

Weaknesses:
- The impact and relevance of the longitudinal measurements are often unclear, rendering that section superficial.
- The methodology for detecting wash trading lacks validation and key details are relegated to the appendix.
- Some findings, such as the centralization of NFT holders, lack novelty and depth in their implications.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity and relevance of the longitudinal ecosystem measurements, ensuring that their implications are well-explained. Integrating Appendix A into the main paper is essential for enhancing methodological transparency. Section 5 requires more detail, particularly regarding the methodology for pattern identification and clustering. We suggest validating the wash trading detection methodology by sampling and manually annotating users near the threshold. Additionally, we recommend integrating Appendix C into the main body to justify the usefulness of the work. Finally, addressing minor points regarding clarity and consistency in figures and terminology will enhance the overall quality of the paper.
