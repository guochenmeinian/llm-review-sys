Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel data reconstruction attack (DRA) on split inference (SI) called GLASS and its enhanced version GLASS++. The authors propose using StyleGAN as prior knowledge to generate images based on intermediate activations from a trained network on the user's device. The effectiveness of GLASS is demonstrated through evaluations against multiple defense methods, showing superior robustness and image quality compared to previous DRA approaches.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper introduces a novel DRA attack utilizing GANs, marking a significant advancement in the field.
- The approach of leveraging StyleGAN for DRAs is innovative and well-executed.
- The evaluation against seven defense mechanisms highlights the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

Weaknesses:
- The paper is difficult to follow, particularly in clarifying terms like “perturbation” and the specifics of the “Z space search.”
- The fairness of hyperparameter settings across different attacks is questionable; varying learning rates and step counts would yield a more equitable comparison.
- The reliance on supplementary material for key experimental results makes the main text hard to comprehend.
- The assumption that the attacker has access to a dataset similar to the private data is overly restrictive, and the impact of distribution shifts is inadequately addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve clarity by defining key terms such as “perturbation” and elaborating on the “amplitude of positive perturbation.” Additionally, we suggest that the authors consider varying hyperparameters for different attacks to ensure a fair comparison. It would be beneficial to integrate more experimental results into the main text to enhance readability. Furthermore, addressing the limitations regarding dataset distribution shifts and discussing potential countermeasures against the proposed attacks would strengthen the paper's contributions. Lastly, a more explicit discussion of the ethical implications of their work is warranted.
