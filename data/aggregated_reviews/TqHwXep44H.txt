### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to integrating language identity information into end-to-end Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems through a language identity-language model (LID-LM). The authors propose inserting a language identity token at the beginning of each text token and introduce a LID state fusion mechanism to enhance the fusion of LID and text representations. The method aims to improve ASR performance, particularly in code-switching scenarios involving English and Chinese languages.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
The authors introduce a unique method for language identification using text data, demonstrating that their LID-LM model outperforms previous approaches that rely on acoustic features. The integration of language identity information is shown to enhance ASR system performance, particularly in reducing language confusion during code-switching.

Weaknesses:  
The proposed model is computationally expensive, as inserting LID tokens doubles the input length without providing significant richness. The performance improvement is marginal, with only a 1.3% maximum reduction in word error rate, primarily attributed to the use of a transformer model rather than the proposed method. Additionally, the reliance on a single dataset raises concerns about generalizability, and the lack of inter-annotator agreement metrics undermines the reliability of manual annotations.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the computational efficiency of the language identity-language model by addressing the redundancy introduced by LID tokens. Additionally, we suggest that the authors conduct comparisons with more recent and robust works to validate the effectiveness of their approach. Expanding evaluations to include diverse datasets and language pairs, such as the Spanish-English Code-Switching Corpus (SECS), would strengthen their findings. Finally, we urge the authors to report inter-annotator agreement metrics to enhance the transparency and rigor of their manual annotation process.
