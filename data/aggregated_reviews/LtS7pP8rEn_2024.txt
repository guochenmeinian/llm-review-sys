Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a framework for estimating hand pressure during various hand-object interactions using multimodal data, specifically integrating 3D hand poses and sEMG signals. The authors propose a dataset that includes pressure data from 20 participants engaged in 22 distinct interaction types. Empirical results demonstrate that the combination of these modalities enhances estimation accuracy compared to using them independently. The method shows promise in complex interaction scenarios, although the evaluation primarily focuses on within-participant comparisons. Additionally, the paper evaluates PressureVision++, highlighting its strengths in detecting contact and the presence of force while identifying challenges in accurately estimating force magnitude. The authors propose that PressureVision++ excels in classification tasks, achieving high Contact Accuracy (89.3%) and Contact IoU (41.9%), but struggles with regression tasks, as indicated by a Volumetric IoU of only 27.5%. They note that while PressureVision++ shows comparable accuracy to the Force-aware Interface, it has lower R-square (40.30%) and NRMSE (32.95%) values, suggesting a disadvantage in estimating precise force magnitude. To enhance transparency, the authors plan to publicly release all data and code related to their quantitative assessments.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The dataset is extensive, comprising 83.2 million frames from diverse hand-object interactions, which is a significant contribution to the field.  
- The integration of different modalities is innovative, and the framework is well-defined and contextualized.  
- Empirical results indicate that the proposed method achieves high accuracy in estimating hand pressure.  
- High performance in detecting contact and presence of force in PressureVision++.  
- Clear presentation of quantitative performance metrics.  
- Commitment to transparency through public data and code release.

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation is limited to within-participant comparisons, which may not generalize well due to variability in sEMG readings across individuals.  
- The framework lacks novelty in multimodal fusion, as it does not fully exploit fine-grained spatial information from hand poses.  
- Comparisons with existing methods, particularly PressureVision++, are insufficiently rigorous, lacking quantitative assessments in scenarios where fingertips are unoccluded.  
- The paper does not adequately address the influence of muscle fatigue on sEMG signal quality, nor does it provide a comprehensive evaluation of cross-participant performance.  
- Challenges in accurately estimating force magnitude in PressureVision++, with lower performance in regression tasks compared to classification tasks.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation by including a drop-one-subject analysis to demonstrate cross-subject applicability. Additionally, a more detailed comparison with PressureVision++ in various scenarios, including those with unoccluded fingertips, would enhance the robustness of the findings. The authors should also consider providing absolute error metrics alongside relative errors and include temporal information in the results, such as curves showing predicted force changes over time. Furthermore, addressing the influence of muscle fatigue on EMG data quality and exploring alternative multimodal fusion methods could strengthen the framework's novelty and applicability. Lastly, enhancing the estimation of force magnitude in PressureVision++ to improve its regression task performance, along with providing further empirical motivation and clarifications in the revised manuscript, could strengthen the overall argument for the effectiveness of the proposed method.
