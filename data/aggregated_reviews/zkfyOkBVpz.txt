Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents an investigation into the development of visual intelligence through a curriculum for self-supervised video representation learning, utilizing egocentric video data from infants. The curriculum is structured according to the age order of the infants, and experimental results indicate that training with data from younger infants, who exhibit fewer motor abilities, leads to a more rapid decrease in training and validation loss. The proposed curriculum also enhances performance on downstream tasks when assessed via linear probing.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The innovative use of curriculum learning in video self-supervised learning to explore infant visual experience is noteworthy.
- The alignment of the curriculum with the developmental age of infants based on recorded egocentric videos is commendable.
- The paper includes a thorough discussion of its contributions and limitations.

Weaknesses:
- There is a lack of quantitative measurement regarding the "slowness" of the video, and experiments aligning curriculum with video slowness rather than age order are missing.
- The iteration number of 5000 may be insufficient for models trained on more dynamic videos to converge; further increasing this number and comparing with Random and Adult baselines would enhance the analysis.
- Reporting video retrieval performance after pre-training with different curricula is recommended for a more comprehensive evaluation.
- Exploring contrastive learning-based self-supervised methods alongside masked image modeling would broaden the study's scope.
- Minor issues include a missing section reference number in line 212.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the quantitative assessment of video "slowness" and conduct corresponding experiments. Additionally, increasing the iteration number beyond 5000 and including comparisons with Random and Adult baselines would provide a more robust analysis. Reporting video retrieval performance after pre-training with various curricula is essential for a comprehensive evaluation. Furthermore, exploring contrastive learning-based self-supervised learning methods would enhance the study's breadth. Lastly, addressing minor issues such as the missing section reference number in line 212 would improve clarity.
