### Key Points
This paper presents a causal mediation analysis framework to investigate how Transformer-based language models (LMs) process arithmetic tasks. The authors propose that they have identified the mechanisms by which LMs perform arithmetic reasoning by intervening on specific model components and measuring changes in predicted probabilities. The study aims to connect mechanistic interpretability with the mathematical reasoning capabilities of LMs.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The paper is well-written, clear, and concise, providing empirical evidence through extensive evaluations across different LM scales.  
- It offers interesting insights into the information flow related to arithmetic reasoning in LMs, effectively tracing key components such as attention mechanisms and MLP modules.  
- The application of causal mediation analysis is a novel approach that enhances understanding of LMs' mathematical capabilities.

Weaknesses:  
- The scope is limited to a narrow set of arithmetic operations, raising concerns about the generalizability of the findings.  
- The claims regarding the discovery of reasoning mechanisms may be overly ambitious, as it is unclear whether LMs possess reasoning abilities akin to human reasoning.  
- The paper lacks tangible methods for improving LMs based on the insights gained, which creates a gap between understanding and application.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of their claims regarding the reasoning mechanisms of LMs, ensuring they do not implicitly equate LM behavior with human-like reasoning. Additionally, the authors should expand the scope of their analysis beyond arithmetic to enhance applicability. To strengthen their findings, we suggest including an a priori description of expected patterns and explicitly discussing alternative hypotheses that could explain their results. This would ground their conclusions and provide a more robust framework for understanding the implications of their research.
