### Key Points
This paper presents CONCOCT (Concrete Outline Control) to enhance the pacing of story outlines by employing a "concreteness evaluator" trained on the BookSum dataset. The evaluator identifies vague nodes in a hierarchical tree outline and prompts ChatGPT to generate more detailed sub-texts. The authors claim that CONCOCT significantly improves pacing consistency in long-form story generation using Large Language Models (LLMs).

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The problem addressed is relevant, and the proposed CONCOCT system effectively targets inconsistent pacing in story generation.  
- The writing is clear, providing sufficient details for understanding and reproducing experimental results.  
- The contribution is well-defined, particularly the concept of "concreteness."  

Weaknesses:  
- The evaluation metrics are limited, focusing solely on pacing without assessing other story qualities like coherence and reader preference.  
- The experimental design appears biased, lacking a comprehensive comparison with baseline methods.  
- The authors do not generate complete stories from the outlines, raising questions about the study's completeness.  
- The dependence on LLM performance is a concern for reproducibility, which should be more explicitly addressed.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the evaluation metrics to include assessments of coherence and reader preference, ensuring a more holistic view of story quality. Additionally, we suggest generating complete stories from the CONCOCT outlines to validate the pacing improvements claimed. Clarifying the design of the concreteness scheduler, including the rationale behind the final schedule and comparisons to naive approaches, would enhance the paper's rigor. Finally, we encourage a discussion on releasing the CONCOCT source code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.
