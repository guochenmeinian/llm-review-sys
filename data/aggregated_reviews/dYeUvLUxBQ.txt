Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a novel approach to causal discovery in semi-stationary time series data, where causal mechanisms change periodically. The authors propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm called PCMCIâ„¦, which extends the PCMCI algorithm designed for stationary data. The algorithm identifies a superset of parents and minimizes parent set size to determine the correct periodicity of variables. The authors provide theoretical guarantees for the algorithm's soundness, although skepticism remains regarding the use of PCMCI for estimating $\hat{SPa}(X_{t}^{j})$ in finite samples, particularly since PCMCI is designed for stationary processes. The authors acknowledge challenges in obtaining stronger theoretical results and emphasize the novelty of their method, but its applicability to real-world periodic random processes remains uncertain without experiments on actual data. The algorithm's independence from turning points is a significant improvement, and the potential integration of consistent CI tests into the algorithm is well-articulated. The authors validate their approach through experiments on synthetic and real-world data.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a significant problem in causal discovery, particularly in scenarios where stationarity is a poor assumption.
- The theoretical framework is rigorous, and the algorithm is described in sufficient detail, enhancing reproducibility.
- The algorithm's independence from turning points is a notable improvement.
- The authors have addressed previous concerns through additional experiments and discussions.
- The potential integration of consistent CI tests into the algorithm is well-articulated.

Weaknesses:
- The proposed algorithm appears to be an incremental improvement over PCMCI, lacking originality.
- Skepticism exists regarding the use of PCMCI for semi-stationary processes, raising questions about the theoretical foundations.
- Numerical experiments do not adequately compare the algorithm with methods specifically designed for semi-stationary data.
- Results from real-world data are unconvincing due to the absence of ground truth and domain expert validation.
- The lack of literature on semi-stationary processes makes the generalizability of the method unclear.
- Computational complexity is not discussed, and the paper's organization hinders clarity.
- Numerous typographical errors detract from the overall presentation.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the originality of the algorithm by clearly articulating its unique contributions beyond the PCMCI framework. Additionally, the authors should include comparisons with algorithms specifically designed for semi-stationary time series data to strengthen the experimental validation. It is crucial to provide a discussion on the theoretical guarantees for the use of PCMCI in semi-stationary contexts and to conduct experiments on real data with known ground truth to enhance the credibility of the method. Clarifying the presentation of definitions and ensuring consistency in CI tests will contribute to a clearer understanding of the algorithm's applicability. Furthermore, addressing the numerous typographical errors will improve the overall readability, and including a limitations section that discusses potential shortcomings and assumptions of the method, particularly regarding instantaneous effects and the implications of sampling frequency on causal reconstruction, would be beneficial.
