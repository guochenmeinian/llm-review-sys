### Key Points
This paper presents simulations and experiments on state-of-the-art quantum computers utilizing up to 100 qubits. The authors propose that machine learning for quantum error mitigation (ML-QEM) can significantly reduce overheads, maintain or exceed the accuracy of conventional methods, and produce near noise-free results for quantum algorithms. These findings could have a profound impact on the scientific community.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:  
- The use of both simulations and experiments enhances the credibility of the findings.  
- Demonstrates significant improvements in error mitigation through ML-QEM, potentially advancing quantum computing applications.  

Weaknesses:  
- The review does not mention any limitations or challenges faced during the experiments, which could provide a more balanced perspective.  

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the discussion of any limitations or challenges encountered during the experiments to provide a more comprehensive view of the research.
