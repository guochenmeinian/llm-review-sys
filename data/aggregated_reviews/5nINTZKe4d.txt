### Key Points
This paper presents an empirical study on domain name collisions in blockchain naming services (BNS), specifically analyzing data from Handshake and Decentraweb. The authors reveal significant findings regarding the characteristics of collided top-level domain (TLD) names, resource records, and owner address distributions. The study highlights the increasing relevance of domain name collisions, particularly as the popularity of BNSs grows and additional generic TLDs are assigned by ICANN.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The paper addresses a timely and important issue regarding name collisions in BNS, contributing to the understanding of this underexplored topic.
- It provides a large-scale analysis, examining over 11 million registrations and identifying around 7,000 BNS TLD name collisions.
- The paper is well-structured and presents detailed background information.

Weaknesses:
- The methods used to derive insights are overly simplistic, lacking depth and complexity.
- The selection of Handshake and Decentraweb as case studies requires justification, as their representativeness is unclear.
- The paper does not adequately explore the implications of its findings on Internet governance and domain management.
- Some sections are unclear or poorly defined, leading to potential misunderstandings, particularly regarding technical terms and concepts.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the depth of their analysis by employing more sophisticated methods rather than relying on basic data processes. Justifying the choice of BNS platforms is essential for clarity, and the authors should elaborate on the completeness of their data collection process. Additionally, we suggest that the authors explore the potential impacts of their findings on domain management in greater detail, possibly including real-world case studies. Clarifying the ethical considerations surrounding responsible disclosure of identified collisions is also necessary. Lastly, we encourage the authors to refine unclear sections and ensure that all technical terms are well-defined for reader comprehension.
