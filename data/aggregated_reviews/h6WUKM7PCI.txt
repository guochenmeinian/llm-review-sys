Aggregated Review:
### Key Points
This paper presents a contrastive learning method for obtaining representations of extracellular recordings, applicable to spike sorting and cell type classification. The authors utilize a transformer-based encoder to generate low-dimensional representations of spike waveforms, which are compared using a contrastive loss. Evaluation on simulated and real datasets demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms PCA embeddings for spike sorting and WaveMap for zero-shot cell type classification.

### Strengths and Weaknesses
Strengths:
- The application of modern machine learning techniques (contrastive learning and transformers) to the classical problem of spike sorting is commendable.
- The paper is well-written and presents clear motivations and methodologies.
- The proposed method shows superior performance compared to traditional PCA and WaveMap.

Weaknesses:
- Notation in Section 3 is confusing, particularly regarding indices and superindices, which could be simplified for clarity.
- The experimental evaluation lacks extensive benchmarking against a broader range of spike sorting methods, limiting the understanding of how CEED compares to state-of-the-art techniques.
- The paper does not include ablation studies to assess the effectiveness of various augmentations or architectural choices.
- The computational complexity of the proposed method is high, which may reduce its practical relevance.

### Suggestions for Improvement
We recommend that the authors improve the clarity of the notation in Section 3 to enhance understanding. Additionally, we suggest conducting more extensive benchmarking against a wider array of spike sorting methods to provide a clearer picture of CEED's performance relative to state-of-the-art techniques. Including ablation experiments would also be beneficial to evaluate the impact of different augmentations and architectural choices. Finally, we urge the authors to provide a detailed analysis of the computational complexity and training requirements of their method, comparing it to existing literature.
